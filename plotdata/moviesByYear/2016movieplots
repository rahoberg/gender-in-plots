Tim who lives with his father (played by David Boutin) after his mother's early death, cannot confide in his own father despite the latter's efforts to get to the bottom of what is ailing his son.  Tim's situation becomes even more precarious in his grade 11 year, because of his continuing friendship with classmate Francis (played by Robert Naylor), a gay youth and Tim's own sexuality issues and his increasing infatuation with Francis, although Tim is reluctant of going public about it. Tim is reluctant to go to the school authorities as he is "no snitch", but finds solace in the friendship of Jennifer (played by Sophie Nélisse), a schoolmate who takes Tim's case to heart.<ref>[http://www.journaldequebec.com/2016/09/22/le-1-54-de-yan-england ''Journal de Québec'': Le 1 :54 de Yan England] </ref>  After a dramatic outing of Francis, and Tim's erratic behavior distancing himself at least publicly from him for the fear of being exposed himself, Francis commits suicide despite Tim's pleas.

As Tim catches up with Jeff's coveted time of 1:54 in running, Jeff first blackmails Tim with publishing  the footage on social media in case Tim goes on with his scheme of stealing Jeff's position in qualifying. During the final run, a desperate and vindictive Jeff first intimidates Tim and then in a desperate move seeing Tim's insistence in winning the race, instructs his friend to publish the footage online. Tim confronted with his painful outing and public shaming, finds support from his father towards his son's sexuality and outing. The father also who pleads with the school board to stop Jeff and arranges for his son finishing his school year through home schooling with help from his school and teachers. But it is too late, as Tim has already prepared a make shift bomb to blast Jeff's celebration party after the latter's victory and qualification to the Nationals. He has also released a video footage on his own online page explaining why he is engaging in this final act. Tim had developed his skill of bomb-making through chemical experiments he had conducted in preparation with a joint lab project earlier with his now-deceased friend Francis. In his last moment of remorse of possibly causing great havoc and mayhem, he tries to remove the bomb he has placed, but dies himself as the bomb explodes in his hands. The last scene shows the reactions of many who knew Tim and could do nothing, with the friend of Jeff - and not Jeff himself - in a remorseful mood trying to justifying or self-excuse himself by saying that his actions were meant as "just a joke".  
The 5th Wave (film)
  Ohio high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a [[Christian cross]] and the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].  A city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as "The Others". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate the planet's geology and fault lines, causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of [[Avian influenza|avian flu virus]], with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassie's mother is one of the casualties.  Cassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a refugee camp in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the army massacring all the adults, her father included.  Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.  At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.  Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base.  Ben's squad is reunited and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.  
The 9th Life of Louis Drax
  Louis Drax (Longworth), a 9-year-old boy, narrates that throughout his short life he has survived a series of near-fatal accidents, and the most recent one involves a suspicious fall off a cliff during a picnic with his parents, the cause of which he does not explain. Through a series of flashbacks, Louis's sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Perez (Platt) are shown. Perez asks Louis about his opinions and past, learning that Louis exhibits certain peculiar behaviors, such as a distrust of men and repeated killings of his pet hamsters, an act Louis justifies by calling it "The Right of Disposal." Perez is suspicious of Louis's relationship with his father, Peter (Paul). Additional flashbacks reveal a strained relationship between Peter and Louis's mother, Natalie (Gadon), including an incident where Peter and Louis run into Peter's ex-wife during a trip to [[SeaWorld]], resulting in a fight between Peter and Natalie. Despite Dr. Perez promising that everything Louis told him would be confidential, he tells Natalie about his concerns, causing her to end the sessions as she believes Perez is interfering with her marriage.  In the present, a doctor examining Louis after his latest accident pronounces him dead. After Louis is transported to the morgue, however, he suddenly awakes, and is placed in intensive care in a coma. Meanwhile, Peter, who has disappeared, is immediately the primary suspect in the possible attempted murder of Louis. Louis's case attracts the attention of Dr. Allan Pascal (Dornan), who is fascinated by Louis's sudden turnaround and becomes the lead doctor in charge of Louis's care. Despite Allan being married, he and Natalie share a mutual attraction, and he kisses her one-day while the two go on a walk, which is seen by everyone. As soon as this happens, Louis briefly awakens from his coma, only to mutter 'my dad' before falling back unconscious.  Natalie and Allan receive threatening letters telling them to stay away from each other, with the author of said letters claiming to be Louis himself. Dalton (Parker), the lead investigator on Louis's case, believes the letters to be written by Peter. To help find the writer, everyone in the hospital submits to a handwriting test. For Natalie's protection, she is given a room in the hospital to stay in until Peter is found. Dalton warns Allan not to become involved with Natalie, telling him that not only is Peter not Louis's real father, but at one point Natalie attempted to give Louis up for adoption. Natalie confesses to Allan that Louis was the result of a rape from a different man, and despite Dalton's warnings, she and Allan have sex.  Louis is visited in the hospital by his grandmother, Peter's mother Violet (Hershey). Violet, who notices Allan and Natalie's relationship, warns Allan that Natalie is unstable and manipulative, implying she has lied about multiple things including her rape. Dalton suddenly enters, informing Violet and Allan that Peter's body has been found at the bottom of a cliff, having been dead for several days.  While all of the above is happening, Louis continues to narrate, seemingly aware of everything going on despite being in a coma. At certain points he is visited by a mysterious, deformed creature covered in seaweed, who gives him advice and encouragement. Allan also sees this creature at one point in a dream he has while sleeping by Louis's side. Louis visits the creature in a cave, and it is ultimately revealed that it is Louis's manifestation of Peter, who was found dead in a cave covered in seaweed. The Peter creature is very kind to and protective of Louis, and Louis doesn't want to leave him.  One day, while waking up from a nap, Allan is told by another doctor that not only did he sleepwalk during his nap, but he also wrote a prescription for Natalie, for dangerous doses of [[insulin]] and [[chloroform]]. This, combined with Allan's other dreams and the suspicious letters, leads Allan to believe that while he sleeps, Louis has somehow been controlling him and his actions. This is further supported when it is discovered that Allan's handwriting matches that of the threatening letters. Allan informs Dr. Perez, who decides to work with Allan to get to the bottom of the situation. He hooks Allan up to an [[EKG]] and through meditative exercises manages to directly communicate with Louis via Allan's mind and voice.  Louis reveals what happened during the picnic: Natalie tries to give Louis some candy but refuses to allow Peter to have any, making Peter suspicious about Natalie possibly harming Louis and leading to a fight. Louis flees to the cliff edge, while Natalie and Peter follow and get into a scuffle, which ends when Natalie pushes Peter off the cliff to his death. Louis sees this and despite Natalie's pleas, walks off the edge of the cliff on his own in an apparent suicide attempt.  At this point, Louis's heartbeat suddenly stops and Allan wakes up. While Allan tries to revive him with a [[defibrillator]], it is shown that Natalie is responsible for Louis's 'accidents', having done things such as poison his candy, electrocute him while near a socket, and smother him with a pillow. Allan succeeds in restarting Louis's heart while Natalie looks on.  Some time later, Allan moves out after separating from his wife. He visits Natalie, who has been placed in a psychiatric ward under Dr. Perez's care. Perez explains to Allan that he has diagnosed Natalie with [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], and her multiple abuses of Louis were her attempts to grow closer to him by 'saving' him from near-death situations, which she herself put him in. It is shown that Natalie is now pregnant, presumably with Allan's child.  In a final narration, Louis ponders the fact that his mother was 'the bad one' and whether being in a coma forever is bad, as it allows him to stay with his father. Peter's voice, however, tells Louis that the world is beautiful and he needs to grow up and live his life. Louis finally awakens from his coma, and the film ends.

   After breaking up with her boyfriend Ben, Michelle drives away from [[New Orleans]]. While in rural [[Louisiana]], she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before she is sideswiped by a truck and knocked off the road, falling unconscious.  Michelle wakes in a locked room within an underground bunker, her wounds tended to. Howard, the bunker's owner, tells her he brought her there for her protection, claiming that the air outside has been poisoned by nuclear or chemical [[fallout]] from an unknown force. Michelle is initially hostile towards Howard, but once she has calmed down, Howard takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker, and meets Emmett, another survivor who found his way to it. Howard takes her to the viewport of the bunker's exit hatch, showing her two dead pigs outside as evidence of the fallout; Michelle also sees Howard's truck, and recognizes it from the accident. Michelle privately relays her concerns about Howard's motivations to Emmett.  During their first dinner together, Michelle secretly takes Howard's keys and makes her way to the hatch, but as she is about to open it, a woman, Leslie, covered in skin lesions, slams against the window demanding she be let in, then collapses. Michelle openly returns the keys and agrees that Howard was right. Howard admits to accidentally hitting her car in his panic to get to the shelter.  While the trio's relationship becomes more relaxed, Howard still shows intolerance towards Emmett and treats Michelle as a little girl; however, Howard opens up about his daughter who he states is "not with us anymore". Howard enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents; while repairing it, she finds a locked skylight, with the word "HELP" scratched into its glass and visible to anyone outside. Further suspicious of Howard, Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her to the bunker. They make plans to escape the bunker, creating a makeshift [[Hazmat suit]] behind Howard's back. When Howard discovers tools and parts missing, he accuses the two of stealing them, threatening to immerse them in a barrel of [[perchloric acid]]. When Emmett takes sole responsibility, Howard coldly kills Emmett with a gun. In shock, Michelle is desperately making final preparations to leave, when she is surprised by Howard. She manages to escape from him with the suit. En route, she knocks over the acid barrel, burning Howard and starting an electrical fire in the bunker.  Michelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howard's homestead. Seeing signs of living wildlife, she takes off the suit's helmet, but then she suddenly sees a giant [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker fire. A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle, forcing her to hide in a shed. She then races towards the farmhouse, but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her, but she is able to craft a [[Molotov cocktail]] from items in Howard's truck to throw into the ship. The fireball causes the appendage to drop her, and she is able to take the dead woman's car and escape.  As she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to [[Baton Rouge]] to evacuate, but also requesting the help of any able-bodied person in [[Houston]]. At a crossroads, she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston. In the distance, a larger alien craft can be seen in the sky.

William ([[Billy Crudup]]), another tenant, is a carpenter and mechanic, who lived on a hippie commune.

Dorothea, concerned that she cannot connect with her son, asks Julie and Abbie to help raise him. When Jamie learns about his mother's plan, he runs away to Los Angeles with his friends to attend a rock concert. When Jamie returns from the show, Julie tells him that she had unprotected sex with a classmate and is worried that she is pregnant. Jamie buys a [[pregnancy test]] for Julie, which comes back negative. Jamie also offers Abbie moral support by accompanying her to her doctor's appointment, where Abbie learns that she is cancer-free, but will likely be unable to have children. To thank Jamie, Abbie tells him her life story: that she was forced to leave her friends in New York and return to Santa Barbara after her cancer diagnosis, brought on by her mother's use of fertility drug [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]].  One day, Dorothea and Julie discuss the fact that Dorothea has only pursued relationships with "safe" men, as opposed to men she is truly attracted to, like William. Dorothea then asks Abbie to show her the modern world. At a punk club, William kisses Dorothea, but she rejects him on account of his sexual relationship with Abbie. When William does end the relationship with Abbie, Abbie warns Jamie and Julie that they must leave Santa Barbara if they want to succeed in life.  Later, Abbie takes Jamie to a rock club where he gets drunk and kisses a girl. Meanwhile, Dorothea teaches William how to pursue a relationship with women, as opposed to seeking one night stands.

Jamie becomes curious about female sexuality, and Abbie lends him a book on gender inequality; when he reads it to Dorothea, she asks Abbie to stop teaching him about the feminist movement. The tension between Abbie and Dorothea comes to a head during a tenant dinner, where Abbie announces that she is menstruating. She grows angry at the tenants' discomfort and makes all of the men at the table say the word "[[menstruation]]". This inspires Julie to recount her first sexual encounter, which upsets Jamie. Jamie tells her that he no longer wants her to spend the night.  Julie is hurt, but convinces Jamie to take a road trip along the California coastline. Jamie tells Julie that he loves her, but Julie says she cares about him too much to have sex. A fight ensues, during which Julie accuses him of only being nice to have sex with her, and Jamie disappears. By the time Dorothea, William and Abbie arrive to search for him, Jamie has returned. Jamie admits to Dorothea that he was hurt when she asked Abbie and Julie for help because it made her seem incapable of raising him. Dorothea tells Jamie about her relationship with Jamie's father.  The film ends with the main characters describing the rest of their lives in voice-overs. Julie moved to New York City to attend college, eventually losing touch with Jamie and Dorothea. She fell in love with a classmate and moved to Paris. They decided to not have children. Abbie stayed in Santa Barbara, marrying and starting a photography studio in her garage.

1920: London
 The film opens with the life of Shivangi, the princess of a royal house in [[Sikar]], [[Rajasthan]], now living in [[London]] with her husband Kunwar Veer Singh. They are a happy couple until one day when Veer develops a minor illness that soon flares up into a disease, shriveling his body and shrinking his head. Veer is hospitalized and his symptoms worsen - his body begins to contort unnaturally and he begins growling in strange languages. The doctors seem to diagnose it as [[tetanus]], which is incurable. Shivangi is frightened; Veer is just not the same and Shivangi's handmaiden, Kesar Ma deems it [[black magic]].  Kesar Ma thinks it is because Veer's father, the King, had two wives and the second wife wanted Veer, the heir, out of the way. The film moves to Rajasthan, where Shivangi and her family visit an exorcist for Veer's condition. This exorcist attempts to confront the witch by entering the other realm, through a mirror, but is soon thrown out, too powerless for the witch. The exorcist refers the King to the most powerful spiritual master in the land, Mewar Baba, also known as Jai Singh Gujjar.   Shivangi shudders on hearing about Jai. She was deeply in love with Jai some years ago. Her uncle saw them together and tried to blackmail the helpless and beautiful Shivangi into sleeping with him. Jai stepped in between and fought off the uncle who promptly reported the matter to the King. Jai was charged with attempted murder. Shivangi inexplicably stood as witness against Jai and Jai was ultimately sent to jail for five years. Shivangi contacts Jai to help her save her husband. Jai flatly refuses but Shivangi pleads and persuades him to help, and Jai finally agrees to come to London.  Jai investigates the matter and discovers that Veer's troubles began upon receiving a strange amulet as a gift from an unknown admirer in Rajasthan. The amulet transmitted the witch demon into Veer. Jai prepares Shivangi into reciting a spiritual chant to bind the witch to their mansion so Jai can throw the locket into the [[Thames]] river, thereby freeing Veer. Shivangi maintains the chant over the witch's attempt to thwart it and Jai finishes the task. However, it is revealed that the amulet and the witch were actually dispatched by Jai, and as he prepares to leave London, Shivangi confronts him, asking him how he knew the source of the amulet. Jai admits his vengeance saying that he wanted Veer dead. Shivangi reveals why she had betrayed him many years ago: When their affair was revealed, the King had ordered Jai killed. Shivangi had begged for his life and it was granted for the price of her betrayal. Now guilty and dismayed, Jai resolves to stay in London and free Veer from the witch.  Jai prepares his final assault on the witch. Jai invokes his own spiritual master through a letter. The master chastises Jai for acting in haste and then regretfully says that the witch will not leave without taking a soul. The master directs Jai to an abandoned church where he receives a set of charmed [[Celts|Celtic]] daggers. Jai prepares a charm to attack the witch. He enters the witch's realm through a mirror and recovers the amulet. The witch attacks ferociously and is about to stop Shivangi when Jai smashes the mirror, closing the portal and trapping himself in the realm, so Shivangi can burn the amulet and free her husband. Shivangi sees Jai smile peacefully from a last shattered piece of the mirror before it breaks as Veer comes to life. Some weeks later, Veer and Shivangi find the letter of correspondence between Jai and his master. Jai had offered his soul so Veer could be freed. Veer is touched and places Jai's photograph upon his mantelpiece as the film ends.

1898, Our Last Men in the Philippines
 During the [[Philippine Revolution]] in October 1897, [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] rebels allied with the [[Katipunan]] attack a Spanish garrison in [[Baler, Aurora]], and massacre 37 out of the 50 soldiers stationed there. Three months later, the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion led by Capt. Enrique de las Morenas y Fossí and Lt. Martín Cerezo is sent from [[Manila]] to retake the village. Despite being informed by Brother Carmelo of the San Luís Obispo de Tolosa church that the rebels have left, Cerezo takes no chances and orders his men to proceed with caution. Upon their arrival, they meet Sgt. Jimeno Costa, a survivor of the massacre, and Teresa, a villager who claims to have no qualms with the Spanish Empire. As the battalion consists of new recruits, they are warned by de las Morenas that the humidity, diseases, typhoons, and wildlife are the rebels' closest allies. Among the cadets is Carlos, an artist from [[Fuenlabrada de los Montes]] hoping to study at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] after the war. He confides with Brother Carmelo, who shares [[opium]] with him to relieve their pain.  One day, a wounded messenger delivers news that the Americans have [[Spanish–American War|declared war]] on Spain and have destroyed the Spanish fleet in [[Cavite]]. As Manila is under siege, supplies to the battalion have been cut off. Capt. de las Morenas has his infantry of 50 men [[Fortified church|fortify the church]] against a possible attack. On 30 June 1898, Tagalog rebels attack the battalion, forcing them to retreat into the church. The next morning, Calixto Villacorta, speaking for Commander Teodoro Novicio Luna of the Filipino forces, offers a one-day truce for each side to bury their own. As both sides gather their dead, Spanish cadet Juan defects to the rebels.  By 10 October, several cadets fall victim to [[beriberi]] due to contamination in the food rations from Manila. As Juan attempts to convince the battalion that they are fighting for a lost cause, de las Morenas succumbs to beriberi that night, leaving Cerezo in charge of the men. Teresa and the village women bring oranges and the latest newspapers to the church as a peace offering, leading to an argument between Cerezo and Costa over the fate of the battalion. On 31 December, Brother Carmelo dies of beriberi. Days later, upon hearing Teresa singing in the village, Cerezo shoots her, prompting the Tagalog forces to shell the church with artillery. Cerezo leads Costa and some cadets to sabotage the rebels' cannon, but an erratic Carlos goes further by stealing the village's food and burning the surrounding houses before retreating back to the church. The next day, Carlos is locked in the basement after Brother Carmelo's opium pipe is found and he is experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  On 18 May 1899, after Carlos emerges from his rehabilitation, Lt. Col. Cristóbal Aguilar y Castañeda, on behalf of General Rios, arrives at the church to deliver newspapers and orders for the battalion to lay down their arms. Cerezo, however, is still not convinced that Spain has lost its colonies to the U.S., believing that the documents he received are false. Carlos offers to travel back to Manila to verify the news they were receiving, but he is captured by Tagalog forces and brought to Luna, who tells him that Spain had [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|sold the Philippines to the Americans for $20 million]], leading to the [[Philippine–American War]]. He returns to the church to tell Cerezo what he has learned, but Cerezo still refuses to stand down. That night, Carlos, José, and Carvajal attempt to flee the church, but are caught by Costa, who chops off Carlos' right arm while Cerezo has the other two cadets executed. As his men lay wounded from another gun battle, Cerezo realizes the truth when he reads a personnel transfer article on a newspaper indicating that his friend Francisco Díaz was posted to [[Málaga]].  On 2 June, Cerezo has Carlos wave the [[White flag#Flag of truce or surrender|white flag]] at the church tower, marking the end of the siege. He then hands over his formal surrender to Luna, who agrees not to take the battalion prisoner and to leave their fate to the American forces. Carlos is given a letter of exemplary conduct by Cerezo, but he threatens to tell Spain what his superior did to his battalion. Disillusioned by the ordeal he faced, he throws away his art book before he and the surviving members of the battalion leave the church.  The [[Siege of Baler]] lasted for 337 days, with 17 Spanish casualties and over 700 Filipino deaths. It also marked the end of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Of the survivors of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion, only Cerezo received the [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Laureate Cross]].

 Aravind ([[Arulnithi]]) was a daredevil police officer who is now off duty due to his drinking habits, which he engaged in after his wife and kid were murdered by criminals who wanted to avenge him. Aravind's supervisor ([[Radha Ravi]]) requests him to proceed with a parallel investigation in a case involving the disappearance and possible kidnapping of several young married men, since the present police team is not able to make any progress in the case. Aravind refuses to this, but later his mother ([[Tulasi (actress)|Thulasi]]) requests him to. Aravind soon gets into the case files and consults the postmortem documents and the doctors who conducted it. Soon, Aravind is seen making breakthrough in the case. Another two kidnappings happen in the series and all this leads to Arulnidhi's rough conclusion of the murderer. The murderer is an eccentric person, has a limp in his feet, and either hates or loves women. The killer leaves certain clues inscribed by sharp surgical knives on the victims' chests. This serves Aravind's thinking of what kind of person the killer is and who his next target is. Upon careful examination of the words inscribed in the victims' bodies, Aravind uncovers that the words are actually Aramaic, the language that Jesus used for communication. The words are later found to point to biblical proverbs, thus helping Aravind lead to conclusions that the killer is insane and that he assumed the victims gave up their lives for the sins committed by their respective wives. He soon figures out that the wives of the kidnapped husbands have links and they all had to do with a guy who studied with them certain years back. There was absolutely no evidence of such a person. During all these scenes, Aravind realizes that there is one last target, and the killer will not miss this, and he will disappear after that. He eventually finds out that the next target is his own brother, and his brother's wife is the last link in the connection. Aravind, with the help of his colleague and other evidences, finds out that the killer has a property. The film ends with Aravind using his presence of mind, apprehending the murderer (like how Alex Cross gets the killer in Kiss the Girls movie) and saving his brother's life. The story of this movie is adapted from Blake Pierce's novel Before He Kills.

Aanandam
 The story revolves around a group of seven friends who embark on their first IV tour (Industrial Visit) of their college life and how it affects small to large changes in their mellow lives. “Rockstar” Gautham, Kuppi (K. Unnikrishnan Pillai), Devika (aka Devooty), Diya, Darshana, Varun and Akshay, along with a group of 33 classmates and two faculty members (Chacko sir and Lovely miss) travel to Hampi ''via [[Mysore|Mysuru]]'' and then to Goa for the New Year’s Eve. Varun organizes the trip as he's recommended by the whole class.  Gautham and Devika are the lovebirds of the group, with Gautham’s talent in western music being the spark kindling the relationship. While Gautham is no longer interested in western music and wish to pursue Hindustani classical music; he is forced to mask that part of his identity from Devika for the fear of how her reaction will be. ''Diya'' with her lovely nature had been the fascination of Akshay’s dreams for a long time, which is known to everyone, except her. The lively nature of Diya had attracted many others in the past (''including Varun, known only to Kuppi''), who obviously confess their feelings only to get turned down as she never adds a different colour to her friendships. Akshay, being apprehensive, never wishes to do the same and hopes that she likes him on her own terms. He never even talks to her and his friends recommend that he can never pray for a better chance than their first year IV. Akshay is also hunted by many fears including fear of water, fear of heights, among others; but the worst one being his fear of future, as he is often being compared with his successful elder brother, ''Akash'', who set the standards too high. Varun had earlier confessed his feelings to Diya, who rejected the proposal hoping to remain friends. With a feeling of insult, he couldn’t do that anymore, leading him to his familiar trait of anger and distant nature. He even remains hostile to another classmate who has a crush on him. The girl, on various occasions tries to approach him, but each time he dispassionately avoids her. In spite of his cold attitude, he is respected among his friends and classmates alike for his discipline and efficiency. He is often too detached from the group carrying on with his responsibilities, that it comes to the notice of even their bus driver, ''Josettan''. Diya, whose parents just got divorced joins the trip as an escape from her distress. She doesn’t reveal about the divorce to her dear friends – Devika and Darshana or any others for the fear of their sympathy, which can make the situation even more difficult on her. She easily manages to hide her secrets in her cheerful semblance. Kuppi’s only intention coming for the IV was to have a good time with his three best friends, which is often denied due to the occurrences around him. Darshana, a reserved person by nature, thinks the world of her friends, being a silent partner in all their activities and a curious observer to all the happenings around them. Her only outlet of emotions is her sketchbook that she holds dear and private.  During the trip, Diya succeeds in talking to Varun. She resolves their differences to slowly gain back her old friend. Akshay’s friends manage to seat Diya near him during the overnight journey to Goa, whereby Akshay finally gets a chance to privately talk to her. They converse through the night, where Diya grows fond of someone for the first time. With a little nudge from her friends, Diya starts to reciprocate Akshay’s feelings. Coming to know of Akshay’s irrational fears, Diya gets him to face his fears, starting with the adventure sport of [[bungee jumping]]. With his first fear conquered, he does the same with his next by finally confessing his feelings to Diya, which she welcomes.  Diya opens up about her parent’s divorce to Akshay, which he accidentally reveals to Gautham and through him to Devika, who openly consoles Diya revealing the secret to the whole group. At the same time, Kuppi in a state of intoxication reveals every other secrets about the group – Diya's relation with Akshay, Varun’s proposal and Gautham’s fear, to everyone else. Offended, Diya retreats to her room. Coming back to his senses, Kuppi realizes how bad his act was. On the next day (also the last day of the trip), Kuppi apologizes to his best friends revealing how tough it was for him to be denied their presence and they reconcile. Gautham reveals his interests to Devika, who gradually accepts and share in his likes. Meanwhile, Varun learns that their expensive tickets to the New Year’s party are fake. To his surprise, no one blames him and the group now has the huge task to search for another party.  Diya still stays away from the group, mainly because she can’t come to trips with her mother leaving her father. She doesn’t talk to anyone including Akshay, much to the dismay of the group. During the search for a party, Akshay runs into his “ideal” brother, Akash, partying in Goa. Although astonished at the find, they share a talk, whereby Akshay no longer fears for his future. With his brother’s help he finds an [[Origami]] themed party for the night (as Diya likes them). On Akshay’s initiative,his professor instigates a talk between Diya's father and Diya, over the phone. Her father reveals the facts behind the divorce and she gets told that the divorce is not that difficult on him, as she imagines it to be. With a feeling of relief despite being sad, she finally rejoins the group for the party. During the party, Darshana shows Diya her sketchbook, which reveals how Akshay and Diya filled her thoughts of late and how happy she was, when she was with him. Diya confesses her feelings to Akshay, rekindling their relationship. Also, Varun apologizes to Diya for his prolonged unfriendly behaviour. He then joins the group for the first time, to celebrate the New Year after Josettan tells him that ''you can never find time for happiness if you wait for your responsibilities to end, as time slips through your fingers before you even know it''.  Back in college, the 'changed' Akshay and Diya are now a couple. Varun is more friendly and content. Kuppi pursues a photography initiative with his new girlfriend ''Cathy'', whom he met whilst on the trip. Devika developed a liking for [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], like Gautham and he on the other hand, overcame his fear of needles to get a couple tattoo with Devika. Darshana is more open about her drawings to her intimate friends.  
The Accountant (2016 film)
  As a child, Christian Wolff is diagnosed with a [[high-functioning autism|high-functioning form of autism]] at Harbor Neuroscience, where he meets the doctor's daughter, Justine. Chris's father declines for his son to stay in a sensory friendly environment, believing that Chris must overcome the hardships inherent in his condition. Afraid that others will exploit his son, Chris's father begins a brutal regimen of stoicism and martial arts training for both him and his brother, Braxton.  In the present, Chris works as a [[forensic accountant]] from a small [[strip mall]] office. He unmasks insider financial deceptions, often for criminal and terrorist enterprises. His daily regimen includes exposing himself to loud music and flashing lights while abusing his own [[tibia|shinbone]] on to inure himself to sensory overload.  [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCen) Director Ray King pursues Chris, known to them as "the Accountant" and recruits Treasury [[data analyst]] Marybeth Medina to help him locate the Accountant. Her leads include Chris's cover names, a recording from his killing of members of the [[Gambino crime family]], and some photos.  Chris is hired to [[audit]] Living Robotics after the company's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], Lamar Blackburn, learns of discrepancies from in-house accountant Dana Cummings. Chris digs into the records and finds that over $61 million has been [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] from the company. That night, [[CFO]] Ed Chilton is forced by a [[Contract killing|hitman]] to commit suicide via insulin overdose. Lamar dismisses Chris, claiming Chilton killed himself because of the investigation of the embezzlement, leaving Chris very distraught because he cannot finish the audit.  Hitmen show up at one of his tax customer's farms (who invited him to practice shooting at their farm as an act of appreciation for helping them). As a result of his self-defense capabilities, Chris dispatches them all but one. Finding that Dana is the next target, Chris saves her before taking her to his storage unit, containing an [[Airstream]] with artwork and other valuables. Chris realizes that the embezzlement at Living Robotics is a scheme; money stolen from the company is returned to it, boosting profits and increasing the company's valuation as it prepares for an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]], exposing Lamar as the embezzler.  Medina isolates Chris's voice from the recording, hearing him repeating the nursery rhyme [[Solomon Grundy]]. She learns that his cadence is reminiscent to autism and that Chris's aliases come from names of famous mathematicians. Using [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] records, she finds his Illinois office.  King later explains to Medina that Chris was imprisoned at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth]] where he learned accounting from Francis Silverberg, a Gambino family accountant turned [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[informant]]. King was Silverberg's handler, but his inaction led to Silverberg's death. King was also investigating the Gambinos when Chris came to avenge his mentor. King began getting information from the Voice when criminals violated Chris's moral code, and King became director of FinCen. The phone rings and the Voice tells Medina about Living Robotics.  Chris goes to Lamar's mansion, where the hitman and his men await. During the battle, the hitman recognizes Chris and greets him. Chris recognizes him as Braxton although they have not seen each other since Chris's imprisonment. Braxton attacks Chris, resentful over his brother's estrangement from him and for their father's death. Lamar arrogantly interrupts and Chris shoots him and amicably agrees to meet Braxton in a week, saying he will find him.  As another set of parents visits Harbor Neuroscience with their child, the boy meets an older Justine; the Voice. Dana receives a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting she saw in the trailer as Chris drives out of town.

He calls himself a Kuwaiti and is often derisive towards Indians.  After a night of partying, Ranjit is woken up to a phone call from his friend and receives word that negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait have collapsed, and Iraqi troops have begun their [[invasion of Kuwait]]. Iraq owes a large debt to Kuwait after the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and President [[Saddam Hussein]] of Iraq had urged Kuwait during earlier talks to reduce their oil supply so prices can rise in the market and Iraq can stabilize their economy. When Kuwait refused, and began slant-drilling into Iraqi oil fields, Saddam ordered the attack. That morning, Ranjit discovers that Kuwait is now mostly overrun by the [[Iraqi Army]]. Ranjit and Nair, his driver, go out and drive to the Indian embassy in an attempt to take their family and leave Kuwait. They are stopped by Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint and Nair is shot dead amidst the confusion. A shocked Ranjit is then taken to the Emir's palace. There he meets [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Iraqi Republican Guard]] officer Major Khalaf bin Zayd ([[Inaamulhaq]]), who reveals that he was the one who pulled up to the checkpoint earlier and prevented Ranjit from any harm. Major Khalaf, who knows Ranjit from Ranjit's visits to Iraq, chides him but extends his personal friendship, ensuring Ranjit and his family's safety from the soldiers.  From there, Ranjit goes to the Indian embassy where he learns that the Kuwaiti government [[Kuwaiti Government in exile|has fled into exile.]] Some 170,000 Indians in Kuwait are now stranded as refugees. Iraqi forces continue to push through Kuwait and Ranjit's mansion is raided by Iraqi soldiers, but his wife and child manage to escape to his office. Ranjit convinces his friends to work together, and they set up a makeshift camp for some 500 Indians with Major Khalaf's permission. Amrita urges Ranjit to use his leverage to extricate his own family, but Ranjit, who ordinarily would have just looked out for himself, appears to have a change of heart. He decides to stay and help the other Indians leave Kuwait.  Ranjit learns that the Indian embassy in Kuwait has been evacuated and phones the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Indian External Affairs Ministry]] in [[New Delhi]], where he reaches the Joint Secretary, Sanjiv Kohli ([[Kumud Mishra]]), and asks for arrangements to be made for the evacuation. Later on, the camp is looted by Iraqi soldiers and harassed some of the refugees. Ranjit pays a visit to Major Khalaf and talks to him about this, to which the Major simply extends his apologies, and also reveals that President Saddam has already permitted Indians to leave Kuwait, but the problem is that they have no way to do so. Ranjit travels to [[Baghdad]] to try to negotiate safe passage out of Kuwait, but to no avail. The only remaining option, Iraqi Foreign Minister [[Tariq Aziz]], turns out to be helpful. He discloses that an Indian [[Merchant vessel|merchant ship]] is due to arrive in Iraq with various supplies, and permits the Indian refugees to leave on the ship. However, Ranjit later receives news of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Sanctions against Iraq|embargo]] and that ships are barred from entering or leaving Iraq, effectively crushing their hopes of getting out.   Meanwhile, Kohli is somewhat of a sluggard, but when his father ([[Arun Bali]]) recounts their tale of woe during the [[partition of India]], Kohli is inspired to actively help Ranjit. He approaches the national airline, [[Air India]], to lead an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait and gets the Indian embassy in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] to issue permits. As the Indians leave Kuwait, Ranjit comes across yet another checkpoint where he encounters hostile Iraqi soldiers who, in absence of any passports or IDs, threaten to kill Amrita. A skirmish erupts between Ranjit and the soldiers, following which the people in Ranjit's convoy come forward and outnumber the Iraqi soldiers. Ranjit lets them live and the convoy passes. They arrive in [[Jordan]] where planes from [[Air India]] and [[Indian Airlines]] would fly the refugees back to India. The Indians salute Ranjit as they board the planes that will take them home.

The Queen cautions Alice that history will be destroyed if anyone sees their past or future self. Upon visiting Time's palace, Alice finds the Chronosphere, an object that powers all time in Underland.  After being told by Time that altering the past is impossible, Alice steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time, shortly after finding the exiled [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]], Iracebeth of Crims, is in the care of Time. The Red Queen urges Time to go after Alice. Alice accidentally flies to the day of Iracebeth's coronation, where a younger Tarrant begins a mockery of the Red Queen when the royal crown does not fit her abnormal head.

The young Mirana steals a tart from her mother and eats it. When confronted by their mother, Mirana lies about eating the tart, and Iracebeth is accused, causing her to run out of the castle in sadness. Alice sees her about to run into a clock, the event that deforms her head and personality. She is able to get the clock out of the way, but fails to change the past as Iracebeth trips and slams her head anyway.  Alice is then confronted by a weakened Time, who scolds her for putting all of time in danger. She runs into a nearby mirror back into the real world, where she wakes up in a mental hospital, diagnosed with [[female hysteria]]. By the help of her mother, she returns to Underland, where she travels to the Attack of the Jabberwocky and discovers that the Hatter's family never died, but were captured by Iracebeth. Returning to the present, Alice discovers the Hatter at the brink of death.  After Alice tearfully says that she believes him, Tarrant awakens and reforms back to his normal self. The Underlanders go to the Red Queen's castle, where Tarrant finds his family shrunk and trapped in an ant farm. Iracebeth apprehends them and steals the Chronosphere from Alice, taking Mirana back to the day she lied about the tart. By the time Tarrant and Alice get there, Iracebeth and her past self see each other. Time becomes irrelevant, and Underland begins to freeze. Using the Chronosphere, Alice and the Hatter race back to the present, where Alice is able to place the Chronosphere back in its original place.  With the Chronosphere stabilized, Underland reverts to normal. The Hatter reunites with his family. Mirana apologizes to Iracebeth for lying, and both of them make amends. Alice bids her friends farewell and returns to the real world where her mother refuses to return Alice's ship over to Hamish, and the two set to travel the world together with their own company.

James appears to enjoy the dependence, saying that it makes him feel needed. As they try for a baby, Gina prepares for a cornea transplant, which will restore the sight in one of her eyes. The surgery is a success, and Gina embraces her newfound independence. Immediately, her sex life with James suffers. To put the spark back into their marriage, James books them a holiday to Barcelona, promising Gina that he has reserved the same hotel room they had on their honeymoon. Upon their arrival, Gina claims the room is not the same, which James denies. Gina is later proven to be correct.  After Barcelona, they attempt to have sex on a sleeper train. James, blindfolded, demands to know who Gina fantasises about when she masturbates, seemingly doubtful when she answers that she only thinks of him. James later rewatches a video of the encounter, obsessed with his helplessness and Gina's emotionless face.  Still in Spain, Gina and James arrive at Gina's sister's house. One night, Gina visits a peep show with her sister and brother-in-law but becomes agitated when someone gropes her on the street. James declines their invitation to join and appears uncomfortable when Gina's brother-in-law jokingly suggests that Gina may find someone better-looking.  Back home in Thailand, Gina begins to have trouble with her vision. As her eyesight worsens, it is heavily implied that James is diluting her eye drops with water, thus damaging the transplant. Confused and terrified by her returning blindness, Gina brings her eye drops to her doctor, who promises to test them for contamination. James learns that he is sterile but does not tell Gina.  While James purchases a new house at Gina's insistence, Gina engages in a flirtation with Daniel, an attractive man she has met at the public pool.

Gina later reveals to James that she is pregnant, unintentionally confirming her affair as she is unaware of James's infertility. James does not confront her. Similarly, when Gina learns from her doctor that her eye drops have been tampered with, she does not confront James. Their home is broken into and their dog is stolen.  Some time later, a visibly pregnant Gina has apparently regressed into her former blind self. She and James move into their new house. At one point, James tests Gina's blindness, intentionally hiding from her in plain sight. He makes plans to meet her at a local school for a talent show in which she is performing. While he is gone, Gina receives an anonymous letter, written in crayon, that reveals James was the one who staged the home invasion and released their dog. The writer claims to have rescued the dog but refuses to return it because "when I look into her eyes, she looks back at me, and that is what love is."  James goes to their old apartment to collect the last of his and Gina's belongings. In the bathroom, he uncovers a stash of empty eye drop bottles. He realises that Gina discovered his deception and secretly continued to obtain eye drops from the doctor, meaning that she has been faking her blindness. Gina confirms this when she looks directly at him during the talent show. Distraught, James drives home in tears, impairing his vision and causing him to crash into an oncoming truck.  Home alone, Gina gives birth. She looks into her baby's eyes.

Alone in Berlin (film)
 In 1940, a working-class couple in [[World War II-era Berlin]], [[Otto Quangel|Otto]] and [[Anna Quangel]], decide to resist [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]], after receiving the news of the death of their only son. An additional impetus for their growing resistance to the regime is the fate of an old Jewish woman living in their building. Though the official deportation of Jews to death camps had not yet started, Jews have no recourse to any legal protection. Ruthless Nazis — and "non-ideological" common criminals — use the opportunity to loot the old woman's apartment with impunity. Despite the efforts of the Quangels and other kind neighbors to help her, the persecution ends with the old woman jumping to her death from a high floor window.  Impelled by all this, the couple starts writing [[postcard]]s to urge people to stand against Hitler and the Nazis and protest against them, and furtively placing the cards in public places - a capital crime.<ref name="ThompsonBruhl" /><ref name=Guardian></ref> Their first card reads: "Mothers, Hitler Will Kill Your Son Too". At first, Otto wants to do it all by himself, warning Anna, "They hang women, too!" She, however, insists on taking part in this dangerous activity. While in the beginning of the film the couple's marriage seems to have dried up, being unable to console each other for the loss of their son, their shared risk and commitment brings them back closer, in effect falling in love with each other all over again.  Escherich is the police inspector charged with finding the source of the postcards.<ref name=FilmingTHR/> He is a professional police detective, acting out of professional pride rather than Nazi ideology. During three years of painstakingly gathering clues about the "[[Hobgoblin]]" (as he calls the mysterious writer of the postcards) he develops an increasing respect for this elusive unknown opponent.  With the lack of progress in his investigation, Escherich is beaten up by the obviously impatient [[Obergruppenführer|S.S. senior officer]], and is further forced thereby, to execute extrajudicially, a man whom he is certain has no connection with these subversive postcards.  Finally, Otto Quangel is arrested due to the accidental fall of postcards out of his pocket, while at work. He remains, though, stoic about the certain death sentence awaiting him, and only tries in vain to take all the blame on himself and save Anna.  After the couple has been executed, Escherich is alone in his office. He gathers up all of the couple's hundreds of subversive postcards, scatters them out of the open window of the police headquarters, and shoots himself. The film ends with the image of the postcards swirling in the wind, falling down on the Berlin streets and picked up by passersby — giving the film's protagonists a posthumous moral victory.

He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beauséjour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.  The two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a bombing raid.  A year later, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a "blue dye" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of false intelligence at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, or be hanged for [[high treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally.  Defying orders, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; However, Sangster, blind from a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that the resistance fighter Paul Delamare worked with Marianne in France and would be able to identify her. Max seeks out a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph and instructs him to ask Delamare whether she really is Marianne.  Max and Marianne host a party. Max hears that the operation might be a test, before he is given a vital job in the run-up to [[D-Day]]. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer. Max becomes aware that Marianne is talking to a local storeowner in the kitchen. Marianne tells Max it was a local jeweller trying to sell her a brooch. He runs outside and catches the salesman, and deceptively asks about the earrings, but the salesman corrects Max that it was indeed a brooch. Then Max tells Heslop that the "blue dye" operation could be a high level test; Frank denies it, but Max suggests that he could not know, because it would be above Frank's pay grade.  That evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet with Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail and detain the lone officer. Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.  Back in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the "blue dye" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she only forwarded the message because German agents were threatening Anna, including the woman who lives around the corner and often looks after Anna.  Max, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to leave before the SOE catches them. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], the nanny and the jeweler. Max uses his credentials to get onto the airbase to flee the country via airplane. Max cannot get the plane to start prior to the arrival of the military police. Heslop drives his own vehicle into the plane's propeller just as Max finally gets the plane engine running. Marianne wraps up Anna in a blanket and says goodbye. Marianne tells Max that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished.  After the war, Max moves to the ranch in [[Medicine Hat]], [[Alberta, Canada]], as he had always wanted to do, and raises Anna. The film ends with Marianne reading the letter that she had earlier written to her daughter, anticipating that one day her real identity would be uncovered.

They both then flee from the scene after the doctor falls over the ground and hits his head.  Guy is horrified by the situation but is calmed down by Nikki. She then informs him about the duties that came with the job and that he gets a cut of the "take", which prompts Guy to now be very interested in the job. They then proceed to pick up two other prostitutes, Jaxi (Bria Murphy) and Fallon ([[Ashley Tisdale]]), for a bachelor party. At the house, Guy is ordered to wash the "hardware," referring to a large bag filled with very messy sex toys.  The four then head to a fancy hotel in Beverly Hills for the bachelor party. The party is filled with over excited testosterone-driven former frat boys. The girls then appoint Guy to play "pimp" to get the frat boys in line. What follows is various strip teases and sexually explicit dancing, followed by a "main event," involving Fallon ejaculating directly on Guy.  Guy leaves the party momentarily when Anne goes into false labor. To his dismay, he runs into the doctor he assaulted, who ends up holding him hostage with a syringe filled with a paralyzing drug, and orders Guy to take him to Nikki. At their arrival, the doctor's plans are foiled when Nikki causes him to stab himself with the syringe. The bachelor party then resumes at full speed but comes to a halt when the girls find themselves robbed. The girls then hold the entire bachelor party at gun point, demanding the return of their money. They chase the culprit down long halls and end up urinating on him before taking back their money.  As they leave the hotel, one of the bachelor party guy approaches Nikki and asks for a "quickie." It is then revealed that he is an undercover cop and he attempts to arrest Nikki. This prompts Guy to once again rescue her and they are caught in a cop car chase. The four manage to escape the cops but end up crashing Guy's car. They continue to escape on a bus.   They return, exhausted, to their homes in the early morning. Nikki thanks Guy by hiring him to design a house for her and tells him the "hardware" will be awaiting him for the next round. Guy expects arresting cops to be at his house but it turns out his car was found by "repo men" and hauled away before the cops could find it.  Being based on a true story, the credits play over scenes that actually took place.

American Pastoral (film)
  In 1996, at the 45th-year reunion of the class of '51 at [[Weequahic High School]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], writer [[Nathan Zuckerman]] meets one of his old friends, Jerry Levov. They talk about Jerry's older brother, former all-state star athlete Seymour ("Swede"), class of '44, who recently died after a long illness.  The story moves back to a young Swede persuading his father, glovemaking magnate Lou Levov, to let him marry his high school sweetheart, New Jersey's 1947 Miss America contestant Dawn Dwyer. Lou is skeptical because Swede is Jewish and Dawn is a devout Roman Catholic, but her strength and honesty sways him. They have a daughter, Meredith ("Merry"), and settle in the town of Old Rimrock, where they acquire a large farm, with Swede commuting the 30 miles to the Newark glove factory.  Merry struggles with a stuttering problem, which her parents are unable to get a handle on &ndash; though Grandpa Lou says it is simply because her mind works so fast. Merry is smart and quirky, and is deeply affected as a 12-year-old by the self-immolation of [[Thích Quảng Đức]] in 1963. By the time Merry reaches high school, she has become increasingly radicalized as the [[Vietnam War]] rages, and frequently goes to New York City to take part in antiwar protests. When Merry lashes out during the [[1967 Newark riots]], Swede urges her to channel her energy into protesting against the war from closer to home. A few days later, the town's little post office and store is destroyed by a bomb, killing the owner.  Merry disappears, and is the FBI's prime suspect, though Swede and Dawn believe she is innocent or, if involved, being forced to act by older radicals she met in New York. Swede searches for her, hounding the FBI for information, but she is not heard from.  Some time later, 22-year-old university student Rita Cohen presents herself at the glovemaking factory, ostensibly working on a report for business class. Rita tips off Swede with credible information about Merry, hints that she knows Merry's whereabouts, then asks him to meet her at a hotel with $10,000 cash. Swede meets Rita in the hotel room, but spurns her mean-spirited attempts to seduce him.  Rita runs off with the money and leaves no further information regarding Merry. Swede calls in the FBI, pointing to the Rita connection and the recent bombing in the [[Greenwich Village townhouse explosion]], but the agency has no more use for Swede's inept interference.  The strain of Merry's disappearance eventually causes Dawn to have a nervous breakdown. After treatment, Dawn starts an affair with a neighbour, tells Swede that Merry has destroyed their former life, and tries to get Swede to forget about Merry so that they can start a new life.  He refuses to stop looking.  In 1970, Swede spots Rita on a New York City street. Rita takes him to a skid-row area of Newark where Merry now lives. During two brief visits, Merry confesses to Swede that she made and planted a total of 3 bombs, killing 4 people. She tells of how she later slid into the underground, where she was taken robbed and raped repeatedly. As a penance for her crimes, she has withdrawn from society, and is practicing extreme [[Asceticism#Jainism|asceticism]]  within the Indian religion [[Jainism]] (though the quietness of her physically dirty and simple life style has ended her stutter). She has no desire to return home, and says that if he loves her, he'll let her be. We see the years pass in a series of shots of Swede growing older as he keeps returning to stand outside the abandoned house where he last found Merry. Swede never sees Merry again.  In the present, at Swede's funeral, Nathan muses that we know we are alive when we realize that "all the time... we are wrong" about our assumptions "about everyone". As the mourners are leaving, a cleaned up middle-aged Merry arrives, silently passing her uncle and mother as she walks to Swede's grave.

Resentful, Red avoids getting to know his classmates Chuck, Bomb, and Terence, as well as the class's instructor Matilda. One day, a boat docks at the island's shore containing [[Bad Piggies|green-colored pigs]], and their captain Leonard, who claim to be peaceful explorers bringing offerings of friendship. The pigs are accepted on the island and introduce the birds to innovative technologies such as [[slingshots]] and [[helium balloons]].  More [[pig]]s arrive and seemingly adjust to the birds' society, but Red soon becomes suspicious of their motives, as they slowly overwhelm the island. He recruits Chuck and Bomb to help him find Mighty Eagle, a giant [[bald eagle]] said to be the protector of the island, and the only bird that can fly, but who has not been seen for many years. They find Mighty Eagle on top of Bird Mountain, but he is now [[Obesity|overweight]], self-absorbed, and largely in [[retirement]]. Looking through the Mighty Eagle's [[binoculars]], Red's group sees the pigs planting explosives around the island while the birds, probably unaware the other three are gone, are at a rave party. They realize the party was actually a cover for their plan to steal the birds' eggs. Red, Bomb, and Chuck attempt to warn the other birds and stop the pigs, but they arrive too late as the pigs escape with the eggs and their [[Explosive material|explosives]] destroy the village. When the birds realize what happened, they apologize to Red for not believing him, and he leads an army in order for the birds to retrieve the eggs.  The birds construct a boat and sail to Piggy Island, where they find the pigs living in a walled city and Leonard, who is actually revealed to be King Mudbeard, the king of Piggy Island. Deducing the eggs are most likely in the castle at the center of the city, the birds [[Angry Birds (video game)#Gameplay|attack and defeat the pigs by firing themselves over the walls using their gifted giant slingshot]]. However, when Terence attempts to launch himself into the city, he accidentally snaps the slingshot in half after pulling himself too far back. Meanwhile, Red, Chuck, and Bomb make it to the castle and find the eggs in a boiler room, where the pigs plan to cook and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives, having watched these events through his binoculars and had a change of heart, and carries the eggs out of the castle. While the birds escape, one egg falls out and rolls back into the castle. While battling Leonard, Red learns to control his anger and distracts him long enough to retrieve the egg; the pot the pigs planned on boiling the eggs in collapses and shields Red as the pigs' reserve of explosives blows up and destroy Piggy Island. Red reunites with the other birds as the rescued egg hatches, revealing three little [[bluebird|blue birds]], and is declared a hero. He, Chuck, and Bomb are approached by Mighty Eagle, who claims that his laziness was only a ruse so the birds could find faith in themselves. Upon returning to Bird Island, the birds rebuild Red's house (which was destroyed by the pigs upon their arrival) and move it to the middle of their village. All of the birds that have hatched sing a song to Red to thank him and enshrine him as a legendary hero, and Red lets Chuck and Bomb move in with him.  During the end credits, the pigs are revealed to survive Piggy Island's destruction, as King Mudbeard begins to make a new plan to steal the eggs. In a mid-credits scene, the three blue birds use the rebuilt slingshot to launch themselves out to sea.

The agents reveal that they are to execute "Operation Anthropoid," the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ([[Detlef Bothe (actor)|Detlef Bothe]]), the main architect of the [[Final Solution]], and the head of [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi forces in German–occupied Czechoslovakia]].  With limited intelligence and little equipment in a city under lock-down, Jozef and Jan must find a way to assassinate Heydrich, an operation that, they hope, will change the face of Europe. With the help of two young women, Marie Kovárníková ([[Charlotte Le Bon]]) and Lenka Fafková ([[Anna Geislerová]]) along with other plotters, the agents plan to ambush Heydrich as he arrives at his headquarters by car. When the agents learn that Heydrich is about to be transferred to France, the plan goes into effect with the duo bolstered by the addition of other agents who have been parachuted into Czechoslovakia and the remaining resistance fighters in Prague.  On 27 May 1942, the attack is carried out but nearly botched when Jozef's [[Sten]] [[submachine gun]] jams. Heydrich is severely wounded - but not killed -by Jan's grenade that shatters his limousine, followed by Jozef's [[fusillade]] of gunfire. Immediately after, the assassins go on the run, and Nazi forces round up thousands of Czech citizens and carry out a terrible reprisal. Lenka is killed trying to escape Nazi soldiers on the street. Resistance fighter [[Karel Čurda]] (Jiří Šimek) turns on the agents and reveals the family which hid them. Meanwhile, the agents have now relocated and hide in the [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral|Orthodox Cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in Prague. Heydrich soon dies from his injuries in the hospital. Reprisals continue with [[Lidice massacre|the village of Lidice destroyed]] with all the males over age 16 shot, children and women sent to camps.   The family who Jozef and Jan stay with are punished, their house attacked by numerous Gestapo officers. The mother commits suicide by taking a cyanide tablet in the bathroom. The son is brutally tortured and gives in to the Nazis' demands. He tells them where Jozef and Jan are hiding, in the cathedral. Hundreds of Nazi troops storm the cathedral and all the agents are killed in a fierce 6-hour battle. Ultimately, a total of 5,000 Czechs and Slovaks were killed in the aftermath of the "Heydrich Terror". The assassination of ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Obergruppenführer]]'' Heydrich was the only successful government organised assassination of a top-ranking Nazi in the [[World War II|Second World War]].  
Antibirth
 Lou ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) is a hard-partying [[Drug culture|stoner]] who lives in a run-down trailer outside a rural [[Michigan]] town where women have recently been going missing. She awakens one morning after a party at an abandoned warehouse and finds herself experiencing bizarre symptoms akin to those experienced during pregnancy. Her friend, Sadie ([[Chloë Sevigny]]) believes she is pregnant and not telling her about it, despite Lou's claims that she hasn't had sex with anyone in nearly a year. Lou also believes that it is impossible for her to get pregnant after an upsetting incident six months earlier when she miscarried in a club while on the toilet. After getting a ride from her friend Luke ([[Emmanuel Kabongo]]) to her cleaning job at a motel, she encounters an eccentric stranger, Lorna ([[Meg Tilly]]), who is staying in one of the hotel rooms.  Meanwhile, Gabriel ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]), Sadie's drug dealer and boyfriend, is keeping a woman hidden in his apartment who has had a grotesque physical reaction to a new and strange drug Gabriel and his friend Warren have been selling to locals. It is revealed that Sadie, who had a child many years ago, is working to try to reunite with her estranged offspring, though Gabriel is doubtful it will ever happen. In addition to running drugs (including unstable, experimental drugs, some of which turned an underling's skin inside out upon sampling it), Gabriel works as a pimp; during an encounter between a prostitute and a client, a strange man, apparently familiar to Gabriel and later revealed to be Isaac, watches the intercourse take place, noting his interest in the encounter.  One afternoon, Lou loses consciousness and has bizarre [[hallucination]]s in which figures from Funzone, a local [[family entertainment center]] give her a vaginal exam. She awakens to find her stomach protruding, and a [[boil]] formed on her foot, which leaks a clear fluid after she cuts it open with a knife. When Lou regains consciousness, Lorna arrives at her trailer unannounced, and asks her if she's experienced a series of odd symptoms and mental fogginess; she claims to be [[clairvoyant]],and have noticed that Lou seemed troubled when she had met her at the motel. The two have lunch at the Funzone, and Lorna confesses that she was abducted by an unknown entity while enrolled in the [[military]], an event which led to her being discharged when she questioned her authorities. Lou confronts Warren, who works at the Funzone, about the night before she began experiencing her symptoms; he admits that Gabriel has been "trading" women, mostly runaways, to a mysterious man named Isaac in exchange for drugs to sell.  At her trailer, Lorna shows Lou a scar on her forearm, where she claims an [[Implant (medicine)|implant]] was inserted and then forcibly removed while she was in the military. Sadie arrives the next day, and suggests Lou see a doctor, but Lou insists she is not experiencing a pregnancy. Lou, Sadie, and Lorna go to visit the abandoned warehouse where the party had occurred the night before her symptoms began. There, she has a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of being injected with a drug by Gabriel at the party. Sadie then confesses that Gabriel had used Lou as a test subject for the new drug—an experimental hormone for women—that he has been selling.  Back at Lou's trailer, Lorna attempts to give Lou a [[cesarian section]] to remove the growth in her stomach.  Instead, Lou gives birth to a grotesque, animated disembodied head. Just after the birth, Gabriel and Isaac arrive at the trailer along with another [[SWAT]] member who shoots Lorna. Isaac reveals that the military is investigating a way to create a new race that can survive the toxic atmosphere of space (which he has been to several times) and that her lifestyle of hard-drinking and drug use, as well as his secretly pumping toxins into her home, provided an ample womb for their experiment. He tells Lou that she can help him build a new, superior race, but she refuses to continue. As he explains this, arms begin to emerge from her vagina, followed by the whole of her [[cytoskeleton]], leaving her flesh an empty shell. The headless creature attacks and kills both Gabriel and Isaac. A [[SWAT]] member enters the trailer after hearing a commotion, and sees the trailer covered in blood, as the full-bodied creature stands in the kitchen, holding its head in its hands.

At a graveyard somewhere close to the temple a group of tantric practitioners capitalise on the Amman being made dormant to awaken evil spirits for black magic purposes. During the ritual they inadvertently release a demonic entity that they could not contain. The evil spirit then leaves the graveyard in the form of cloud and moves into the village. The village mendicant-holyman notices the evil spirit and chases after it, but could not prevent it from entering the titular palace. Being mute, his pleadings to warn the palace owner ([[Radha Ravi]]) is ignored. Later that night, the spirit attacks the owner who then falls and goes into a coma. His elder son Ramesh ([[Subbu Panchu]]), arrives with his wife Sandhya ([[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]]) and their son Suresh ([[Nithin Manivannann]]). Together with them are his younger brother, Murali ([[Siddharth (actor)|Siddharth]]) and his fiancé Anitha ([[Trisha Krishnan]]). Devadas ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]) arrives as well, in disguise as his father, Sandhu Bondu Naadimuthu (Soori) who was a doctor and had contact with the land owners.

He initially suspects Manju ([[Poonam Bajwa]]), who was hired by the family as a nurse for Murali's father, but he soon realizes it is not her since she has a different agenda. After that he sets up cameras around the house. A couple of nights later the elder brother goes missing and Ravi sees it. With the cameras he is able to identify the spirit that is causing havoc. Murali identifies her as Maya ([[Hansika Motwani]]), his younger sister.  Maya was loved by all, especially by her father and Murali. She was also the owner of Maya Granites shown in the song ''Maya Maya''. On the day before her marriage, she eloped with one of the workers' son ([[Vaibhav Reddy]]) and the whole family was shocked and felt disgraced. Three years later in Bangalore, when Murali sees that she is pregnant, he passes the good news to his father and brother as they arrive to their house. Their father asks Maya to come back home to which she agrees. On the day she was supposed to arrive, Maya didn't show up, and Murali thought she had changed her mind. Later Ravi tells that it's not true. Maya and her husband got off a stop earlier since her elder brother wanted them to arrive home safely. While traveling in a Jeep on the way to their palace, Maya's husband was stabbed by the driver. After that he instructed Maya to go into hiding. But this plan failed when Maya's father arrived and told her to drink poison since she disgraced her family's name and status by marrying someone who belonged to a lower caste. Maya agrees to her father's words with a condition that her husband's life should be spared. After she drank the poison Maya's elder brother killed her husband in front of her which made Maya vow that she will end the male generation in her family, before her father chokes her to death.

It is also shown that Anitha killed Murali's elder brother and also poisons her father-in-law as an act of revenge, even though he managed to recover from his coma. Ravi decides to find Maya's corpse, while Murali, Suresh, and Manju try to distract Anitha by taking the entire family to a restaurant. Their main goal is to get Anitha's blood and put some holy ink on her hair. They manage to get her blood when she is cutting an apple, and one of the assistants ([[Manobala]]) manages to put the ink before getting thrashed by Anitha/Maya. There Anitha goes to the house and tries to kill Murali and Suresh. However it fails and the priest manages to get Maya out of Anitha. Later Ravi and the priest decide to kill the spirit and the only way is to be possessed by the spirit and stab its own corpse. Ravi manages to do it and completes it but the priest gets chest pain and he tells Murali that their only hope is to go to the Amman Pooja that is happening in their village temple as Amman is their final hope. Murali and Suresh get there with Ravi possessed by Maya trying to stop them. When Ravi is about to kill Murali, Amman uses her powers and prevents Maya's spirit from killing Murali and Suresh. Before she leaves, she sees her brother Murali who sheds tears for what had happened to his beloved sister. Before Maya disappears she smiles at the Amman. After this incident, Murali, Suresh and Anitha reunite and Ravi reunites with Manju leaving the Aranmanai in the hands of the caretakers.

Dhayalan's view is that the toddler need to enjoy his childhood by playing and learning and join a school at the age of 5. But after a heated argument, Dhayalan's wife attempts suicide for this and he agrees against his conscience and enrolls their son in the play school.  As the boys grow, their fathers imbue different social aspects into their children. Dhayalan teaches his son to be friendly to society, trust people, enjoy every moment of life and do good to the community. He teaches his son to follow a path of truth and integrity, considering human values above everything else. He also teaches his son how to behave friendly and talk socially with others. Singamperumal teaches his son not to trust anyone and focus only on academics, asks him to follow a timetable for everything and the goal is to achieve state topper in Class 10th and 12th exams, join a medical degree in a prestigious college and take up a master's medical degree in one of the [[United States]]'s top medical colleges. Nadunilayan teaches his son not to stand out on any particular aspect and to take a centrist position in everything. His ideology is to live a low-profile life because he understands if one is very good or very bad in any of the aspects, he attracts the attention of society.   When Vetriswaran is in second grade, Dhayalan is furious with the teaching approach of this school, gets into an argument with the school management, and moves his son out of the private school to a government school. Dhayalan's wife is angered by this event and separates from him; she goes to her parent's house and seeks divorce and custody of her son. However, her father rejects this idea and lets Dhayalan have custody of his son.  The children grow into boys and become teenagers. Vetriswaran grows into a self-confident teenager excelling in both sports and studies; Chakravarthy as a studious but timid and indecisive boy whereas Mayilvaganam grows up with an inferiority complex about his height and studies.  Dhayalan identifies that Vetriswaran is interested in swimming and enrolls him in swimming classes, it leads to achieving a Guinness World Record at the age of 16. Dhayalan also identifies the ability of Mayilvaganam to write poems, compiles all his works and sends them to a leading lyricist [[Pa. Vijay]]. Mayilvaganam's book gets a good recognition and he is felicitated by the renowned persons of the industry. Chakravarthy also joins at Dhayalan's backyard hut for children when his father is not at home, and the trio become friends with Nandhini ([[Amma Kanakku|Yuva Lakshmi]]) and Rashitha Bhanu ([[Gabriella Charlton]]). They all study together and pass the 10th std examinations, with Bhanu and Chakravarthy becoming the state first students.  Singamperumal's ideology is that dedication plus meditation plus concentration is equal to education and Chakravarthy tops 10th class with 99% and his father enrolls him in one of the strictest higher secondary boarding schools in a distant locality. Chakravarthy is given a target by his father to top in Class 12th as well. He longs for the affection of his mother in the boarding school, succumbs to the rigorous rules, torture by staffs in a dark room and unforgiving pressure of school management. He calls Vetriswaran and the gang of children decides to meet him. They help him to sneak out and have fun but this is found out by the management and Chakravarthy faces repercussions.  Singamperumal, while arguing with Dhayalan and the other children for meeting his son, suddenly receives a phone call that his son attempted suicide. Singamperumal who is in a shock reaches the hospital with Dhayalan and later apologises to Dhayalan for ill-treating and abusing him. He also exclaims that he did not even allow his son to talk friendly with him and hence Singamperumal realises his mistakes and then reforms. The whole management convinces that nothing serious has happened. But Kumaran ([[M. Sasikumar|Sasikumar]]), a famous doctor from the hospital, informs Dhayalan that that Chakravarthy already died 8 hours ago and was murdered by the School officials for complaining after a night long torture. The management publicize that Chakravarthy committed suicide because of a love failure but an angry student who is Chakravarthy's best friend tells the media the truth. Dhayalan reports the incident with evidence of a letter which the child has written for his father. Chakravarthy's friends are devastated. The story ends with the moral that children should be cherished and loved but not ignored and kept pressured.  
Apprentice (film)
 Prisons officer Sergeant Aiman has just been transferred from "[[Commonwealth, Singapore|Commonwealth]]" (referring to the former Queenstown Remand Prison) to the fictional Larangan Prison, the state's maximum security prison. Due to his vocational education background, he is assigned to watch the rehabilitating prisoners at the prison's workshop. Later on, while helping a colleague, Sergeant Joseph, to clear some stores at the prison gallows, he encounters the Chief Executioner, Senior Chief Warder (1) Rahim. He volunteers to help Rahim find suitable rope for the gallows, and the two men soon strike up a friendship.  At home, Aiman informs his older sister, Suhaila, of his encounter with the hangman. This puts a strain on the siblings' relationship; Suhaila is displeased with Aiman's dealings at work, particularly because their father was sentenced to death thirty years ago for murder, while Aiman appears to disapprove of Suhaila's relationship with John, an Australian expat.  At work, Joseph reveals to Aiman that he has stepped down as Rahim's assistant because, when tasked with carrying out an execution, he could not bring himself to pull the lever. Aiman agrees to become Rahim's new apprentice. Suhaila calls Aiman to announce her engagement to John. Aiman does not take it well, and out of spite, tells Suhaila that he is now the hangman's assistant, greatly angering Suhaila. Meanwhile, Rahim teaches Aiman the tricks of the trade and shares his knowledge and experience with him, and their mentor-mentee bond grows stronger.  Aiman finally receives first-hand experience with an execution. He ushers death-row inmate Randy to the gallows, where Rahim offers Randy words of consolation before performing the execution. Distraught with the experience, Aiman tries to call Suhaila to no avail. He rushes home to find the house empty; Suhaila has presumably left for Australia with John.  In the meantime, Rahim checks on Aiman's security clearance and finds out that Aiman's father had been sentenced to death a long time ago. When Aiman returns to work, Rahim tells him that his father's criminal record ought to have precluded him from taking up a role pertaining to execution, and that his failure to disclose such was an offence. Aiman argues that his father's past should not have any bearing on his employment and others' impressions of him. The two men get into a heated argument; Aiman questions Rahim's ethics, and Rahim chides Aiman for speaking out of line. When things cool down, Rahim says Aiman can expect disciplinary actions. When Aiman returns home, he sends a voice message to Suhaila to let her know that he could lose his job.  Rahim is involved in a road traffic accident and is hospitalized. Assistant Superintendent James Tan puts Aiman in charge of an upcoming execution, implying that not only might Aiman not have been charged, his career with the prisons department may have taken a turn for the better. The next morning, Suhaila calls Aiman about her arrival in Australia. She checks with Aiman to confirm if he will be charged; Aiman responds "maybe not". She then reassures him and lets him know that, as his older sister, she will always be there for him.  The day of the execution arrives. The death-row inmate is ushered towards Aiman, with a number of important persons observing. Aiman leads the inmate to the gallows, puts the noose around the inmate's neck and places his hands on the lever that activates the trap doors. The screen goes black, leaving the outcome open-ended.

Approaching the Unknown
 Captain William Stanaforth (Strong) is on a one-way solo mission to Mars, taking humanity’s first steps towards colonizing it. Although the entire world is watching him, he is completely alone on the space ship. After liftoff and the subsequent rocket separations, Stanaforth takes his suit off to relax and is set on course to Mars by the team on the ground.  Through flashbacks we see how Stanaforth had come up with the idea to create water () by supercompressing sand/dirt and combining the separate hydrogen and oxygen byproducts.  It is by this synthesis that the mission is made possible.  Stanaforth's water generation apparatus malfunctions during his mission to Mars.  Rather than return to Earth as protocol requires, he takes manual control of his spacecraft and continues to Mars.  His spacecraft becomes entangled with a nebula and through voiceover we hear Stanaforth ruminate on the nature of matter and space. Stanaforth says,  "This is why I came here.  To give everything up.  For one moment of pure wonder."  Stanaforth is then seen in his spacesuit, exiting the spacecraft.    Without explanation, the scene cuts to Stanaforth, clean-shaven in his spacecraft, preparing to land on Mars. Stanaforth lands on, then walks, on Mars. As he walks, we hear Stanaforth say, "Nothing has ever lived here. Nothing has even died here. Maybe I'll live forever."

Arrival (film)
 An introductory sequence shows linguist Louise Banks's daughter Hannah dying in early adolescence from an incurable illness.  Twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear at twelve locations across Earth. A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, Colonel G.T. Weber, recruits Louise and physicist Ian Donnelly to find out why the aliens have come. Weber takes them to an army encampment in [[Montana]] near one of the craft. On board, Louise and Ian make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call "heptapods"; Ian nicknames them [[Abbott and Costello]]. Louise and Ian begin researching their written language of [[Logogram|complicated circular symbols]]. As Louise studies the language, she starts to have visions of a child who seems to be her daughter.  When Louise is able to ask why the aliens have come, they answer "offer weapon". However, China translates this as "use weapon", prompting them to break off communications, and other nations follow. Louise argues that the symbol interpreted as "weapon" might mean "tool", and that China's translation likely results from the competitive nature of their interaction with the aliens.  Rogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Louise and Ian re-enter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them an extremely complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Ian and Louise from the craft, knocking them unconscious. When they reawaken, the military is preparing to evacuate, and the craft has moved out of reach. Ian discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message, and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the space in which it is projected. Louise suggests that the full message is split among the twelve craft and that the aliens want all the nations to share what they learn.  China's General Shang issues an ultimatum to the aliens, demanding that they leave within 24 hours; Russia, Pakistan, and Sudan follow suit. Louise goes alone to the craft and it sends down a shuttle to transport her inside. One of the aliens is dying from the explosion; the other explains that they have come to help humanity, for in 3,000 years they will need humanity's help in return, and the "weapon" is their language, which changes humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience 'memories' of things that have yet to happen.  It is revealed that Louise's visions of the young girl are premonitions of her yet-to-be-born daughter, Hannah, whose name is a palindrome.  Louise returns to the camp as it is being evacuated, and tells Ian that the [[alien language]] is the "tool"; those who master it are able to perceive the future and past. She has a premonition of a [[United Nations]] event, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words. In the present, Louise steals a satellite phone, calls the number, and recites the words. The Chinese announce they are standing down and release their twelfth of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve craft disappear.  During the evacuation of the camp, Ian expresses his love for Louise. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them if he could see the future. Louise knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die and Ian will leave them after she reveals that she knew this.

ARQ (film)
 Renton wakes up beside his former lover, Hannah.  Three men break into his bedroom and take him hostage.  Renton breaks his neck while escaping and wakes with a start, only for the men to break in once again.  He and Hannah are taken to another room and bound to chairs.  The leader of the group introduces himself as Father, identifying the others as Sonny and Brother; Cuz died of electrocution after touching a large device, the ARQ, in the room.  Father says he represents a rebel group known as the Bloc and demands Renton surrender money, or "scrips", from their rival organization, the Torus Corporation.  He gives them several minutes to comply and leaves the room with the others to get food.  Renton explains to Hannah the ARQ is a working [[perpetual motion machine]] he designed at Torus.  After Torus shut down the project as an impossibility, he stole it.  Renton believes the Bloc members to be after the ARQ rather than the scrips, though Hannah urges him to comply with their demands.  After freeing himself and Hannah, he is killed while trying to escape.  Renton wakes up gasping, only to relive the same scenario.  This time, after freeing himself, he asks Hannah to help poison the intruders with cyanide gas.  This fails when Hannah reveals herself as allied with them.  Renton surrenders the scrips, only to be killed again after Sonny shoots him.  After reviving, Renton questions Hannah about her past.  She says she grew to resent Renton after he abandoned her to Torus, who tortured her.  Renton says he never gave up looking for her after he escaped.  Though he does not trust Hannah, Renton frees her.  They work out a deal where they will split the scrips after using the cyanide gas to force Father and his group to stand down.  Renton reneges on the deal, demanding that Hannah abandon the Bloc and come with him.  She refuses and accidentally shoots Renton during a scuffle.  Renton and Hannah wake in bed; this time, both recall the events.  When Renton says the ARQ is causing a [[time loop]], Hannah insists he give the technology to the Bloc.  Eventually, Sonny reveals himself as a Torus mercenary and kills everyone.  When they wake, Renton and Hannah agree they must keep the ARQ from Torus, though Renton expresses distrust in the Bloc.  They convince Father to help them, but Sonny shoots Father and knocks Brother unconscious.  After killing Sonny, Renton applies first aid to Father.  He dies after Brother shoots him, not realizing Sonny is responsible.  The next iteration, Sonny becomes aware of the time loop and immediately kills Father and Brother.  Renton theorizes the ARQ is looping the same three-hour period due to running out of energy.  Instead of producing unlimited energy, its fuel cells are refilled after every loop.  When Sonny overpowers them, Renton sacrifices himself to prevent Sonny from acquiring the ARQ.  In the next iteration, Sonny saves Cuz's life, then kills Father and Brother.  Renton and Hannah poison Sonny and Cuz with the cyanide. Before dying, Sonny uses the pool of blood from every other corpse (including Cuz, whom he kills) to set up a trap.  After arguing not to destroy the machine, Hannah is electrocuted when she accidentally steps on Sonny's trap.  Renton briefly considers destroying the ARQ but allows the next iteration to begin.  He admits he was wrong and offers the ARQ to the Bloc.  Father, who is now aware of the time loop, and Brother agree to work with Hannah and Renton; however, Sonny and Cuz take all hostage.  After Sonny forces Renton to disable the machine, Father and Brother die in the confusion of a blackout.  Renton and Hannah briefly escape but return once they realize the time loop is localized to the house.  After they kill Cuz, revealed to be a torturer for Torus, Sonny restarts the ARQ, only to be killed.  An interrupted video message and the ARQ's logs reveal a second, outer time loop: every nine time loops form their own loop in which their memories are reset.  Unknowingly, they have repeated the same nine loops thousands of times. Realizing they are on their ninth loop, Renton and Hannah leave a desperate message to themselves, hoping future iterations can get the ARQ to the Bloc before Torus' reinforcements arrive.  After a robot breaks through and kills them, Hannah wakes with a gasp.

Ares (film)
 In the 2020s, France's economy collapses, and corporations buy its debt.  Although still nominally a democracy, the corporations take control of the government and pass sweeping reforms, deregulating many industries.  Among these changes, [[doping in sport|doping]]  and human experimentation are legalized.  As homelessness and unemployment rise, violent new sports are introduced.  Athletes become sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, who test their new drugs on them.   After a promising start, boxer Reda, who fights under the pseudonym Ares, is injured and loses his corporate sponsor.  Besides performing in brutal cage matches as a low-ranked fighter, he takes jobs for corporate agent Altman, with whom he has a relationship.  During a riot, Reda performs security, freeing his niece Anouk when she is arrested, though he chastises her.  When his sister Carla is framed for possession of a pistol, Altman tells Reda that Carla will be charged as a terrorist.  The only way to save her from a prison sentence is to bribe the officials, which will take €100,000.  To raise the money, Reda is forced to submit to human experimentation for HFX, a drug that has killed every other test subject.  Although corporate executive Anna assures him his biochemistry will likely allow him to survive the drug, she warns that he will black out five minutes after taking it.  Reda leaves Carla's children with his neighbor, a cross-dressing prostitute named Myosotis who believes Reda to be a fascist.  Despite their antagonistic relationship, Myosotis agrees to help him for the sake of the children.  Unable to bet on himself, Reda convinces Myosotis to bet Reda's meager life savings on the fight.  Needing a dramatic demonstration to spur sales, the CEO arranges for Reda to fight a highly-ranked fighter who has had his nervous system tweaked so that he no longer feels pain.  The fight is widely believed to impossible for Reda to win, and even his coach declines to bet on Reda.  HFX performs well, and Reda wins against 12:1 odds.  The drug becomes a sensation, and Reda makes enough money to free Carla.  Before he can, she dies in prison while attempting to save another inmate.  Altman offers to return the money, but Reda asks her to use it to find out who framed his sister.  At the same time, Anouk's boyfriend Boris, a hacker who supports the resistance, provides evidence that implicates Reda's coach.  Reda once again leaves the children with Myosotis.  During his next fight, Reda goes down in 17 seconds, and his earlier win is written off as a fluke.  Sales of HFX plummet, and Reda's coach is financially ruined.  When Reda meets with him, Reda reveals that he did not take the drug and intentionally threw the fight.  Instead, he saved the drug to administer it to his coach, who quickly dies once he is injected.  Anna finds Reda and tells him that she has ordered Altman to kidnap Carla's children.  Anna says that although Altman truly does care for him, Altman cares more for money.  Reda reluctantly agrees to a demonstration in front of the corporate board.  At Reda's house, Altman orders Anouk to call Myosotis.  Anouk tells Myosotis that Reda wishes to thank him, a deeply uncharacteristic action.  Suspicious, Myosotis recuits Boris for help.  Boris and Myosotis rescue the children and kill Altman.  Once they signal Reda that they are safe, Reda takes HFX and throws the CEO out of a window.  Anna's bodyguards, two genetically engineered clones of the most powerful arena fighters, initially gain an advantage on Reda.  However, Anna forbids them from killing him, as they need him for more drug trials.  Handicapped by having to take Reda alive, both die.  With the five minute time limit running out, Reda considers killing Anna but instead assists Boris in remotely hacking into the corporation's mainframe.  There, Boris uncovers proof that over 30,000 people died in HFX's drug trials.  Knowing his nieces will never be safe from the corporation while he is alive, Reda commits suicide despite Anna's protests.  Reda's death and the HFX scandal lead to widespread riots and a revolution.  
Assassin's Creed (film)
 In 1492 [[Andalusia]], during the [[Granada War]], Aguilar de Nerha is accepted into the [[Assassins]] Brotherhood. He is assigned to protect Prince Ahmed de [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] from the [[Knights Templar]]. In 1986, adolescent Callum "Cal" Lynch finds his mother killed by his father, Joseph, a modern-day Assassin. Gunmen led by Alan Rikkin, CEO of the Templars' Abstergo Foundation, arrive to capture Joseph, who convinces his son to escape.  In 2016, Cal is sentenced to death for murdering a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], but his execution is faked by the Abstergo Foundation, which then takes him to their research facility in Madrid. He is told that the Templars are searching for the [[Apple of Eden]], in order to eliminate violence by using the Apple's code to control humanity's [[free will]]. Sofia, Alan's daughter and the head scientist, reveals that Cal is a descendant of Aguilar, the last person confirmed to be in possession of the Apple. She puts Cal in the Animus, a machine which allows him to relive (and the scientists to observe) Aguilar's genetic memories, so that Abstergo can learn what he did with the Apple.  In 15th-century Spain, Aguilar/Callum and his partner Maria are deployed to rescue Ahmed, who has been kidnapped by the Templar Grand Master [[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomas de Torquemada]], to coerce Ahmed's father, Sultan [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]], to surrender the Apple. Aguilar and Maria intercept the Templars, but are overpowered and captured by Torquemada's enforcer, Ojeda. Cal is quickly pulled out of the Animus by Sofia.  Cal encounters other Assassin descendants held captive at the facility, most of whom are suspicious of his motives, with the exception of Moussa, the descendant of an 18th-century [[Haiti]]an Assassin named Baptiste and a key leader.  Cal begins experiencing hallucinations, dubbed "the Bleeding Effect", of both Aguilar and Joseph. Cal and Sofia build a rapport during their sessions; she confides that her mother was likewise murdered by an Assassin, sharing his hatred of the Brotherhood of which his father is a member.  Back in the Animus, Aguilar and Maria are scheduled for execution but he manages to free them, leading to a rooftop chase in which they escape through an [[#Connections to the video games|Assassin "Leap of Faith"]]. Cal's mind reacts violently to the session and he is temporarily paralyzed. When Cal learns that his father is also at the facility, he confronts Joseph over his mother's death. Joseph informs him that the Bleeding Effect will allow modern Cal to possess Aguilar's combat abilities. He also learns that his mother was an Assassin, and she chose to die by Joseph's hand rather than be forced into the Animus. Unconvinced, Cal vows to destroy the Assassins by finding the Apple. Meanwhile, Alan is pressured by a Templar Elder, Ellen Kaye, to shut down the multibillion-dollar Animus Project because they have already "won... people no longer care about their civil liberties... they're content to follow", leading Sofia to question her father's true intentions.  Reaffirmed by his encounter with his father, Cal willingly enters the Animus once again, whereupon Aguilar and Maria ambush a meeting between Muhammad and Torquemada. They succeed in killing the Templars and retrieving the Apple, though Ojeda captures Maria in order to force Aguilar to surrender it.  Instead, Maria chooses death, and stabs herself on Ojeda's blade. Aguilar kills him and escapes through another Leap, the force of which causes the Animus to violently malfunction. Aguilar gives the Apple to [[Christopher Columbus]], who promises to take it to his grave. When Moussa and the modern Assassin prisoners start a riot in order to escape, Alan orders the facility purged. Abstergo security kills Joseph and most of the other prisoners.  Cal stands in the Animus chamber and is met with the projections of a number of his Assassin ancestors, including Aguilar, [[Assassin's Creed Unity|Arno Dorian]], Joseph and his mother. Persuaded by his mother, Cal embraces his Assassins' Creed and, having fully assimilated Aguilar’s memories and abilities, joins Moussa and two other surviving Assassins in escaping the facility.  Having retrieved the Apple from Columbus' burial vault, Alan and his followers converge at a ceremony in a Templar sanctuary in London to celebrate their triumph. Inside the sanctuary, a disillusioned Sofia meets with Cal, who has come to take the Apple, and she reluctantly allows him to act. Cal retrieves the Apple, but kills Alan to do it. While Sofia vows revenge against Cal, the Assassins depart, vowing to once again protect the Apple from the Templars.  
As You Are (film)
 Set in the 1990s, the film opens with a flashforward of a battered Mark ([[Charlie Heaton]]) examining his wounds in the mirror before going off into the woods with his friend Jack (Owen Campbell), where a gunshot is heard. The narrative is also framed within a police investigation involving interrogations of the main characters.  Months earlier, Jack's single mother, Karen, begins dating a man named Tom, who has a son Jack's age. Jack meets the son, Mark, and the two quickly become best friends. They also befriend a local girl named Sarah ([[Amandla Stenberg]]) when she defends them after they are assaulted by a group of thugs. The three spend all their time together, and though Mark kisses Sarah during a game of spin the bottle (which makes Jack visibly jealous), the threesome is platonic at first.  Tom shows his gun collection to the kids, who practice shooting in a nearby field. Soon after, Karen suggests Tom and Mark move in with her and Jack, and Tom agrees. Jack and Mark begin sharing a room and grow closer, experimenting with drugs and navigating adolescence, sexuality and the tribulations of the 90s, including the suicide of their idol [[Kurt Cobain]].  After Jack reveals to Mark that he's never kissed anyone, Mark makes out with him to teach him experience. They later go out to the woods with some of Tom's guns and kill a squirrel. That night, Jack witnesses Tom physically abuse Mark over a trivial incident, which escalate later when he and Jack skip school to go to the quarry with Sarah. Tensions between Tom and Karen over the raising of the boys gets worse until Karen discovers that Tom has been planning for Jack to join the Marines without her knowing, which infuriates her. Following an argument, Tom moves out of the house and takes Mark with him, which devastates Jack, who is clearly in love with Mark.  Mark leaves the school, leaving Jack with Sarah. The two start to date after Sarah is stood up at prom, but break it off when she realizes there is no chemistry between them. The two encounter Mark hanging out with a group of criminals, though Mark returns to Jack after the encounter and they make out again.  Though Jack believes he and Mark will be a couple, Mark and Sarah reveal that they have started dating each other. After Sarah let the two talk Mark tells Jack that it will be easier this way. Feeling betrayed, Jack scuffles with Mark and pushes him, making Mark fall and hit his head on a rock. A distraught Jack carries Mark to the hospital, where Tom is informed that Mark will be fine. Mark convalesces at Karen's house, where he reveals to Jack that he doesn't remember what happened, and the two hold each other, which Tom notices. Meanwhile, the investigation takes a turn when it is revealed that Mark is dead.  As in the start of the film, Mark shows up at Jack's house with a battered face, presumably from Tom. Mark tells Jack that he wishes he were a girl. Jack puts on his mother's makeup and dress to try to seduce him, but Mark rebuffs his advances. The two get drunk before Mark appears with his father's guns, and the two go into the woods once more. The disoriented pair wanders around the area, before being disturbed by animal calls. The ending is open. There is a gunshot but it's not clear if Mark killed himself or if Jack killed him.

Emily is seen in the sets of "solvathellam sathyam," a reality show that showcases people's problems on TV. She complains about three men who raped her friend Aruvi. The Assistant Director Peter (Pradeep Antony) agrees to telecast their problem and calls the three men for interrogation.  Next morning, shooting starts as the host ([[Lakshmi Gopalaswamy]]) asks Aruvi to narrate what happened to her. Aruvi then explains that the three men are Jessy's father Joseph, Arulmani and the swamiji. Joseph had sexually abused her when she took shelter in his house. Arulmani had taken advantage of Aruvi's situation when she begged for a loan and the swamiji had hypnotized and raped her. Aruvi then reveals that she has had AIDS from the past 2 years. The infection seems to have entered through an accident, where an open wound was exposed to a carrier of HIV. She meets her friend Emily in an NGO as both of them have AIDS. Aruvi asks the three men to apologize, but Lakshmi turns against Aruvi, accusing her of intentionally infecting those men. Aruvi is appalled and states everything wrong with the society and the unnecessary stereotypes that every common man has to conform to, in order to fit into this consumeristic world.  The director uses all this drama to his advantage as this would improve his show's TRP rating. Aruvi pulls out a gun and shoots the director in the arm. Later, she calms herself and apologizes to everyone, but as she gets up to leave, Arulmani tackles her and hits Emily. This maddens Aruvi and she points the gun at him and takes everyone hostage. Hearing the gun shots, police start surrounding the studio suspecting terrorist activity. Aruvi then plays "spin the bottle." Whoever the bottle points at, should do whatever Aruvi says, else they would be shot. Aruvi then makes everyone do silly things as she watches, in her own way of getting back at the society that forced her into so much pain. As a part of the game, Aruvi asks Peter to propose to her which he does not do properly; so she asks him to narrate a story and he tells a story as follows: An old man happily spends his life in his village. Soon after, there happens a theft in that village for which the old man is suspected even by his own family members, which forces him to leave the village and go. During the last stages of life he remembers his past happy life and writes a letter about everything he feels to the members of his village, which he hands over to a young man in that village, who then moves to a tea shop buys a cigarette and smokes; thereafter he calls all the people who know that old man to go in search of him and find him and the story ends with the old man smiling where the story is frozen. During the game, everyone becomes friendly with Aruvi. She even forgives the three men who raped her.  She then surrenders to the police. Since Aruvi and Emily are AIDS patients, they cannot be arrested and have to be isolated Inside the camp, Aruvi's condition continues to deteriorate as she loses a lot of weight and becomes incapable of taking care of herself. One night, she disappears from the camp and moves to a village all alone. After a few days, all acquaintances of Aruvi receive a video from Aruvi on Facebook. The video shows her crying and explaining how she misses everyone and speaks about all the regrets in her life. On seeing the video, Peter gathers everyone and takes them to the village in which Aruvi currently resides (as he told the story to Aruvi for which she told that such a thing will never happen). Aruvi is finally surrounded by everyone she loves towards the end of her lifetime. Everyone she loved gave her a lot of gifts like cakes, pictures and lot. Among such gift is a card from Peter who actually was someone she knew from her youth, who gave Aruvi a greeting card, written " Love you Aruvi, Peter" which she saved. Peter had actually proposed to Aruvi in the way she liked but had forgotten the whole incident (it's shown earlier in the film where a guy proposes to aruvi while her friends mock her as it was too blunt). Then she smiled at him and was happy. And Aruvi asks Subash to spin the bottle as she did during the time of hostage and the bottle stops pointing at Aruvi which means that she can do whatever she wants till the end of her lifetime. The movie ends with Peter capturing the image of Aruvi smiling.  
Assassination Classroom: Graduation
 It has been six months since the start of senior year, and yet the Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka High School has not been able to assassinate their tentacled teacher, Koro-sensei, who will blow up the Earth on graduation day. Due to the school festival to be held, assistant teacher Tadaomi Karasuma instructs the class to give all they got, since Koro-sensei will be distracted, making him an easy target of killing. Karasuma also insists that the class should assassinate Koro-sensei before the government-sponsored assassin Red Eye do the same. However, neither the students nor Red Eye are ultimately able to do the task, and Koro-sensei even convinces Red Eye to give up his job for the sake of his students.  At the end of the school festival, Kaede Kayano catches Koro-sensei off guard and begins her assault by revealing her tentacles. She reveals her true identity to be a child actress named Akari Yukimura and the younger sister of Aguri, the class' former teacher and the one whom Koro-sensei promised to teach the class for. She wants to take revenge against Koro-sensei for having supposedly killed her sister. Knowing that the experimental tentacles she wears is taxing her life force, Nagisa Shiota manages to calm her down. He distracts her with a kiss and disables the tentacles.  Koro-sensei then tells the class about his past: as a human, he was an assassin known as "the Reaper". Due to his strength and intelligence, two years ago, a rogue organization led by Dr. Kōtarō Yanagisawa took him as a second guinea pig (a mouse being used as the first) for the testing of a chemical capable of stimulating growth in plants. The Reaper was supervised by Yanagisawa's fiancée, Aguri, with whom he developed a close relationship, especially after she revealed her circumstances as a teacher. When Yanagisawa found out that the mouse tested on the Moon had destroyed it, he ordered the disposal of the Reaper before he could do the same to the Earth. Aguri prevented the execution but was mortally injured and died in the Reaper's arms; this action pulled the Reaper from succumbing to the madness his experimentation caused, leading him to make a vow to teach Class 3-E.  Nagisa decides to find an alternative besides killing Koro-sensei after hearing the story. Having to deal with several opponents, Karma Akabane included, on the plan, he compromises it by saying that should the plan fail, he will kill Koro-sensei himself. The class begin to work on an antidote mapped by a file Nagisa, Karma and Itona steal from Yanagisawa's labs. However, the government has planned to use a laser ignited by a satellite as a last resort to kill Koro-sensei. The government agents kidnap the class, but they manage to escape with the help of Karasuma and Irina Jelavić.  However, to their dismay, the class find out that they have been tricked by Yanagisawa, as the stolen file was faked. Yanagisawa proceeds to inject artificial tentacles, transforming himself into a monstrous being. Seeing him easily defeating Koro-sensei, Akari attempts to defend him, only to get injured in the process. Angered of having to see a repeat of the tragedy two years before, Koro-sensei creates a bomb that obliterates Yanagisawa. He does a surgery that heals Akari, having developed it since his failure in saving Aguri, then tells the class that they should kill him soon. In tears, Nagisa volunteers for the task.  Several years later, Nagisa has become a teacher in a school for delinquents. A delinquent tries to intimidate him, which Nagisa responds by silently threatening him.  
The Assignment (2016 film)
 Dr. Rachel Jane ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) is a rogue plastic surgeon with a twisted vision of a better world. After losing her medical license, she began an illegal practice and performed unwanted surgical experiments on impoverished homeless people. The film is split between a present-day timeline in which she has been institutionalized and her condition is being assessed by Dr. Ralph Galen ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), and a second timeline two years into the past.  Three years prior, Jane's brother Sebastian was murdered by professional killer Frank Kitchen ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]). After discovering Frank's identity, Dr. Jane hires Honest John Baconian ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]) to double-cross him. Seeking revenge, but also seeing an opportunity to assess how much physical identity matters, Jane performs [[gender reassignment surgery]] on Frank and turns him into a woman.  Horrified by his new appearance, Frank has a mental breakdown. Finding a box in the room with hormones and a tape recorder, Frank discovers a message left to him by Jane encouraging him to start over. Leaving the hotel, Frank contacts a girl he hooked up with named Johnnie ([[Caitlin Gerard]]) and asks to stay at her home while he recovers.  The police do not believe Frank exists, frustrating Jane. When Galen contradicts her, she attacks him in a fit of rage before being restrained. A short time later, she asks for a legal deposition so that she can confess. She recounts the events surrounding Frank's surgery and the murders at her clinic that led to her incarceration, but ultimately expresses no remorse for her actions.  Frank sets out to kill everyone involved in his operation, including the men on Honest John's payroll. After learning that the surgery cannot be reversed, he interrogates Honest John, demanding the identity of his surgeon. Honest John implies that Johnnie knows the doctor and is involved. When Frank confronts Johnnie, she admits that the doctor hired her to monitor Frank, but does not know her name. While tempted to kill her, Frank chooses to spare her and send her to Reno, Nevada. She agrees to help him lay a trap for the doctor. However, the doctor's bodyguards were expecting Frank, and they sedate him.  Frank awakens in a straitjacket and finally comes face to face with Dr. Jane. She announces her intention to perform another surgery on him to remove his right arm, so he can never kill again. Frank manages to overpower and kill all of Jane's bodyguards, and her surgical assistant. Jane reappears, threatening Frank with a large knife, noting that he has run out of bullets. Admitting she is a coward “when it comes to life and death situations”, Jane suggests that they go their separate ways amicably. Frank refuses, reloads his gun with a bullet he had taped to the sole of his boot and shoots Jane, non-fatally. After staging the scene to look as if Jane's assistant killed everyone, Frank is seen holding Jane's knife over her unconscious body.  After completing his revenge, Frank records a video in which he tells his side of the story, to be released after his death. He reveals that Johnnie decided to stay in Reno. At her final meeting with Galen, Dr. Jane reveals that she had hoped to convince him to help her be deemed mentally fit for trial, but realized that it was over when she attacked him. She instead decided to accept her fate, while using the deposition as a means to tell her side of the story for anyone interested. The film ends with Jane examining her mutilated hands; Frank had severed her fingers to ensure she would never practice again.

 The corpse of an unidentified woman is found at the scene of a bloody and bizarre homicide. The sheriff finds no signs of forced entry, though he suggests that the victims were trying to escape from the residence.  Emma visits her boyfriend, Austin, and his father, Tommy, who is the coroner in their small town. Tommy explains to her that coroners in the past used to tie bells to bodies to make sure they were actually dead, not comatose. The sheriff arrives with the mysterious body, dubbed Jane Doe, and tells Tommy that he needs the [[cause of death]] by morning. Austin postpones his date with Emma to help Tommy, promising to meet her later that evening.   Tommy and Austin perform the autopsy on Jane Doe and quickly become confused by what they find. There are no external visible signs of trauma, but her wrist and ankle bones had been shattered. As well, her tongue has been crudely cut out, one of her molars is missing, her lungs are blackened as though she had suffered third degree burns, and her internal organs reveal numerous cuts and scarring. [[Datura stramonium|Jimsonweed]], a paralyzing agent not native to the area, is found in her stomach. The condition of much of the body suggests that death had just occurred, while cloudiness of the corpse’s eyes suggests that she had been dead for a few days.  Other mysterious events occur. The radio begins to spontaneously change stations, frequently settling on the song "[[Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In)]]", and Austin hears sounds and believes he sees people standing in the morgue's hallway. He also finds their cat mortally wounded, hiding in an air duct.   News reports on the radio state that a severe storm is about to hit the area, but Tommy and Austin decide to stay and finish the autopsy.  Tommy finds the woman's missing tooth wrapped in a piece of cloth in her stomach. The cloth has Roman numerals and letters as well as an odd diagram. Similar symbols are found on the inside of her skin. The lights in the room suddenly explode. During the confusion, they realize that other corpses in the morgue have gone missing. They decide to leave, but the elevator does not work and a fallen tree is blocking the exit door. An unseen figure attacks Tommy in the bathroom, leaving bruises on his body.    Austin and Tommy decide to burn Jane Doe's body. Unable to get to the cremation furnace, they set her ablaze in the exam room. The fire spreads rapidly; Tommy puts it out with an extinguisher but is disturbed to find the body has not burned. When the elevator turns back on, Tommy and Austin try to use it to escape but the doors will not close. Panicked, Tommy uses an axe against what he believes to be one of the animated corpses. When he and Austin exit the elevator, they discover he has actually killed Emma, who had returned to pick up Austin for their date.   Certain that Jane Doe's corpse has been preventing them from finding out the truth about her death, they return to the examination room. Tests determine that Jane Doe's brain tissue cells remain active, proving that she is somehow still alive. Further examination of the cloth determines that the markings refer to [[Leviticus]] 20:27, which condemns witches, and the year 1693, the date of the [[Salem witch trials]]. Tommy and Austin reason that in their attempt to punish a witch, the Salem authorities instead transformed an innocent woman into a witch who now wants revenge. Tommy offers himself to the corpse as a sacrifice, hoping that she will spare Austin. Tommy’s ankles and wrists shatter, mimicking the wounds on the corpse. Tommy forces his son to kill him to end his misery, Austin reluctantly stabs his father in the chest with a knife. Believing he hears the sheriff outside, Austin tries to flee but realizes the voice is another hallucination. Startled by a vision of Tommy's corpse, Austin trips over the railing and falls to his death.  The police arrive the next morning and are again confused by another inexplicable crime scene. The corpse, showing no signs of an autopsy, is taken to another county. During the ambulance ride, the radio begins to play "Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In)", the camera moves across her body settling on her feet, her big toe twitches.

Azhar (film)
  The movie begins with Indian cricketer [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] ([[Emraan Hashmi]]) scoring a century in his 99th test match, but he soon faces allegations of [[Betting controversies in cricket|match-fixing]] as his name has been linked with a [[London, England|London]] based bookie M.K. Sharma aka Shaun ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]). The Indian cricket board slaps a life-ban on him. Azhar decides to challenge the ban in court with the help of his lawyer friend Reddy ([[Kunaal Roy Kapur|Kunaal Roy Kapoor]]).  The story shifts to 1963, when Azhar was born to a middle-class family in [[Hyderabad]]. His grandfather ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) dreamed of Azhar playing 100 tests for Team India and motivates a soft-spoken young Azhar to answer his rivals with his batting skills. Young Azhar goes for an Indian team selection match to Mumbai, where on the match day he receives the bad news of his grandfather's death. Nonetheless, he participates in the match, in accordance with his grandfather's last wish.  Azhar impresses the selectors, sealing his place in Team India and he soon becomes a national hero by scoring 3 consecutive centuries in his first 3 Test innings. Azhar soon marries Naureen ([[Prachi Desai]]) and they both begin a happy married life. After a loss against Pakistan in 1991, the President of Cricket Broad calls Azhar for a one-to-one meeting. Azhar initially fears getting dropped from the team, but is surprised when he is offered the position of team Captain. Some senior players like Manoj, Ravi and Navjot, resent Azhar's appointment as Captain, not wishing to take orders from a younger and less experienced player. But Kapil ([[Varun Badola]]) supports and encourages him to focus on his duty.  While playing in an [[India–Pakistan cricket rivalry|India–Pakistan match]], [[Javed Miandad|Javed]] taunts Azhar, telling Azhar his Muslim heritage would be a better fit for the Pakistan team. Azhar leads his team to victory and soon becomes a successful Captain. At the peak of his career, Azhar's personal life takes a twist when he meets a former [[Femina Miss India|Miss India]], Bollywood actress [[Sangeeta Bijlani|Sangeeta]] ([[Nargis Fakhri]]) during an ad film shoot and instantaneously falls in love with her. Sangeeta cautions him that he is already married and to stay away from her, but Azhar is infatuated by her beauty and does not listen to her advice. They both begin dating but keep their relationship hidden, until it is exposed by a gossip magazine.  Azhar publicly announces his affair with Sangeeta. Heartbroken, Naureen asks him for a divorce and soon Azhar leaves her to marry Sangeeta. During a cricket match against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], Azhar gets in a spat with Manoj for a slow run rate in order to complete his century, letting the team lose. Manoj is dropped from the next match and Azhar leads the team to victory. Manoj is humiliated and vows to take revenge. In later years of his career, Azhar, famous for his expensive lifestyle, comes into the eyes of match-fixers. He is soon approached by a London-based bookie M.K Sharma, disguised as a diamond merchant, who later offers him 1 crore rupees to under play in a match against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], which Azhar hesitantly accepts.  In a parallel story, after the match-fixing scandal, Azhar is now facing nationwide criticism and a London-based prosecutor, Meera ([[Lara Dutta]]), is building up a strong case against him on the basis of sting operations done by Manoj on Ravi, Navjot and several other cricketers. She also uses the report of the inquiry commission set up by the Cricket Board and secretly meets the bookie M. K. Sharma to gather more evidence. Meera also approaches Naureen, asking her to serve as a witness, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Azhar and his lawyer Reddy are struggling to find any proof of innocence as none of his fellow cricketers are ready to help him out.  Azhar attends a gym-opening ceremony to gain back his old fame in public, but is left insulted by the owner himself. After a long, eight-year legal fight, Reddy finally makes a breakthrough by proving in court that the inquiry commission report is biased, as they were paid by Cricket Board itself. Reddy even challenges the authenticity of sting operation tapes as none of the witness was under oath and hence can not be treated as truth. Later, Azhar also reveals that he took 1 crore rupees from the bookie to keep him away from other team members but later scored a match winning innings and returned all the money to the bookie.  On the final day of judgement, both Naureen and Sangeeta attend the court hearing, showing their support for Azhar. Kapil also states in a television interview that he believes Azhar is innocent. In its final verdict, the court lifts the India cricket board ban imposed on Azhar.

Bad Cat
     The film starts in a bathroom, where Šero the cat is smoking and using the toilet, stalling his owner, Tonguc. Šero eventually finishes and heads outside to meet his friends, Rifiki the seagull and Riza the rat, who are preparing for a grand barbecue that night. The two are driven away by Tonguç's violin playing, as Šero scolds him for it. He is then greeted by his friend Cemil, who informs him on a beautiful Siamese cat nearby that he has to see.  Šero and Cemil find the cat, named Pirta, who is playing with her owner, Çizer. When Çizer leaves for work, Šero and Cecil sneak into the house. When Šero tries to seduce the Pirta, however, she goes into a panic attack and ends up dying. Çizer then returns home and sees that Pirta has died. He finds Šero and Cemil still in his house and attacks them. Cemil is killed, angering Šero, who gets into a fight with Çizer that results in the two falling out the building. Çizer lands on the pavement hard, blowing his brain out, while Šero safely lands on his feet (as he is a cat) and walks away from the now-dead Çizer, whose face is frozen in a horrified glance.  Rifiki and Riza arrive home shortly before Šero, who meets an old man named Semistan upon approaching his apartment. Semistan has a surprise for Šero: a cat named Tacetin who claims he is Šero's son. Šero does not care about Tacetin, and insults him by calling him human. Šero leaves an enraged Tacetin, steals some fish from Tonguç's grandmother, and meets up with Rifiki and Riza and informs them of Cemil's death, while frying the fish. He finds out that they didn't get drinks and storms inside, after which Tacetin climbs onto the balcony, and Rifiki and Riza notice his resemblance to Šero.   Inside, Šero accidentally drinks water, and finds out that Tonguç has drunk all the booze. The two get into an argument, after which Tonguç puts his foot down and kicks Šero out of the apartment, calling him a " bastard ". He announces that the two are moving, to different houses each, and goes inside, blocking every possible entrance from Šero, and throwing out some photos, including a picture seen earlier of Tonguç and a baby Šero with booze.   While smoking and sulking, Šero witnesses a beautiful Anagora cat being chased by some mean dogs. He races to the rescue and beats up the dogs.   At the same time, an ambulance is shown having picked up Çizer's dead body, and they try to revive him. Çizer has a vision where he sees his beloved Pirta one final time, before being eaten by a giant Šhero. Çizer ends up being shocked back to life by the vision, and he takes over the ambulance and drives offscreen, preparing revenge on Šero.   The latter is shown finishing off one of the dogs, much to the Anagora cat's, whose name is Misket, relief. Šero tries to make love with her, but she turns him down, demanding a date first. Her owner calls out to her. Misket says that it's dinner time. Šero tries to move in on her one more time, and she kicks him in the privates and tells him to meet her that night at that exact spot before kissing him and leaving. Šero is overjoyed by the kiss, and is flooded with emotion, as vengeful Çizer is shown driving the ambulance through town again, searching for Šero.   Back at Semistan's shop, Šero asks him for a present he can give to Misket. Semistan tells him to find a store where he can but flowers. Meanwhile, Tacetin digs around in a dumpster for food, attracting a young couple who take a picture of him and try to feed him, but Tacetin is instead attracted to the two dogs from earlier, who are grumbling about how Šero beat them both up. Tacetin follows them, and is almost run over by Çizer, who mistakes him for Šero. Tacetin escapes, and Çizer forces the dogs to help him find and kill Šero.   Šero finds a store with turkeys hanging in the window with flowers up their butts. He breaks in and steals all of the flowers. Later reaching the meeting area, he is quickly met and overwhelmed by Misket. Unfortunately, before they can make love, Šero is knocked out by an unseen person. He later comes to, tied up next to Misket, as the two are confronted by Çizer, who immediately abandons the dogs and tries to electrocute the cats. Luckily, Tacetin comes to the rescue. He frees Šero, who then fights Çizer and throws him off the building and into a dumpster, along with the dogs.   Just like last time, Šero doesn't give Tacetin a second glance, instead trying to get back to Misket. Tacetin says he used to have a mom named Mimosa, whom Šero can't seem to remember, but tells Tacetin to leave him alone and go back to her. Tacetin angrily reveals that his mom was killed via getting hit by a car, and storms off.   Meanwhile, a garbage truck arrives at the bottom of the building, and two men load a dumpster in it, not noticing Çizer is still in it. As the truck drives away, Çizer is almost crushed inside, but he grabs one of the men, pulls him inside the truck, and escapes.  Then, Tonguç is shown packing his things, despite Šero yelling at him from outside. Misket scolds Šero for not listening to Tacetin, who suddenly appears and punches Šero. The two are about to start a fight, but then Šero decides to use Tacetin to get some beer for dinner.  Šero lowers Tacetin down to Semistan's shop in a basket so he can get some beer. Just as the mission is complete, Çizer drives by in the garbage truck, which he hijacked, and kidnaps Tacetin. As the two struggle in a fight, Šero chases after the garbage truck. Šero jumps onto a motorcycle and forces the driver to chase after Çizer. Šero successfully leaps on to the garbage truck, only for it to plunge into the sea, but not before Šero helps Tacetin to safety.  After a long underwater fight between Šero and Çizer, whom the feline presumably kills once more by shoving a beer bottle down his throat, Šero climbs to land, much to Tacetin's joy. The two get a ride home by the same motorcycle man again, who drops them off at Semistan's shop. Šero then discovers that his apartment is being blocked off by barbed wire. Šero looks for Misket, but can't find her anywhere.  Back at the docks, a rescue team lifts Çizer's dead body out of the ocean using a crane. Unfortunately, the crane accidentally rams Çizer's body into some electrical wires, bringing him back to life yet again, and still wanting his revenge.  Later, while Šero is sitting on a rooftop, Rifiki and Rita fly by him and fly towards a restaurant in a tower. Riza sneaks inside to get some wine. When he gets it, he whistles for Rifiki, but he is busy catching up with another seagull. The chef catches Riza and tries to kill him with a broom, but Riza manages to escape, albeit the wine is destroyed. Riza yells at Rifiki for abandoning him and ends their partnership.  Šero and Tacetin wait for the two, and they finally return and explain the mishap to an angry Šero, who yells at them and then leaves them. Everyone sits on their own side of the roof, until Riza remembers how humans get what they want with money. He tells everyone this and they decide to go to the bank and steal money.  Riza sneaks into the bank through the sewers to opens the doors for Šero and Tacetin, and Rifiki keeps watch. Across the street, Çizer is shown being arrested, having gone insane. Inside the bank, a security guard uses the washroom and leaves just as Riza comes out of the toilet. While searching the bank, Riza runs into the security guard, who freaks out upon seeing the mouse and ends up knocking himself unconscious. Rita steals his keys and opens the bank doors. The trio walk through the bank and finds the vault where the money is. Tacetin gets the code right (1,2,3,4 ), and the vault opens, revealing the money.   Security footage catches the robbery, which is then broadcast over police car radios. Çizer overhears the mention of 2 cats on the scene and immediately breaks free of his handcuffs and strangles the policemen so he can go to the bank. Šero and Tacetin quickly load up on money and head for the door, but Rifiki informs them of incoming cops. Rifiki flew for the toilet so he can escape. Since Šero and Tacetin are too big for the toilet, they decide to exit through the side window, where Çizer arrives in the police car and sees them.  Šero and Tacetin hide behind a building. Riza rises from a pothole and orders the cats to get to the roof of the bank, where they can escape. Çizer kills the cops so he can kill Šero himself, but one of the cops survives and shoots Riza. Rifiki sees this and rescues Riza, and is shot in the wing by the cop before landing on a rooftop. Meanwhile, Šero and Tacetin make it to the roof and search for a way out. They try to go back the way they came, but their exit is blocked by Çizer, who now has a gun and tries to shoot Šero and Tacetin. They hide behind an object, and when Çizer tries to catch them, they are not there. He looks over the edge of the roof, which is where the felines are hiding. Šero swings up and grabs Çizer's leg, causing him to fall and land on the roof of a car, shooting one bullet into the air. The bullet flys at Šero, but Tacetin leaps in the way and is shot instead.   Šero catches his son before he falls. Çizer passes out, and the police order the cats to leave the roof. Šero tries to get Tacetin to show signs of life, and is heartbroken when there is no response. Realizing that the money caused all this, Šero angrily gives it all back to the bank by throwing it off the roof, and it is eagerly collected by passerby. Šero walks through it all, carrying a presumably dead Tacetin.  Tonguç is then shown angrily driving down the road, and suddenly stops in front of an unfazed Šero, who explains what happened to Tacetin. Tonguç tries to help, but the vet is closed, so Šero and Tonguç bring Tacetin back to their old apartment, where Rifiki and a healed Riza meet them. Misket watches the whole thing from another rooftop, but is scared by an unseen person that sneaks up on her.  Tonguç and Šero try to revive Tacetin, but it's no use. Šero goes crazy and slams his fist on Taceti's stomach, miraculously bringing him back to life, much to everyone's joy. Tonguç's grandmother then enters and takes Šero's last bit of money from the bank. She uses it to pay off everyone for Tonguç and asks what they should do with the last dollar.  The gang ends up having the huge barbecue they were awaiting since the beginning of the movie. Everyone comes, from Tacetin to Tonguç's grandmother. Šero, however, is sad that Misket could not make it. Suddenly, a platform rises in front of everyone Misket tied to Semistan's cylinders. Çizer, of course, is revealed to have been responsible, and threatens to blow up the cylinders, which would kill everyone, including himself.   Having had enough with Çizer, Šero lunges at him and attacks him, brutally beating him up. Tonguç joins in, resulting in an epic beatdown during which Šero and Tonguç punch Çizer in the face back and forth to each other, ending with Tonguç grabbing Çizer by the neck, smashing him on the ground, spinning him around, and throwing him off the building. Çizer lands in a dumpster for the second time, and while climbing out, is crushed to death by Semistan's cylinders, which Tonguç and Šero dump on him. Finally, Šero smokes a cigarette and flicks it in the dumpster, causing it to explode, creating a massive fireworks show, and finally killing Çizer, ending his insane reign of terror.  Šero and Misket watch the fireworks, and then confess their love for each other. They then have sex, and end up bouncing across the world as the credits roll.

Bad Moms
 Amy Mitchell ([[Mila Kunis]]) is a married woman in the [[Chicago]] [[suburbs]] with two children, Jane ([[Oona Laurence]]) and Dylan ([[Emjay Anthony]]), who feels overworked and overcommitted. She works as a sales rep for a "hip" coffee company, prepares healthful, hand-packed lunches for her children, does most of their homework, goes to all of their extracurricular activities, and is active in her school's [[Parent-Teacher Association#PTA|PTA]], run by the domineering Gwendolyn James ([[Christina Applegate]]) and her cronies, Stacy ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]) and Vicky ([[Annie Mumolo]]). When she catches her husband Mike ([[David Walton (actor)|David Walton]]) cheating on her with a [[camgirl]], Amy kicks him out and attempts to keep everything together.  After a particularly stressful day, Amy publicly quits the PTA in response to Gwendolyn's overzealous bake sale plans. At a nearby bar, Amy meets Carla ([[Kathryn Hahn]]), a laid-back, sexually active single mom, and Kiki ([[Kristen Bell]]), a stay-at-home mom of four who adores Amy's dissent from Gwendolyn. Amy and Carla are irritated to discover that Kiki's husband is domineering and expects her to take care of all the kids and the house with no assistance whatsoever, while Amy and Kiki are disturbed at Carla's very hands-off approach to parenting. The trio embark on an all-night bender that inspires Amy to loosen up with her kids: she takes them for rides in Mike's classic car, gets them lunch from [[Arby's]], forces Dylan to fend for himself to prevent him from being lazy and entitled, and takes the overachieving and constantly stressed Jane for a spa day. Amy herself decides to start dating but finds herself inexperienced due to her early marriage and motherhood. She ultimately ends up striking a connection with Jessie ([[Jay Hernandez]]), a handsome widower at the school who's had a crush on her.  After Amy brings store-bought donut holes to the bake sale, she draws the ire of Gwendolyn, who uses her PTA authority to get Jane benched from the soccer team. Amy is angered, and decides to run for PTA president in opposition to Gwendolyn. A meet-and-greet at Amy's home draws only one visitor, who informs them that Gwendolyn has launched a rival party at her own house, catered by [[Martha Stewart]]. In spite of this, the other moms, and Martha, swiftly abandon Gwendolyn's party when it becomes clear that she intends to lecture them all evening, leading to a successful party at Amy's house.  Gwendolyn responds by putting drugs in Jane's locker, which gets her kicked out of all extracurricular activities. Jane and Dylan both go to stay with Mike (who has agreed to an amicable divorce) in response to what they see as Amy's failure as a mom. Amy loses her job because her boss refuses to understand her reasons for taking time off.  A despondent Amy stays home during the PTA election but is roused into action by Carla and Kiki, who finally stands up to her husband and orders him to deal with everything alone until the meeting is over. At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how all the moms are overworked and that they need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. Amy wins by a landslide and eventually winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals that her life is not perfect like she claims it is and that being in charge of the PTA was her only way to take her anger out on the problems she is facing.  Some weeks later, Amy's approach has led to positive changes: Jane has been reinstated to the soccer team and is stressing out less, Dylan is actually applying himself, Kiki makes her husband help out with taking care of their kids, Carla is more responsible and hands-on, and all of the other moms, including Stacy and Vicky, are feeling more energized. Amy herself has gotten her job back with much better compensation after her boss sees how much he had taken her for granted, and she continues to see Jessie. Gwendolyn invites Amy, Carla, and Kiki for a day of fun on her husband's private jet.  The ending credits play over the cast interviewing their real-life moms.

The following morning, Barry and Charlotte are walking in Harlem when Barry begins to feels uncomfortable as people are surprised to see him with a white woman.  At lunch this anxious feeling continues as Barry explains to Charlotte that everybody is looking at him. They have an argument which ends with Charlotte saying to Barry that she loves him. Barry, surprised, only responds "thank you", then leaves to go play basketball.  The following day, Barry is invited by PJ and the people in his basketball group to attend a party in Harlem.

As Barry leaves the party drunk, he returns to campus only to be racially profiled by security guard Eddie ([[Danny Hoch]]) and asked to show his ID to confirm he's a student. Barry begins to get into an angry argument with Eddie, but Thad (Sawyer Pierce), a white classmate from his political science class who is openly holding a beer can, intervenes. Frustrated by Thad's personality and his lack of acknowledgement of the double-standards around him, Barry calls Thad an asshole and then goes to Charlotte's apartment where he attempts to hook-up with her. Charlotte refuses when she sees the wound on his face and tries to comfort him. While sitting on her bed looking at pictures she took of him, Barry gets in a fight with Charlotte and questions their relationship until Charlotte goes to sleep and leaves him alone.  A few days later on the day of Charlotte's sister's wedding, Barry receives a phone call. He learns that his father has died in a car accident (1982).

At the wedding, Charlotte's mother introduces Barry to [[Grace Lee Boggs]] (Marion Kodama Yue) and [[James Boggs (activist)|James Boggs]] (Robert G. McKay), a mixed race couple in their late 50s who were involved as civil rights activists in the '60s. Barry confides in them about his inner turmoil and the confusion he has about his identity. The couple reassures him that, above all else, he is American and he is not obligated to choose a social standing. They tell him that he should take inspiration from the ones who came before him and to carry the baton of hope as far as he can. Finally, Barry receives advice that begins to comfort him and he starts to find peace within himself. Later at the wedding, while they're dancing, it is assumed Barry breaks up with Charlotte as he simply leaves her on the dance floor; he then enjoys a cigarette outside and reads the letter he was going to send to his father as he was finally trying to contact him. A few days later, Barry is playing basketball where he meets a young boy  who looks like him, and together they play HORSE. The boy asks him where he is from, a question Barry has always struggled to answer. Much more at ease with himself, Barry answers the question by saying, "I'm here now."

  Eighteen months after the battle between [[Superman]] and [[General Zod]] in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Superman has become a controversial figure. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated in [[Gotham City]] as the vigilante [[Batman]] for twenty years, sees Superman as an extraterrestrial threat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of justice, [[Clark Kent]] (Superman's civilian identity) seeks to expose him via ''[[Daily Planet]]'' articles. Wayne learns that Russian weapon trafficker [[KGBeast|Anatoli Knyazev]] has been contacting [[LexCorp]] mogul [[Lex Luthor]]. Meanwhile, Luthor unsuccessfully tries to persuade Senator June Finch to allow him to import [[kryptonite]] retrieved from the [[Indian Ocean]] following Zod's [[terraforming]] attempt, claiming he wants to maintain it as a "deterrent" against future Kryptonian and [[metahuman]] threats. He instead makes alternative plans with Finch's subordinate and gains access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship.  Bruce attends a gala at LexCorp to steal encrypted data from the company's mainframe, but has it taken from him by an antiquities dealer named [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince]]; she eventually returns it to Bruce when she is unable to access the information. While decrypting the drive, Bruce dreams of a post-apocalyptic world where he leads a group of rebels against an evil Superman. He is awakened from his dream by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who warns him of [[Lois Lane]]'s crucial role in the future, and urges him to find "the others" before vanishing.</ref>}} Upon fully decrypting the drive, Wayne discovers Luthor's files on several metahuman individuals across the globe. One of them is Prince herself, who is shown in a photo taken during [[World War I]]. Wayne admits to [[Alfred Pennyworth]] that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.  At a Congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb smuggled by Luthor goes off and kills everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite. In preparation to battle Superma, he builds a [[powered exoskeleton]], creates a kryptonite [[grenade launcher]], and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and accesses a vast technology database accumulated from over 100,000 worlds.  To bring Superman out of exile, Luthor kidnaps Lois and [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]], Clark's adoptive mother. He reveals to him that he manipulated Superman and Batman by fueling their distrust for each other. Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman attacks Superman and eventually subdues him with the aid of a kryptonite gas. Before Batman can kill Superman with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "save Martha", whose name is also shared with Bruce's [[Martha Wayne|late mother]] and whose own father echoed a similar sentiment before dying. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.  Luthor executes his backup plan, unleashing a genetically engineered monster with DNA from both Zod's body and his own blood.</ref> actor [[Robin Atkin Downes]] has identified the character as [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].<ref name="Downes"></ref>}} Diana Prince arrives unexpectedly; revealing her metahuman nature, she joins forces with Batman and Superman to eliminate the creature. When they are all outmatched, Superman realizes its vulnerability to kryptonite, and retrieves the spear to kill it. In the creature's last moments, it fatally wounds Superman.  Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, with various friends and family members including Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince attending his funeral in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. Martha gives an envelope to Lois, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Bruce expresses his regrets to Diana about how he failed Superman. He reveals to her that he plans to form a team of metahumans, starting with those from Luthor's files, to help protect the world in Superman's absence. After they leave, the dirt atop Clark's coffin levitates.  
Bastille Day (film)
  On the eve of [[Bastille Day]] in [[Paris]], American drifter and pickpocket Michael Mason steals a woman's handbag, not knowing that it contains explosives. After he drops the bag off, it detonates and kills four people. Upon being captured by [[CIA]] agent Sean Briar, who is being reprimanded for irresponsible conduct on the job, Mason protests that he is not a terrorist, and tells Briar that the bag contained a cell-phone owned by a woman named Zoe. The bomb was set up by a group of corrupt policemen led by Rafi Bernard, all of them members in the French special force RAPID who intend to pull a robbery at the [[Banque de France|French National Bank]]. Zoe was told to plant the bomb at the office of the French Nationalist Party (as part of a diversion for the heist), but after seeing the night cleaning crew arrive, she was unwilling to kill innocents and so abandoned the plan. Zoe's boyfriend Jean, one of the conspirators, allows her to escape, realizing that his compatriots will kill her.  The group [[GPS tracking unit|tracks Zoe's phone]] to Briar's and Mason's location. Briar engages the conspirators, who subdue him, while Mason escapes. Rafi's team proceeds to plant fake evidence at a mosque and stir up a nationwide uproar among its Islamic population, using agitating hashtags on the Internet. Chased by the French authorities and Rafi's forces, Mason is picked up by Briar, who has come to believe his story and intends to clear the case with his help, even against the orders of his superiors. They track Zoe to the hideout of her friend Paul and his motorcycle gang, but the gang fires their car to cover their escape. Appropriating another car, they track Paul down to the bar where he works, and Mason instigates a brawl, during which he steals Paul's ID card.  Mason and Briar use the card to find out Paul's address, where Zoe is hiding, and manage to gain her cooperation. Zoe leads them to Jean's apartment, where they find his body and an ID and badge identifying him as a police officer. Briar informs his colleague, Karen Dacre, who confers with her French contact, [[General Directorate for Internal Security|DGSI]] Director Victor Gamieux, about taking Mason and Zoe into protective custody. However, Gamieux, actually the mastermind of the heist conspiracy, kills Dacre after obtaining the information he needs and sends a pickup team consisting of his henchmen. Briar, Mason and Zoe manage to pick up clues about the men's true allegiance and fight their way out of the deathtrap. Now realizing Gamieux's hand in the game, the three head toward the French National Bank.  When a crowd of protestors masses at the front of the bank—as the conspirators have intended—Gamieux assigns Rafi's RAPID team to the building to provide interior security, thus facilitating the digital robbery of its entire monetary reserves (half a billion [[euro]]s). Upon arriving at the bank, Briar disguises himself as a RAPID officer and manages to gain access to the building before he is found out. Hearing of his predicament over their stolen police van's radio, Zoe and Mason start a riot among the protestors, who storm the bank and overpower the RAPID troopers closing in on Briar. Briar subsequently infiltrates the vault and engages Rafi and his remaining henchman. Rafi escapes with the USB flash drive on which the money has been downloaded, but Briar contacts Mason, who steals the flash drive from Rafi. Upon noticing the theft, Rafi takes Zoe hostage. Gamieux, trying to salvage his plan, commands a squad of policemen to shoot and kill Rafi, and Mason escapes with the flash drive.  Some time later, Mason, working with Briar and French law enforcement, meets with Gamieux on the pretense of trading the flash drive for a passport and a ride out of the country, leading to the latter's arrest. The charges against Mason are dropped, and he is offered a job with the CIA.  
Batman: The Killing Joke (film)
 While out on patrol, [[Batgirl]] ([[Barbara Gordon]]) fails to stop a robbery, but manages to stop one criminal with help from [[Batman]]. Paris Franz, the robbers' leader and the nephew of a powerful mob boss, develops a dangerous obsession with her and starts sending her messages. After Franz tricks her into finding his uncle's dead body, Batman becomes concerned about her safety and takes her off the case, telling her that she will eventually be tempted to kill the criminals she pursues. Outraged, Batgirl attacks Batman physically and verbally, which leads to the both of them having [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. A few nights later, Batgirl tries to apologize to Batman, but he is ambushed by Franz and his men, prompting her to come to his aid. When she arrives and overpowers Franz, he makes her lose control and give him a savage beating, stopping just short of killing him. Realizing Batman was right, she retires from crime-fighting.  Later, Batman investigates a murder scene with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Harvey Bullock]] and concludes that [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], currently held at [[Arkham Asylum]], might be behind the crime. He goes to Arkham to talk to him, only to discover that he has escaped and put a decoy in his place. Joker then attacks Barbara and her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]. He shoots her in the stomach, paralyzing her from the waist down, and takes Gordon to an abandoned amusement park. There, Joker strips him naked and subjects him to torture, including showing him photos he took of Barbara, naked and in pain.  The story is intercut with flashbacks of Joker's origin. It is revealed that he was once a lab technician who quit his job to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to help two criminals rob his former workplace. The criminals tell him that he has to use the [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]]'s mask and caped costume, secretly intending to frame him. During the planning, the police inform him that Jeannie and their unborn child have died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, he tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.  At the plant, the criminals and the costumed comedian run into security personnel, and a shootout occurs. The criminals are gunned down and the comedian is confronted by Batman. Terrified, the comedian trips and falls into the chemical plant's waste pond, and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. As he removes his mask, he sees the chemicals have permanently disfigured his face, giving him a clown-like appearance. His disfigurement, combined with the loss of his family, drives him insane and transforms him into the Joker.  In the present, Batman finds and saves Gordon, while the Joker flees. Despite his ordeal, Gordon remains sane and demands that Batman capture the Joker "by the book". Batman follows the Joker as the latter tries to persuade him that the world is just one big joke, and that "one bad day" is enough to drive an ordinary man insane. Batman subdues Joker, tells him that Gordon has remained sane, and concludes that Joker is alone in his madness. He then attempts to reach out to him, offering rehabilitation. Joker declines, saying it is too late. He then says that the situation reminds him of a joke about two patients in an insane asylum who try to escape by leaping over to the adjoining building. The first patient makes it across, but the second patient is too afraid. The first patient says, "Hey, I got this flashlight with me. I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings and you can walk across the beam and join me." But the second patient says, "What do you think I am, crazy? You'll just turn it off when I'm halfway across!" Batman and Joker then have a good laugh at the joke as the police arrive. The Joker's laugh trails off while Batman continues to laugh, leaving the ending as ambiguous as the comic.  In a mid-credits scene, Barbara is in her wheelchair entering a secret room in her apartment. She says "back to work" as she turns on her computers and [[Oracle (DC Comics)|Oracle]]'s logo appears on the screen.  
Batman: Bad Blood
 [[Batwoman]] intercepts a group of criminals in [[Gotham City]] that includes [[Electrocutioner]], Tusk, [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], [[Killer Moth]], and others. When a fight ensues, [[Batman]] arrives. They are confronted by the apparent leader of the criminals, a man called the Heretic, who detonates explosives planted within the facility. Batman flings Batwoman to safety and apparently perishes in the explosion.  Two weeks later, a concerned [[Alfred Pennyworth]] sends a distress signal to [[Dick Grayson#Nightwing|Nightwing]]. Meanwhile, [[Damian Wayne]] watches a news report of Batman's disappearance and sets out to return to Gotham. Batwoman's civilian alter-ego, Katherine Kane, meets with her father Jacob, explaining she feels responsible for Batman's apparent death. In the past, Katherine was traumatized by an incident in which her sister Elizabeth and mother Gabrielle were abducted, held for ransom, and eventually killed by their captors, while she was the sole survivor. After her time in the military, she became a promiscuous drunkard who was saved by Batman from street thugs, which motivated her to never need to be saved again, resulting in her becoming Batwoman.  Batman apparently resurfaces and is quickly noticed by Robin and Katherine. Both of them intercept Batman and quickly deduce that it is Nightwing wearing an old version of the Batsuit. They begin their own investigations into the Heretic, unconvinced that Bruce is truly dead. The Heretic and his henchmen attack Wayne Enterprises, forcing [[Lucius Fox]] to open the way into the vault by threatening his son [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Luke]]. Though Nightwing and Damian arrive, they are unable to prevent the Heretic from escaping with Wayne technology, and Lucius is injured. Before they leave, the Heretic kills Electrocutioner when the latter is about to kill Robin.   The Heretic returns to his headquarters, where it is revealed that he is working for [[Talia al Ghul]]. They are holding Bruce prisoner and the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]] is causing him to hallucinate. The Heretic then breaks into the Batcave and kidnaps Damian. He explains that he is a clone of Damian, created by a genetics program run by [[Ra's al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]]. They used Damian's DNA to genetically engineer a perfect soldier with accelerated growth and development, but he was the only subject of the program to survive. He wishes to have Damian's memories and personality implanted within his own brain, but Talia arrives and kills the Heretic. Nightwing and Batwoman then arrive, having located Damian through a tracker in his costume. They are quickly joined by Luke, clad in an advanced combat exosuit and styling himself as Batwing. The three rescue Bruce and Damian, but Talia and her henchmen escape.   A week passes and Bruce seems to have recovered, though he remains adamant that Katherine and Luke not be involved. After Katherine is forced to fight her father after he suddenly attacks her, Dick learns from this that Bruce is still under the effects of the Mad Hatter's mind control. Luke realizes that the League of Assassins are planning to brainwash a number of world leaders at a tech summit held by Bruce. As the brainwashing takes place, Nightwing, Robin, Batwoman, Alfred, and Batwing arrive and fight Talia and her henchmen. During the fight, the Mad Hatter is killed, interrupting the mind control. Bruce, still brainwashed, defeats Nightwing. Talia then orders him to kill Nightwing and Damian, but Bruce resists the brainwashing. Incensed, Talia escapes in a vessel, only for [[Onyx (comics)|Onyx]], a subordinate of the Heretic, to confront and attack her to avenge the Heretic's death. The vessel subsequently crashes and explodes, implying their deaths. Bruce is later seen comforting Damian over Talia's supposed death. Alfred remarks to Dick that despite Talia's madness, she was still Damian's mother.  As the [[Bat-Signal]] shines in Gotham City, Batwoman, Nightwing, and Batwing meet Batman and Robin on top of the police station to respond to a crime committed by the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. On a nearby building, [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] observes the group and prepares to join the pursuit.  
Bastu-Shaap
 Kushal ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]) and Timir ([[Kaushik Ganguly]]) are [[Vastu shastra|Vaastu Shastra]] experts who are hired by Arjun ([[Abir Chatterjee]]) to examine the Vaastu of his Bungalow in Darjeeling. Kushal is instructed to masquerade as Arjun's school friend and Timir as Kushal's business partner, and are brought in to Arjun's Bungalow for the project under the pretext of a chance reunion between Arjun and Kushal. Arjun introduces them to his older sister Antara ([[Churni Ganguly]]) and his wife Bonya ([[Raima Sen]]), who seemingly recognizes Kushal.  It becomes apparent that the household is in a disarray. Years earlier, Arjun and his family met with a car accident, due to which Arjun has suffered a permanent injury to his leg, and Antara has lost her husband and her only child. Upon Arjun's recovery, he moved to Darjeeling, but the family is unable to recuperate from their losses. Arjun and Bonya become distant while Antara obsesses over Bonya's son as a coping mechanism for losing her own, which creates tension between Bonya and Antara. Timir and Kushal get to work on their Vaastu Shastra modifications to the Bungalow.  It is also revealed in interleaved flashbacks that Kushal and Bonya had met earlier after Bonya's family accident at the same hospital, where Arjun and Kushal's wife were admitted. Kushal and Bonya developed a slow friendship, and he gave her a crystal ball, asking her to put it beside Arjun's bed in hopes of speeding his recovery. One day Bonya visits Kushal's house and she sees a painting of Kushal's palm painted by Kushal's wife, dubbed ''The Lotus''. Arjun recovers from his coma soon after, but Kushal's wife dies the same day. Kushal leaves for his wife's cremation while Bonya unable to find him moves on with Arjun.  Kushal sees ''The Lotus'' hanging on Bonya's bedroom wall. Bonya is distraught with Arjun no longer being attracted to her, and the two express their love for each other momentarily. Bonya asks Kushal to do everything in his power to restore Arjun back to her. The very next day Arjun challenges Kushal to a duel, with Timir serving as Kushal's champion. After reaching a stalemate, Arjun decides to settle the duel on a suddent death -- Bonya would volunteer with a bottle on her head as the target for the shooters. Timir, realizing Kushal's love and fear for Bonya's safety deliberately loses the duel. Later that night Arjun rudely asks Kushal and Timir to leave his Bungalow the next morning after collecting their fees.  Kushal agrees to leave, but instead of money he says he wants to take away with him their Bastu-Shaap -- a snake or a curse that lives in a household and yet is not killed or warded off despite being a potential danger to everyone in the house, since everyone gets used to it. He says this is the least he can do for the family before he departs without completing his project. He asks to take with him ''The Lotus'', which Arjun confesses to have never liked, although Bonya always refused to give it away. He privately also asks Antara to leave Arjun and Bonya alone in their house and come with him to an NGO to take care of orphan children -- a place that would fulfil her need to be a motherly figure while leaving Arjun and Bonya to resume a normal family.  Next morning, Antara is nowhere to be found and Arjun departs to search for her. Kushal bids farewell to Bonya who asks him to take his old crystal ball and bring it to her father who is very sick, believing that it will miraculously save him, just like it saved Arjun in the past. Driving out of the Bungalow Kushal and Timir meet Arjun, who confesses that he heard Bonya and Arjun professing their love for each other, when Bonya accidentally dropped her phone and it dialed his number. He says that hearing them, made him jealous and realize how much he loved and was possessive about Bonya and hence the duel and him throwing Kushal and Timir out rudely earlier. Later down the road they meet Antara, who was waiting for them to arrive. She gets in their car, and asks if the scarf she was knitting earlier would fit anyone in the orphanage. Kushal smiles and realizes that Antara has agreed to move out of Arjun and Bonya's household, and move on with her life. The three drive away and fade into the hilly fog of Darjeeling having effectively solved all of Arjun and Bonya's household problems.  
Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders
  At stately [[Wayne Manor]], [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] and his ward [[Dick Grayson]] watch their favorite show, ''Gotham Palace''. During the programming, a band that was supposed to play on the show is revealed to be hidden and replaced by four of the Dynamic Duo's greatest villains; [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]], [[Riddler|the Riddler]], and [[Catwoman]]. Bruce and Dick suit up as Batman and Robin and head towards the Gotham City Police Department, where they receive a riddle from [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] and [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Chief O.27Hara|Chief O'Hara]].  They discover that the crooks are robbing the Acme Atomic Energy Laboratory of the Replication Ray that was invented by Dr. Nichols. The Replication Ray has the power to make a perfect duplicate out of anything. After a brief fight, the criminals manage to escape Batman, but leave behind a clue that leads the caped crusaders to their lair in an abandoned TV dinner factory. While discussing what to do with the Replication Ray, Catwoman reveals her plan to make Batman join their side with a scratch from a substance called "Batnip". After Batman and Robin break in, they are defeated by the criminals and trapped on a frozen food tray heading towards a large oven. Catwoman uses her Batnip on Batman, but he is supposedly unaffected by it. The two escape the trap after the villains leave the factory.  Back at stately Wayne Manor, Bruce starts showing signs of aggression after Aunt Harriet nearly discovers the Batcave. He blames [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] for the incident and fires him, leaving the butler to wander on the streets homeless. After days of not finding Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman, Batman figures out that the four crooks are no longer on Earth and have hijacked a space station. The two heroes go into space with the help of their Bat-Rocket.  At the space station, Joker, Penguin and Riddler betray Catwoman as they do not trust her to be on their side due to her feelings for Batman. They try to throw her out into space. She is rescued by the Dynamic Duo and aids them in defeating her former allies for revenge. Batman savagely beats the three men and recovers the Replication Ray, but Catwoman escapes in an escape pod in the process.  After the mission, Dick expresses concern towards Bruce for his behavior in the space station and at the Gotham City Police Department (where he left when Gordon was not looking without a word). Bruce kicks Dick out of the house and takes a break from being Batman, resulting in a crime spree in Gotham City.  A few weeks later, Batman returns to the Gotham City Police Department and blames the police for the increase in crime. He uses the Replication Ray on himself to replace Gordon and O'Hara as [[police commissioner]] and [[Chief of police|police chief]] respectively.  Batman soon replaces most of the government, jobs, and citizens in Gotham with his replicas and plans to take over the world. Dick realizes that the Batnip had a delayed effect on Batman and was slowly making him more evil over time. He then suits up as Robin and goes to Catwoman's lair to request her help in curing Batman which she agrees to do as she thinks the effects of the Batnip were more severe than she had planned.  The two take the Catmobile to the Batcave, where Catwoman attempts to give Batman the antidote, but Batman anticipated it and took the Bat Anti-Antidote. Batman defeats the two in a fight and leaves them to die in the Nuclear Reactor, but they survive thanks to Robin's Bat Anti Isotope Spray. Knowing they cannot take on an army of Batmen by themselves, Robin and Catwoman arrange the prison break of most of Batman's rogues gallery from [[Gotham State Penitentiary]]; [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Archer|Archer]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Black Widow|Black Widow]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Bookworm|Bookworm]], [[Clock King]], [[Egghead (DC Comics)|Egghead]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#False Face|False Face]], [[King Tut (comics)|King Tut]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Louie the Lilac|Louie the Lilac]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Minstrel|Minstrel]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Sandman|Sandman]], [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Shame|Shame]] and [[Siren (DC Comics)|Siren]] by claiming to [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#WardenCrichton|Warden Crichton]] that the ball and chains and pickaxes are not in good shape. This resulted in the replaced versions carrying the villains out of the prison. While a [[Prison officer|prison guard]] tells Warden Crichton that Joker, Penguin and Riddler did not escape, the three of them mysteriously turn into a pile of dust.  The two confront Batman and his army on the ''Gotham Palace'' set, but they still lose even with the help of the criminals. Before Batman kills Robin and Catwoman, a disguised Alfred arrives and gives Batman a strong enough antidote to counter the Bat Anti-Antidote. Batman returns to normal, and the rest of his clones turn to dust as the Replication Ray was not strong enough to make perfect clones.  Batman realized that his behavior change was used as a distraction by Joker, Penguin and Riddler, and that the ones they arrested were fake copies. Joker had spiked the Batnip Catwoman was using. The real ones were using the opportunity to rob the Gotham Art Museum. Joker, Penguin and Riddler just wanted to get Batman out of the way first. Batman, Robin, and Catwoman (who came as vengeance for what they did at the space station) chase them to Penguin's blimp, where the villainous trio is defeated after they are knocked off the blimp to a safe location to be arrested. Catwoman tries to escape with the stolen paintings, but Batman recovers them. Unwilling to be put in a cage again, Catwoman allows herself to fall into a smokestack.  Bruce and Dick then throw Aunt Harriet a surprise birthday party acting as if that is the secret they have been hiding from her. During the party, Bruce and Dick are called away by the Bat-Signal.

They decide to download the app, which results in the group getting tormented by Mr. Bedevil and becoming haunted according to their personal fears. They also discover brands on their bodies in the shape of Mr. Bedevil’s app icon and eventually accept that the app is intent on killing them. Trying to destroy their phones will not stop Mr. Bedevil, as their phones will only get restored to their prior state.  The group tries to go to the police with their concerns after the app uploads a sex tape made by Haley and Dan, only for Mr. Bedevil to possess the police, making the application impossible to stop through normal means. As the tension mounts, the app tricks Gavin into coming to Alice's house, where he's murdered by clowns. The remaining friends manage to recover Nikki's phone, through which they discover that Nikki received an invite via Samuel Price, Nikki’s former physics tutor and [[pseudoscience]] enthusiast. Alice and Cody go to Sam's house, where they discover his body as well as audiotapes of Sam's research, which identify Mr. Bedevil as a paranormal presence that uses the app to enter reality in a manner similar to a [[Ouija|Ouija board]]. Meanwhile, Haley and Dan are both murdered by Mr. Bedevil in ways that mimic their own fears.

Alice and Cody set a trap for Mr. Bedevil at a warehouse using two separate computer stations.

Cody answers that his mom is dead, too. That night, the couple see their deceased child and try to hug him. When Cody wakes up, Sean disappears. Upon discovering Cody's gift, Jessie takes advantage of it. She lets Cody watch home videos of Sean and, that night, the couple once again sees their beloved child.

Before it disappears, she whispers to him and asks him to release all the people the creatures have taken. The nightmare turns into a beautiful dream, and all the people taken by "the Canker Man" reappear, though only as dreams themselves. Jessie takes the-still unconscious Cody home.  The following day, Jessie gives Cody the journal his birth mother Andrea had kept, which shows how much she had loved him and his gift. However, she had died of pancreatic cancer when Cody was just three years old. Then she revealed to him that there is more to his recurring nightmares than meets the eye, and Cody begins to learn how to control his gift.  
The Belko Experiment
 Mike Milch ([[John Gallagher Jr.]]), an employee of Belko Industries, arrives at his remote office building in rural [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], to find unfamiliar security guards turning away the local Colombian staff at the gate. New employee Dany Wilkins ([[Melonie Diaz]]) reports for her first day on the job, and is told that a tracking device is implanted in the base of every Belko employee's skull in case they are kidnapped. This is common in Colombia due to the high incidence of kidnapping.  Evan Smith ([[James Earl]]), Belko's head security guard, does not know who the new security guards are. Once the eightieth employee shows up, a voice on the intercom instructs the co-workers to kill two of their co-workers, or else four workers will be killed at random. Several staff attempt to flee the building, but steel shutters seal off the walls and doors, locking them all in. They ignore the announcement at first, believing it to be a prank, but four employees die when explosives hidden in their trackers detonate and blow their heads apart. Mike attempts to remove his tracker with a box cutter. Warned by the voice that he too will die unless he stops, he gives up.  The group is told that unless thirty of them are dead within two hours, sixty will be killed. They split into two factions, one led by Mike who believes that there should be no killing, and [[chief operating officer]] boss Barry Norris ([[Tony Goldwyn]]) who intends to follow the directions in order to save himself. Barry and his group attempt to burn off the lock of the armory in order to gain access to its weapons. Mike and his group, including his girlfriend Leandra Florez ([[Adria Arjona]]), Evan and employees Keith ([[Josh Brener]]), Leota ([[Gail Bean]]), Peggy ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]), Vince ([[Brent Sexton]]) and Roberto ([[David Del Rio]]), try to hang banners from the roof as a call for help, but soldiers outside shoot at them. Barry, executive Wendell ([[John C. McGinley]]), and employee Terry ([[Owain Yeoman]]) ambush the group in the stairway, kill Evan and take his keys to the armory.  With his group now armed, Barry and Wendell select thirty people, including Mike and Peggy, forcing them to kneel in a line. He begins executing them with a gunshot to the back of the head. Dany, who has been hiding in the basement, sees what is happening and shuts off the building's lights before Mike and several others can be killed. During this, Dany goes into the elevator shaft with Roberto.  Barry and Wendell hunt down the fleeing employees as the voice informs them that only twenty-nine have been killed. The two-hour time limit runs out and Terry, Leota, Peggy and Keith, along with twenty-seven other employees, have their trackers explode, leaving only 16 survivors. They are then informed by the voice that, as a final task, the employee who has killed the most people within an hour will be spared. Barry finds Dany and Roberto in the elevator shaft, but Dany escapes while Roberto is crushed and killed in the elevator shaft. Two employees, Marty ([[Sean Gunn]]) and Chet ([[Abraham Benrubi]]) collect the un-exploded trackers from the heads of people who have died by other methods, planning to use them to blow up the wall. However, they are killed by Wendell. Leandra kills Wendell, and Barry kills Vince and Dany. He then shoots Leandra, who dies shortly after. Mike and Barry are left as the only two survivors.  In a rage, Mike kills Barry with a [[tape dispenser]]. The building is then unsealed, as he is the last survivor, and the soldiers escort him to the hangar next door. There, he meets the owner of the voice ([[Gregg Henry]]), who introduces himself as a social scientist who believes that discoveries about human nature can only come from placing people in extreme environments. As he and his colleagues begin to question Mike about his emotional and mental state, Mike notices a panel of switches that correspond to the eighty employees. Having planted the trackers that Marty collected on the soldiers and the Voice, he flips every switch except his own. The trackers explode, killing the soldiers and wounding the Voice, before Mike grabs a gun and kills the remaining scientists. The Voice attempts to reason with Mike but Mike kills him. He then leaves the warehouse in a state of shock. The view zooms out to reveal that Mike is one of many sole survivors from similar experiments, being watched by another group through security cameras. A new voice states "end stage one" and "commence stage two."

Being 17
 Smart and sensitive, Damien is a seventeen-year-old student who lives with his mother Marianne, a doctor. His father, Nathan, is a military pilot on a mission abroad. They enjoy a comfortable life in a small town located in a valley among the mountains of the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]].  In high school, Damien gets picked on by Thomas, a classmate, who  trips him in the middle of class for no apparent reason. From then on there are constant altercations between them while playing sports and in the schoolyard. Both are outsiders at school chosen last for sports teams. In order to protect himself, Damien takes self-defense classes with Paulo, an ex-military family friend.  Meanwhile, Thomas, who is the biracial adopted son of a couple of sheep and cattle farmers, faces his own set of problems. Every day, he has to walk and bus for 90 minutes to reach the school. Marianne makes a house call to Thomas’s farm when his mother, Christine, has a pulmonary infection. Christine, who has a history of miscarriages, is pregnant and has to be hospitalized for some time. As the reserved Thomas worries about his mother and the birth of a biological child to his parents, his grades in school begin to fail. Wanting to help, Marianne invites Thomas to come and stay with her family so he can visit his mother in town at the hospital and spend more time studying and avoid the long trip to school every day. This coincides with a blissful return home for Nathan for leave between his tours of duty abroad. Nathan is lovingly welcomed by his wife and son and takes it upon himself, during his short visit, to personally invite Thomas to stay with his family. Pressed by his parents, Thomas reluctantly accepts.  Sharing the same household does not improve the relationship between the two teenagers. Damien resents that his mother is charmed by Thomas and accuses him of getting sick so he can be examined by Marianne. Away from home, the two boys fight each other in the mountains. Damien asks Thomas to drive to see a man whom he has contacted online for a sexual encounter. Thomas reluctantly drives him there, but Damien backs down, unsure of his feelings. On their way back home, Damien confesses his feelings to Thomas, saying, “I don’t know if I’m into guys or just you." Thomas does not welcome the revelation. He stops the car and gets out at the bank of a river. While trying to rebuff Damien, Thomas falls into a ditch and breaks his wrist. Realizing that the two boys have continued fighting, Marianne asks Thomas to return to his farm the next day. Damian and Thomas get closer at school while sitting in class together. Damien takes the first step and kisses Thomas, who initially seems to welcome the affection, but then retaliates violently, hitting Damien in the face. Thomas is expelled from school. Damien tells his mother that Thomas hit him because he kissed him, revealing his true feelings for Thomas. Marianne is sympathetic to her son.  Nathan is killed in a mission, shattering the lives of his wife and son. After the funeral, Thomas embraces Damien while consoling him. As Marianne falls into a deep depression, Thomas moves back to live with them to help look after Marianne. He keeps her company while Damien is away at school. The relationship between the two boys warms up. They work together, discussing a classroom project on desire. When Marianne finds the strength to go back to work, it is time for Thomas to return to his farm. Marianne goes to bed earlier that night. Damien tells Thomas that he loves him and that he is not afraid of his feelings. Thomas kisses him and they make love. The next morning, Thomas leaves before Damien wakes up.

He enlists in the Roman army and fights in the Roman Empire's wars in Germany.

But when her father Simonides seeks to marry her off to a Roman, Judah declares his love for her and takes her as his wife. Three years later, Messala returns as a decorated Roman officer. His return coincides with a rising insurrection by the [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealots]], who are opposed to the oppressive nature of Roman rule. Judah treats and shelters a young Zealot youth named Dismas. Messala reunites with Ben-Hur and attempts to convince his adoptive brother to serve as an informant. Following a reunion dinner with Ben-Hur and his family, Messala informs them that a new Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] will be taking residence in Jerusalem.  Days later, Pontius Pilate marches into Jerusalem with Ben-Hur and his family watching from a balcony. Dismas attempts to assassinate Pilate and in retaliation, the Romans storm Ben-Hur's household and arrest him and his family. Rather than betray a fellow Jew, Ben-Hur takes responsibility for the assassination attempt. His mother and sister are sentenced to be crucified. Ben-Hur and Messala fall out with each other. While being led to the prison galley, Ben-Hur encounters [[Jesus of Nazereth|Jesus]], who fetches him some water.

During a naval battle against Greek rebels in the Ionian Sea, Ben-Hur's galley is boarded but collides with another ship and is destroyed as Ben-Hur manages to cling to a floating mast. He is washed ashore and is found by [[Sheik Ilderim]], who recognizes him as an escaped slave. Ben-Hur manages to convince Ilderim not to hand him over to the Romans by treating one of the Nubian's racing horses. After Ben-Hur develops a bond with the four racing horses, a grateful Ilderim then trains Ben-Hur to be a chariot racer.  Ben-Hur and Sheik Ilderim later travel to Jerusalem to take part in a grand [[chariot racing|chariot race]] at the newly built Roman [[circus (building)|circus]]. Jesus' preaching ministry draws the attention of governor Pilate and Messala, who is now the commander of the Roman garrison and a champion chariot racer. While visiting Jerusalem, Ben-Hur encounters Esther, who has become a follower of Jesus and is involved in charity work. Esther tells Ben-Hur that his mother and sister are dead, and despite their reunion, the two are kept emotionally apart due to her new cause which is contrary to Judah's insistence on seeking revenge against Messala.  Ben-Hur later confronts Messala alone in their former home but is forced to flee when Roman soldiers turn up. After the Romans execute twenty Jews in reprisal, Esther completely falls out with Ben-Hur. Sheik Ilderim instructs Ben-Hur in chariot racing techniques. Later,  Ben-Hur encounters a former Roman soldier named Druses, who informs him that his mother Naomi and sister Tirzah are still alive. However, their reunion is soured when Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister have [[leprosy]], the former also appearing to have lost her memory.  Sheik Ilderim bribes Pilate into allowing Ben-Hur to compete by proposing a high wager. Esther tries to convince Messala not to race Ben-Hur, but he is adamant that he will win. On the day of the race, Ben-Hur follows Ilderim's instructions to hold back from the race until the final laps. Using dirty tactics, Messala manages to knock out the other competing charioteers. Following a brutal and grueling race, Ben-Hur wins the race. Messala survives but is badly wounded and loses a leg. Ben-Hur's victory embolden the Jewish spectators and yields dividends for Ilderim.  Despite his victory, Ben-Hur is despondent about his family and his former friend Messala. Later, Esther witnesses the arrest of Jesus in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].

Mirroring his first encounter with Jesus, Ben-Hur tries to offer Jesus water but is beaten by a Roman soldier. Following Jesus' crucifixion, a rainstorm occurs. Naomi and Tirzah are miraculously healed by rainwater containing the blood of Jesus, and Sheik Ilderim pays a ransom to set them free. In the end, Ben-Hur reconciles with Messala. Despite his anger, Messala finds the strength to forgive Ben-Hur and is reconciled to him and his family. Together, Ben-Hur, his mother, sister, Esther, and Messala accompany Sheik Ilderim's caravan as they leave Jerusalem.

Best Frenz Forever
   
The BFG (2016 film)
 Sophie, a 10-year-old orphaned girl who lives in a [[London]] orphanage, stays awake reading through the nights due to her insomnia. At 3 in the morning, or what she calls the "[[wikt:witching hour|witching hour]]", she sees an elderly [[giant]] outside her window. The giant captures her and takes her into Giant Country. There, he explains that Sophie must stay with him for the rest of her life because she saw him and must not be allowed to reveal the existence of giants. He also explains that she will put herself at risk if she goes out in the open, as nine other giants inhabit Giant Country, all of whom are man-eaters and favor the taste of children.  When Sophie awakes, the Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants (and the same one from Sophie's nightmare), enters the smaller giant's home and smells Sophie. The Fleshlumpeater nearly devours Sophie before exiting. The giant gives Sophie some replacement clothes, as hers are ruined, and Sophie convinces him to take her to Dream Country to catch dreams together. As they leave, they accidentally wake up the Bloodbottler, the more intelligent and cunning second-in-command to the Fleshlumpeater, who awakens the other man-eating giants. They torment and bully the friendly giant by throwing him around like a football and rolling him down a hill in a garbage truck. As the pair escape during a thunderstorm which drives the man-eating giants into the cave, the Fleshlumpeater and the Bloodbottler find Sophie's blanket (which she had dropped before) and plan to find her. Climbing up the mountain, Sophie tells the giant that he shouldn't allow the other giants to bully him.  The pair arrives in Dream Country and catch a dream each. While there, the giant reveals that his only other alias (other than "Runt" which the other giants call him, as they are much larger) is "the Big Friendly Giant" and Sophie decides to call him "BFG". The two then head to London to spread good dreams to sleeping children. As they do so, Sophie realizes that she has lost her blanket. The BFG realizes that the other man-eating giants know about her and she wakes up outside the orphanage. He explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by Fleshlumpeater's group. She throws herself out of her window in the hope he will appear again to catch her, and he does.  When they return to the BFG's home, the other giants barge in and upend the place looking for Sophie, destroying much of the BFG's hard work. Sophie evades detection and the enraged BFG finally stands up to them and drives them off with a hot fire iron. While hidden, Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG before becoming a victim of Fleshlumpeater's group. She leaves his jacket on his bed and finds a portrait of [[Queen Victoria]] amongst his belongings. From this she devises a plan to forge a nightmare and give it to [[Elizabeth II]], the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. The nightmare consists of giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing on her windowsill.  They head to [[Buckingham Palace]] where upon waking from her nightmare, the Queen and her maid Mary find Sophie on the windowsill as in the nightmare with the BFG outside in the palace grounds. Sophie and the BFG inform the Queen, Mary, and Mr. Tibbs that the child-eating beasts in her dream are indeed real and must be stopped at all costs before they cause any more harm to her subjects. After a large breakfast they all enjoy, the Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country.  The BFG plans to give the man-eating giants the regretful nightmare Sophie caught the night before, so they will be more compliant once caught. They are almost all immediately consumed by guilt, but the Fleshlumpeater awakens and intercepts the nightmare before it can affect him. Despite this, the British army's helicopters effortlessly ensnare and capture him and the other giants. They are lifted away onto an isolated uncharted island somewhere in the world where numerous snozzcumbers and a large crate of snozzcumber seeds are left with them, much to their fury.  In the aftermath, Sophie begins living in the Queen's palace with Mary while the BFG returns to Giant Country to resume giving dreams to people and begins growing a wide variety of vegetables inspired by his time in England. The film ends with Sophie narrating that whenever she feels lonely, which is less often than before, she talks to him. He can still hear her. Leaning out of her window, she says "Good Morning, BFG". At his writing desk, the BFG hears her words and smiles.

This act of courage earns Lynn the [[Silver Star]] and quickly ascends him and his unit, erroneously designated "Bravo Squad" by the media, to celebrity status. They return to the U.S. for Shroom's funeral, then are sent on a publicity tour culminating at the halftime show of the November 25 [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving home game]].  Now led by Sgt. David Dime, the members of Bravo Squad are driven in a limousine to the stadium with the Cowboys' [[Public relations|PR]] representative Josh and [[film producer]] Albert Brown, who is in the process of securing a film deal for the squad. A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals that Billy joined the army after destroying the car of his older sister Kathryn's boyfriend, who left her after she was in a car accident that required multiple [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|facial reconstruction]] procedures. At the stadium, the group is greeted by anxious fans who express gratitude for their actions and [[jingoism|blindly support]] the [[Iraq War]]. During a press conference, Billy spots a [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders|Cowboys Cheerleader]], Faison, smiling at him. They strike up a conversation and begin a flirtation. Billy tells her how it feels weird to be honored for the worst day of his life.  As the game starts, Billy recalls his time in Iraq, where Shroom offered him philosophical insight and advice during their downtime. It is revealed that once the game ends, Bravo Squad will have to return to duty. Billy receives a phone call from a psychiatrist to whom Kathryn had spoken, regarding a plan to get Billy honorably discharged so he doesn't have to return to Iraq, thereby sparing him further suffering.  During the halftime show, featuring [[Destiny's Child]], the loud music and pyrotechnics traumatize an already unstable squad member, Crack, and he reacts violently against a security guard. Billy experiences a flashback to the battle that made them famous. The squad was called in to rescue soldiers pinned down by insurgents at a school. Shroom is shot while advancing from cover, and Billy rushes to save him, firing on the nearby insurgents with his sidearm. Billy drags Shroom into a trench, but an insurgent attacks Billy at close range. Billy kills him in self-defense and is traumatized. Then, upon returning to Shroom, he discovers Shroom has bled to death. Billy's flashback ends when troop members get his attention and point out that the halftime show has been over for a few minutes. Billy had been frozen in place all the while.  Billy and Dime meet with the owner of the Cowboys, Norm Oglesby, who is considering investing in Albert's movie about the incident in Iraq. However, instead of the $100,000 that Albert was hoping to get for each squad member, Oglesby offers them only $5,500 apiece. Dime angrily rebuffs Oglesby's offer. In private, Oglesby tells Billy that the squad's story is no longer theirs, but instead belongs to the U.S. people. Billy tells Oglesby off, joining Dime. Albert promises Billy that he will find investors one way or another, and that their story deserves to be told "the right way."  As the squad leaves, they are attacked by the security guards from earlier, briefly triggering Billy's [[posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], which fills his mind with surreal imagery of war and death. The altercation is halted, and Billy meets up with Faison briefly before leaving. He says he wishes he could run away with her even though he has to go back. They share a kiss before parting ways. Kathryn arrives to retrieve Billy, but his expression makes it clear he is returning to duty. She is upset, but after Billy explains his decision, the siblings share a tearful hug.  Billy returns to the limo, but hallucinates and sees a [[Humvee]]. He gets in and has a philosophical conversation with (a visible) Shroom. Billy tells Shroom "I love you," then returns to the reality of the limo and Bravo Squad members, each of whom responds with "I love you."  
Big Fish & Begonia
 In a mystical realm that exists beneath the human world, populated by magical-powered beings, a girl named Chun participates in a coming-of-age ritual where she is transported through a portal of water to experience the human world in the form of a red dolphin. There, she encounters a human boy who lives by the sea and reveres aquatic creatures. During a storm, Chun is tangled in a fishing net near the boy's house, and the boy drowns while freeing her from the net. Chun returns to her world, taking the boy's ocarina with her.  Chun bargains with the soul keeper, a resident of her world who collects virtuous departed souls from the human world, to return the boy to life. The soul keeper takes half of her lifespan in exchange for giving her the boy's soul, which has manifested in this world in the form of a baby dolphin. He advises her that she must nurture the dolphin to adulthood in order to return the boy's soul to the human world. Qiu, Chun's childhood friend, discovers her undertaking; since beings from the human world are forbidden, he promises to help her keep her task secret. Together, they name the dolphin Kun, after a massive fish of legend.  Chun's mother soon finds Kun and throws him into the sewer. While searching for Kun, Chun and Qiu meet the rat matron, who collects the souls of sinners from the human world, which manifest in the form of rats. She takes an interest in the dolphin and summons her rats to recover him from the sewer.   Later, Chun and Qiu manage to take Kun away before he is narrowly discovered by the villagers. In their search for a new home for the dolphin, Qiu is bitten by a two-headed snake. Chun's grandfather draws the venom into his own body to save Qiu's life. Before succumbing to the venom, he confides in her that he will support her in her task even in death. After his passing, his soul manifests in the form of a begonia tree.  As Chun's world begins to experience unnatural torrential rains and snowfall, her family and the local elders realize that Kun's continued presence has caused these phenomena. One night, after Chun confesses to Qiu that she traded away half her lifespan, Qiu receives a warning from the rat matron to hide Kun. He puts Kun in a frozen lake in order to save Chun from further persecution, but Chun dives in after Kun. The rat matron summons her rats to recover Chun and Kun from the icy water, and takes the ocarina from Chun, planning to use it to secure her own passage to the human world.  As Chun continues to watch over Kun, Qiu visits the soul keeper to bargain his own life for the return of Chun's. The soul keeper demands his entire lifespan as payment, while warning that Chun will still die regardless when Kun returns to the human world. The soul keeper reveals to Qiu how to save Chun from this fate.  The residents of Chun's world gather to kill Kun and avert further calamity. Qiu arrives and performs the ritual to open a portal to the human world, but Kun is unable to swim through it, while the rat matron arrives and uses the ocarina to pass through the portal. Holes in the sky begin to open uncontrollably, flooding Chun's world with sea water from the human world.  Chun is reminded that her actions to save Kun are dooming the people of her own world; she tries to help them evacuate from the flood, but is spurned by all, including her mother. As a last resort, Chun sacrifices herself, merging her body with her grandfather's begonia tree to grow it to colossal proportions, plugging the holes in the sky and saving everyone from the flood.  Kun breaks a branch off the begonia tree and brings to the soul keeper who restores Chun to life from it. He sets her on a pilgrimage to return Kun to his world; along the way, they find Qiu, who joins them. Qiu asks her whether she would like to live in the human world herself, but, overwhelmed with regret in knowing they are spending their last night together, is unable to express his feelings for her.  The next day, Chun bids Kun farewell as Qiu opens one last portal for his return. At the same time, Qiu, following the soul keeper's instructions, casts a spell that will send Chun to the human world while killing him by setting him on magical fire. As he burns away, Qiu tells her that when she sees the wind and rain to think of him and he'll be with her always. Chun is transformed into a red dolphin, allowing her to follow Kun through the portal.  On a seashore in the human world, Kun and Chun wash ashore in their human forms. As Kun comes to, he sees Chun holding out her hand to him.  In a mid-credits scene, the soul keeper restores Qiu to life from his ashes and declares Qiu his successor, revealing the true cost of Qiu's sacrifice for Chun.

Bleed for This
 On November 1988, Vinny Pazienza boxes [[Roger Mayweather]] for the WBC World Light Welterweight Title. He arrives late to the weigh-in, as he has been riding a stationary bicycle in order to make the weight limit. Vinny's final weight is 140 pounds even, which qualifies him for the fight.  Instead of resting up for the fight, Vinny spends the night at a casino. The following day, he loses to Mayweather. At one point during the fight, Vinny  is hit after the bell. His boxing manager [[Lou Duva]] causes a scene by going after Mayweather, but is punched as a result. Following the match, Duva tells the media that Vinny should retire from boxing. This angers Vinny's father Angelo (who serves as his coach), and he confronts Duva. In the ensuing argument, Vinny announces that he wants another fight, and hires [[Kevin Rooney]] as his coach.  Angelo receives confirmation that Vinny has been granted a title fight against [[Gilbert Dele]]. Vinny wins the bout via technical knockout, which makes him the WBA World Light Middleweight champion. Some days later, Angelo tells Vinny that he will be fighting Panamanian boxer [[Roberto Durán]]. Vinny is pleased, and gets in a car with his friend Jimmy to get some coffee. On the way, they are hit head-on by an oncoming car. Jimmy is hurt, but Vinny suffers a critical neck injury. As he regains consciousness in the hospital, the doctor informs him that he might never walk again, and will certainly never fight again. He offers to better Vinny's chances of walking by performing a spinal fusion. While this would guarantee that he can walk again, it would limit movement in his neck. Thus, boxing would be out of the question. Against his doctor's recommendation, Vinny opts to be fitted with a [[Orthotics|Halo]], a medical device in which a circular metal brace is screwed into the skull in four spots, and propped up with four metal rods. This would allow him to regain movement in his neck, which could allow him to box again. Despite Vinny's optimism, the notion is rejected by Kevin.  Disobeying his doctors' advice, Vinny begins to work out in his basement. He tells Kevin, who agrees to help him. Angelo eventually catches them, and kicks Kevin out of the house.  Six months after the accident, Vinny is ready to have the halo removed. He chooses to endure the pain of having the screws removed without taking any sedatives.  In his comeback match, it is confirmed that Vinny will fight against Durán. The fight is held in Las Vegas, in 1990. In the first six rounds, Vinny is overpowered by Durán. Then suddenly — inspired by his own tenacity — Vinny lands a good punch late in the fight. Vinny eventually wins, via 12-round majority decision (, , ).  In the final scene, Vinny is interviewed by a journalist. She asks him about the biggest lie he was ever told as a boxer. Vinny pauses, then says the biggest lie is, "It's not that simple".

Among those in attendance, Lee points out Man in the audience. Man commends Lee's skill and technique but notices that Lee is his own limitation, to which Lee verbally retaliates and challenges him to a fight as Man leaves in peace. McKee and Xiulan sneak out, later learning that she and her roommates are owned by gangster Auntie Blossom      ([[Jin Xing]]), who owns the China Gate restaurant. Asking for help, McKee learns that Man is in America to perform penance working as a dishwasher because of a near-fatal kick, the Mon Shan, during an exhibition against a Tai Chi master in [[Henan]] the year earlier nearly killed his opponent. Realizing that teaching McKee would help liberate himself, Man takes on McKee as his student. Meeting up with Lee, who tells him that he would begin filming [[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]], McKee reveals his intention to end his time at Lee's academy. The relationship between McKee and Man captured the attention of Auntie Blossom, who makes a proposition to the former that if he could get both martial artists to fight, she would let Xiulan go. Man appears at Lee's academy and accepts his challenge. Despite Auntie Blossom's conditions, Xiulan refuses to leave without her fellow roommates, who are all under the control of Wing Lo. In preparation, Lee reluctantly agrees to fight under Man's conditions: only 12 witnesses at an empty warehouse, and the winner would be revealed in the newspaper the next day.  Auntie Blossom, McKee, and a few other spectators bear witness to the private match. Lee's aggressive style of Wing Chun gains him the upper hand, drawing first blood. Man's traditional style of Shaolin was fluid, countering Lee, enraging him. They both engage until the two reach the top of an unfinished staircase, to which Man uses as an example to show Lee the limitation of his style. Man leaps down to the floor with grace, and Lee follows suit as a symbol of exceeding his own limits. They continue to fight until Man is knocked down and attempts the Mon Shan as he arose, only for Lee, and his new style, to prepare to parry. The two stop and show their mutual respect with a bow, ending the fight. With no winner formally announced and $15,000,000 in bets still in the balance, Auntie Blossom would keep all the girls until one of would declare himself the winner, while the other concedes.  Lee contemplates his own style, knowing that he could have been killed during the fight. Man is confronted by McKee to declare himself the victor to Auntie Blossom, however, Man says he won the fight by virtue of showing Lee a new path after exceeding his limitation. Wei notifies Lee that McKee grew desperate to get Xiulan out of captivity, taking on the gang at the China Gate restaurant himself, leaving him to be beaten up senselessly. Lee teams up with Man and agree to help out their mutual student, defeating the gang. Lee, Man, and McKee confront Auntie Blossom and her boss, Wing Lo. Man concedes, declaring Lee to be the winner. However, Lee would accept that on the condition that Lo would let all captive girls in Chinatown free. Lo's nephew attempts to shoot Lee with a shotgun, but Lee swiftly performs the Mon Shan, knocking him out. While visiting McKee at the hospital, Lee reveals his desire not just being recognized as a star, but instead, a legend and by doing so, develop a new style that is more fluid and expressive. McKee and Xiulan bid farewell to Man before boarding his ship back to China. Man firmly believes that Lee is the right person to show kung fu to the world.  In a closing disclaimer, Lee had altered his fighting style. In July 1969, he introduced [[Jeet Kune Do]], the forerunner of mixed martial arts.  
Blair Witch (film)
  In 2014, James Donahue finds a video on [[YouTube]] containing an image of a woman he believes to be his sister [[The Blair Witch Project#Cast|Heather]], who [[The Blair Witch Project#Plot|disappeared in 1994]] near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] while investigating the legend of the [[Blair Witch]]. Believing she is still alive, he heads into the woods, accompanied by his friend Peter Jones, Peter’s girlfriend Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to film James' search as a [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''The Absence of Closure''.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Locals Talia and Lane, who found and uploaded the video, join them.  While walking through the woods and upon setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather and her film crew, the 1940-41 murders by Rustin Parr, and other mysterious occurrences, which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. They hear noises during the night, then awaken at 2 p.m. to find strange stick figures hanging from the trees. When Lisa notices [[twine]] in Lane's backpack, he and Talia admit to creating the figures in order to convince the group to believe, but also point out that there is no explanation for the strange noises during the night and sleeping through the day. James and his friend banish Lane and Talia from their group and head out of the woods.  After hours of walking, the four surprisingly arrive back at their original campsite. Lisa pilots a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to obtain their location, but it malfunctions. Ashley becomes sick due to a wound on her foot, forcing the group to camp again. When Peter inspects Ashley's wounded foot, he notices what he thinks may be a parasite inside the wound. Peter leaves the camp for firewood, soon being chased by an unknown entity; a tree falls on him, then he disappears.  Lane and Talia appear in the night, claiming they have been wandering for five days without a sunrise. Lane believes the camp is a hallucination and runs off, leaving the dishevelled and ravenously hungry Talia. The next morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that it is still dark outside at 7am and discover larger stick figures. Talia sees clumps of her hair tied to one of the figures. Ashley accuses Talia of crafting them and snaps the figure with Talia's hair in half; Talia is then snapped in half. An unseen force lifts their tent and the group is separated. Ashley finds the drone and climbs a tree to recover it, but is knocked out and falls from the tree, the unknown entity dragging her away.  A rainstorm ensues as Lisa and James stumble across Rustin Parr's house, which James had previously stated to have been burned down after his execution. James hears someone he thinks is Heather scream upstairs, enters the house and sees Peter standing in the corner. He chases after the figure he believes to be Heather, confronted by a teleporting dishevelled figure; upon its vanishing he barricades himself.  Lisa spots the unknown entity, a tall, pale, long-limbed creature moving through the trees, and she runs into the house's basement. She finds an aged and hostile Lane who traps her in an underground tunnel as “you have to do what she tells you”. The tunnel connects to a different part of the house, where Lisa stabs and kills Lane when he attacks her. Lisa flees when the long-limbed creature emerges from the tunnel and chases her through the house. Lisa runs up to the attic with Lane's camcorder, creating the [[bootstrap paradox|paradox]] video that lured them all to the woods.  She reunites with James in the attic and they try to barricade the door. A bright light shines from outside the building, moving until stopping at the door, indicating the arrival of the witch. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room and desperately apologizes to her before the witch enters, alongside her creature. James is tricked into turning around, believing that he hears Heather's voice, and vanishes from sight. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to view what is behind her and begins walking backward. However, hearing James' apology again, she turns, and vanishes, leaving her camera behind before it gives out.

After killing a tenant, Jonah ties up another and presses Lydia to kill her. However, Lydia accidentally shoots Jonah in the neck, apparently killing him, and escapes the crime scene. She contacts her estranged father, John Link ([[Mel Gibson]]), an ex-convict and recovering alcoholic out on [[parole]] after serving seven years in prison. He picks up Lydia, takes her back to his [[Mobile home|trailer house]], and learns that she is both a drug addict and an alcoholic. Some days pass by uneventfully, although Lydia receives death threat text messages from the gang members.  One night, members of Jonah's gang come to John's house. After failing to force themselves in, they open fire on the house and ram it with their SUV. John's neighbor and sponsor, Kirby ([[William H. Macy]]), and other armed residents rush to intervene, and the gang retreats.   Reasoning that giving Lydia up to the police will put her in danger, John flees with her.

John overpowers Preacher and his wife, and escapes with Lydia on a [[Softail|1997 Harley Softail]] motorcycle. They are pursued by two of Preacher's men, who are both killed in the chase.  John travels to a prison where he meets Arturo, his former cellmate, to ask about Jonah's connections. He learns that Jonah himself stole the money from his cartel, blamed the tenants, and then murdered them to cover his tracks.   At the motel alone, Lydia receives a call from Kirby, who says she is in danger and advises her to head to a crowded public place, like a theater. At the cinema, Lydia is confronted by Jonah, who had survived his injury and who, with help from his gang, abducts her.   After leaving the prison, John calls Kirby, but Jonah answers the phone, reveals that he has captured Kirby, and kills him.

John offers up his life for his daughter, and Jonah arranges to meet at a secluded spot in the desert.  John goes back to Preacher's place, and picks up a [[landmine]] and some [[grenade]]s. He arrives at the meeting spot, and improvises a booby trap with his bike and the landmine. Jonah's men tie John up and put him in a car. As they prepare to leave, two of Jonah's men are killed by the trap. John kills the gang member inside the vehicle, but Jonah escapes. The sicario, having taken position at a vantage point, wounds John. Taking cover behind a car, John forces the sicario to get closer, and the two fatally shoot each other.   John dies after telling his daughter she is a good girl. Jonah is arrested and incarcerated. While sitting down at a table, he's met by a visibly hostile gang led by Arturo, who smiles knowingly, implying that Jonah will be killed.

An old, overweight man named Ding witnesses a man being stabbed by a gang, but when he is summoned by the police to identify the suspect, he hesitates and is unable to. The police research Ding's background and discover that he is a retired [[Central Security Bureau]] officer from Beijing, and they figure that he is suffering from [[dementia]]. Back at his home, Ding is frequently invited for supper by his land-lord, Park, an elderly lady who is attracted to him. Ding, in turn, frequently cares for a little girl next door named Cherry, whose father, Li, is an abusive [[gambling addiction|gambler]].  When Li becomes heavily in debt because of his gambling, Choi, a Chinese person of Korean descent, who happens to be the leader of the aforementioned gang, forces Li to embark on a criminal assignment. Li is driven to a hotel and told to steal the shoulder-bag of a [[Russian mafia|Russian gang leader]]. The alarm is raised but Li escapes with the bag after a protracted chase. However, upon being told that his debt isn't absolved, Li goes into hiding, taking the bag with him. Choi reacts by sending men to abduct Li's daughter. Meanwhile, the Russian gang leader feels angry and plans an attack against Choi's gang for violating their territory.  Choi's gang members follow Cherry and assault Ding's home after she enters it, but to their dismay, Ding proves to be a remarkable fighter, and they are repelled. To avoid arrest, two of them are sent by Choi to hide in the countryside. The police, noticing that Li has disappeared, send Cherry to live with her aunt and uncle. However, within a short time, the aunt and uncle wish to eject her, and Ding agrees to provide for her living. Then one night, Cherry goes missing, and what is more, Li suddenly appears in Ding's home, bringing money in order to compensate Ding for his service. As Li exits the house, he is assaulted by Choi's gang and killed, and the shoulder-bag is taken back.  Ding, who has been plagued with guilt for years, ever since his granddaughter went missing on a hiking trip, resolves to bring Cherry back using force. He visits the gambling house demanding Cherry's release, and when Choi's gang attempts to kill him, he overpowers around 20 of them including a skilled knife assassin. At that moment, some of the Russian gang members appear and start to kill the rest of Choi's men in an attempt to reclaim their stolen money. Seeing this, Choi escapes, but not before Ding wounds his leg. The Russians proceed to attack Ding, believing that he works for Choi, and Ding is forced to kill them. At the same time, the police, led by Park's son, chase after two leaders of the Russian gang, who die when they collide with a truck. Choi, who thinks he is safe, is approached by the two subordinates he sent into the countryside. They proceed to murder Choi and to rob him, having accepted a Russian bribe to do so.  In the aftermath of the incident, Ding's dementia worsens, and he is paralyzed by the loss of Cherry. The police make no attempt to blame Ding, recognizing that his actions were [[self-defense]]. Suddenly, Cherry returns, revealing that she simply ran off to live at a friend's house. Even as Ding forgets his family members, he remembers his relationship with Cherry, who cares for him well into his senescence. In a scene after the credits, the two countryside criminals accidentally encounter a group of drilling PLA military-police, who turn and give chase. After a short chase the remaining criminals are captured.  
Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadland
  Thad Castle, recently drafted into the pros, is now an ostentatious multi-millionaire with high prospects as an NFL player. At Blue Mountain State, his former team is training as normal under an increasingly frustrated Coach Daniels and new assistant coach Larry, with Alex as the senior captain. However, Alex realizes that the only three players with any notable skill left are himself, Harmon, and Donnie, and declares that he will devote himself to partying for his final year of college due to the fact that his team is set to have a losing season. Sammy, meanwhile, is still attempting to find sexual gratification, usually masturbating to the sight of either Alex's -- or his sister Mary Jo's -- conquests. Mary Jo, still a lesbian, tells Alex about her newest conquest, a ditzy airhead named Holly.  After returning from practice, Alex and the team are confronted by the new dean of the university, Oliviares, who declares that the Goat House will be auctioned off so as to avoid further damaging the school's reputation. Alex is aghast, and seeks Thad for help. He meets him at a garish and expensive restaurant, whereupon he is also confronted by Thad's equally bombastic cousin and bodyguard, Dick Dawg. After a bit of convincing, Alex convinces Thad to purchase the Goat House, with Thad's condition that he throw a massive party in his honor, an idea that he dubs Thadland. He gives Alex a crudely drawn picture book, and the team gets to work, stopping to puzzle at the contents of the last page, which shows a crayon-drawn Thad with angel wings.  Coach Daniels, facing his second divorce from Debra and the decline of his career, drinks his sorrows at a bar in town, where he meets a young woman, to whom he offers a ride on his bike. While he performs cunnilingus on her during said ride, he crashes and breaks his arm. The party begins days later, and Thad and Dick Dawg show up, with the former highly impressed with the results; however, the popularity of Thadland causes the drug supply, of which Harmon collected from literally half of the United States, to decline. Sammy, in an attempt to impress Thad and make him remember his name, asks Harmon to offer his experimental drug of choice. After Harmon initially declines due to the drug's potency, he relents, first testing it on Billy the goat, the team's animal mascot, before sharing it with the rest of the party in the form of a gas sucked from balloons. The drug is wildly successful, and the party is renewed.  Sammy, again attempting to make Thad remember him, tries to make conversation with him, only for Thad to offhandedly give him a "sloot" named Tina, who is insistent upon anally playing with a tied-down Sammy, who relents on the condition that they have sex afterwards. Tina leaves the bedroom to grab more items; while she is gone, Billy, in a drug-induced haze, anally rapes an unknowing Sammy, horrifying Tina upon her return.  Alex begins to flirt with Holly, infuriating Mary Jo. Upon seeing her anger, Donnie tells her that she is not gay, but rather, in love with Alex, which she denies. She asks him how he is so sure of her sexuality, to which he responds that he himself is gay. Thad and Dick Dawg overhear this, and happily announce his sexuality to the party in a misguided show of support, surprising everyone except for Harmon, who already was aware of it. Coach Daniels arrives at the party to see Thad, and the two struggle to admit that they miss one another.  The auction begins for the house, and Thad bids five million dollars on it (having outbid himself from three million). Alex celebrates having "his" house back, and Thad confronts him on only thinking of himself when agreeing to create Thadland. Thad angrily banishes Alex from the Goat House. Outside, Alex finds Mary Jo and Holly talking about their date, and, after taking a hit of Harmon's drug, confronts the former on her supposed inability to turn Holly gay. Mary Jo, to disprove this, kisses Holly; Alex does so as well. Finally, Mary Jo and Alex kiss, and they confess their feelings for one another before the drug causes the three to hallucinate having an orgy before passing out.  Alex, in a dream, sees a potential future where Sammy is dead, Thad, now a middle-aged wash-up, is living in the Goat House, having never left, and Alex is now his house boy. Horrified, Alex wakes up in the middle of a deserted field. He walks to a nearby road, where he flags down a car driven by his old teammate, Craig Shilo. The two go to Thadland together, which is still running as a shell of its former self, with derelict amusement attractions and multiple deaths as a result of partying too much. Alex finds a drugged out Sammy, who has eaten Billy as a form of vengeance. Thad and Dick Dawg approach Donnie with a gay young man that the former bought for him. Despite the off putting start, Donnie and the boy, Frank, seem to hit it off. Out of options and seeing Mary Jo flirting with Thad, Alex asks Larry, who he finally treats as a coach rather than his friend, for help in rounding up the team.   At a press conference about Thadland and Coach Daniels' liaison and subsequent car crash, Daniels angrily tells the reporters and Dean Oliviares off, admitting to everything he's done and denying any regret for it. Dick Dawg, at the conference, hands the dean an envelope from Thad.  In the basement of the Goat House, Alex confronts Harmon about the balloon-based drugs and what is inside of them. Harmon reveals that the drugs are a fermented gas derived from the house's septic tank. A disgusted Alex uses his authority as captain to coerce Harmon to shut the tanks down, to which he complies. Upstairs, Alex finds Thad and Mary Jo, both of whom are high due to the drug. Alex confronts him about his supposed wealth and asks why he can waste his time at a party at a college campus rather than attending practice with his professional team. Thad tearfully reveals that his contract was voided due to his bad behaviour upon receiving his money, and that all of his wealth was fake. He also reveals that Dick Dawg told the dean this. Alex, enraged, asks why he did that, and Thad produces a handgun, declaring that if he couldn't have his wealth, he wanted to die. Alex sadly realizes what the final picture in the Thadland book was: it was a picture of Thad "in heaven." He refuses to help Thad kill himself, but instead has another plan. He asks for Dick Dawg to come to him as police sirens approach the house.  In the basement, Dick Dawg begins to rig the septic and gas tanks to explode, where he is confronted by a naked and drugged Sammy; the two fight, with Dick Dawg easily overpowering Sammy, who is knocked unconscious by falling debris. The house begins to crumble, prompting everyone inside to evacuate. Upstairs, Alex and Thad embrace, with Thad asking him to remember his story. Alex leaves with Mary Jo, which Dick Dawg carries the unconscious Sammy out of harm's way. The Goat House explodes.  Mary Jo sympathetically consoles Alex about the house he fought so hard for, to which he responds that it's "just a house," and they kiss. The Dean celebrates his so-called victory over Alex but begins to hyperventilate from the excitement. Before Alex can confront him, Harmon, in the guise of providing oxygen, gives Oliviares a puff of his drug. The dean begins to hallucinate and promptly begins humping Holly, likely costing him his reputation and job. In a line-up, Alex, Mary Jo, Larry, Donnie, Harmon, Shilo, and Radon all toast to Thad's memory.  One month later, a girl is seen running with a mojito to a rocky beach in an unknown locale. There, a poorly disguised Thad, under the alias of "Mr. Poontang," takes a sip of it, only to angrily declare that it lacks lime. As the girl hastily runs back to the bar to correct the mistake, he finds the lime "hidden under all the mint" and tells her to return.  In a mid-credits scene, Dick Dawg calls out Sammy's name for him to wake up. Upon opening his eyes, Sammy accuses Dick Dawg of knowing his name, to which the latter vehemently denies, infuriating Sammy.

At the end of the hill, Papa Zola, Adu Du and Probe held on the edge to avoiding them from falling. J-Rex too slides down the hill but is on the verge to fall, but Papa Zola gives his hand to it. J-Rex, in debt to the rescue, decides to join Papa Zola's side. It also threatens Adu Du and Probe with the fall if they do not want to join him too. They go to the Tengkotak's spaceship and try to intrude it. With the help of J-Rex, they managed to impose it but end up captured by Gaga Naz and Kiki Ta.  BoBoiBoy's team arrive in front of the door of Power Sphere Lab, presuming it to be the dead end.  After some investigation, however, the door opens on its own.

Initially, Greta ignores the rules and the doll and follows her own routine. She regularly calls her sister Sandy, who tells her that her abusive ex-boyfriend Cole has been trying to find out where she is.  Malcolm, the local grocery dealer, stops by to deliver groceries, and Greta learns that the real Brahms was killed in a fire 20 years ago on his eighth birthday.

However, her dress and jewelry vanish while she is in the shower, and she is lured to the attic by strange noises and locked in.  She is mysteriously let out the next morning. She explains to Malcolm what happened, and they briefly discuss the real Brahms, whom Malcolm said Mr. Heelshire described as "odd."   Strange things begin to happen—a child's sobs are heard in the hallways, phone calls are cut off, and the doll seems to move on its own, vanishing and reappearing elsewhere in the house. After receiving a phone call in which a child's voice urges her to follow the rules, Greta locks herself in her room. She later finds a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]] outside her door.   Elsewhere, the Heelshires write a goodbye letter to Brahms, then drown themselves.  Believing that Brahms' spirit lives within the doll, Greta begins to take the rules more seriously. After Greta demonstrates the doll's ability to move by itself, Malcolm becomes worried. He informs Greta that the real Brahms was friends with a young girl about his age. One day, she was found in the forest with her skull crushed. Before the police could question Brahms, the Heelshires' house was burned down with him in it. Malcolm warns Greta not to stay in the house, but Greta, having previously suffered a miscarriage after she was beaten by Cole, feels obligated to care for Brahms.  One evening, Cole abruptly appears in the house and announces his intention to bring Greta back home, by force if necessary. Malcolm makes an early delivery and decides to stay nearby. As she puts Brahms to sleep, Greta asks Brahms for help. Cole wakes up and sees a message written in blood urging him to leave. Believing it was done by either Greta or Malcolm, Cole angrily snatches the doll from Greta and smashes it.  The house begins to shake and the lights start flickering. Cole hears noises behind a mirror and investigates. The mirror explodes and knocks Cole to the ground. A strange voice calls Greta's name from the hole behind the mirror and a grown man wearing a porcelain mask of Brahms emerges. It is revealed to be the real Brahms who apparently survived the fire and now has been living in the passages behind the walls of the house. Brahms attacks and kills Cole, then turns on Malcolm and Greta.  A chase ensues throughout the house. Greta and Malcolm discover Brahms' room while trying to find an exit. A doll made from Greta's missing dress, hair and jewelry is in Brahms' bed. Greta finds the final letter from the Heelshires revealing their plan of leaving Greta as a mate for Brahms. Brahms catches them and severely beats Malcolm, threatening to kill him if Greta leaves.  Greta flees anyway, but then she returns with the intention of saving Malcolm. Arming herself with a screwdriver, Greta invokes the rules to force Brahms to go to bed. He asks for a good night kiss, and when he tries to kiss her she stabs him with the screwdriver, but he throws her across the room and tries to choke her. While he's choking her she pushes the screwdriver deeper into his organs and he collapses. Greta drags Malcolm to his car and sighs with relief as they leave the estate.

However Mark is so thrilled at the news that he is about to be a father that Bridget does not tell him about Jack. Bridget also decides not to go forward with testing the DNA while her child is still in the womb as she is terrified by the possibility that she might miscarry. She persuades Dr. Rawlings to go through appointments twice, once with Jack and another time with Mark.  Bridget invites Jack to a work event and is startled when Mark shows up as well. The two men immediately take a liking to one another, finding the other's accomplishments impressive. They go out to dinner where Bridget finally comes clean and tells them that she is unsure who the father is. Jack takes the news well, telling Bridget that the child is the priority. Mark Darcy is upset and walks out of the restaurant.  At an ante-natal class, Jack arrives early and Bridget is gratified when Mark shows up as well. Jack and Mark are mistaken for a gay couple with Bridget as their surrogate, much to Mark's discomfort and Jack's amusement. Mark is also jealous at the easy rapport that Jack has with Bridget and his warmth in taking care of her.  Bridget experiences cramps and goes to the hospital, taking Jack with her as she is unable to reach Mark. When at last Mark arrives he is upset to see the two laughing together and embracing. Mark and Jack fight and Bridget sends them out of the room. Outside, Jack implies that he and Bridget had sex without condoms, making Mark realize that he is less likely to be the father. He leaves once again and ignores Bridget's calls.  Bridget continues to prepare for the arrival of her baby, now with only Jack by her side. They have a discussion where he asks her to move in with him and confesses that life for him is lonely. Bridget asks him what will happen if Mark is the father and he tells her he will need to re-evaluate their relationship if that is the case. He also confesses that the reason Mark has been absent is because Jack heavily implied that Mark was unlikely to be the father. An upset Bridget goes to talk to Mark, but sees his wife arriving at his house and decides to let him be.  At nine months, Bridget quits her job rather than being fired for numerous gaffes and unprofessional mishaps, notably inviting a guest onto the show with the sole intent of obtaining a sample of his DNA, live broadcasting bare arses during the launch event of a public news-gathering initiative and mixing up a guest with his chauffeur. Unemployed, exhausted, and hungry, she goes out shopping but has her card eaten by a cashpoint and locks herself out of the bank lobby, leaving her keys and her food inside. When no one buzzes her up to her building, she stands outside her apartment in the rain feeling miserable. Mark arrives and breaks in for her. He informs her that he and his wife are going through with their divorce and she was only there to pick up the last of her things. Just as they are about to kiss, Bridget's water breaks. When his phone rings for work, he throws it out the window in a romantic gesture, which leaves them without a means to call transport to the hospital. They enlist the help of a local restaurant to get them to hospital, but a traffic jam due to protests forces them to walk. Overtaken by contractions, Bridget cannot walk and Mark offers to carry her, but almost collapses. Jack arrives just in time and the two of them get Bridget to the hospital.  During labour, both Mark and Jack try to help Bridget. However, during labour Bridget accidentally punches Jack in the nose. She also reaches to Mark for comfort and he reassures her that she can get through labour and he will love her no matter whether the child is his or not, while sustaining an agonizing bite to the wrist by Bridget. While Jack and Mark wait outside, Jack apologizes to Mark for his behaviour and Mark accepts. Bridget gives birth to a boy and all of Bridget's friends and relatives come to visit her in the delivery room. Meanwhile, Dr. Rawlings has both men come with her to perform the DNA test. After having bonded for the last 6 months Mark and Jack each wish each other luck.  A year later Bridget prepares to be married. At the altar she is greeted by Jack, holding her son, and then moves forward to marry Mark. After the wedding, Mark and Jack, now friends, head to the reception together while Bridget carries her and Mark's son, William.  A newspaper lying on a bench reveals that Daniel Cleaver has been found alive in the woods in the wreckage of the plane.

Brimstone (2016 film)
  '''Revelation'''  Liz lives with her husband Eli and two children, one of which is a boy from her husband's prior marriage, and the other is a young girl. The family lives in the old west. Liz is a midwife, but is mute and communicates through sign language. A new minister comes to their church, and the moment that Liz hears his voice, she is terrified, as she is convinced that the man is dangerous. Eli notices bad things happening, but blames Nathan, an irrational drunk whose newborn baby died during labor and who blames the death on Liz who delivered the child. Liz decides to murder the minister, and sneaks off at night to do so, but finds her daughter's doll in the bed of the minister instead of him and realizes that her family is in danger. As she rushes back to her family, the minister disembowels Eli, who is then left to die. Her husband's final request is for his son to take the family up into the mountains, where Eli's father lives. With a horse and carriage, Liz and her two children manage to flee from the farm, now on fire.  '''Exodus'''  A young girl named Joanna walks exhausted through the desert and is picked up by a Chinese family. In the mining town of Bismuth, she's sold to a bar/brothel owned by Frank. A prostitute named Sally tries to care for and protect her, but is hanged for shooting a violent customer. This leads to Joanna eventually becoming a prostitute. A few years later Joanna reveals that 'Joanna' was Liz's former identity. Joanna's friend is another prostitute, Elizabeth. One day, Elizabeth bites the tongue of an abusive customer, which results in Frank cutting off her tongue as punishment. Now living as a mute, Elizabeth learns sign language from Joanna, who teaches her from a book the doctor gave her. Elizabeth plans to sneak out of Bismuth to find a new life, and makes arrangements through a marriage broker to marry Eli.  As Joanna is helping Elizabeth prepare to leave, the minister shows up in the brothel. He pays to take Joanna to a room and becomes violent. Elizabeth runs in with a knife to save Joanna, saving her from being whipped, but the minister ultimately ends up killing Elizabeth. Joanna proceeds to grab the knife and slashes the throat of the minister, and then takes Liz's clothes and identity. She cuts out her own tongue in order to be able to match Liz’s backstory and takes her place in an arranged marriage to Eli, who has never seen Elizabeth.  '''Genesis'''  In the desert, two badly wounded men, Samuel and Wolf, are the last men standing in a larger dispute over mined gold that has left several other men dead. They depart on a single horse. Young Joanna lives with her mother, Anna, and father, who is revealed to be the minister. Anna is reticent to have sex with her husband, which causes him to turn his interest to his daughter. Samuel and Wolf arrive at the farm and, without telling her parents, Joanna hides the outlaws and begins to take care of them. When Anna confronts the minister with his intentions toward their daughter, he beats and humiliates her by placing a [[scold's bridle]] on her head, so that she commits suicide in full view of the church congregation. The next day the increasingly unhinged minister takes Joanna to church and starts to perform a wedding ceremony between himself and his daughter. Samuel comes in to rescue her, but the minister kills him. Angry that she has hidden this man from him, the minister drags her towards their house through the mud. She screams that she loves Samuel and enrages her father when she admits that she lusted after him. After the minister whips Joanna, he rapes her. In the morning she runs off, away from her sleeping father.  '''Retribution'''  Liz, with her children, Sam and Matthew, she plows through the snow to go to the home of Eli's father, up in the mountains. When they cross a frozen lake, Matthew is shot by the minister and dies. Liz and Sam reach their destination. As Liz guards the house, the minister shows up again and tells Liz that he will substitute Liz's daughter for Liz, as he believes himself damned forever anyway. Liz manages to kill him. Some time later, Liz has turned Eli's place into a [[sawmill]], where she lives with her young daughter, but Nathan arrives to arrest her. He tells her that it was the minister who instructed him to go to Bismuth to start a new life. He became a deputy and when the old sheriff died, the town chose him as the new one. He then found the 'Wanted Poster' of Elizabeth Brundy, a woman without a tongue. It turns out the original Elizabeth killed Frank just before she turned up to save Liz/Joanna, and Nathan is coming to take her back and hang her. As Nathan is escorting her onto a ferry, with a last look at her daughter playing on the shore, Liz decides to throw herself in the lake and drown. Later, Sam is now a grown woman with a child of her own, and we find that she is the narrator of the story.

Brotherhood (2016 film)
   Ten years after the events of ''Adulthood,'' Sam has now settled down. He has a partner, Kayla, and two kids, one from a previous relationship with Lexi who has died. He is on much better terms with his mother, Mrs. Peel, and brother Royston and has also befriended Alissa, who now has a teenage daughter from her relationship with the late Trevor 'Trife' Hector, whom Sam killed in Kidulthood. Now Sam has four jobs and also works out at a local gym. One day when he arrives, he overhears a girl describe to the owner how she was attacked by someone called 'Mooks.' The owner pulls out a gun, sees Sam listening in and closes the door.  Royston is in a band with Henry. One night, when they're playing a gig, a gunman, Drew, enters the venue and non-fatally shoots Royston on orders. Before he escapes in a Jeep, Drew leaves an envelope addressed to Sam next to Royston. Sam visits Alissa with some money for her daughter. Alissa, who has forgiven Sam, says they must soon tell Trife's daughter, who sees Sam as a family friend, what happened to Trife.  Sam visits Royston in the hospital and sees their mother there. She asks Sam to bring the grandchildren to see her soon. Afterwards, Sam learns from Henry that it wasn't an accident, as told earlier. Henry gives Sam the envelope. It contains an address with instructions for Sam to go there. Sam asks Henry to come with him, but Henry refuses.  On his way home, Sam bumps into a mystery lady, who "accidentally" spills coffee on him. She invites Sam to her flat to make amends and seduces him. They have sex, but unbeknownst to Sam, their interlude is being taped. Sam heads home, discovers he is being followed, and attacks the mystery man. While they grapple, the Jeep that facilitated gunman Drew's escape pulls up. Out comes Melvin (AKA 'Hugs'). When he hugs assailants, he knifes them for crossing him or his friends. Hugs pledges to cut Sam and also threatens his family. If Sam fails to go to the address in the envelope, more people will get hurt.  Sam arrives at the place, a lavish property in a well-to-do area. He sees the man that he originally assaulted and jumps him again. Sam gains access to the house but finds he is outnumbered. After an initial beating, a man named Daley intervenes. He is a successful criminal, who works for a notorious Kingpin known as 'Mooks'. He shows Sam around the house and it's clear he runs drugs and high-end prostitution. Daley offers Sam a job, but he refuses. Daley then directs Sam to a basement room in the house where he meets up with Curtis, Trife's uncle. The two have a long-standing feud because Sam killed Trife and also set up Curtis for a 10-year stretch. Curtis is now out and tells Sam he's after revenge - not just against Sam, but also his family, despite Sam telling Curtis that he wants no trouble and just intends to live his life. After an initial struggle Sam leaves the property. He is caught on the street by Drew and some of Daley's other young thugs. Drew tells Sam that he's the one who shot Royston. In the nick of time, Henry turns up to help Sam escape. Hugs stabs one of the kids who let Sam get away as a warning to those who fail him.  As Sam and Henry escape, Sam realizes his family is in danger. He phones Kayla to suggest she take the kids to her mother's for the night, as he has to prepare for a job interview. Back with Kayla Sam finds out that a DVD of his sexual encounter with the mystery lady was delivered to his home. Sam protests that he was set up, but Kayla walks out. Sam reaches out for help to his old volunteer PC friend Desmond 'Buds' Lynch, now a detective. Buds and a colleague go to the address where Sam was, but Daley belittles and threatens them for not having a warrant.  Curtis phones Sam, to further frighten him and his family. After the threatening call, Daley is furious that Sam has contacted the police and orders Curtis to speed things up by spilling the blood of Sam's family. Instead, Curtis and Hugs secretly conspire to kill Daley and take over the operation. Sam's mother is returning home when she sees a girl being attacked. The assailants promptly run away so Mrs. Peel helps the girl, Janette, into her flat. Janette claims she was robbed, but she still has her mobile phone and uses it to text someone. Meanwhile, Mrs. Peel calls Sam and tells him what's happening. Sam senses something amiss and asks Mum to describe the girl. After a brief description Mrs. Peel ends the call as the doorbell rings. Sam knows something is definitely wrong here and heads to the flat. Mrs. Peel asks Janette, the same girl who seduced Sam and works for Daley, not to open the door, but she lets in Curtis and Hugs. They threaten Mrs. Peel for what Sam has done, then Hugs pushes her off the balcony to her death. The police try to restrain a devastated Sam, but he attacks them and then is arrested. After Buds interrogates him, Sam is released without charge. He arranges and attends his mother's funeral and wake. Royston tells Sam that his fiancée is pregnant and they plan to move to America. After Sam and Kayla have sex following the funeral, she makes it clear that she and the kids are not coming home until Sam ends his involvement with Curtis and Daley.  Sam, vowing to kill Curtis and Daley, breaks into the gym planning to steal a gun he had spotted during his workout. The owner of the gym, named "Brick", catches and interrogates Sam, thinking he works for Mooks. Once Sam explains his intentions, Brick reveals that Mooks raped his little sister Sariya. Since then, he and his partner Calvin have been searching for Mooks to get revenge. They let Sam go and he again enlists Henry to help him. Henry has been lying to his partner to excuse time away from her and his son, who he wrongly thinks is not his. Henry tracks one of Daley's henchman to a café run by Sam's employer Hassan. With Hassan's help he learns where to find some of Daley's other henchmen. Meanwhile, Sam goes to a party and meets more of Daley's people, who direct him to a play-park. After taking some 'tools' from Henry's car, Sam goes to the play-park. Drew is there, getting a blowjob from a girl while two of his friends look on. Sam assaults Drew with a nail-gun until he tells Sam where Curtis and Daley are. Elsewhere, one of Drew's thugs, Yardz, threatens Henry with a hammer. Henry successfully persuades Yardz to change his life and walk away from involvement with Mooks.  Sam gathers some help, including Hassan, Henry, Brick, Sariya and Calvin, and goes to Daley's estate, where he finds both Hugs and Daley. Sam and his people storm the house, as armed police approach the scene. Heading upstairs, Sam finds a locked penthouse door and Janette outside. He knocks her out for everything she's done to help Daley and then kicks down the door. Meanwhile, Daley has known all along that Curtis and Hugs have been planning to double-cross him, so he stabs Hugs, killing him. When Sam gains entry to the penthouse, he finds Hugs' body and Daley gone. Sam pulls the knife from Hugs; just as the police arrive and find him there. The rest of Sam's crew have fled, but everyone left in the house - Sam, the prostitutes and rest of Daley's men - are all arrested.  Buds exerts his influence to exonerate Sam as the suspect for Hugs' murder, in return for his giving up Curtis, Daley and Mooks. Sam calls Curtis to arrange a meeting and settle this once and for all. They meet seemingly alone at an abandoned location to fight to the death. Sam overcomes Curtis and wrestles a gun from him. Instead of killing him as agreed, he empties the rounds from the clip, leaves the gun and bullets on the floor next to Curtis and walks away. Wounded, Curtis gets to his feet, picks up the gun, and loads a single bullet, but before he can shoot Sam, armed police gun him down and Sam goes back to confront Curtis. As he dies, Curtis manages to tell Sam where Daley is.  Sam tracks Daley to a flat where he's filled a bag with millions of pounds, ready to escape. To stop him from leaving, Sam switches on the light, revealing Brick, Sariya and Calvin. They unmask Daley as Mooks, the real boss, the one who had beaten and raped Sariya. Sam confronts Mooks for his actions, grabs the bag from him and leaves. Brick pulls out a pistol and silencer and shoots Mooks dead.  Safely away, Sam divides up the money with everyone who helped him get revenge on Curtis, Drew and Mooks. There's money for Royston and Alissa, too. Now strolling through a shopping mall with Kayla and the kids, Sam encounters Buds. The detective says Sam will get no more help from him but affirms they're still friends, warning him to stay out of trouble. As the family walks off, Sam tells Kayla, "It's done."

He is quickly arrested and sentenced to death, but his father's soldiers arrive and demand his release. When Yeung refuses to give in, and threatens to kill Cho on the spot, the soldiers declare that Yeung must release Cho in the morning, or else the entire town will be killed.  Two of the soldiers' commanders worry about Cho, and attempt to lead a squad in a rescue mission at night, to attack the prison and set Cho free, but the militia members successfully repel them.

While Yeung's friend is killed, Yeung manages to defeat Liu's men.

However, in the morning, when Cho's soldiers arrive and free him, they begin plundering the entire town and killing civilians indiscriminately. Yeung, his wife, and his few remaining followers fight back by bombing the soldiers' camp, setting traps within the town, and arming the surviving townsfolk so they can retaliate.

Phil introduces Bobby to his secretary Veronica, nicknamed Vonnie ([[Kristen Stewart]]), who is tasked with helping Bobby settle into Hollywood. Bobby is drawn to her unpretentiousness as opposed to most young women living in Hollywood, and falls deeply in love with her. She rebuffs his advances, telling him she has a journalist boyfriend named Doug. In reality, "Doug" is Phil, with whom Vonnie is carrying on an illicit romance; he promises to divorce his wife and marry her.  On the [[Wedding anniversary|first-year "paper anniversary"]] of their affair, Vonnie gives Phil a letter written and signed by [[Rudolph Valentino]] as a gift. However, Phil proceeds to tell her that he is incapable of divorcing his wife, so he ends the affair. Vonnie subsequently surrenders to Bobby's love for her and their friendship turns into a romance.  A forlorn Phil confides in Bobby about his affair—without naming his mistress—before telling him he has determined to divorce his wife. Bobby passingly mentions his relationship with Vonnie and his intention to marry her and return to New York. Phil begins petitioning Vonnie privately to leave Bobby and marry him instead.  While having a conversation with Phil in his office, Bobby notices the Valentino letter. Recognizing it from Vonnie's account about her breakup with "Doug", he confronts her and asks her to choose between himself and Phil. Vonnie chooses Phil.

It soon becomes a famous hangout for the rich and powerful, from politicians to gangsters. Bobby meets divorcée Veronica Hayes ([[Blake Lively]]) at the nightclub, and they begin dating, soon getting married and starting a family together.  On an extended visit to New York, a happily married Phil and Vonnie stop at the nightclub and insist on seeing Bobby. Vonnie has become a pretentious name-dropper and Bobby is at first repulsed by her. However, he agrees to show her around New York—as she had once done for him in Hollywood. They spend an evening without Phil, visiting Bobby's favorite haunts and, as dawn breaks over [[Central Park]], share a kiss; but it's clear that it can go no further.

His late brother's notoriety propels the nightclub to new heights, and Bobby travels to Los Angeles to contemplate opening a Hollywood version. He ultimately decides against it, but, before he leaves, he and Vonnie have lunch together, where she mentions that she and Phil will be returning to New York for a short visit. However, they both decide that it is better if they don't see each other.  Months later, on New Year's Eve, Bobby and Vonnie are apart—Bobby in New York City hosting festivities in his nightclub, and Vonnie with her husband at a Hollywood house party. As the new year is rung in, they both seem distant to their spouses, and both have a faraway look in their eyes.

Zahid, a Bosnian Muslim who chose his username ironically, refuses to wear gear that labels him as a terrorist. After he discovers the exit is now locked, Shelly convinces him to play, saying they understand he meant the name ironically.  Once everyone puts on their helmets, a computer simulation replaces the high-tech office building they are in with a post-apocalyptic, war-torn setting. A simulated sergeant enters and explains their goal: Russian terrorists have taken over each floor of the building, and they must clear a path to the bottom, starting at the 25th floor. Although relieved the terrorists are not Muslim, Zahid expresses regret in accepting the invitation, though the others are excited. The first level, a tutorial, is easily cleared, and Andre, a former soldier, takes the lead. The players are soon alarmed, however, when Carl is wounded and says the VR suit's feedback caused him actual pain. Taylor becomes increasingly panicked and reveals she took her friend's place. Shelly promises to protect her.  Suspicious of Andre's military background, Marco accuses him of being involved in the game's design. Upset, Andre leaves the group and is shot by a terrorist who has [[respawn]]ed.  The others find his body and realize their VR helmets have been programmed to deliver a lethal shock on their character's death. Zahid asks Carl to smash his helmet, which he can't remove.  Before they can get the helmet off, the sergeant enters the room, beats Zahid, and warns against further tampering. With no other choice, the players descend to the next level.  When Zahid and Carl attempt to break a window, the sergeant again appears, breaks Zahid's leg, and warns that the next violation will result in death. Zahid, recognizing that the others can not carry him all the way to the finish of the game, stays behind as the others continue. After the players clear several levels, Taylor becomes separated from the others and hides in a bathroom. Forced to defend herself, she kills a terrorist solo and becomes more confident. At the 9th floor, the sergeant reveals a captive terrorist and instructs the players to torture him for information. Edward volunteers, and, after several jolts of electricity, the captive gives up a password. When Adam inputs it to a computer console, it arms a bomb in the basement and starts a 30 minute countdown. Marco becomes aggressive toward Adam, whom he blames for making their situation worse.  Marco and Adam descend further while Shelly, Carl, Edward and Taylor continue clearing an upper level. Marco uses Adam as bait for the terrorists, leaving Adam to die when he is shot.  When the others reach his position, Marco kills Taylor to take a medical kit from her. Seeing "Atlas" written in Taylor's own blood, Carl attacks Marco and damages his helmet, causing the sergeant to walk in and kill Marco.  Carl, Shelly, and Edward descend to the basement floor. After taking out 4 terrorists, one terrorist (the game’s boss) with a bipod-mounted machine gun shot both Carl and Shelly. Carl sacrifices himself to save Shelly by using the group's last medical kit on her; she holds his hand as his helmet kills him. Ignoring the others, Edward takes out the machine gunner with a rocket launcher and stops the countdown just before it goes off. Excited, Edward recites the sergeant's victory speech with him. As security guards enter the room, they tranquilize Shelly as she discovers that Edward works for the game company. Shelly wakes up earlier than expected, and Edward instructs the guards to giver her another dose. When Shelly threatens to reveal Edward's involvement in the murders, he says nobody will believe her. Shelly instead is able to inject the guard with the tranquilizer and grabs his pistol, with which she kills the remaining guards in a firefight. Edward appeals for mercy and offers a bribe, but she kills him and leaves.  
Captain America: Civil War
   In 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes|James "Bucky" Barnes]] is dispatched from a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] base in [[Siberia]] to intercept an automobile carrying a case of [[Super-Soldier Serum|super-soldier serum]]. In the present day, approximately one year after [[Ultron]]'s defeat in the nation of Sokovia at the hands of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]], [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] stop [[Crossbones (comics)|Brock Rumlow]] from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically contains the explosion and throws it upward, damaging a nearby building and killing several [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] humanitarian workers.  [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Meanwhile, [[Helmut Zemo]] tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a conference in [[Vienna]] where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King [[T'Chaka]] of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]], vows to kill. Informed by [[Sharon Carter]] of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended.  Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in [[Suspended animation|cryogenic stasis]]. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft prison]], while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff goes into exile.  Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Stark's armor]]. He departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.  In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a [[post-credits scene]], Parker tests a new gadget built by Stark.

Sally, meanwhile, has become immensely famous and wealthy after her comics about happy blue bunnies became popular after the end of the war. Ashley is now forced to work for her former assistant and attempts to begin painting again, only to find she is physically unable to do so because of her injuries, meaning her art career is ruined forever. Ashley has lost everything - just as Veronica did.  One night, Ashley asks Sally why she is being nice to her, and Sally unapologetically admits that she enjoys seeing Ashley so miserable because of the cruel treatment she received while working for her. Enraged, Ashley begins destroying the few possessions she has left, only to discover a bus ticket to Pennsylvania. Ashley realizes that the bus ticket belongs to Veronica. During the last two years, Veronica has been caring for her Aunt Charlie out in the middle of the woods, and has come to enjoy living away from the rest of the world. Veronica is surprised when Ashley suddenly appears at her home. Ashley blames Veronica for her misery, and intends to "destroy" her. Veronica calmly offers to make her breakfast beforehand, and Ashley reluctantly accepts.  While the two women eat, they discover that they have some things in common - they both hated the war with the Middle East, but didn't let that hate stop them from profiting off of it, and both of them deeply miss their lost children. Veronica shows Ashley the camera full of recordings made by Kip while he was deployed, and confesses that watching the clips makes her feel like her son is still with her, and has helped her overcome her anger and sadness towards Ashley. Ashley is moved, and for a moment it seems as though the two will be able to reconcile. However, Ashley accidentally spills her coffee onto the camera, frying it. Veronica freaks out, revealing she never backed up the files on the camera, and blames Ashley for destroying it. Ashley gets mad and calls Veronica an idiot. The two begin fighting for the third time, taking their brawl from the house and into the woods. The fight starts out just as brutal as their previous fights, but it soon loses all passion, and the two women end up just sitting on the ground punching each other over and over again as they both break down sobbing.  Aunt Charlie watches the two fight from the window. The video camera suddenly reboots, revealing it wasn't broken after all, and showing that all of Ashley and Veronica's fighting is completely pointless.

Characterz
 The story begins [[in medias res]] with Tucker being arrested while in costume, and then the bulk of the rest of the story is told as a buildup to that event.  Tucker Ostrowski recently graduated from a college in central Florida with an Associate of Arts degree, and is accepted to [[California Institute of the Arts]], as he wants to go into music creation, animation, or theme park design. However, his parents recently filed for personal bankruptcy, so he cannot count on their money to pay for tuition. So, he needs to get a job to pay his own way, but has a criminal record because of a charge of vandalism in his teenage years. He just has to do community service, and expect it to be expunged from his record in two months, but the big parks in the area all do background checks. He looks into other jobs without success before finding that the [[amusement park]] Old Time Fun Town is hiring.  He goes to the theme park and is accepted on the spot from Mr. Lloyd, the hiring manager, with literally no questions asked, and Tucker isn't even sure what job he has accepted at first. He finds he has accepted a job as a theme park [[mascot]], Hoppy the Kangaroo, and immediately meets two-week-long veteran Jerry, a former high school mascot performer, who is working as Cap'n Jack's Parrot. Given the low budget nature of the park, Tucker is sent out to interact with the patrons immediately. With no training, he finds he has to learn the job as he goes, but finds that he is enjoying the work regardless. At lunchtime, Tucker meets Stu, who performs as Paws the Pink Polar Bear. Tucker, Stu, and Jerry discuss park operations. The park general manager, Benjamin Fletcher, is a vaguely shady but oddly affable manager who knows all the employees by name. It's also well-known that he plays poker with some "notorious types" but Tucker is grateful for the job and thinks nothing of it.   The second day on the job, before starting work, Jerry and Tucker watch news but ignore mention of a string of daring daylight robberies where the perpetrators are "elaborately disguised." Jerry has to go off to advertise for the park before it opens and relieve Sam, who comes to the break room dressed as Bowser the Bulldog. Tucker helps Sam get out of costume and is surprised to learn that Sam is short for Samantha, not Samuel as he assumed. Sam works part time at the park, and her other job is working at the Haven House.  Mr. Fletcher wants to address the entire staff. He informs the park staff that when he joined park management the previous summer, he promised to increase attendance and profits by offering quality games, rides, food, and merchandise. The end result was that the park had about the same attendance as the year before. He hopes to get attendance and profits up through entertainment. The park was successful when Hoppy was first introduced 15 years before, but the original performer died 12 years ago and the character was retired, and there were no costumed performers in the park since. Fletcher says that he plans to boost attendance by reintroducing Hoppy and several other costumed performers. He then reveals that in addition to the four characters based on off-the-shelf costumes purchased from MaskUS, Inc., he has had the in-house art director Don Cluff design a large custom-made "Doby Mick" blue whale costume to support their marketing push.  However, the costume proves too large and unwieldy for the current four performers, so Benjamin Fletcher pulls in a favor and gets Franklin Jefferson Washington to wear the costume. He was a professional basketball player that got injured, then became the team's mascot, then was poached by Disney to play one of their tall characters, and then retired from that to start his own delivery business, likely selling drugs. The new character is a big hit with crowds and a huge draw. A few days later at Old Time Fun Town, the park employees practice for a Fourth of July parade. When it comes to the actual parade, it is extremely lackluster and takes less than a minute to pass.  After a hard day at work, Sam suggests that Tucker visit her at her other job at the Haven House and get a new perspective on the job. He finds that the house is a haven for retired people with various health and mental problems who cannot live independently. One of the people at the home is Lyle, a reclusive old man. Tucker is left alone with him and in attempting to strike up a conversation, he explains that he costumes as a kangaroo. Lyle explains that he was "attacked by a kangaroo two nights ago" who came up to him while he was at an ATM and robbed him of $400.  A few days later at the Haven House, Tucker shows Sam several rough animations he has made. Sam tells Tucker she got accepted into an [[Adult-gerontology nurse practitioner|adult-gerontological nurse practitioner]] program in Los Angeles. Tucker still wants to go to California Institute of the Arts, but is still extremely far from that goal financially. He explains why he wants to go there, and excitedly explains his plans. Sam points out that the seniors at Haven House never feel the sort of joy most people feel at an amusement park anymore, as their health problems severely limit their mobility.   Soon after, back at work Tucker learns Sam is spending a week in California to tour the campus. Stu is going to a [[cosplay]] [[Fan convention|convention]] over the weekend, leaving just Tucker and Jerry to cover the park schedule. Tucker has to cover for Stu for an offsite event at a private party that specifically requested the bird and polar bear costumes. Tucker is wary of covering for him, as Stu is known to be the sweatiest of the group, and Paws the Pink Polar Bear reeks even after intense cleaning, and Tucker won't have time to even attempt to clean it. Tucker and Jerry arrive at the party and are told that all they have to do are greet the guests. They both learn that it's actually a [[Furry fandom|furry]] party, and after they are done greeting guests, check around back to see what goes on at that sort of party. They are surprised to find it is a very tame and normal party. Back in the car, they see a police car speeding past, and checking the radio and find that the sixth in a string of robberies occurred, with this one being a bank heist.  In Tucker's free time, Tucker has started a personal project of creating entertainment for the seniors at the Haven House, despite his parents having pawned or sold almost all their tools. Tucker buys new power tools, but as his parents’ financial situation becomes even more dire, his parents lose electricity, leaving him to attempt work by himself with hand tools. Tucker lets Jerry in on his plan, and he suggests getting help from the landscaping crew. They agree to help, and suggest using a large variety of construction supplies and old props that Old Time Fun Town has had in storage for decades. Tucker and Jerry also find the original head of Hoppy, and backup costumes for the rest of the characters, including Paws the Polar Bear. When Sam returns from her trip and goes to the Haven House, Tucker reveals that he designed and helped build a Tunnel of Love for the seniors, designed to be ridden in wheel chairs.  The next day while working Tucker is arrested in costume, as well as Jerry, Sam, and Stu. They all assume that they are arrested for borrowing the items from the warehouse, as they did not inform Benjamin Fletcher of their plan. When they are questioned at the station, the detective shows them videos from the recent crime spree, which show people dressed in their same costumes committing robberies. However, all of their alibis check out and they are free to go, except for Stu, who is kept for further questioning and released later.  Jerry suspects that the people in the costumes worked for park operations. Tucker, Jerry, and Sam know that if they can get the backup costumes from the park's warehouse to the police, the police can test the sweat in the costumes. Since none of them have worn those sets of costumes, they can get the sweat in the costumes matched to the park employees to discover whoever was trying to use them as patsies to be blamed for the crimes. However, Tucker, Jerry, and Sam suspect that the warehouse will be watched closely, and enlist the help of the seniors from the Haven House to help distract park operations so they can remove the costumes from the warehouse. However, despite the distractions, half of park operations is already there, about to take the duplicate costumes to the incinerator. Jerry reveals that Stu told Benjamin Fletcher of his suspicions, but Mr. Fletcher arrives and reveals that he was the mastermind behind the whole plan, and park operations engaged with the crimes with his blessings so he could take a cut of the money, though bank robbing was too extreme for him. The park operations employees approach Tucker, Jerry, and Sam to restrain them, but George the Janitor arrives and beats them back. The police detective enters and stops the fight. The entire park operations team is taken in for questioning, as well as Benjamin Fletcher. The police also take the costumes as evidence, so the performers make do by buying other off the shelf costumes or borrowing them from friends, though Tucker is able to use the original Hoppy the Kangaroo costume, as that one wasn’t worn by anyone in 12 years.  After the summer is over, Stu starts a furry cosplay costume company and brings on Tucker's parents as sales agents. Jerry gets a promotion to director of entertainment at the park and the next summer creates a hit musical on Fletcher's old stage. Sam goes off to California for college, and Tucker is able to go to the California Institute of the Arts, as the grateful seniors at the Haven House all pitch in for a college fund.

Fearing for her life and Joker's mental well being, she denounced her relationship to Joker, which led to him asking about what happened in the future. Zixia revealed to him that, due to the fact that she left a mark in Joker's heart, leading to Pak Jing Jing realizing that Joker will eventually stop having feelings for her, leading him to fall for Zixia. However, Zixia withheld the information about Joker being the Monkey King's reincarnation and tried to make things right by forcing Joker into meeting with Pak Jing Jing much earlier than in the original timeline. Unfortunately, Joker had already stopped having feelings for Jing-Jing and prevented Zixia's plan from going any further resulting in a slap from Zixia. After having a talk with Qingxia (Zixia's twin sister stuck in Zixia's body), Zixia decided to go the Bull King and marry him so Joker can stop falling for her so she left Joker - who was looking for her after being slapped - alone by himself.  Joker, now by himself, continues his search for Zixia in the desert, where he witnessed this timeline's version of the Monkey King being subdued by Guanyin, with the difference being that the Longevity Monk used the Pandora's Box to escape from being killed by the Monkey King and the time to subdue the Monkey King took longer than expected. After Guanyin left with the subdued Monkey King, Joker found himself left with the returning Longevity Monk and both were caught together by the Bull King, being happy about having a second wife and the Longevity Monk being captured. Meanwhile in Heaven, Guanyin handed over the subdued Monkey King to the Jade Emperor, discussing about the overwhelming presence of Yaoguai and fearing that the Sealed Book had a mistake in it, which Jade Emperor reassures her that the Book was never wrong. As Guanyin left to report the progress to the Buddha, the Jade Emperor unsealed the Monkey King, who is revealed to be the [[List of Journey to the West characters#Six Eared Macaque|Six-Eared Monkey]], revealing that the Sealed Book did not mention about the Monkey King in the initial pilgrimage at all as he was born 500 hundred years later as Joker, causing the Jade Emperor to get the Six-Eared Monkey fill in the role until Joker arrived from the future. This eventually leads to the Jade Emperor betraying the Six-Eared Monkey and have him slowly burn in the Great Oven.  In the House of the Bull King, Zixia and Qingxia were talking about the possible married life with the Bull King, with Zixia realizing that the Pandora's Box was missing and suspecting that Qingxia had given it to the Six-Eared Monkey, with a flashback revealing that she was an ex-lover of his. Zixia was soon confronted with Princess Iron Fan and her son Red Kid, resulting in a fight between the two women, leading to Zixia being blown past the just arrived Bull King, Joker and Longevity Monk. The Bull King, realizing the trouble he's in, instructs Joker to take the Longevity Monk and Zixia to his sister, Xiang Xiang while he tries to stall the Princess for time. While on the run, Joker demands to know why Zixia left him alone whereas the Longevity Monk accidentally found a way by freeing one of the Bull King's Giant Bulls. The trio escaped, but were chased by Red Kid until both Joker and Logevity Monk accidentally stole his fire wheels.  Upon arriving at Xiang Xiang's Palace, the trio met with Xiang Xiang and, much to their horror, witnessed her devouring a man whole. Xiang Xiang challenged the trio and defeated them, leading them to be locked up in the dungeon. It was there that Zixia tells Joker about her demise in the original timeline, and why she tried so hard to stop Joker developing feelings for her. At the same time, the Bull King arrived to reconcile with Xiang Xiang about the execution of her lover, Mantis, by his own hands, which she rejected as Mantis was the only true love to her. It was at this time that the Longevity Monk played the main theme of the entire A Chinese Odyssey series, leading to Joker and Zixia kissing at the end of the song. The Bull King and Xiang Xiang saw the silhouette of them kissing, causing the Bull siblings to burst into the dungeon only for the Longevity Monk taking Zixia's place. When Xiang Xiang saw this, she ended up drooling implying that she's interested in Joker, thus allowing the Bull King give his blessing to Joker for Xiang Xiang's hand in marriage.  While preparations for the Bull King's second wedding is underway, Joker and Xiang Xiang talked about Mantis and why doesn't she just use the Pandora's Box prevent his death from happening while the Bull King tried to impress Zixia. The Bull King asked Joker how to impress Zixia, with Joker using the Pandora's Box multiple times, the first few times to play a game on the Bull King, two times to get rid of the Bull King and Xiang Xiang, and once to get himself and Zixia away from the ceremony, only for the plan to backfire forcing all four of them to return. The Bull King, angry at the series of events, tries to kill Joker while Xiang Xiang chases after Zixia, only to have Zixia captured while Qingxia was forced out of Zixia's body. The Bull King was soon interrupted by the arrival of Princess Iron Fan and Red Kid, only for him and Red Kid to find out the Princess had an affair with the Monkey King, causing him to punish Joker and Zixia by forcing them to marry at the ceremony.  Meanwhile in Heaven, the Jade Emperor was shocked to find out the Sealed Book had changed, forcing him to free Six-Ear Monkey from the Great Oven, and accidentally reveal to him that the Longevity Monk is the Monkey and Qingxia's son and finding out that Qingxia knew everything about the mistake in the Sealed Book. Thus, the Jade Emperor allowed Qingxia to repossess her body and let Six-Eared Monkey to go rescue his son while still under the guise of the Monkey King. Six-Eared Monkey crashed the wedding, revealed that he started the affair with the Princess, while maintaining that Joker is not the Monkey King, and started battling with the entire Bull household, with Qingxia arriving later save Zixia from Xiang Xiang and trading places with Zixia in order for the prophecy to remain true, with a few changes. The battle ended up with the Bull siblings finally reconciled, with Xiang Xiang being forced to consume her brother just so to have a fighting chance against Six-Eared Monkey while the Heavenly Army provided backup for Six-Eared Monkey and Qingxia entering the fray, sustaining a blow in the process. As he saw this, Six-Eared Monkey breaks free from Xiang Xiang's grasp to grab Qingxia while the Heavenly Army and Li Jing dealt the final blow and sealed Xiang Xiang once and for all.  Five hundred years later, Six-Eared Monkey accompanied his son and his disciples on the pilgrimage, while Joker and Zixia watches on after kissing on the top of the wall, mentioning about Six-Eared wanting to be united with Qingxia as quickly as possible. A day in Heaven later, Longevity Monk became a Buddha while his parents stay together as the Wick for the Buddha's Lamp, only for their day interrupted by the Jade Emperor saying that the Sealed Book changed again.

Nowadays, due to the availability of the internet, we often do not realize that we are criminals of Intellectual Property Theft. Moreover, the artists who work so hard are not truly paid for their work as these sites providing us with the free songs and movies do not acknowledge the artists. As shown in the movie Pranabendu Bose is a victim to the modern-day technology. He is passionate about movies and his passion is not well understood by most of us in this generation including his own son, Prakash. Prakash sells illicit pirated movie CDs which angers Pranabendu so much so that the two do not speak living in the same house. Kamalini, the cinema hall owned by Pranabendu is abandoned as no one really goes to watch movies on the big screen and he ultimately burns down the hall with him in it in order to preserve the world of Cinema.

It is soon realized that David and Claire do not have amnesia but are dating and are simply playing a game. One day, Claire suddenly disappears.  After contacting her friends and workplace, David goes to the police.  Detective Sloan can offer little hope beyond posting missing person flyers.  A year later, Claire's friend Buck shows up.  While they are out discussing Claire, David drunkenly insists Buck dare him to jump from a ledge.  The next morning, Buck says he must make a flight that afternoon, and David allows Buck to stay at his apartment while he does chores.  Instead, David rides the bus through the city, reminiscing about Claire.  The bus driver forces him off the bus at the last stop, and David returns home early.  David surprises Buck, who has trashed the apartment while searching for something.  Buck knocks David unconscious and leaves.  After contacting the police, Detective Sloan agrees to look into Buck and Claire.  Looking for clues Buck may have missed, David finds a hidden cache of pictures.  These lead him to an automotive wrecking yard.  While exploring it and questioning employees, he draws the attention of an accented man in a back room.  Although initially friendly, he demands to know why David has come to his store to look for a missing person.  When David does not answer to his satisfaction, the man tortures him with an electric prod.  Finally satisfied, the man releases David and says he may not like what he finds.  The next day, David surprises a man, Aleksandr, who breaks into his house. After subduing Aleksandr, David learns he is a mobster based at the automotive wrecking yard who has been dispatched to learn more about David. Aleksandr says Claire killed his brother, and he intends to kill her if he finds her. Before David can finish interrogating Aleksandr, Sloan interrupts him.  Sloan says his investigation into Claire and Buck has turned up nothing – neither are apparently who they say they are. Sloan suggests Claire is troubled and advises David to forget about her.  Questioning Aleksandr further leads David to search Vancouver for clues, though Aleksandr says the mob will be looking for him now.  In Vancouver, David questions a businessman's widow after finding his face among Claire's pictures.  It turns up nothing, but a limo begins following David, who panics and flees into the woods.  A man chases him on foot, and David launches a surprise attack on him, crippling him.  The SUV stops him before he can flee further and takes him to see Hall, who introduces himself as a U.S. government official.  Hall presents photographic evidence of Claire's death and asks David to stop researching her, saying the businessman's death was an assassination by Claire, and exposing her past could endanger David.  David initially agrees to stop but becomes suspicious of Hall.  Catching on, Hall announces he can no longer allow David to leave.  David causes the SUV  to crash and escapes.  He eventually finds a missing person photo of Claire under a different name and contacts a man who leads him to Buck, who is now going under the name Kyle.  David leads Buck, Alexandr, and Hall all to the same meeting spot.  While Hall's and Alexandr's men fight, David abducts Buck and demands he and Hall leave him alone.  Buck rejects his demands, saying that David does not understand what kind of mess he has gotten himself into.  Hall immediately afterward takes him hostage.  While David is being tortured for the location of Claire's pictures, someone breaks into Hall's warehouse and kills the guards, eventually revealing herself as Claire. Claire and David return to their house to retrieve Claire's pictures, which she explains is evidence that Hall is a double agent.  Before they can leave, however, Alexandr and Hall arrive outside. Both of them surround the house with armed assassins. The situation is patently hopeless. David and Claire resign themselves to going out in a blaze of glory. The final image is not of the deadly reality beyond the living room door, however, but of a dreamy reminiscence of a happier time that just may be running through both of their minds.  
Collateral Beauty
 Successful advertising executive Howard Inlet becomes clinically depressed after his young daughter's tragic death. He spends his time alone, rarely sleeping or eating, and at the office building domino chains and structures. His estranged friends and business partners, Whit Yardsham, Claire Wilson, and Simon Scott fear for Howard's mental health as well as their company's future, as Howard's behavior has cost them numerous high-profile clients and left them on the verge of bankruptcy. As the majority shareholder, Howard has also undermined their efforts to sell the company.  The trio hires a private investigator, Sally Price, to acquire evidence that Howard is unfit to run the company, allowing them to take control. Sally intercepts three letters written by Howard which he posted to the abstract concepts of Love, Time, and Death, and presents them to Whit, Claire, and Simon. They hire a trio of struggling actors – Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy – to masquerade as Death, Time, and Love to confront Howard about his letters. Their plan is for Sally to record these encounters and then digitally erase Amy, Raffi, and Brigitte to make Howard appear mentally unbalanced, enabling them to sell the company.  In preparation for their roles, Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy spend time with Simon, Claire, and Whit, who are going through personal problems of their own: Simon is battling cancer in secret; Whit is struggling to connect with his pre-teen daughter Allison after cheating on her mother; and Claire is looking for [[sperm donor]]s to conceive a child after neglecting her private life for years.  After his encounters with Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy, Howard attends a grief support group and befriends Madeleine, who has lost her daughter, Olivia, to cancer, which led to the end of her marriage. As he meets with Madeleine, she shows him a note from her husband, "If only we could be strangers again..." To which her reply is, "And now we are." Howard tells her about his recent "conversations" with Death, Time, and Love. She tells him that on the day Olivia died, an old woman at the hospital had told her to notice the "Collateral Beauty", which she has learned to recognize as acts of selfless kindness that follow tragedies.  As the group is discussing the actors' performances, Amy storms out of the room because she feels guilty about manipulating Howard. Whit goes to convince her to return and declares romantic interest in her. She rejects him, but agrees to commit to their plan if Whit will make amends with his daughter, Allison. Simon similarly confides with Brigitte about his condition and his fear of death. She encourages him to share the burden with his family.  Amy, Raffi, and Brigitte confront Howard again, and he lashes out at them, particularly Amy, externalizing the pain he held inside since his daughter's death. Amy tells Howard he owes it to his daughter's existence to love and can't live without it. The next day, Howard attends a meeting with his company's board of directors in which footage of him yelling, with the actors digitally removed, is shown. Howard realizes his mental state and behavior are ruining the company. He voices his gratitude for all that his friends have done for him, and promises to be there in their times of need. He then signs documents to ensure the agency's survival.  After the meeting, a domino falls on its own, starting a chain reaction: Simon tells his wife about his health condition, and she comforts him. Claire meets with Raffi, and he states she will make a good mother someday. She says time has caught up to her, to which he replies that her battle with time isn't over yet.

Colossal (film)
 Gloria is an unemployed writer struggling with alcoholism. Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts.  Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian [[monster]] appears in [[Seoul]], leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and the creature's movements correspond with her own.  Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol.  After spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands that Gloria drinks, then orders her to do so by threatening to return to the playground if she does not. The next morning, a sobered-up Oscar confesses his remorse and pleads with Gloria to forgive him. Gloria accepts his apology, but Oscar's controlling attitude becomes clear.  Tim shows up in town on a pretense in order to see Gloria. Oscar provokes a confrontation that ends with him setting off a large firework inside the bar. He follows this up by boasting that, no matter how he behaves, he knows that Gloria will remain under his thumb. He later shows up at Gloria's house, telling her he is there to prevent her from going back to New York with Tim.  A flashback reveals how Gloria and Oscar are able to manifest their avatars in South Korea: a freak lightning flash struck both of them, a toy robot and a toy reptilian monster while they were passing through the playground when they were children. Gloria also realizes that Oscar has always been violent and manipulative because he hates himself, and resolves to leave town with Tim. Oscar, in response, heads for the playground. When Gloria follows, Oscar assaults her, leaving her on the ground while he terrorizes Seoul.  Upon returning to her house, Gloria comes up with a plan to stop Oscar. She flies to South Korea, apologizing to Tim for not coming with him. Once again at 8:05 am, U.S. time, Oscar causes the giant robot to manifest in Seoul. As she heads towards Oscar's avatar, Gloria causes her monster to appear again, this time at the playground back home. Clutching Oscar in her hand, Gloria's monster throws Oscar off into the distance, causing the giant robot to be launched into the sky, disappearing from Seoul.  Her mission accomplished, Gloria retreats to an empty bar in Seoul. Settling into her seat, Gloria promises the young waitress an incredible story. Offered a drink, Gloria simply lets out a long sigh.  
Cold War 2 (film)
  The Hong Kong Police Force holds a funeral for two superintendents killed during the previous film. Shortly after, the commissioner Sean Lau ([[Aaron Kwok]]) receives a call from one of the culprits behind the theft of the police van. He is told that his wife has been kidnapped and that he must release Joe Lee ([[Eddie Peng]]) for her to survive. Lau overrides standard procedure to transfer Joe out of prison, and is told by the kidnapper to bring Joe to the metro station. There, Joe is able to escape with the aid of several accomplices, one of whom sets off a bomb. The culprits leave Lau's wife alive at the station.  Lau's actions are criticized by the media and by numerous politicians, leading to a public inquiry. Fearing that the police have been infiltrated, Lau privately requests Billy Cheung ([[Aarif Rahman]]), an ICAC agent, to form a separate squad independent of the police, so they can track down the culprits. Meanwhile, MB Lee ([[Tony Leung Ka-fai|Tony Leung]]), a deputy police commissioner who is about to retire, who is also the father of Joe, is confronted by his fugitive son along with Peter Choi (Chang Kuo-chu), a former commissioner who is now manipulating politics behind the scenes. Choi is revealed as the mastermind behind the troubles of the previous film, and his current goal is to remove Lau, who is not a member of his ring, and to place his own followers into positions of power during the next election. Choi has formed a militant band consisting of former police officers who were expelled or faked their own deaths. He promises Lee not only the position of commissioner, but also of security secretary later on, upon which Lee gives into temptation.  A legislator named Oswald Kan ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) is convinced by his old friend Lai ([[Waise Lee]]), the secretary of justice, to participate in the public inquiry into Lau, but is taken aback when Lee openly criticizes Lau, rather than defending him. Kan deduces that Lee is being controlled, and tells his pupils to investigate, one of whom, Bella Au ([[Janice Man]]), decides to secretly follow Lee, and later Choi whom Lee confers with. Realizing that they are being followed, Choi orders a subordinate to crash into Au's car, causing a chain collision in which Au is killed, and Choi's car is trapped. Lau arrives to investigate, and a shoot-out occurs, in which Joe is shot and severely injured by Lau, but Choi escapes. Kan finds a photograph taken by Au of Choi and Lee together.  Lau's independent squad finds the location of Choi's remaining henchmen and the stolen police van. Lee, meanwhile, convinces or bribes several senior police officers to sign a petition for Lau's removal. In the final hours before Lau steps down, he launches a raid on the henchmen, and requests that Lee take command, noting that, since the henchmen are renegade police officers formerly under Lee, Lee would best know their strategies. Lee accepts, knowing that he cannot refuse without looking weak, but since he is secretly close friends with those henchmen, killing them taxes him emotionally. The operation is a success, with all suspects killed, and Kan and Lau report Lee's and Choi's crimes to the chief executive, who decides to grant amnesty to Lee and Choi, since they are too important to arrest without destabilizing society. Lee is forced into retirement, and Choi is permanently exiled from Hong Kong, but otherwise, their exact crimes are never disclosed to the public. Lau retains his office as commissioner, and Lee visits his son, who is in custody, and lying in a bed at the hospital.

While researching Tom (Shannon), she plans an interaction with his colleague, Clyde at their work cafeteria. She tells Clyde a story of her being a biologist and how she spent the last few years in Tasmania, Australia. She also explains why she is back in NYC. She tells him about a new species of a frog on Long Island. Clyde, obviously taken with Alice, invites her to Tom's birthday party.  Later that night, Tom and his wife Ramina are getting ready for their friends to come over for dinner. Ramina is a jewelry designer and was recently accepted into a design program in San Diego. The two start to bicker as Tom mentions that a committee meeting for a project at work isn't going to be held until September,  therefore bringing up the move to CA. Tom leaves to go to the bakery as his friends arrive to fix the spelling of his name on the cake. Clyde arrives with Alice and she is quite a hit with his friends, talking about the new species of frog and her work in Australia. As Tom makes a toast to his friends, he sees Alice and is stunned to see her. She introduces herself and the group have dinner. Alice discusses her travels to Mexico as a teen and how she changed her name from Jennifer, therefore beginning her change of identities. Some of the friends in the group question her choices. Alice also says that she hasn't seen her parents since she left her home since she has never been back. Taken back by her way of life, Clyde is shocked as he didn't know this. Later on the balcony, Tom confronts Alice, calling her Jenny and tells her that he thought she was dead. He also says that she just took off and have had no contact in 15 years. He asks what she wants and asks if she has been home to see her parents since her father once begged Tom to tell him where Alice/Jenny was. Alice explains that she tried to see her parents but couldn't leave the car and that her father died two years ago.  While lighting the candles for the cake, some of the friends in the group are divided in their opinion of Alice. They are either amazed at Alice's courage or angry that she could have so little compassion for those who care for her, particularly Tom. The topic of Ramina moving to CA comes up and she and Tom tell their friends that they are not sure what to do as it is a tough situation. Tom gets angry at his friends butting into his marriage and tells the group they should all go dancing.  While at the club, Alice does a magic trick with olives at the bar and explains that she toured China for a few months as a magician's assistant. Clyde confronts her as that is not what she told him previously, catching her in a lie. The other friends soon turn on her and ask if she just made that all up. Alice grabs her bag and decides to leave. Tom runs after her and asks her if she has actually been to Australia and Alice explains why she does what she does. She says that once something feels too familiar, she decides to start fresh and has done so nine different times. New cities, new names and new professions. The two run into Nina (Bates) while she is walking her dog. Nina falls and sprains her ankle. Tom and Alice help Nina home. There, Alice says that she is a Cardiologist and that Tom is also a doctor. The two meet Roger (Glover) and Tom soon enjoys the whole process of pretending to be someone else. Alice explains that they met in college, but are not together and Tom is married to Ramina. While looking at Nina's back at her request, Tom is suddenly shaken and the two decide to leave.  Later, Tom and Alice discuss the past, particularly how Tom didn't want to be responsible for Alice leaving school since she was supposed to 'have this whole life.' Alice discusses how he looked at her so differently once he found out that she was a piano prodigy. She explains the intense pressure she was under and how she didn't know anything but piano. Alice talks about why she disappeared and Tom tells her that he was jealous of her since she was so driven. He also talks about his dissatisfaction of his job and how he feels that if he left it all, he would feel like a failure. He asks her if she made everything about the frogs and Australia up and she says no. He asks her to show him who she really is now.  Alice takes Tom to the lab where she works. He meets her lab partner James. There they both dress to go out and hear the frogs sing. After they both walk in the woods and hear the frogs, they begin to head back to the city. Alice removes the picture from her desk and looks around the lab as if she is going to leave once more. While on the train, Tom asks what is next and asks her if he can see how she leaves and becomes someone else. As Alice packs her things, Tom asks her how she keeps track of all her identities. She says that 'keeping track isn't that hard part and that the hard part is when everyone around you thinks they know who you are and they try to lay claim to you and you are trapped.' Tom tells her to stop doing it, she laughs. He tells her that all of these people she tries to be are actually just her. Alice asks Tom to come with her, but he says no. As they say goodbye outside her building, Tom says it was good to see her again. The two parts ways and Tom returns home to Ramina. He says to Ramina " Um, about California. I've been thinking." The scene then cuts away, leaving the movie viewer to question whether or not Tom will actually go with Ramina to California, and whether or not their marriage survives his encounter with Alice.  The scene then changes to Alice in a bus station, train station, or airport bathroom.  She is getting rid of all her credit cards, but keeps her New York State Drivers license.  She puts it in her notebook that she has keep through the years to chronicle all her identity changes. The film ends with Alice disappearing into a crowd of people on a busy street wearing a dark, heavy coat, her hair down. She is walking away from the camera. Then, after she slowly disappears into the crowd of people, and you can't see her anymore, she reappears walking towards the camera, hair up, wearing a different outfit, a white vest with a white shirt underneath.  This leaves the viewer to decide whether or not she was walking on the streets of New York City and had decided to stay in order to pursue Tom and perhaps build a future together with him, or whether or not she was in a different city developing a new identity.

During a [[Séance|seance]], Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders. A demonic nun figure appears and lures her to the basement, where she witnesses Ed being impaled before breaking out of the vision.  In 1977, the Hodgson family begins to experience [[Enfield Poltergeist|strange occurrences]] in their home in the [[London]] suburb of [[Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Enfield]]. Janet, the second oldest of four children, is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity in the form of an angry elderly man, who insists that the house is his. Eventually, all the Hodgson siblings and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes, forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors. When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons, Janet is possessed by the spirit of the elderly man, Bill Wilkins, who is revealed to have previously lived and died in the house. During the [[Demonic possession|possession]], Wilkins states that he enjoys tormenting the family and wants to reclaim his home. As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession, the story eventually reaches the Warrens, and their assistance is requested to assist the local church in an investigation to prove whether or not Janet's possession is a hoax. Lorraine, fearful that her vision of Ed's death may become reality, warns him not to get too involved in the case, but she reluctantly agrees to travel to London with him. She has yet another vision of the demonic nun in Ed's study wherein the demon says its name, which Lorraine scribbles in her Bible.  While staying at the Hodgson residence, Ed and Lorraine consult with other paranormal investigators, including [[Maurice Grosse]] and [[Anita Gregory]], on the legitimacy of the case. They also attempt to communicate with Wilkins' spirit, hoping to convince him to stop haunting the family. One night, after the Hodgsons witness Janet being possessed, Gregory presents video evidence of Janet purposely wrecking the kitchen as if for a [[practical joke]], thereby discrediting the haunting. Based on this discovery, Ed and Lorraine feel they have no choice but to leave the family on their own but soon discover that the spirit of Wilkins is only a pawn being manipulated by the demonic nun, to haunt Janet and break her will. Lorraine then realizes that her abilities have been blocked by the demonic nun, preventing her from grasping the truth of Janet's possession.  Ed and Lorraine quickly return to the Hodgson residence, only to find Janet being possessed once more and the rest of the Hodgsons locked outside the house. Ed ventures inside the house alone. A lightning strike hits a tree near the house, leaving a jagged stump resembling the object that impaled Ed in Lorraine's vision. Ed finds Janet standing near the window, ready to leap onto the stump and commit suicide. He manages to grab Janet in time, but finds himself holding onto a curtain that is being torn from its rings by his and Janet's weight. Lorraine remembers that she wrote the demon's name – [[Valac|Valak]] – in her Bible. She enters the house and confronts Valak, addressing it by name and successfully condemns it back to [[Hell]]. Janet is freed of its possession, and Lorraine pulls her and Ed to safety.  After returning home to the United States, Ed adds an item to his and Lorraine's collection – [[There Was a Crooked Man#In popular culture|"The Crooked Man"]] [[zoetrope]] toy owned by Peggy's youngest child Billy – placing it near [[The Conjuring|April's music box]] and the [[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle doll]].

Contratiempo
 Adrián Doria, a handsome young businessman is accused of the murder of his mistress, a young photographer named Laura Vidal. In pursuit of a defense against conviction for her murder, his lawyer, Félix Leiva engages the services of a prestigious defense attorney, Virginia Goodman. Adrian is placed under house arrest and Virginia visits him late one evening, claiming that the prosecutor has a new witness and the judge might be having the trial tonight.   Adrian tells Virginia how he and Laura had decided to end their affair months ago. However, they received a call blackmailing them to come to a hotel far away from the city with 100 000 Euros. At the hotel, Adrian and Laura realize that it is a trap and they try to leave. However, Adrian is knocked down unconscious by an unseen person. When he awakes, he finds Laura dead in the bathroom with his money all over her body. The police arrive and find the room door locked from the inside and break in. The windows are also shut manually during winter. Since there is no way someone else could have entered the room and left undetected, Adrian is arrested for Laura's murder. Virginia points out Adrian is not telling her the whole truth and makes him tell her the entire story.   Adrian then narrates how he came back to Spain after a business trip to Paris. However, instead of going home straight to his wife and young daughter, he went to the outskirts of town for a rendezvous with Laura. On their way home to the city, they get involved in a collision with another car. Although they are unhurt, the driver of the other car, a young bank worker named Daniel Garrido, dies at the scene. Laura rationalizes that it is not entirely their fault since Daniel was texting while driving and did not have his seat belt on. While another car passes by, Adrian and Laura pretend like nothing happens and the driver leaves. While trying to flee the scene, Adrian's car engine dies off. Laura waits for help while Adrian leaves with Daniel's car to get rid of it and the body. He disposes of it by driving it into a lake. He then texts Laura his location and she comes to fetch him with his car, now repaired.   When Adrian asks Laura how she got his car fixed, she tells him a much more horrific story. A middle-aged man claiming to be a mechanic drives by and offers Laura help. He tows Adrian's car and drives her to his house where she rests while he fixes her car. A paranoid Laura lies to the mechanic that her name is Raquel and she owns a bookstore. While talking to the mechanic's wife, Laura sees some photographs on the wall and realizes that she is at the home of Daniel Garrido and the mechanic and his wife are his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Garrido. Laura, who has Daniel's phone in her pocket, hides it in the couch. Mrs. Garrido finds it and assumes her son left their house without it. As Laura leaves in Adrian's car, Mr. Garrido notices her adjusting her seat, proving that she was not truthful when she claimed she was alone earlier. He notes down the car's number plates as it leaves his compound. Laura picks up Adrian and they go to sell off his car before reporting it stolen. Back in the city, they part ways, promising to never meet again.   During the next few days, Adrian tries to put the incident behind him and focus on a new business deal that will expand his company's business in Asia. Before the deal can be signed, he is summoned to the police station. Mr. Garrido has reported his plate number to the police. Felix arranges for a false alibi in Paris and warns Adrian from hiding anything from him ever again. Felix also bribes the police to get rid of Adrian's case file to prevent any gossip that might taint his reputation and affect the business deal. As a result, the Asian deal is a success and Adrian is named Young Businessman of The Year by the government. During the award ceremony, he is visited by Mr. Garrido who tries to make him admit the truth. Security removes him from the ballroom and Adrian continues to live his life as usual.   A few weeks later, Adrian learns from the news that the police have evidence Daniel Garrido is on the run from the police after a huge sum of money from the bank he was working for was transferred into his account. Adrian confronts Laura about this and she admits that she not only took Daniel's phone but his wallet too before hiding his body in the car boot. With his security details, she hacked into his account and stole his money in order to create a distraction for the police. Adrian tells her that what she is doing is wrong and they should surrender to the police. Laura refuses to comply and threatens to frame him if he goes to the police.   Days later, Adrian receives a photo of a lake and an audio recording instructing him and Laura to come to the hotel at the outskirts with the 100 000 Euros. Adrian and Laura do as they are told and the rest happened as he had told the police. However, Adrian reveals that he had seen the face of the man who hit him in the hotel room and it was indeed Mr. Garrido.   Virginia points out that Laura's latest medical reports show that she suffered from anxiety days before her murder and the jury will not believe someone like her who is feeling guilty could frame Daniel to save herself. Instead, it is much more plausible for it to be done by Adrian, who the prosecution would have known by now, bribed the local police to get rid of his case file. However, Virginia reveals that she believes Adrian's story because Mrs. Garrido works at that hotel too. She could have easily unlocked the room window for her husband to escape after killing Laura. Later, after the police have broken into the room to arrest Adrian, she could have walked in and locked the window, making it seem like nobody could have come in and left.   Now, in order to prove that the Garridos are behind Laura's murder, Virginia states that Adrian needs to confess to disposing of Daniel Garrido's body in order to establish their motive. Adrian marks the spot on a map for Virginia. He also reveals that before pushing Daniel and his car into the lake, he realized Daniel is still alive. By then, it is too late and Adrian pushes the car into the lake, killing Daniel. At this point, Virginia has come to realize Adrian is not a victim of his circumstance as he has painted himself to be. In fact, it was he who orchestrated the cover up of Daniel's murder and made it seem like Laura was the mastermind behind everything in order to save himself. Virginia can no longer bring herself to sympathize with Adrian but is still determined to save him and her reputation.   Just then, Felix calls and informs them that the prosecution's star witness is actually the driver that passed by Adrian and Laura that day. Felix has bribed him to remain silent and he will not testify for the prosecution any longer. With everything settled, Virginia leaves the apartment. At that moment, Adrian realizes the pen she gave him is actually bugged and has been secretly recording their entire conversation. Virginia then goes to the building opposite the apartment and reveals herself to be Mrs. Garrido in disguise. She had successfully recorded Adrian's confession along with the location of her son's body. And Mr. Garrido calls the police saying he has the information about his son's death. At that moment, the real Virginia Goodman arrives at Adrian's apartment (at the real time they set their appointment). By then, Adrian realizes it is too late for him and his life is over.

Criminal (2016 film)
 When Spanish industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook—a [[hacker]] known as "the Dutchman"—to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes, the Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to the [[CIA]]. He makes contact with London-based agent Bill Pope, but although Pope is able to get the Dutchman to a [[safe house]] and recover the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman.  Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's CIA supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead man onto a living one. Keeping Pope's brain stimulated to preserve its knowledge, Franks requests that convict Jerico Stewart be the subject of the procedure, as Stewart's criminal behavior is the result of childhood brain trauma leaving him with an underdeveloped [[frontal lobe]], hindering his emotional development and impulse control, that they can use to "graft" Pope's knowledge into Stewart's mind.  While the process initially appears unsuccessful, Jerico is able to escape custody while being transferred after the operation, faking his death and heading to Pope's house, where he ties Pope's wife, Jillian, to her bed and gags her mouth with duct tape, is able to disable the house alarms and delay an investigation of the silent alarm which Jillian manages to activate. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can determine is that the bag of money was hidden behind a shelf of books relating to [[George Orwell]], without identifying where it or the Dutchman are kept.  The CIA becomes increasingly anxious to find the Dutchman when they learn that he is now planning to sell the program to the Russians, believing that the CIA has betrayed him. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks for medication using Pope's CIA codes, Franks's questioning confirming that Jerico is developing emotions as well as drawing on Pope's experience. As Jerico attempts to retrace the route Pope took to hide the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Quaker's attention, allowing Heimdahl's henchwoman Elsa to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge.  His leg injured in his escape, Jerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jillian and explains the situation to her. Although initially concerned, Jillian comes to accept Jerico's story as she sees him interacting with her daughter, Emma, allowing Jerico to stay the night. Jerico forms a bond with the two. The next morning, Jerico realizes through a conversation with Jillian that the bag is hidden in the rare books collection at the [[University of London]] where she works. He attempts to retrieve the bag, but he is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa once he has found it. Heimdahl forces him to take them to the Dutchman or he will kill Jillian and Emma.  With the CIA and a Russian strike team now seeking the Dutchman, Jerico—who has recalled that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university—is able to escape Elsa using an improvised [[nitro-glycerine]] bomb, returning to the office to provide a hurried explanation to the Dutchman. The two are caught by Elsa before they can escape, Jerico is shot in the shoulder and after she kills the Dutchman, Jerico knocks her out with a potted [[cactus]] before killing her by bashing her head in with a lamp.  Taking the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape, Jerico is able to save Jillian and Emma despite Quaker's protests about the danger Heimdahl could pose with the program. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, Jerico reveals to Quaker that he had the Dutchman reprogram the wormhole so that it would target the source of the next transmission, resulting in Heimdahl unwittingly destroying his own plane when he tries to fire a missile at the airfield.  A few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach where Pope and Jillian had their honeymoon, initially unresponsive to anything but automatic reflexes and responses. With all other options exhausted, Quaker and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him, the sight of Pope's family confirming that some part of Pope exists in Jerico when he responds with a nose-tap that was Pope and Jillian's way of saying "I love you" in private. Witnessing this, Quaker reflects that he will offer Jerico a job.  
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny
 After eighteen years of solitude, renowned warrior-maiden Shu Lien emerges from retirement and travels to [[Peking]], where the Green Destiny—the legendary sword of her deceased love Li Mu Bai—is located. In the forest, Shu Lien's carriage is attacked by several warriors from the West Lotus clan. As she fights them, a masked horseman comes to her aid, and together they defeat the attackers, revealing one's identity to be a young man called Wei Fang.  At the tower of the West Lotus warlord Hades Dai, a young woman named Snow Vase arrives asking to join his ranks. As Dai approaches, she draws a sword and attempts to kill him, although he easily fights her off, and she flees. As Wei Fang makes his way through the forest, he is approached by a blind enchantress, who orders him to take her to Dai. She tells Dai that his great sword is surpassed by the Green Destiny, and prophesies that if he is to rule the Martial World, he must obtain the sword. Dai is reluctant to storm the home of the emperor's brother, but the enchantress tells him to send Wei Fang, as the boy and the sword are bound by destiny itself.  Shu Lien arrives in Peking, and is taken to the house of Sir Te, a man like a father to her, who has recently died. Te's son greets her and reveals that the Green Destiny is kept on display at the house, also recalling the unmentioned love between Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien. That night as Wei Fang breaks into the house and attempts to steal the sword, Snow Vase appears and fights him. During the fight, Snow Vase sees a birthmark on Wei Fang's chest, which distracts her and allows him to escape. She calls for help and Shu Lien arrives and captures the boy. Snow Vase approaches Shu Lien and asks her to train her in the Iron Way.  At a tavern, Meng Sizhao (known as Silent Wolf in the West), the horseman who came to Shu Lien's aid, posts a warrant for warriors to join him protecting the House of Te. One warrior offers his twenty swordsmen for a high price, and attacks when rebuffed. Four warriors join Silent Wolf in the fight, and he recruits them to his cause: Flying Blade of [[Shandong|Shantung]]; Thunder Fist Chan, famed in [[Zhejiang]]; Silver Dart Shi, famed in [[Fuzhou]]; and Turtle Ma, famed in that tavern.  Shu Lien begins Snow Vase's training. That night, Silent Wolf and his warriors arrive at the Te compound.  Shu Lien is shocked to see Silent Wolf, her former betrothed, as he was thought to have been killed by Hades Dai many years before. He explains that he was in love with Shu Lien, but knew that Mu Bai was her true love, and had feigned his demise to seek a life of enlightenment in the mountains, as he knew that as long as he was alive, Li Mu Bai would not have asked Shu Lien for her hand.  Hades Dai rages that Wei Fang has failed in his raid, and sends his elite warrior, Mantis, to retrieve the sword. She arrives with her raiding party, and Silver Dart Shi and Turtle Ma are killed in the attack. Snow Vase attempts to free Wei Fang from his cage in the courtyard, but she is attacked by Mantis, and Wei Fang reveals the sword's location. The blind enchantress fights Shu Lien in the sword chamber, killing Sir Te's son when Shu Lien refuses to relinquish the sword.  As the inhabitants of the House of Te mourn the loss of their dearest companions, Snow Vase explains her connection to Wei Fang's past. His birth mother was the legendary swordswoman Han Mei. However, as a baby, he was swapped for the infant Snow Vase by her mother, a concubine. Han Mei raised Snow Vase as her own daughter, but never stopped looking for her son. Eventually finding him at West Lotus, she was mortally wounded by Hades Dai and, as she died, implored Snow Vase to find Wei Fang.  Knowing that Dai will send people to kill Wei Fang, Snow Vase frees him, and is horrified to later hear that he has stolen the sword. Silent Wolf tracks the boy down and they fight on a frozen lake. Wei Fang's master, Iron Crow, arrives and wounds Silent Wolf, allowing Wei Fang to escape and reach West Lotus. Wei Fang offers the sword to Hades Dai, but then attempts to kill him with it to avenge his mother. Shu Lien and the others arrive and fight Dai's army. Shu Lien fights the enchantress and kills her, using her skills to see through the witch's illusions. Mantis kills Flying Blade and Thunder Fist, then fights Snow Vase, who defeats her but is badly wounded. Silent Wolf fights Hades Dai on the tower, eventually killing the warlord with his own sword as he reaches for the Green Destiny.  Snow Vase survives her injuries, and joins Shu Lien, Silent Wolf and Wei Fang as they take the Green Destiny to the [[Wudang Mountains]] where it will be kept safe yet again.

Crayon Shin-chan: Fast Asleep! The Great Assault on Dreamy World!
 One night, the Nohara family were enjoying a pleasant dream, when suddenly a big fish appeared in their dreams and ate them. The next morning, Hiroshi read in the newspaper that everybody in another town had the same nightmare as him, but it seemed to have ended. But Hiroshi also heard the same dream from Misae, Shinnosuke, Himawari and even Shiro. They were surprised and thought if the same thing is happening in Kasukabe too. In kindergarten, on telling others about his nightmare, Shinnosuke was surprised to know that everybody too had the same dream.<br> Then a mysterious girl named Saki was transferred to Futaba Kindergarten and joined Shinnosuke's class. Everyone in the class, including the rather inactive Bo-chan, were all excited and happy on seeing her. But Saki had a cold attitude and didn't get along well.<br> That night, Shinnosuke and others were taken to a fantasy dreaming world (called ''Yumemi-World''). Shinnosuke could see all the Kasukabe Defense Group members. They were riding on big balls. Whatever they wished was granted. When Masao said that he wanted to be a manga-artist, the ball grew bigger and he was transformed into a manga artist. Kazama was a TV announcer and Nene was an actress and a singer. Shinnosuke wished for ''chocobi'' and sweets which was instantly granted. Then he wished to play with young attractive girls in swimsuits and was taken to a beach-like area where he could do all sorts of enjoyment.<br> While the kids had good dreams, Hiroshi, Misae and other adults too had nice dreams, but their dream was soon converted into nightmares. The dreaming power of children is big while that of adults is small. Adults were losing dreaming energy faster than the kids. When the dreaming power of kids was consumed, they too started having nightmares. The kids became disheartened and depressed when their dreams couldn't be fulfilled completely. Masao on losing all his manga started crying.<br>  The next day, the Kasukabe Defense Group held a meeting and decided to solve this problem of nightmares. Meanwhile, they were gradually befriending Saki. Then they asked Saki to join their group, to which she agreed. While Kazama was worrying about the cause of such nightmares, he came to realise that while everyone was having the same dream, Saki was not present. He also recalled that their dreams were being suck and converted into nightmares. Kazama gradually started to suspect that Saki and her family are the ones who are sucking up their good dreams.<br> Kazama went to Saki and questioned her about this. Shinnosuke told not to accuse Saki. But Saki finally decided to reveal the truth.<br> Saki had lost her mother in an accident when she was small. Her mother in order to protect Saki had sacrificed her life. Considering her mother's death to be her fault, Saki started having nightmares fearing that her mother is having a grudge against her. Saki's father, Nubatama Yumehiko, was worried about Saki and created a psychological magical world called the ''Yumemi-world''. To protect her from having nightmares, he absorbed all the good dreams from others and poured it into Saki's dream world so that she could have happy dreams. As a result, others' dream energy was sucked and they all started having nightmares.<br> Despite knowing all this, Saki said that she didn't want to upset her father and so she neither said anything to him or to others.<br> In the Yumemi-world, Saki always had a stuffed toy ''[[Baku (spirit)|baku]]''([[tapir]]) which ate all her nightmares. In Japanese mythology, the tapir (called "Baku") is a spirit that devours dreams and nightmares. Shinnosuke said that Baku must be existing somewhere and decided to find it together, but could not see it anywhere.<br> Meanwhile, Saki's father came to know about this and worrying about Saki, he interfered in their plan. Hiroshi and Misae too came to know about their plan. They said that children are pure in heart and adults shouldn't play with their feelings. They along with other adults decided to help the kids. In the dream, a grey old female monster appeared suddenly and swallowed Saki. Saki cried for her mother. Just then, the Yumemi-world broke and everybody woke up. But Saki was still in her dreams. So Shinnnosuke and the kids again slept, this time forming a circle around Saki and went into her dream.<br>  In Saki's dream, the monster was powerful. They fought with the monster. Shinnosuke transformed to a tapir, Nene to a crab, Kazama to an airplane, Bo-chan to a rock and Masao used a pen as a sword, but they couldn’t win. Shinnosuke being a tapir ate Saki's nightmare, but the nightmare was born again. Just then, little Saki, around the age when her mother had died, appeared and said to Saki, "Mom died because of you. She won’t forgive you. You can’t escape from nightmares."<br>  Seeing the children sleeping in torment, Misae couldn't resist and decided to go into their dream. Misae said that, "There is no such parent who doesn't care about their children. It is the duty of every parent to protect their children during trouble. For a parent, children are more important than themselves. Even if a mother hates her child for some reason, still the child is much precious than her own self." Misae being a mother herself fought the monster bravely and is able to defeat it.<br> Misae then embraced Saki explaining that parents never have a grudge against their children. She apologized for making her face sad and told that she is her dream and her smile is their power. Saki was able to accept her mother's death and was able to destroy the nightmare.<br> Then little Saki appeared again and asked if she was going to disappear. Saki said that since she was fine, little Saki can be inside her. So they two get unified into one. Seeing the nightmare getting disappeared, Kazama asked whether it was all over. Saki replied that it was still left but she is going to live better than before.<br>  In order to prevent others from getting further nighmares, Saki's father along with Saki moved to overseas. Everybody returned to their normal lifestyles. Later Shinnosuke and others received an overseas letter from Saki saying that she wants to meet them in her dreams. In the Kasukabe Defense Group meeting, they decided to meet Saki in their dream world and slept together that night in excitement.

A Cure for Wellness
 At a large financial services firm in New York City, an executive named Lockhart is sent by the company board of directors to retrieve Roland Pembroke, the company's CEO who had abruptly decided to stay at a "wellness center" in the [[Swiss Alps]]. The board needs Pembroke to sign off on an upcoming merger. The company is being investigated for criminal misconduct, and several self-serving partners hope to place all of the blame squarely upon Pembroke. Lockhart arrives at the spa, but he is met with resistance by the staff and Dr. Heinreich Volmer in attempting to speak with Pembroke.  Lockhart leaves but is involved in a car accident and supposedly awakens three days later at the center with his leg in a plaster cast.  Curiously, in spite of the truly horrendous nature of the accident, both he and the driver suffer from no other injuries but a minor scratch or two. During his time at the spa, Lockhart meets a mysterious young girl named Hannah, who, among others, doses herself with a mysterious fluid kept in a small, cobalt-colored bottle.  A patient named Victoria Watkins, as well as residents of the nearby town, regale a fascinated Lockhart with the history of the spa. It was built on the ruins of a castle once owned by a baron roughly 200 years ago. The baron desired an heir of pure blood and married his sister. When the baron learned she was infertile, he began performing hellish experiments on the peasants to find a cure for her infertility. He succeeded, but after finding the carelessly buried bodies of his victims, the peasants stormed the castle and set it on fire.  The baron's pregnant sister was captured by the peasants and the baby was cut from her womb before she was burned. Although the peasants tossed the baby into the local aquifer, it somehow survived. Lockhart attempts to escape the center but finds that no one is allowed to leave. After gifting Hannah a ballerina figurine, Lockhart bikes into town with her help. Lockhart leaves Hannah in a bar and seeks out a translator for Pembroke's German-language medical dossier.  He finds out that the people of the spa suffer from dehydration despite the quantities of water they imbibe from the aquifer.  Meanwhile, Hannah, who has been kept at the spa her entire life, explores the bar and attracts the attention of the locals.  Lockhart returns and gets into a fight with a man who was dancing with Hannah.  He is rescued by Dr. Volmer, who has discovered that Lockhart had left the spa with Hannah.  Everyone in the place is curiously cowed by Dr. Volmer.  Lockhart investigates his suspicions and discovers the transfusion wing of the spa is a front for macabre medical experiments. The water from the local aquifer possesses unique properties. It is very toxic to humans but has life restoring properties for the eels living in the water. The baron had devised a process to filter the water through the bodies of humans and distill it into a life giving essence.  Volmer uses the patients as filters for this process.  This "cure" is ingested by Hannah, Volmer, and his staff in order to gain vastly lengthened lifespans. Lockhart also realizes that his leg isn't broken and that he is being forcefully kept prisoner there. Volmer then subjects Lockhart to nightmarish treatments that warp his mind until he believes he is insane.  Hannah perceives this change and gives Lockhart back the ballerina figurine. This act helps to break him out of his delirium.  Around this time, Hannah has her first menstruation, and Volmer marries her. During the reception, he leads Hannah to a secret room built in the ruins of the castle and attempts to rape her. When Lockhart confronts Volmer he realizes that Volmer is the baron and Hannah is his daughter, the baby who was thrown into the well. They both had been aging very slowly due to the "cure". In the ensuing fight, Volmer's face is revealed to be a mask that hides his hideous burns. Lockhart sets Volmer and the castle on fire but is overpowered by Volmer all the same.  Hannah saves Lockhart by killing her father. He falls backwards into the aquifer and is eaten by the furiously voracious eels. Lockhart and Hannah escape from the premises on her bicycle as fire engulfs the structure. Not far down the road, Lockhart crashes into a car carrying his employers. They have arrived from New York to retrieve him and Pembroke. Lockhart is ordered into the car by the employers. Lockhart instead chooses to ride away with Hannah while sporting a grin on his face.

The Crucifixion (film)
 In Bucharest, 2004 Father Dumitru and several nuns perform a violent exorcism on Sister Adelina Marinescu, who is believed to be possessed by the demon Agares. Dumitru and four nuns are arrested for murder when the three-day ordeal culminates in the death of Adelina.  New York journalist Nicole Rawlins convinces her editor to let her investigate the case. He cautions Nicole to not allow her personal views on faith or the death of her mother to affect her objectivity.  Nicole begins by interviewing Father Dumitru in jail. Dumitru claims he could have saved Adelina, and she only died because Bishop Gornick interfered with the unauthorized rite’s completion.   At Adelina’s funeral, Nicole meets Adelina’s close friend Sister Vaduva, who insists the young nun wasn’t murdered. Nicole follows a secret passage into the underground chamber where the exorcism was performed, and takes pictures of the cross where Adelina died before Bishop Gornick throws her out.  She then meets local priest Father Anton, who identifies Sister Vaduva as well as Adelina’s brother Stefan Marinescu, whom Vaduva lives with on a nearby farm. Anton directs Nicole to speak directly to Bishop Gornick at St. Joseph’s Cathedral.  Bishop Gornick tells Nicole that Adelina was mentally ill, not possessed, then goes on to infer that Father Dumitru was a rogue priest who overzealously performed an inordinate amount of exorcisms. She then has a strange encounter with mute gypsy boy Tavian Amanar outside.  Nicole returns to Father Anton. Anton theorizes that the demon allowed Adelina to die because it no longer needed her and could transfer its evil into someone else for another possession.  Nicole begins having terrible nightmares as well as waking visions involving strange activity. Vaduva again tells Nicole that the demon killed Adelina. Vaduva recounts how the seeming suicide of Father Gabrielle, a close mentor who unexpectedly threw himself from the monastery’s bell tower, triggered Adelina’s transformation.  Over dinner with Father Anton, Nicole confides in him how she lost her faith when her terminally ill mother died following a decision to abandon medical treatment for trust in God. Anton warns that Nicole is an easy target for the demon.  Nicole has another odd encounter with Tavian on her way back to the hotel. Following a sexual fantasy involving Father Anton, Nicole wakes to a frightening vision of Adelina.  Another visit with Vaduva reveals that Adelina fell in love with a man who led her away from the church, but the relationship ended unexpectedly. Adelina’s plea for God’s forgiveness seemingly invited The Devil instead. Vaduva describes what Adelina’s exorcism was like.  Father Anton brings a bottle of wine to Nicole at her hotel as an apology for how he left things the night before.

 A serial killer stalks young women in Northern Wales.  Known as the Wedlock Killer, he chops off a finger before brutally murdering his victims.  Amid reports of a new victim, Laurie Wolf, a radio DJ, becomes bitter when her local radio program is cancelled and she has trouble finding a new job.  On the last day of her show, she rants to her listeners about the disappearance of local radio programs and ignores the corporate playlist.  Ben Evans, her engineer, suggests they have a psychic, Carla Zaza, as a guest.  Laurie, a sceptic, reluctantly agrees when Ben says it will further annoy the owners.  Before the broadcast begins, Kate Komisarczyk speaks with Ben over the internet,  upsetting her boyfriend, Nick Keller.  Though Kate has refused to meet Ben, Nick believes she is being naive by befriending people from the internet.  Kate and Nick leave her disabled son, Marek, with a babysitter.  Kate tells the babysitter she is visiting Ben to attend the radio broadcast, but she instead drives Nick to a house he intends to burgle.  Although Kate is nervous, Nick reassures her that they are not truly stealing anything, as the money is from a client who has refused to repay his debt.  Nick enters a nearby mansion and leaves Kate as lookout.  As she listens to Laurie's broadcast, she fails to notice a bloody and battered ghost has momentarily appeared in her car.  An old man surprises her when he approaches.  When he complains she is on private property, Kate says her boyfriend has gone to find a petrol station and will return shortly.  Dubious, the man insists on waiting with her.  Kate listens to Laurie dismissively interview Carla.  At the station, Carla becomes curious when she hears an anomaly in the broadcast, eventually convincing Ben and then Laurie that it is [[electronic voice phenomenon]]. Ben also reveals to Carla that Laurie used to be a singer, but her boyfriend stabbed her in the neck and threw her down a flight of stairs, killing her unborn child and ruining her voice; her skepticism is a result of her disbelief that she will be able to communicate with her dead child.  When Nick calls Kate to check on her, she uses the opportunity to get rid of the old man by saying Nick found escaped farm animals, assuming he is a local farmer Nick said may appear.  Before leaving to investigate her report, the man indicates that he lives in the mansion.  Confused, Kate demands answers from Nick, who admits his story is untrue; before he can explain further, he is apparently murdered.  As Kate investigates the mansion, Carla performs a live seance.  The spirit, Sarah, says the Wedlock Killer murdered her on a farm.  As Kate discovers Sarah's body in the mansion, the old man, revealed to be Nick's father, Alan, accuses her of killing his daughter.  Before he can exact vengeance on her, the Wedlock Killer surprises and kills him.  The Wedlock Killer expresses surprise that Kate is there, cripples her, and leaves to retrieve her son to kill in front of her.  After Kate frees herself, she finds her dying boyfriend; Nick gives her the money and explains that he did not want her to know he was desperate enough to steal from his own family.  Marek becomes possessed by Sarah while listening to the seance on the radio.  Kate leaves for the radio station, where her babysitter has taken Marek.  When she arrives, she finds everyone but Marek and Ben dead.  Ben explains that the show was recorded last night and was broadcast from tape.  He plays the last part of the tape for her, where Laurie discovers evidence he is the Wedlock Killer.  After sabotaging any parts of the broadcast that could reveal his guilt, he killed Laurie and Carla, though not before revealing to Laurie that he was actually the one who attacked her, with her then-boyfriend merely taking the blame.  Kate stabs him and flees, guided by Sarah's ghost to a room where Ben has handcuffed Marek to the wall.  Before she can free him, Ben knocks her unconscious.  Kate revives as Ben is about to immolate her.  She fights him off but is again overpowered.  Before Ben can douse her in petrol, Sarah appears in front of him, momentarily frightening him and causing him to spill the petrol on himself.  Kate grabs his lighter and sets him on fire, killing him.  As she returns to the radio station to free Marek, Laurie's last words play, questioning whether there is an afterlife and repudiating her earlier sceptism about the paranormal.

They will then both be allowed to ask the angel to grant them a special favor. A visibly grieving Sophia will ask her angel to be able to speak to her dead seven year old son.

He says she must spend months of punishing exercises, in which they will be dealing with real demons and angels; she agrees. Over months she complies methodically with dozens of harrowing and painful exercises, but refuses to do the forgiveness ceremony. Grudgingly they get to know one another.  However, after months a frustrated Sophia complains that it’s taking too long, and Solomon accuses her of impairing the ritual by not being honest about something. She admits that the real favor she will ask the angel is revenge upon whoever kidnapped and killed her son. That night he awakens her to insist that because her dishonesty has made her unpure, a re-birthing ritual in the tub is required. However, he drowns her, says a spell, and revives her with CPR.

Deadpool (film)
  [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] is a dishonorably discharged [[special forces]] operative working as a mercenary when he meets prostitute [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]. They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal; however, after Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer, he leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.  A mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to [[Ajax (Francis Fanny)|Ajax]] and [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]], who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant genes]]. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. When Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a [[hyperbaric chamber]] that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.  Wilson survives and seeks out Vanessa, but does not reveal he is alive because he is afraid of how she would react to his new appearance. After consulting his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]], Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name "Deadpool" (from Weasel picking him in a [[dead pool]]), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named [[Blind Al|Al]]. Deadpool questions and murders many of Ajax's men until one, the recruiter, reveals Ajax's whereabouts. Deadpool intercepts Ajax and a convoy of armed men on an expressway, killing everyone but Ajax. He demands the cure, but is interrupted by the X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and his trainee [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]. Colossus wants Deadpool to mend his ways and join the [[X-Men]]. Taking advantage of the distraction, Ajax escapes. He goes to Weasel's bar and learns of Vanessa.  Ajax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned [[helicarrier]] in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and they battle Angel Dust and several soldiers while Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the falling ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again but is overpowered. He reveals that there is no cure, and despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills Ajax. Deadpool promises to try and be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry at Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.

However Nok gives Ana's father the incorrect number and pockets the winnings for herself.

His father Robert ([[Kevin Kline]]) is an engineer who lives in the suburbs and is having difficulty adjusting to a life alone. Dean's ex-fiancée Michelle ([[Christine Woods]]) attempts to give back the engagement ring, as Dean has "un-proposed." Dean refuses, suggesting she put it on a charm bracelet.  Dean's best friend Brett ([[Reid Scott (actor)|Reid Scott]]) is getting married. Dean is actually the "second best" man behind Kevin ([[Barry Rothbart]]). Brett and Dean were roommates, along with Eric ([[Rory Scovel]]) who has flown out from Los Angeles for the wedding. During the wedding ceremony, Dean sees Michelle's wedding date and gets distracted. When asked to produce the wedding ring, he fumbles with it and drops it. Later during the reception, a drunken Kevin finishes up the best man speech. Dean begins his best man speech, but gets rudely interrupted by Kevin, who gets up and starts swinging at Dean.  Waking up in bed with his face in donuts the next morning, Dean gets a call from Robert. Robert says it is time to sell the house. Dean cannot deal with that, so tells his father to wait because he has to fly to Los Angeles to meet with ad agency "creatives" who want to use his drawings. His father has been frustrated by Dean's lack of engagement, and has already brought in realtors Carol ([[Mary Steenburgen]]) and Patrick ([[Peter Scolari]]). Robert assumes that Patrick and Carol are husband and wife, but Carol says they are not. Robert sees that Carol has an online dating profile on her PC behind her realtor work. While he begins critiquing her profile, a relationship begins to form.  Dean meets with the advertising creatives, but is put off by their strange work habits and attitudes. They want to use his work to represent the "before" drawings in an advertisement for deodorant. The main character in the ad is a nerd, but the pitch is to have the deodorant enable the character to draw amazing detailed drawings after using the product. Dean excuses himself and leaves.  Dean calls his friends in Los Angeles including Becca and Eric. He goes to a party and meets Nicky ([[Gillian Jacobs]]). He is immediately taken by her, but clumsily tips over a serving tray when he absent-mindedly leans on it. He still pursues her, despite Nicky's friend Jill repeatedly dragging her away, and manages to give her his phone number, written on a small notebook paper in a "twentieth-century way." The next day Dean spends time with Eric and finds out he is a cat person, with cat furniture all over his bedroom.  As Dean is leaving Los Angeles, he gets a text on his iPhone from Nicky inviting him to come play volleyball at the beach. He leaves the plane and an annoying seat mate behind and heads to the beach, where he is seen dragging his suitcase across the sand. He finally finds Nicky, and they go out to have a dinner date. He kisses her at the end of the date. She invites Dean to come to an art gallery with Jill.  Nicky tells Dean that she and Jill will be going up to San Francisco. Dean says that he also had planned to go to the Bay area with Eric. The four end up driving together. Right as they are about to go on a hike, Eric gets a call from his roommate telling him that a bookcase has dropped on his cat. Eric demands to be taken to the San Francisco airport immediately to fly home. Dean goes to a hotel, because Nicky tells him that Jill's parents would not be comfortable with him staying there. He tries to kiss Nicky goodbye, but Jill honks the car horn and interrupts them.  Nicky later comes back to Dean's hotel room and spends the night with him. Dean tells Nicky that he thinks he might be falling in love with her, and tells her about the failed engagement and mother dying. Later in the morning, Nicky is gone. There is a hand-written "twentieth-century style" letter for Dean at the front desk. In it, Nicky explains that she is married, but has been separated. Jill had been telling Nicky to divulge that to Dean, but there was never an opportunity.  Robert and Carol have been going out together in New York. They return from a play, where they both confess they had no idea what was going on. Carol invites Robert up to her apartment for coffee, and Robert is unable to, because he is "still married".  At the end of the film Dean has returned to New York, and finished his next book. He sends a signed copy back to Eric. Robert has moved into a new apartment in the city. Dean tearfully admits that he has not been there, but he and Robert finally reconcile with each other. Later Robert sees Carol walking in his neighborhood, and they walk on together.

Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra ([[Kunal Kapoor]]), a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns her out of her apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents (Aban Deohans and [[Atul Kale]]) with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many sleepless nights in unhappiness and uncertainty.  While in Goa, she seeks out Dr. Jehangir "Jug" Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]), a psychologist, for her insomnia, after inadvertently having heard him talk at a Mental Health Awareness Conference.

Meanwhile, she meets a musician, Rumi ([[Ali Zafar]]), and she falls in love with him, but they break up before anything serious can happen when she realises they may not be the right fit for each other. She also reunites with her younger brother, Kiddo (Rohit Saraf), who is the only other person besides her best friends that she is closest to. Matters with her family come to a head when Kaira has an outburst at a family get-together where she confronts her parents about them abandoning her for years at her grandparents' (Martha Xavier Fernandes and [[Madhav Vaze]]) house.  She finally narrates the story of her abandonment to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her in her childhood. But as an adult, have the maturity to see her parents as two regular people who are capable of making mistakes, like everyone else. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.  At their last session, Kaira admits to Jug that she has grown to like him. Jug responds that it is normal for a patient to feel this way about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, (in a non-romantic way) she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves. There is a subtle suggestion that Jug might have liked her back, even romantically (but of course he can't admit that since Kaira is his patient).  Kaira finally completes her short film, which she had been working on for years. At the premiere, friends and family, and exes are present to cheer her on. This is where she finally meets a furniture designer ([[Aditya Roy Kapur]]). Life moves on.  
Dead Awake (2016 film)
 Kate Bowman is a by-the-books social worker who is investigating a series of deaths after her twin sister, Beth, suddenly dies under mysterious circumstances. Each victim suffered from sleep paralysis, a frightening ailment that immobilizes its victims as they dream. Kate is approached by an unorthodox doctor who warns of an evil entity that haunts people in their sleep. She brushes aside his admonition, but when a terrifying entity begins to haunt Kate's friends and loved ones, she must fight to stay awake to stop the nightmare.  After becoming convinced the monster is real, Kate teams up with Beth's boyfriend Evan, and meets up with the doctor again. They come up with a plan to allow her to fall asleep and inject her with adrenaline before the creature can kill her. She falls asleep and all seems to be going well, until the monster attacks and she shows no signs of being in sleep paralysis (her eyes are closed, and she seems to be sleeping peacefully). Evan notices something amiss, and figures out that she's in paralysis and under attack.  They manage to administer the adrenaline just in time to wake her, apparently dispersing the creature and freeing Kate from its attacks.  As they prep to perform the same procedure on Evan, Kate suddenly realizes that her parents have the research on the phenomenon and could be under attack as well. They arrive at her parents' house, and find them doing just fine, after which, they head to Evan's apartment so Kate can shower and he can feed his kitten. While Kate is showering, Evan falls asleep, and the 'hag' monster emerges from a painting of it he created earlier in the film. As the monster attacks, Kate comes out of the shower and tries to revive him, unsuccessfully. Paramedics arrive on the scene, and he is seen being taken away while Kate looks on, despondent.  Kate visits him in the hospital and we find out he's in a coma.  The doctor arrives, and convinces Kate that she hasn't defeated the monster yet, and that she needs to go to sleep and break the sleep paralysis on her own in order to defeat it once and for all.  After seeing Kate to sleep, the doctor watches over her and sees her attacked by the monster but can't get his adrenaline pump to work.  He goes to sleep as well, knowing the monster will come after him over Kate.  Once he falls asleep, Kate is temporarily left alone and has a dream-within-a-dream sequence where she meets her sister. Her sister, Beth, begins to prey on her fears of being a bad sister, and the reason she's dead. Kate realizes Beth would not be saying the things she's saying, and attacks Beth, knowing it's really the Hag.  She stabs the hag, then finds herself back in her 'real' body being choked by the Hag.  She breaks her paralysis, and attacks the hag, strangling it (apparently) to death.  In the next scene, Kate is vlogging about her experiences and telling her audience that Evan has awoken, and her paralysis has come back, but that the Hag has not reappeared.  She also promises her audience that she will not stop until she comes up with a permanent solution for everyone.

Death Note: Light Up the New World
  In 2006, [[Light Yagami]] (aka "Kira") battled [[L (Death Note)|the detective L]] in his attempt to rid the world of crime, aided by the power of a [[Death Note]] - a supernatural notebook that kills anyone whose name is written inside. Ten years later, in a world afflicted with cyber-terrorism, a chain of unexplained deaths suggests that Death Notes are being used once more. Interpol quickly assigns L's biological successor, Ryuzaki, to the newly established "Death Note Task Force", led by Detective Tsukuru Mishima. They quickly secure a notebook during a murder spree in Shibuya, after its owner, Sakura Aoi, is killed by another Death Note. Upon touching Aoi's notebook, the Task Force meets and questions its original owner - a [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] ("god of death") named Beppo - who reveals that there are six Death Notes currently in the human world; this is the maximum number that can exist there at any one time. The Task Force resolves to find the remaining five Death Notes.  Similarly, Aoi's killer - cyber-terrorist Yuki Shien - vows to acquire all the notebooks, believing he is on a mission from Light via his Shinigami, [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]]. Inciting global panic with a virus featuring a video of Light as Kira, Shien then makes contact with Light's girlfriend and former ally, [[Misa Amane]]. After restoring her memories of Death Notes and gifting her with his, Shien asks Misa to disclose information which he believes will reveal where Light is hiding; she refuses, having watched Light seemingly die ten years ago. Undaunted, Shien uses his exceptional hacking abilities to locate three Death Notes, killing their owners in the process. He then impersonates Kira via another virus, threatening a killing spree unless L's successor reveals his name and face. In response, Ryuzaki spreads a CGI video of the original L, inviting Kira to a website intended to trick him into revealing his location. Anticipating this, Shien escapes before killing one of the original Kira investigators - [[Touta Matsuda]]. Fearing that the investigation is compromised, the Japanese government dissolves the Death Note Task Force.  Refusing to give up, Mishima finds a hidden message in Ryuzaki's video: "I own the last Death Note". Enraged, Mishima confronts Ryuzaki in his home and discovers the latter's unconventional relationship with his Shinigami, Arma. However, Ryuzaki reveals that his Death Note is blank, having promised L before his death that he would never use one. Upon leaving, Mishima is arrested on suspicion of compromising the investigation. A year prior, Mishima was tasked with locating Hikari Yagami, Light's secret successor who was placed in the care of prosecutor [[Teru Mikami]]. However, both Yagami and Mikami subsequently vanished, leading the police to suspect Mishima of conspiring with Kira. After Mishima is interrogated, Ryuzaki frees him so that he can access the Task Force's Death Note and confront the new Kira. Agreeing to meet Ryuzaki at the National Arts Centre, Shien again asks Misa for her help, which she reluctantly gives.  After three Task Force members return to the case, they head with Ryuzaki to meet Shien, who has been lured with the promise that Ryuzaki will reveal his face and the team's Death Notes. Mishima remains at headquarters to instruct them - however, contact is cut by a jamming signal made by Shien. Forced to reveal their faces, Ryuzaki and two Task Force members are killed by Misa, who has acquired "Shinigami Eyes" which display a person's real name above their head. Misa then gives Shien the information he needs but warns him that Light is definitely dead; his name did not appear when she looked at her picture of him. Finally, Misa kills herself with a Death Note page.  Realising that the Kira who gave him his task is an imposter, Shien arrives at the secret location and sacrifices half of his life span to obtain Shinigami Eyes - deciding to kill the imposter and take his place as Neo Kira. Shien is then shocked to be confronted by Mishima and Ryuzaki; the latter suspects Neo Kira wrote his name much earlier and specified a later time of death. Ryuzaki then reveals that he believes Mishima is Neo Kira - and upon touching Shien's Death Note, Mishima remembers everything. Having witnessed Teru Mikami turn insane and murder Hikari Yagami, Mishima killed Mikami and replaced Yagami as Neo Kira. Mishima later gave up ownership of his notebook and instructed Ryuk to give it to Shien, confident that the cyber-terrorist would find the remaining Death Notes. With this new information, Shien attempts to kill Mishima, but the police arrive with orders to kill all three of them. Mortally wounded in the initial crossfire, Shien dies after giving Mishima the Death Notes, allowing him and Ryuzaki to escape through an abandoned subway. They are then confronted by the last remaining Task Force member, who realises that Mishima is Kira and thus the one who killed her brother. However, Arma kills her when she attempts to shoot Mishima - at the cost of her own life, much to Ryuzaki's despair.  Mishima and Ryuzaki's execution order is annulled by Interpol and Mishima is taken into custody. Ryuk then explains why the six Death Notes were dropped down to earth - the dying Shinigami King, intrigued by Light Yagami, has promised to give his throne to the Shinigami who finds the next Kira. When Mishima points out that all six Death Notes have been secured, Ryuk suggests that human greed will result in their use once again, and leaves. Shortly after being led to his cell, Mishima is greeted by Ryuzaki, who informs him that the vehicle containing the notebooks was attacked by a terrorist group, destroying four and leaving the other two missing. Revealing that today is his appointed date of death, Ryuzaki suggests trading places with Mishima, as he believes that the latter is the only one who can retrieve the missing Death Notes. Accepting his new role, Mishima reveals his real name - Ryo Nakagami - and leaves Ryuzaki to die peacefully in the cell.  A post-credit scene shows a video of Light saying "Just as I planned" and ironically smiling.  
Deepwater Horizon (film)
 On April 20, 2010, ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'', an [[Oil platform|oil drilling rig]] operated by private contractor [[Transocean]], is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of [[Louisiana]] on behalf of [[BP]]. Chief Electronics Technician Michael "Mike" Williams ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) and Offshore Installation Manager James "Mr. Jimmy" Harrell ([[Kurt Russell]]) are surprised to learn that the workers assigned to test the integrity of recently completed cement work are being sent home early, without conducting a [[cement bond log]] (CBL), at the insistence of BP managers Donald Vidrine ([[John Malkovich]]) and Robert Kaluza ([[Brad Leland]]). While Mike prepares the drilling team, including Caleb Holloway ([[Dylan O'Brien]]), Harrell meets with Vidrine and persuades him to conduct a test, which only serves to weaken the already poorly placed cement further. His patience thinning, and without waiting for Harrell to confirm the results, Vidrine orders the well to be flowed.  At first, the operation goes smoothly, but the cement job eventually fails completely, triggering a massive [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] that overpowers and kills the drill team members Keith Manuel, Shane Roshto, Roy Kemp, Karl Kleppigner, Adam Weise, and Gordon Jones.  A chain of equipment malfunctions, coupled with a failed attempt to seal the well, ignites the oil, killing Dewey Revette, Stephen Curtis, Jason Anderson ([[Ethan Suplee]]), and Donald Clark. Andrea Fleytas ([[Gina Rodriguez]]), the rig's Dynamic Position Operator, tries to alert the [[Coast Guard]], only to be overruled by her superior, Captain Curt Kuchta, on the grounds that the rig is not in any imminent danger. With oil now spewing into the ocean, a frightened, oil covered [[pelican]] flies into the bridge of a nearby vessel and dies, which heads towards the rig just as the workers begin a frantic evacuation. Harrell, still alive, although seriously injured in the explosion, is rescued by Mike and assumes control of the situation, only to discover that the rig could not be saved.  Aaron Dale Burkeen, a close friend of Mike's, sacrifices himself to keep a burning crane from collapsing onto the surviving crew, while Mike and Caleb are able to rescue Vidrine and Kaluza and get them to safety.  As night falls and the burning oil lights up the area, the Coast Guard becomes aware of the incident and sends a ship to collect the survivors, who are being ferried in the lifeboats to the ''Damon Bankston''. With all the lifeboats full, Mike locates the emergency life raft, but it becomes separated from the rig before he and Andrea can board, causing the latter to suffer a [[panic attack]]. Just as the oil in the well itself ignites and destroys the rig, the two jump into the water and are picked up by rescuers, who then ferry them to the ''Damon Bankston''.  Returned home, the workers reunite with their families in a hotel lobby, during which the father of one of the dead crew members family angrily confronts Mike for failing to save his son, resulting in Mike having a panic attack himself.   The film ends with a series of clips showing the aftermath of the disaster, including testimony from the real-life Mike Williams and the revelation that not a single employee of either Transocean or BP was prosecuted for their actions. Pictures appear of the 11 men who lost their lives before the credits.  The movie postscript reads: "The blowout lasted for 87 days, spilling an estimated 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It was the worst oil disaster in U.S. history."

Denial (2016 film)
 [[Deborah Lipstadt]] is an American professor of [[Holocaust studies]] whose speaking engagement is disrupted by [[David Irving]], a [[Nazi Germany]] scholar. He files a libel lawsuit in the [[United Kingdom]] against Lipstadt and her publisher for declaring him a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] in her books. Since, in the UK, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in a libel case lies with the accused, Lipstadt and her legal team led by [[solicitor]] [[Anthony Julius]] and [[barrister]] [[Richard Rampton]] must prove that Irving had lied about the Holocaust.  To prepare their defence, Lipstadt and Rampton tour the [[Auschwitz]] [[death camp]] in Poland with a local scholar, while the research team [[subpoena]]s Irving's extensive personal diaries. Lipstadt is annoyed by Rampton's apparently disrespectful questions on the subject, and frustrated when the team minimises her involvement in the case, arguing that she harms its chances of success. Members of the [[British Jewish]] community plead with her to settle out of court to avoid creating publicity for Irving. However, her team has a promising start when they persuade Irving, by appealing to his ego, to agree to a trial by judge instead of a jury, which he could have manipulated to his advantage.  Irving conducts his own legal representation, facing Lipstadt's legal team. Irving endeavours to twist the presented evidence for the defence. Lipstadt is approached by a [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivor]] who pleads for the chance to testify, but Lipstadt's legal team insists on focusing the trial on Irving.  Irving tries to discredit evidence for the existence of [[gas chambers]] at Auschwitz, claiming there were no holes on the roof for the [[Zyklon B]] gas crystals to be introduced. His [[Sound bite|soundbite]] "no holes, no holocaust" dominates the media coverage. Furious, Lipstadt demands that she and the Holocaust survivors take the stand. Julius angrily counters that Irving would only humiliate and exploit a survivor on [[cross-examination]], as he has in the past. Rampton visits Lipstadt at her home to explain his approach and earns her trust. In court, he subjects Irving to skilful cross-examination and exposes his claims as absurd, while expert testimony exposes the distortions in Irving's writings.

She is suffering from [[amnesia]] and her phone is broken as a result of the car crash the day prior.

The Detective Boys then decide to stay with Curaçao to help her regain her memory. After noticing Curaçao's perfect aiming skills while playing darts and her swift act of saving Genta from falling from high a place, Haibara and Conan notice that Curaçao is not an ordinary woman, and Haibara herself gets a sense that Curaçao is likely to be another Black Organization agent. Meanwhile, Dr. Agasa attempts to recover the message from Curaçao's broken cell phone, and finds out that Curaçao attempted to send the names of known NOC agents (Stout, Aquavit, Riesling, Bourbon/Rei, and [[List of Case Closed characters#Hidemi Hondo|Kir/Hidemi Hondo]]) to the organization. Stout, Aquavit, Riesling are later killed by members of the Black Organization in [[London]], [[Toronto]] and [[Berlin]] respectively, and Rei and Hidemi are held hostage in [[Tokyo]].

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police later come and take Curaçao into custody, transferring her to the Police Hospital, but they are forced to surrender her to the PSB as the Bureau believes Curaçao was the spy infiltrating the Bureau Office the day before. The Bureau becomes aware that Curaçao appears to react to certain events in the Tohto Aquarium, and decides to take her back to the Aquarium. The same night, the Black Organization, who arrived by the [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]], knocks out the electricity for the entire aquarium and plan to intercept Curaçao when the ferris wheel reaches the top. After Curaçao regains her memory by looking at the specific color patterns of the projected lights like she did earlier before, Yuya Kazami, who boarded the ferris wheel with her, is knocked unconscious by her and she escapes. The Black Organization attempts to detonate the bomb planted at the ferris wheel, but the bomb is disarmed by Rei after he is informed of its existence through Conan. The organization then change plans and instead fire from the V-22, trying to kill Curaçao and destabilize the wheel so that it will fall and roll. Akai, with the help of Conan and Rei, are able to shoot down the V-22, and Conan attempts to stop the rolling wheel before it crushes to the aquarium. Curaçao, having noticed that the Detective Boys are in the rolling ferris wheel, crash a crane truck into the wheel, stopping it and saving the Detective Boys but her actions cause the ferris wheel to crush her to death. Before her death, Curaçao admits to Vermouth that the mail tampered by Conan and sent from her broken cell phone that reads "Bourbon and Kir are clean" was sent on her own; thus the two are able to maintain their cover in the Black Organization.

During his college days, he was part of a group of friends that included Subhashini ([[Tamannaah Bhatia]]) and Stella ([[Srushti Dange]]). Both of them were in love with Dharmadurai, and while Stella openly revealed her feelings for him, Subhashini kept her feelings to herself. He was influenced by one of his lecturers Dr. Kamaraj ([[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]), who believed in serving the poor and helpless in the villages instead of running after money and foreign employment. Inspired by Dr. Kamaraj's ideas, the three friends decided to stay back in India after graduation, but they soon lost contact with each other. Badly requiring Stella's and Subhashini's support and guidance for his current troubles, Dharmadurai manages to get their current addresses from his old college.

But Dharmadurai's brothers demanded 50-sovereigns gold ornaments and 5,00,000 as dowry from Paraman, who refused to accept their demand and called off the marriage. Heartbroken, Anbuselvi committed suicide. An enraged Dharmadurai, realising that his brothers were the cause of the end of his marriage and Anbuselvi's death, thrashed them mercilessly and was about to kill them, only to be stopped by Pandiyamma. Betrayed and heartbroken, Dharmadurai shut down his clinic and took to alcoholism.  Subhashini, after hearing Dharmadurai's story, takes him to her apartment and nurses him back to sobriety. Following Dharmadurai's recovery, Subhashini reveals to him that she has decided to divorce her husband as he had killed her unborn child, by mixing abortion pills, in the milk she consumed without her knowledge, when she was pregnant, since she had refused to abort the baby and move abroad with him to France as he had desired.

One day, Dr. Kamaraj, who is blind now, upon hearing about Dharmadurai's work, visits him. On the advice of Dr. Kamaraj, he and Subhashini decide to get married. Subashini gets pregnant with Dharmadurai's child. Subhashini also advises him to return to his village, give back the money in bag to his brothers and also to tell them and  mother Pandiyamma that he is going to get married. Dharmadurai agrees and visit back his village.  At his village, Dharmadurai learns that his family had to vacate their house as they were forced to sell it to compensate the villagers, who had found out that their money had been stolen. When he goes to the place where his mother and brothers are now living (a hut in the middle of a field), one of his brothers knocks him out with a spanner, enraged that he had brought them to poverty by stealing the chit fund money. But when he realizes that he had brought back the money, he repents his action. Pandiyamma rushes Dharmadurai to hospital, where he is treated by his batch mate, whom he had attacked in the college.

He singles out three prominent business oligarchs, including pharmaceutical mogul Dheeraj Chandra ([[Sayaji Shinde]]), don Irfan Ali ([[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]]) and a minister. When Dhruva tries following Dheeraj Chandra, he realises that all three of them work as a group and they all work for an affluent scientist Siddharth Abhimanyu ([[Aravind Swamy]]). After the completion of his training, Dhruva is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit.  Dhruva discovers that Siddharth is Chengalrayudu's son Venkanna. After his release from juvenile detention center, Venkanna had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation he returned to India and is now a well established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and his own profit. Chengalrayudu is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people.

While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital with the help of Ishika and Gowtham, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens all of Dhruva's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Akshara ([[Abhinaya(actress)]]). She was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Akshara. So Siddharth arranges goons and the goons rape and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it. But before Dhruva can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Abbas to recover the card, but Dhruva tells Gowtham to get the card. Gowtham goes to the house where the SD card is at. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Abbas, but through the bug Siddharth knows this and abducts Gowtham. Gowtham fights Abbas and Siddharth but he gets drugged and before Dhruva can save him, Siddharth and Abbas kill Gowtham. Dhruva comes back to his special house where he finds a pin has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Naina Miss world of 2011 and a close aquintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Preethi was also part of that event. Dhruva doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Ishika checks the finger prints on the pin keeping the gun case Dhruva received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony and the finger prints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Preethi's father so that she doesn't participate in the competition and as she won't have a ticket to go to her father's funeral he requests to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Dhruva frantically searches for the bug which he eventually finds out in a series of thrilling events.  Dhruva captures Abbas and records all the information from him. He drugs Abbas and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against the CM. When Siddharth learns about this, he ask Chengalrayudu to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to hospital. The ruling party forces Chengalrayudu either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Dhruva appeals to the CM that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills his father using his goons in an accident and forces the CM to stop actions against him or he will lie that the CM killed his father for personal vengeance. But the next day at his father's state funeral, Dhruva arrests him on the CM's orders.  When Siddharth is arrested, Dhruva tells him that the medicine was patented in Akshara's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Chengalrayudu is alive, saved by Dhruva and the public funeral held was for Gowtham. Dhruva makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to court. They also plan to take down the set up planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth. Dhruva takes him down and pushes Siddharth back. To Dhruva's surprise, Siddharth does not wear the vest, and is fatally shot by his girlfriend Preethi as an act of vengeance for killing her father. Before dying, he tells Dhruva that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Dhruva had asked for it.

Dana experiences a vision of a young girl being tormented by her father and his German Shepherd, and subsequently suffers a [[nervous breakdown]].  Dana eventually makes it out of the room, but is deeply shaken by her experience. She begins to research the history of the house, learning about its namesake Judge Ernest Blacker ([[Gerald McRaney]]) and his daughter Laura, who died on the same day as Catherine; July 5. Dana consults the local historian Judith, who tells her the Blacker family had a secret "disappointments room" in the attic, where wealthy socialite families cruelly shuttered their deformed or disabled children. As she spends more time researching the house and its history, Dana's mental state begins to unravel, and she stops taking her medication. She begins having increasingly vivid and disturbing visions of Laura, Judge Blacker, and the dog, and begins acting erratically toward David and Lucas. She finds a portrait of Judge Blacker and Mrs. Blacker hidden behind a pair of facing mirrors, and burns it.  While David entertains family friends, Dana hires local [[handyman]] Ben Philips ([[Lucas Till]]), who has been performing maintenance on the house's leaking roof, to dig up the grave in the backyard. The ghost of Judge Blacker suddenly manifests and kills Ben with a shovel. Dana discovers Ben's body hanging from a [[noose]] above the open grave, inside of which sits Laura's deformed skeleton. Dana sees another light appear in the attic, and when she goes inside, finds the portrait she burned intact and in their place. Entering the disappointments' room, she witnesses a flashback of Judge Blacker murdering Laura with a hammer as his wife futilely tries to stop him. Blacker's dog attacks Dana as he moves toward Lucas' bedroom. Dana breaks the dog's neck and picks up the hammer, running to Lucas' room and stopping Blacker from killing her son by repeatedly bashing him in the head with it. David rushes in, seeing Dana frantically hitting an empty bed. He tries to get her to calm down, telling her that there's no one there.  Calming down, Dana reflects on Catherine's death, revealing that she accidentally smothered her, triggering her slow spiral into insanity. She realizes that she can no longer tell what's real when she realizes that she was hallucinating Ben's murder and corpse. David vows that they will return to Brooklyn, and that Dana will get better. Before leaving, David removes the door from the disappointments' room, and Dana takes one of Laura's figurines. As they drive away, Dana spots Judge Blacker looking down at them from the window.

Die Beautiful
  Trisha Echevarria ([[Paolo Ballesteros]]), whose birth name is Patrick, is a transgender woman whose sexuality and dream to become a beauty queen were greatly opposed by her father ([[Joel Torre]]), causing her to leave their house and live on her own together with her best friend Barbs ([[Christian Bables]]).  At present, Trisha is already dead. She died after collapsing during her pictorials as the newly crowned Binibining Gay Pilipinas. Her wake is being held at Happy Endings Funeral Homes under the care of her gay friends. Everyday, Trisha undergoes makeup transformations into different female celebrities, which she owes to the makeup skills of her best friend Barbs. The best friends enjoyed doing make-up transformations together when Trisha was still alive.  Trisha's adopted daughter Shirley Mae (Inah de Belen) arrives with her boyfriend. She cries and apologizes to her adoptive mother for rebelling against her before when Trisha unceasingly pushed her to join beauty pageants even if Shirley Mae didn't want to do so anymore. She tells Barbs that she is pregnant, thus, making her unable to fulfill Trisha's dream for her to be a beauty queen.  Meanwhile, [[Iza Calzado]] who crowned Trisha in Binibining Gay Pilipinas also visits the wake at the time when Trisha's makeup transformation is Iza's face. In another makeup transformation, the gay funeral parlor owner, Flora ([[Lou Veloso]]), was amazed by Trisha's look and asks for a selfie with the corpse dressed as [[Miley Cyrus]]. Flora later uploads the picture on Facebook without Barbs' consent. The photo goes viral, making Trisha's wake an attraction even for people who did not know her in life, much to Barbs' disapproval.  Couturier [[Eugene Domingo]] also visits the wake after knowing about the viral photo. She was appalled by the gown Trisha was wearing as [[Julia Roberts]] from the [[Runaway Bride (film)|Runaway Bride]] and bought a fabulous white gown for Trisha to wear. Flora points out that corpses can't be dressed normally so they would have to cut the back part of the gown so they can put it on Trisha. Despite being hesitant at first, the couturier cuts the gown.  During the seven days of Trisha's wake, flashbacks of the glamorous life Trisha had lived as a son/daughter, brother/sister, mother, girlfriend, wife, and a beauty queen were shown.  The flashbacks showed both teenage Trisha, who was still Patrick then, and Barbs studying in the same school—proud gays modeling as they walk in the hallways. Patrick had a crush on basketball player Migs ([[Albie Casiño]]). Eager for Migs and with Barbs' convincing, Patrick goes with Migs and his friends one night. The next morning, Patrick arrives in school in a state of disarray and reluctantly confides to Barbs that he was gang-raped by a drunk Migs and his friends. The rape has caused anal bleeding to Patrick. Patrick's father and his sister Beth ([[Gladys Reyes]]) visit him and later finds out about what happened. Patrick ends up being slapped by his own father. His father as well threatens Trisha's friends - Barbs, Paola, and Erica - not to go near Patrick anymore.  This incident further strains the relationship between Patrick and his father. Patrick continued to disobey his dad, secretly joining gay beauty contests. As a result, his dad disowns him and tells him to leave. As he exits their house, Patrick yells his new identity: Trisha Echeverria.  Barbs' and his mother willingly let Trisha stay with them. Not having jobs, Trisha and Barbs start joining gay pageants from town to town, with someone called 'Mother' (Mimi Juareza) who gives them tips on how to win. Mother is usually upset with Trisha especially when she could not answer in the Q&A portion. When Trisha transformed herself into a celebrity ([[Britney Spears]]) in a pageant, she again fails to win the crown as she was only able to memorize one answer from the given set of questions and unfortunately, another candidate has picked the question.  Trisha and Barbs continued joining beauty pageants and finally win titles. Trisha became more creative with her costumes and talent. However, Trisha always only won the First Runner Up title. She also adopts an orphaned child named Adora and renames her as Shirley Mae. As Shirley Mae grows up, she gets bullied by her classmates for having a gay mother. Trisha tells her to neglect them and that she is a mother even if she does not have a female body yet and she loves her as a mother would do,  Trisha meets a young gay club dancer named Miko who later becomes her boyfriend. Trisha even pays for Miko's rhinoplasty. However, their relationship is short-lived as Trisha finds out that a gay beauty parlor owner ([[Mel Martinez (actor)|Mel Martinez]]) stole her dancer boyfriend.  Trisha continues to save money to have top surgery with Barbs while thinking that it will be the key for them to win beauty pageants. When they finally got the surgery, Trisha reminisces the only beauty pageant answer that she was able to memorize but she never got to pick the question.  Back to present, an unknown woman (Jade Lopez) visits Trisha's wake and tells the corpse "''kayo rin pala ang nagkatuluyan sa huli''" (''"In the end, it's still the two of you together"''). It was revealed that the woman is Diana, the wife of Jesse, ([[Luis Alandy]]) Trisha's lover.  Trisha met Jesse in a bar. In another flashback, Jesse, although married, dates Trisha. Trisha loved the idea that someone sincerely finds her beautiful and treats her like a lady. On their sixth monthsary, Trisha prepares a dinner for them at her home, but Jesse does not arrive. A month comes by and Jesse still has never called nor showed up. Diana later comes to their house and tells Trisha to go with her.  Trisha and Diana arrive in the hospital where Jesse was confined due to [[leukemia]]. Jesse tells Trisha his condition then confesses that their meeting at the bar was not accidental.  It turns out that Jesse was only urged by his conscience as he was one of Migs' friends who gang-raped her. He tells Trisha that he grew to love her but Trisha ignores him and leaves.  Trisha goes on with her life with Barbs and Shirley Mae. Fate had Trisha to pick the question in the biggest gay pageant he has ever joined: the Binibining Gay Pilipinas. He delivers her memorized answer well "...if I'll die and be blessed to live again, I would choose to be nobody, nobody but me." At the backstage, Trisha jokingly tells Barbs that if she wins this major pageant, she will be ready to die. She further elaborates the details of her funeral: to have a makeover as a different celebrity everyday in her week-long wake. Trisha eventually wins the pageant but she collapses on stage and later dies of cerebral aneurysm.  In the morgue, Trisha's father and sister  arrive. Her father remains cold, and with disgust, orders to have Trisha's breast implants removed. Beth convinces him to respect Trisha's decision so instead, they ended up dressing Trisha in a Barong Tagalog - contrary to Trisha's burial wish.  Barbs, Paola, and Erica get deeply disappointed at the sight of their friend and asks Beth to give in to Trisha's final request. Knowing her father will never agree, Beth helps Barbs and other friends sneak out Trisha's corpse to give her the burial she wished for.  In the last day of her wake, Barbs announces to everyone that her final makeover of Trisha is what she really is - the Trisha they knew who lived a glamorous life despite many obstacles and rejections. The movie ends with Trisha's final walk message,  showing a younger version of herself, confident and glamorous.  Other celebrity transformations of Trisha during her wake are [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Beyonce]].

The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.  In [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate.

The Divergent Series: Allegiant
                                                     After Evelyn forbids anyone from leaving [[Chicago]], she announces that all Erudite members involved in the previous coup attempt are to be put on trial and executed if found guilty. Tris and Four rescue Caleb from execution and try to escape over the wall, along with Tori, Peter and Christina. The group is ambushed by Edgar, who kills Tori, but the group escapes, and pass the wall and are intercepted by soldiers with advanced weaponry who take the group to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, a city of advanced technology hidden behind a cloaking shield. They learn that years ago the U.N believed that society's problems were caused by "damaged genes". In an attempt to create a better society they began to tamper with people's genes; this eventually led to the Purity Wars and the destruction of most of the planet. To try to reverse the destruction a series of "experiments" were set up in an attempt to repair this mistake, establishing isolated cities across the remains of the world.  Tris and Four are tested by Matthew and Nita to verify and study their Divergence. Tris is shown to be truly Divergent, and the first Chicago Divergent to be 100% genetically pure, but Four's genetic structure indicates that his genes still carry damage. Caleb and Peter are assigned to surveillance teams that remotely monitor Chicago, while Christine and Four are assigned to the military. Matthew then brings Tris to the leader of the Bureau, David ([[Jeff Daniels]]). David gives Tris a device that allows her to view her foster mother's memories, and she sees that her mother was rescued from the wastelands as a child before volunteering to join the Chicago experiment out of dedication to the project. In return for his help in restoring peace to Chicago, which David claims only the council has the power to intervene in, Tris agrees to help David continue the experiment.  Meanwhile, Four and Christina train with Nita. They join the military on a rescue mission to a nearby wasteland village, though Four becomes mistrustful of the Bureau's intentions after realizing that they are simply kidnapping children and wiping their memories with amnesia gas. Four also attempts to warn Tris of the Bureau's intentions, but they are interrupted by a video call from David.  Caleb warns Four of a rapidly escalating conflict back in Chicago between Johanna's group of Allegiants and Evelyn's factionless. Four appeals to Tris for her to return to Chicago with him to end the bloodshed, but she decides to go with David. David agrees to reinsert Four back into Chicago, escorted by Matthew and some Bureau soldiers. Once in the air, Matthew quietly reveals to Four that the flight is a trap and he is meant to be killed. A skirmish breaks out and Four defeats all of the soldiers, though the transport crashes as a result. Matthew gives Four a device to allow passage through the cloaking shield, and Four proceeds to Chicago while Matthew remains behind to be rescued by the Bureau and warn Tris.  Meanwhile, Tris and David meet with the council. Tris disagrees with the council's objectives and criticizes how they have done nothing to stop the violence in Chicago. The council responds that David has full power to intervene whenever he desires, revealing that he has lied to her from the beginning. During the return flight to the Bureau, Tris ends their partnership. Upon her return, she gathers Caleb and Christina in David's hovercar to return to Chicago. Nita helps them escape, revealing that David's rule is not popular with everyone in the Bureau.  Four is captured by the factionless and confronts Evelyn to end the violence. Tris, Caleb, and Christina arrive to find the city tearing itself apart at the opening stage of a full assault by the Allegiant. Back at the Bureau David makes a deal with Peter in exchange for Peter's promotion and inserts him into Chicago to convince Evelyn to deploy a hidden Bureau stockpile of amnesia gas to wipe the memories of the attackers and force a peace in her favor, to which she agrees. Peter takes her to a hidden vault.  Tris and Christina fight through the factionless and arrive at the vault, having rescued Four along the way. At the vault door, Four convinces Evelyn to stop the gas attack, as he would not remember that she was his mother if she carried it out. She capitulates and stops the release, but is shot in the leg by a frustrated Peter. Peter gloats until the same gas starts flooding the vault as well. Realizing David has betrayed him, Peter opens the vault so Tris and Four can stop the gas release, and flees back towards the cloaking shield, as Four says he will find and kill Peter.  Caleb arrives and aids Tris in destroying the gas dispersion hub, stopping the release. The group gathers atop the Erudite building as they watch David's shuttle autopilot back towards the Bureau, heavily laden with explosives. Tris transmits a message to the whole world, revealing to them the existence of the Bureau and that Chicago was an experiment in genetic purity. Her message to the Bureau is that Chicago is no longer their experiment, but the home of its citizens. Caleb detonates the explosives at the end of the message, tearing a massive hole through the cloak wall and revealing the Bureau. As the group watches, David's image is revealed standing behind Tris via a Bureau remote viewing device.

Both Kabir and Junaid start their investigation with a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage of Viraj's hotel and find out that on the night of his disappearance, Viraj went out with a local girl, Samira Dalal ([[Nargis Fakhri]]). On confronting her, she reveals that she took Viraj to a friend's birthday party but he left soon. Kabir and Junaid roam around the town to meet a local goon nicknamed Khabri Chacha ([[Vijay Raaz]]) who directs them to Sameer Gazi ([[Akshay Kumar]]), the city's biggest party animal who met Viraj in the same party, but still could not get any clue. Finally, the duo gets a breakthrough by tracking down Viraj's cellphone from the apartment of a pick-pocketer, Ishika ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]) who claims to have stolen the cell phone from a stranger, the previous night, in a supermarket. They also manage to capture the person in the video, but discover that he is just a struggling actor being used as the face in the video by the real kidnapper.

Kabir spots Altaf and both try to chase him down but before they could succeed, a sniper kills Altaf. Wagah calls and confesses to Kabir that he got him killed and they should stop searching for Viraj.

With minutes to blast Kabir negotiates with Wagah to stop the bomb in return of 5 billion rupees from Indian Government. Wagah takes the money but refuses to stop the bomb. After witnessing the blast from a distance Wagah walks into the cricket stadium expecting the match to begin without Viraj. But to his shock Viraj is alive and walks into the ground all ready to play as a parallel flashback reveals Kabir and Junaid helped Viraj to get out of the jacket by dislocating his shoulder and all three had jumped into water just before the blast.  After seeing his plan failed, Wagah tries to run away only to be apprehended by the duo. Kabir returns to India along with Ishika, while Junaid, who regains his duty, gets a marriage proposal from an Indian girl, Muskaan ([[Parineeti Chopra]]) and he also plans to fly to India to meet her.

The Do-Over
 Charlie McMillan ([[David Spade]]) is an unhappily married bank manager in a supermarket who reunites with his old high school buddy and FBI agent Max Kessler ([[Adam Sandler]]) at a high school reunion. They spend a weekend on a [[yacht]] Max rented, which makes Charlie feel young again.  However, Max blows up the yacht and fakes their deaths. When Charlie regains consciousness, Max explains that they can now both start new, better lives. He confesses that he was not FBI, but a [[coroner]]. This allowed him to use two unclaimed [[cadavers]] in place of them when he blew up the yacht. Although initially appalled, Charlie has no reason to return to his old life. He is given the new identity of Dr. Ronald P. Fishman and Max takes on the new name Butch Ryder. Max tells Charlie he found a key in Butch's rectum and Charlie being a bank manager finds out it belongs to a [[safe deposit box]] in [[Puerto Rico]].  They relocate to Puerto Rico and access the late Butch's safe deposit box. The box contains money and the keys to a secret mansion hideaway. The duo learn that the late Ronald was married after seeing a picture of his wife on Butch's [[tablet computer|tablet]]. Max and Charlie are then attacked by a group of assassins led by a hitman called  "The Gymnast" ([[Torsten Voges]]). They manage to escape and Max reveals he lied about being a coroner, he's a [[guidance counselor]]. He wanted to be a [[police officer]], but was unsuccessful due to failing his [[Psychological evaluation|psychological exam]].  They return to the continental U.S. and find Ronald's widow, Heather ([[Paula Patton]]). Max and Charlie explain to her that Ronald was murdered and infer that Butch got Ronald entangled in criminal activity. Heather informs them that Ronald's study was broken into recently.  The trio head to a biker bar where Ronald and Butch used to meet up. At the bar, they learn that Butch had stage 4 cancer. Ronald had developed a "magic bullet" cancer treatment and they began conducting secret, non-FDA approved [[clinical trial]]s. When Ronald's partner Arthur "Shecky" Sheck withdrew funding, Butch started robbing banks. But they also learn, to their disgust, that Ronald and Butch were having a love affair.  The group heads to Shecky's ([[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]) home where he reveals that his laptop and cell phone were stolen. The trio leave and determine that the men who tried to kill them wanted the cancer treatment formula and broke into Heather's and Shecky's homes to try to find it.  Charlie says they should hand over the formula when they find it, which Max protests. Charlie then discovers that Max was actually one of Ronald's cancer patients. He also learns that Max has a young son with his wife, Becca ([[Kathryn Hahn]]), and realizes Max has been trying to recover the cure to save his own life all along.  Max returns to Shecky's house, thinking that he is withholding the cure. Shecky has been mortally wounded by a gunshot, but reveals that the assassins were hired by Trojgaard, the world's largest [[chemotherapy]] company, to steal the cure so they could bury it. Shecky then dies and the Gymnast shows up to take Max hostage.  Meanwhile, Charlie figures out that Ronald's cure has been disguised as a Jenga [[application software|app]] on Butch's tablet. He attempts to call Max, but the Gymnast destroys Max's cell phone. Heather then arrives at Shecky's house and reveals to Max that she not only accepted a fortune from Trojgaard to bury the drug, but she was the one who killed Ronald and Butch.  Charlie calls Heather and she claims Max killed Shecky. Charlie sees through her lie and comes to rescue Max. Heather manages to pull a gun on Charlie, but Max escapes from the Gymnast and knocks her out. Heather recovers, but Becca shows up and beats her unconscious. The police arrive, resulting in the tablet being accidentally thrown into water.  The tablet suffers irreparable damage, but Charlie backed up the formula on a [[USB flash drive]]. The duo are pardoned for their crimes when they offer the cancer treatment as a bargaining chip.  Charlie, Max, Max's wife Becca, son and mother return to the house in Puerto Rico after Max is cured. The movie ends with Max and Charlie jumping off a cliff into the ocean, a feat which Charlie previously thought he would never be brave enough to do.

One of their pranks involves ordering a pizza for Sam’s neighbor Larry. Mosley, who delivers the pizza from the shop where he works with Peyton, becomes upset with his friends for involving him in the prank.  A mysterious man who identifies himself as Mr. Lee begins repeatedly calling the boys, insisting that they do not hang up on him. Sam and Brady are initially indifferent until Mr. Lee reveals that he knows their names, addresses, and intimate details of their lives. Peyton delivers a pizza that Sam and Brady didn't order. Peyton reveals that Mosley disappeared after his earlier delivery. Sam and Peyton have an uncomfortable conversation about their relationship before Peyton leaves. Mr. Lee begins texting Sam and Brady in addition to calling. Video footage he sends them reveals that Mr. Lee is holding Brady’s parents hostage at the Mannion residence.

The Izzy account reveals that Mr. Lee had been stalking the pranksters for over a year. Sam also finds a sex video revealing that Brady had been sleeping with Peyton. Sam beats Brady again. Sam notices from a clock in the background that the video of Brady’s parents is two hours behind the current time. Sam frees Brady. New video shows that Mr. Lee already killed Brady’s parents. Believing that Peyton is probably dead too, the boys plan to escape and contact authorities. However, once Sam is outside, Brady locks the front door and remains behind. Sam finds a surveillance van outside in the rain. Inside the van, Sam finds Peyton and rescues her. Back in the house, Brady steps over Mosley’s covered body to go out the back door. In the backyard, Brady finds Mosley’s real body. Brady realizes that Mr. Lee switched places with Mosley and hid in the house. Mr. Lee catches Brady off guard and attacks him.  Sam has Peyton go for help while he looks for Brady. Sam follows Peyton’s screams to the backyard. A masked man suddenly lunges at Sam and Sam stabs him. The man turns out to be Brady, tied up and gagged to look like Mr. Lee in a mask so that Sam would kill him by mistake. With Sam and Peyton defeated, Mr. Lee shows up and explains his actions. When the four boys previously called Mrs. Kolbein, she dropped her phone and didn't hear the revelation that she had been pranked. Still convinced that there was an intruder in the house, Mrs. Kolbein grabbed a gun and accidentally shot her daughter Izzy. Upon realizing what she had done, Mrs. Kolbein killed herself. It's implied that Mrs. Kolbein and the young girl were Mr. Lee's wife and daughter, and he wanted to avenge their deaths. Mr. Lee knocks Sam unconscious.  When Sam wakes up, he finds Peyton shot in the head. Holding a knife in one hand and a gun in the other, Sam is arrested by the police arriving at the scene.

Don't Breathe
  Rocky, Alex, and Money are three Detroit delinquents who make a living by breaking into houses secured by Alex's father's security company and selling the stolen items. Rocky longs to move to California with her younger sister, Diddy, in order to escape from their abusive mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. However, the person buying the stolen goods from Money doesn't give them a fair price, not enough to fund Rocky's dream. Money then receives a tip that a US Army Special Forces veteran living in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood has $300,000 in cash in his house. He received it as a settlement after a wealthy young woman, Cindy Roberts, killed his daughter in a car accident. The three spy on the house and learn that the man is blind due to a blast during the Gulf War.  That night, the three approach the house and drug the Blind Man's dog. Finding all entrances locked, Rocky enters the house through a small window and lets the other two in. The group searches the house for the money but are unable to find it. Money puts a sleeping gas bottle in the Blind Man's bedroom. Assuming the money is behind a locked door downstairs, he shoots the lock. The noise wakes up the Blind Man, who overpowers Money and demands to know who else is with him. Money insists he is alone, and the Blind Man kills him with his own gun. Terrified, Rocky hides in a closet, where she witnesses the Blind Man open a hidden safe to check his money. After he leaves, she opens the safe and takes the money, which appears to be at least $1,000,000. However, the Blind Man finds Rocky's shoes and realizes that Money was not the only intruder.  Rocky and Alex evade the Blind Man and hurry to the basement. There, they are shocked to find a restrained woman in a home-made padded cell. Desperate, she shows them a newspapers article about the car accident. They realize that she is Cindy Roberts held captive by the Blind Man. They free her and run to the storm cellar door, only to be taken off guard by the Blind Man who mistakenly shoots and kills Cindy. He breaks down crying when he discovers she is dead, sobbing "my baby". Rocky and Alex rush back into the cellar while the Blind Man shuts off the lights, plunging them into darkness. After a blind struggle, Alex knocks out the Blind Man and they flee upstairs.  After blocking the basement door, they encounter the Blind Man's dog, who has woken. Unable to unlock the front door in time before the dog attacks them, they flee into the bedroom, where they are trapped by the barred windows. Rocky escapes the room through a ventilation duct, while the dog attacks Alex, who falls out of a window onto a skylight, going unconscious. When Alex awakens, the Blind Man shoots out the skylight and corners Alex in the utility room, appearing to kill him with a pair of garden shears. Meanwhile, the dog pursues Rocky through the vents, and she is captured by the Blind Man. She wakes up restrained in the basement like Cindy was. The Blind Man reveals that Cindy was conceiving his child to replace the one she killed. He then prepares to artificially inseminate Rocky, explaining that she will now give him a child. It is revealed that the Blind Man stabbed Money's corpse with the shears instead of Alex, who manages to save Rocky and handcuff the Blind Man.  Rocky and Alex are unable to call the police, as their blood is all over the house, so they try to leave through the front door. The Blind Man breaks free and shoots Alex dead. Rocky flees as the dog pursues her. She manages to trap the dog in her car trunk but gets captured again by the Blind Man. Inside his house, Rocky disorients him by setting off his house's alarm system, then hits him repeatedly in the head with a crowbar and pushes him into the basement. The gun fires into his side as he falls. Believing him dead, Rocky escapes before the police arrive.  With the money, Rocky prepares to leave Detroit with Diddy on a train to Los Angeles. Before boarding, she sees a news report, stating that the Blind Man was brutally attacked by two intruders (Alex and Money) in his house. He killed them both in self-defense and is now in stable condition at the hospital. However, the news report doesn't mention anything about Cindy, Rocky or the stolen money.

Doraemon: Nobita and the Birth of Japan 2016
 The movie starts with a boy who belongs to prehistoric times hunting a fish. Returning home he finds it destroyed and cries out in despair before suddenly being captured into time vortex. Meanwhile, in the 21st century, Nobita wants to run away from his home due to his mom always scolding him for getting a 0 on tests, as depicted many times in various episodes. As a result of failing to find an ideal home, Nobita decides to make a makeshift place to live, however due to land property ownership laws he fails to find a suitable location. At the same time, Shizuka, Gian, Suneo and Doraemon also want to run away from their homes as they feel their parents have been working them too hard (with the exception of Doraemon, who leaves as the family has been requested to take care of a [[hamster]] which Doraemon thinks looks too much like a mouse, an animal he hates). Nobita suggests that they should go back in time to live in a place before humans existed. The group agrees with him and travel to Japan 70,000 years ago.  To settle in, Doraemon assigns everyone a ministry. Nobita, who is given the ministry of pets, mixes the genes of different animals and creates a Pegasus, a Dragon and a Griffin. At night, the group eats the supper and decides to return home and visit here another day. On the next day, Doraemon is upset to find his dorayaki has been eaten, deducing it was the hamster. As he sets off in a rage, Gian, Shizuka and Suneo come and is attacked by the mysterious boy from the start of the movie. Gian fights with him and manages to overpower him. At first they are annoyed as they believe Doraemon and Nobita have told someone else about their secret but it quickly turns to confusion as they find the spear the boy holds is made of real stone. Nobita's mom then comes up the stairs and in a panic, the group take the boy with them to the past.  They take the boy into the cave and when he regains consciousness, Shizuka gives him food and Doraemon uses the translation taro in order to understand him. He tells them that his name is Kukuru and he belongs to the Light Tribe, who got attacked by the Dark Tribe and enslaved all of his people. Nobita and Doraemon decide to help him. Kukuru is mistrustful as they are led by a powerful "King of the Spirits", Gigazombi, but as Doraemon demonstrates the secret gadgets he has, Kukuru hails him as a god much to the annoyance of Doraemon. Pegasus, Dragon and Griffin are left behind as Doraemon fears arriving on them will cause too much of a scene,  and they trace the Dark Tribe using Takekoputa, eventually finding and fighting them. However their shaman proved to be strong and gave them a challenge; his ability to generate force fields is worrying to Doraemon and he wonders how an object in the Stone Age has such powers. Using the Hirarimando Doraemon reflects the shaman's attacks back to him, seemingly destroying it. They take the tribe to Japan to give them a peaceful place to live and return to the 21st century, but Nobita is worried as his pets were nowhere to be seen.  The next day, Pega finds with some help from Gri that the shaman is made of a type of ceramic that has shape memory and can restore itself. The Light Tribe is still in danger, so they once again return to prehistoric times. Unfortunately they were too late and the Dark Tribe had already taken the Light Tribe. Gigazombi appears as the hologram, challenging the protagonists to come to him and face him, which they do so. Unfortunately on the way they encounter a blizzard and Draco is separated from the group, but luckily he is found by his pets. They have a reunion.  The group without Nobita travels on to Gigazombi's hideout where they find the Light Tribe being forced to work. Gian jumps down from their hiding spot but Doraemon quickly stops time, knowing they will need to move tactfully. He uses the Toorinuge Hoop to reach the surface, but is confused by the subspace tunnel curving and the exit being in an unexpected location, a room with historic electronics everywhere. Gigazombi then appears and Doraemon is confused since time is supposedly stopped, which the former says he removed. Doraemon then realises that Gigazombi is a time traveler, like them, although he changes history for his own benefit. Gigazombi reveals that he also plans to destroy the subspace time tunnel so that no one may enter or leave this time period again. They battle for a while, but Doraemon is easily defeated as it turns out Gigazombi is from the 23rd century, making Doraemon's 22nd century gadgets outdated in comparison.  Doraemon, Shizuka, Suneo and Gian are captured and face a Siberian tiger, but Nobita and his pets come in and rescue them just in time. They disable the machine that will destroy subspace and just in time, Time Patrol and Dorami come and arrest Gigazombi. Dorami says that she found out the shape-memory ceramic the shaman was made from is manufactured in the 23rd century, which made her worried and thus called Time Patrol. Nobita and the rest of the group prepare to return to their own time although a tearful farewell is first said to Pega, Draco and Gri - because they are fantastical animals, they cannot accompany Nobita and must be moved to a zoo. Nobita eventually relents and says goodbye to his pets.  In the epilogue, Nobita's mom tells Nobita that he's going to be late for school, but gives him 10 more minutes of sleep as she finds out he was working on his homework.

Jack arrives and joins the scene, promising that he will not abandon her.  But Sam tells him that she is happy in the well and she knows and accepts that their relationship is over.

The Duelist (2016 film)
 Set in [[Saint Petersburg]] in [[1860]], the story revolves around retired officer Yakovlev. A deadly shot, Yakovlev is effectively a kind of mercenary in that he is available for hire through his associate Baron Staroe to stand in for others in formal [[duel]]s.  Much later in the film, flashbacks reveal that years ago an [[Aleutian Islands|Aleut]] [[shaman]] has predicted he would never die, and so far that seems about right as Yakovlev wins duel after duel, wounding and more often killing noble opponents. Although duels of honor are technically illegal in [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] at the time, most people turn a blind eye to the law. The code of practice is not written down anywhere, and yet everyone knows the rules and rituals, while many participants see it as an almost mystical rite. To take part in a duel is to accept that one’s fate is ultimately in the hands of [[God]], hence the practice of [[Russian roulette]].  Eventually, it turns out that all of Yakovlev’s recent duels were secretly arranged by Count Beklemishev. He is a shadowy puppet master with a grudge and designs on Princess Martha Tuchkova whose brother (Prince Tuchkov) Yakovlev is scheduled to duel with next. When attraction stirs between him and the pretty blond princess, problems arise, especially since, as the flashbacks reveal, Yakovlev has an agenda of his own.

Before they can, Dominic returns and kills all three despite Miles' pleas for the killing to end.  Miles and Dominic arrive at a small town, where they encounter an old man walking down the street.  The man initially refuses to speak to them, but he seems willing to help once they offer him food.  After he surprises them by puncturing one of the car's tires with a knife, Dominic begins beating him.  A young woman, Vijah, stops him at gunpoint and ushers the two into her house, where she performs first aid on Miles.  Vijah explains that the town's leader, Doyle, is dangerous, and they should all stay inside her house for their safety; Dominic ignores her warnings.  While exploring the ruins of the town, Dominic encounters Sasha, who seduces him.  As they have sex, Sasha's boyfriend, Latos, appears.  While Sasha holds Dominic at gunpoint, Latos grabs Miles and chastises Vijah for hiding the brothers from Doyle.  Latos beats Dominic with a baseball bat but leaves the killing blow to Doyle.  Latos forces Miles to watch as Doyle murders his brother.  When Doyle later questions Miles in his office about why the brothers have trespassed in his territory, Miles refuses to cooperate, to Vijah's concern.  Noticing this, Doyle and his gang taunt her.  Doyle himself slashes one of her ears to teach her a lesson about loyalty.  Latos delivers food to Miles and says they are interested in having Miles  join their gang.  Latos explains Dominic was too obviously strong-willed and independent to be of use to them.  When Miles is again uncooperative, Latos taunts him with the insinuation that the food is his brother's flesh.  Vijah later visits Miles, and gives him a shard of glass.  The two caress each other wordlessly, and he observes her scarred ear.  Doyle invites everyone to a dinner.  Miles, finding Dominic's head on a platter, grows enraged as Doyle's gang noisily eats and taunts him.  Miles draws the glass shard and stabs Sasha in the throat.  Latos jumps on him and begins eating his face as Doyle impassively watches Sasha die.  Vijah kills Latos, but another gang member takes her hostage.  Doyle unceremoniously kills the gang member and takes Vijah hostage himself.  Miles shoots Vijah in the gut; the bullet passes through her and kills both her and Doyle.  After tenderly shutting her eyes, Miles points the gun at the old man encountered earlier, who has also been eating Dominic's flesh.  As the man whimpers wordlessly, Miles lowers the gun and leaves.

Eddie the Eagle (film)
 In 1973, ten-year-old Eddie Edwards dreams of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother unconditionally supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Games]] in favour of [[skiing]] in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]]. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realizing he could make the team as a [[Ski jumping|ski jumper]] (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated in six decades), he decamps to a training facility in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Germany]]. The more seasoned jumpers, specifically those on the Norwegian team, belittle him.  He self-trains, and after successfully completing the  hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first try from a  hill. Alcoholic [[Snow grooming|snow groomer]] Bronson Peary encourages Eddie to give up, but Eddie's tenacious spirit and shared feelings of ostracism by the other jumpers there convince him to train Eddie. Peary is a former champion American ski jumper who left the sport in his 20s after a conflict with his mentor, famous ski jumper Warren Sharp, which Eddie learns from Petra, the kindly owner of a nearby tavern. With very little time to qualify for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Eddie and Bronson employ various unorthodox methods to condition and refine Eddie's form, and he successfully completes the 40m hill.  To qualify for the British Olympic division in ski jumping, Eddie only needs to complete a jump from a  hill in order to qualify for the Winter Olympics. Not long after, he manages to land the jump successfully, with a distance of 34 metres (112&nbsp;ft), thus winning a place on the British Olympic Team. However, the officials, in an effort to keep Eddie from sullying the Winter Games with his amateurish skillset, decide to change the rules and demand that he jump at least . Though discouraged, Eddie decides to continue training and performs on a circuit, his jumps increasing in length each time, but unable to meet the Olympic requirements. During a practice jump at the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, he lands a 61m jump exactly, but on his official jump, he falls and is disqualified. Eddie is devastated and resolves to return home to work with his father as a plasterer, but he receives a letter claiming that his qualifying practice jump is valid, and he happily tells Bronson that he's eligible to compete in the Winter Olympics. Bronson tries to dissuade him, promising that he will make a complete fool of himself and his country if he goes, but Eddie is undeterred, noting that competing in the Olympics was always enough for him.  Upon arriving in Calgary, he receives instant scorn from the other British athletes, who get him drunk and nearly provoke him into fighting after he is subsequently absent from the opening ceremonies. Despite finishing last in the 70m jump with , Eddie sets a British record. His triumphant celebrations win the audience over, and the media embrace him as Eddie "The Eagle". Over the phone, Bronson criticises Edwards for not taking the sport seriously. Edwards publicly apologizes to the press for his antics, and wanting to ensure he does not leave the games as little more than a novelty, he enters the  jump, which he had never attempted before. Bronson decides to travel to the games and support him. After an encouraging conversation with his idol [[Matti Nykänen|Matti "The Flying Finn" Nykänen]] on the lift to the top of the hill, Eddie barely manages to land a  jump. Once again, he scores last in the event, but is nonetheless cheered by the audience as well as millions around the world, which includes a playful salute in the closing speech of the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]], Frank King. British Olympic officials grudgingly accept him.  Warren Sharp reconciles with Bronson, who was present, and Edwards returns home a national hero to the cheers of his fans at the airport, his mother rushes to him embracing him. And as Eddie looks to his father, he reveals a jumper declaring his support before then embracing Eddie as well.  
The Edge of Seventeen
 In October 2015, Nadine Franklin ([[Hailee Steinfeld]]), a high school junior in the [[suburb]]s of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], confides to her school teacher Mr. Bruner ([[Woody Harrelson]]) that she plans to commit suicide. Her threats and his responses illustrate their unique, bantering relationship.  Nadine narrates her life so far: By age seven, differences between Nadine and her more popular older brother Darian ([[Blake Jenner]]) are already obvious. Nadine has a tempestuous relationship with her overly dramatic and [[image conscious]] mother Mona ([[Kyra Sedgwick]]) who seems to favor her brother, while Nadine's father, Tom ([[Eric Keenleyside]]) is the only immediate member she feels close to. At age 13, Nadine is buoyed by her relationships with her best friend Krista ([[Haley Lu Richardson]]) and her father. Nadine's father suffers a fatal heart attack while driving. As a result of her father's death, Nadine's life turns upside down. Up to the time Nadine is 17, Krista was the only "good part" of her life.  One night at home, Nadine and Krista get drunk, while Darian throws a pool party. Nadine falls asleep and wakes up to find Krista in bed with Darian who is naked. Krista tries to fix things, but Nadine is tormented about her best friend being with her brother. Krista and Darian think to break it off, but he ends up asking her to be his girlfriend. Nadine feels desperately alone and resorts to her classmate Erwin Kim ([[Hayden Szeto]]), who has a crush on her. She discovers that, although he is awkward, he has a great sense of humor and is kind. Nadine, however, is attracted to older student Nick Mossman ([[Alexander Calvert]]), whom she has only met once.  Later, Darian invites Krista to a house party, who insists Nadine join them. When they arrive, Krista is introduced to other students, who invite Krista and Darian to play beer pong, leaving Nadine to her own devices. After several failed attempts at talking to others at the party, Nadine goes outside and sits on a porch bench with another partygoer, who remarks how inferior Nadine seems compared to her popular, athletic brother. This conversation drives Nadine to leave the party without Krista or Darian. Nadine calls Erwin and asks him if he'd like to go with her to the amusement park. There he tries to kiss her but it turns into a comedy of awkwardness. At the end of the night Nadine tells him he's a great guy.  Krista confronts Nadine for ignoring her the night before, so Nadine makes her choose between herself and Darian. Krista does not want to choose, and Nadine angrily tells Krista their friendship is over.  At school, Mr. Bruner has become Nadine's go-to person for support. He lets her vent her anger at him, but afterwards, as a way to guilt her, reveals that she is his favorite student. Erwin and Nadine spend the evening in his heated swimming pool. Although Erwin is wealthy, his parents conduct business overseas for much of the year; he has become lonely. Nadine learns that he is an animation filmmaker and accepts his invitation to their school's short-film festival.  One morning as Mona drives Nadine to school they have an argument that results in Mona taking her to work with her. At the workplace, Nadine has an argument with her mother about her father. Nadine steals Mona's keys and drives away. In the heat of the moment, she writes a sexually explicit text to Nick but decides against sending it. Nonetheless, she accidentally hits "send" and is mortified.  The narration switches to when Nadine told Mr. Bruner that she is going to kill herself, and he tries to keep Nadine calm about the text she sent. She receives a text from Nick, asking her to hang out that evening, exciting Nadine. Mona calls Darian, confessing that Nadine is missing and that she has depended on her son as the father figure since Tom died. Darian leaves to find Nadine. During their date, Nick repeatedly attempts to have sex with Nadine in his car, having interpreted the text as a proposition, while she had been wanting a romantic date. Embarrassed and heartbroken, Nadine runs away and calls Mr. Bruner while waiting in a donut shop, who drives her to his house, where they wait with his wife and baby boy until Darian arrives. Darian confesses to Nadine that although his life seems perfect, he has been secretly suffering from the pressures of having to take care of the family ever since their father died. Darian confesses that he feels trapped and did not apply to colleges far away, and the only person who helps him smile is Krista. But that is a problem, too, since Nadine is upset that Krista is with him. Nadine confesses to her brother that she has been dealing with self-hatred, intensified by her envy of him. They hug and their feud ends.  Nadine readies herself for the school's film festival. Nadine walks downstairs on her way out and is welcomed by Darian and Krista. The two girls reconcile and agree to catch up later. Mona fears that Nadine has run away. Realizing that her mother is worried, Nadine texts her saying that she is safe. Mona decides to trust her word. Erwin's animated film is a story about a green alien boy who falls in love with a girl at high school, but is rejected by her. Realizing the metaphor, Nadine apologizes to Erwin for taking so long to accept his love. Erwin is congratulated by his colleagues. When he introduces Nadine to them, she greets them with a smile, finally opening up to others.

Elle (film)
 Michèle Leblanc is [[rape]]d in her home by an assailant in a ski mask, then cleans up the mess and resumes her life. At her workplace, her male employees are alternately resentful of or infatuated with her. She carries on an affair with Robert, the husband of her friend and business partner Anna, and flirts with her married neighbor Patrick. Michèle feels detached from her son Vincent, who submits to his abusive, pregnant girlfriend Josie. She has a contentious relationship with her mother, Irène, whom she resents for her [[narcissism]] and involvements with younger men. She is also the daughter of an infamous [[mass murder]]er whose [[parole]] hearing is approaching. Haunted by her father's actions, Michèle is wary of law enforcement and does not report her rape to police.  Michèle grows increasingly suspicious of the men in her life. She receives harassing text messages from her assailant at a blocked number, indicating he is [[stalking]] her. She at first suspects Kurt, a particularly resentful employee, when a [[CGI animation|CGI]] animation of a monster raping her is emailed to everyone at the company. She [[Pepper spray|pepper-sprays]] a man lurking outside her house, only to find out it is her ex-husband Richard, who was checking on her safety. She later discovers that another employee, who has been infatuated with her, created the animation but did not rape her.  On [[Christmas Eve]], Irène suffers a [[stroke]] and begs her daughter to go see her father before she dies at hospital. Michèle is later attacked in her home by the assailant and, after stabbing his hand and unmasking him, learns that he is Patrick. Though she now knows his identity and realizes that he is able to enter her home despite having her locks changed, she still does not call the police and takes no measures to increase her home security.  Michèle decides to visit her father after his parole application is rejected, only to find that he has hanged himself hours before she arrives. Michèle suspects he killed himself because he could not bear to face her again. On the way home from the prison, she gets into a car crash in a secluded area. Rather than calling an ambulance, she first tries to call her friends, and then decides to call Patrick. After he rescues her from the car and bandages her, Michèle courts a brazenly dangerous sexual relationship with him. She engages in a vivid rape scenario while attempting to mitigate his inability to perform with a consenting woman. The two of them walk a delicate line in which Patrick has to feel as though he is raping Michèle, even though she consents to the roleplay.  Michèle grows increasingly disillusioned with her life leading up to the launch party for her company's new [[video game]]. She confesses to Anna that she was having an affair with Robert. As Patrick drives her home, Michèle professes that she is no longer in denial about their unhealthy relationship and claims she intends to call the police. She takes her time walking in front of his parked car after getting out, and then makes a point to leave her gate unlocked. Patrick enters and attacks her, in an ambiguous encounter that blurs the line between rape and consent—but Vincent, who was already in the house, sneaks up behind Patrick and bashes him in the back of the skull. Michèle appears to remain largely composed, but Patrick is seemingly confused as he dies.  Michèle speaks briefly with Patrick's wife Rebecca as she is moving out of the neighbourhood. Rebecca is placid and expresses gratitude to Michèle for being able to temporarily "satisfy Patrick's needs"—implying that she was aware on some level that the two were sexually involved and that Patrick had inclinations she couldn't satisfy. Vincent is now more assertive in his relationship and career, while Michèle reconciles with both Josie and Anna; the latter offers to move in with her now that they have severed their relationships with Robert.

 Former U.S. federal agent Thomas McKenzie, now using the name Martin Parker, is living in London under witness protection with his eight-year-old daughter, Carly.  Thomas had worked undercover inside the crime syndicate of American arms dealer Charles Cooper, where he fell in love and married Cooper's daughter. Thomas' wife has since died, and Cooper wants to kill him and get his grand daughter.  One night, three armed burglars with the wrong address break into their London home looking for cocaine. After a brutal fight, and with a gun pointed at Thomas and a knife to Carly's neck, Thomas takes the gun and kills the burglars. He calls U.S. Embassy colleague Gail Callister before passing out due to a head wound.  Thomas wakes handcuffed in his hospital bed, charged with murder and with his face all over the news.  Carly has been taken to Kavendish Place, Child Social Services, where she is placed in the care of Stacy.  Cooper, having finally found him, sends deadly British hitman George "Bishop" Edwards to kill Thomas and bring him Carly.  Thomas' old friend, Ray Monroe, calls to explain that he is on a flight from the U.S. and will arrive in two hours to sort out the witness protection status with the British authorities, as Callister and the U.S. Embassy has proven incapable of handling the situation.  Worried about Carly, Thomas engages in a brutal fight with three policemen and escapes from the hospital.  He finds Bishop trying to hack a database at Kavendish Place, and believes he is a child care worker. Bishop attacks him, but Thomas manages to get the location of Carly then escapes in a taxi just before Bishop can stop him. Bishop, with sophisticated computer systems in his car, tracks down the taxi, calls the driver, tells him that his fare is incredibly dangerous and advises him to pull over at a petrol station. Bishop arrives seconds later, but Thomas has escaped.  Playing back the petrol station's surveillance system, Bishop sees that Thomas got on the back of a truck, and Bishop again uses his computers to track the vehicle. Thomas reaches a cable car terminal and enters a gondola before Bishop can stop him.  Bishop hollers to two thugs in the gondola that he will pay them £10,000 to knock out Thomas. Thomas knocks them out in a brutal fight, then borrows a cellphone from an innocent passenger. He is able to call Ray, who meets him at the cable car terminal across the Thames. Bishop drives up and shoots Thomas in the abdomen as he jumps into Ray's car.  They arrive at a safe house (apartment suite) where Ray cleans the bullet wound. Bishop has tracked them and blows out a wall from the next suite. Bishop kills Ray as he and Thomas flee. When Bishop returns to his car, Thomas emerges from the back seat, holding Bishop at gunpoint and directing him where to drive. Arriving at a dock, Thomas ties Bishop's hands and starts to question him, but Bishop breaks free. They have a brutal fight until Bishop is knocked into the water, failing to re-emerge. Thomas uses Bishop's car to get to Carly.  Callister has finally sorted out the situation with the British authorities, and an embassy protection team arrive at Carly's location. Before they can leave, Cooper, his assistant Hannah, and three bodyguards arrive and shoot Stacy and kill the protection team. Cooper finds Carly and explains that he is her grandfather and loves her dearly. Thomas arrives, kills the bodyguards, and is surprised to find Bishop.  The two have another brutal fight, ending when Thomas kicks Bishop onto a pickaxe, finally killing him.  Thomas enters the house, kills Hannah and Cooper, and finally has Carly safely back in his arms.

Erased (2016 film)
 The film begins in 2006 with Satoru Fujinuma, an aspiring [[manga]] writer who has his manga once again rejected by his publisher, forcing him to continue working as a deliveryman to support himself. Satoru has the ability to "Rewind", in which he is sent back to a point in the near past to prevent a person around him from enduring a fatal accident. One day, Satoru's mother, Sachiko, stays with him for the weekend. While the two are outside, Sachiko senses a man about to abduct a girl and makes Satoru remember a tragedy that happened 19 years before. Sachiko passes this information to a friend of hers, but when she is alone in Satoru's apartment, she is murdered. Satoru unsuccessfully gives chase to the killer; before he is captured by the police, who accuse him of Sachiko's murder. Satoru's Rewind activates and, to his surprise, he is sent 18 years into the past, back to his elementary school life in [[Hokkaido]].  Trying to adjust to his "new" life, Satoru remembers that his Rewind comes around after the murder of Kayo Hinazuki, a classmate of his, by a child serial killer, whose identity is placed to that of Jun Shiratori, even though Satoru does not believe that. He befriends the quiet and friendless Kayo, learning that she lives with an abusive mother, Akemi, and stepfather. With his friends and Sachiko's help, Satoru manages to convince Kayo to attend a double birthday party, as the two children are revealed to have the same birthday. Despite these changes, Kayo is still murdered, and in frustration, Satoru is sent back to the present.  Still evading the police, Satoru seeks refuge in the house of Airi Katagiri, a high school student who works as a fellow part-time deliveryman. Satoru realizes that though Kayo's death still occurred, its details have changed somewhat. Believing that Satoru is wrongly blamed, Airi helps him track down Sachiko's killer. However, this only puts her in danger when her house is burned down in an arson attack, though she still attempts to help Satoru by escaping from hospital, unaware that the police are following her. Meanwhile, Satoru meets with Sachiko's friend whom she contacted earlier, Makoto Sawada, who confirms that Sachiko's killer and the child serial killer are the same person. He reunites with Airi afterward, but this only causes him to be captured by the police. Noticing one of his captors as the killer, Satoru's Rewind activates and he is once again sent to 19 years before.  To prevent Kayo from being alone, Satoru "kidnaps" her by taking her to live away from her mother. He and his friend Kenya Kobayashi first place her in an abandoned van, but when they learn that the van is the child killer's hideout, they move her to live in the Fujinuma residence. Satoru's teacher, Gaku Yashiro, contacts the child abuse prevention center, who take Kayo into custody after enough evidence of Akemi's abuse is revealed. Still convinced that he needs to prevent more murders from happening, Satoru watches over another quiet classmate, Misato Yanagihara, during an ice hockey competition, but she quickly leaves, while Satoru is given a ride home by Yashiro. Recounting the evidence, Satoru eventually realizes that Yashiro is the killer and has deliberately placed Misato as a decoy. To prevent Satoru from interfering again, Yashiro throws him down a river.  Satoru is sent back to 2006, this time to a timeline where both Sachiko and Kayo, who is now pregnant, are alive, where he is no longer estranged from his childhood friends, and where his manga is successfully published; at the same time, however, Airi does not recognize him, as he does not work as a deliveryman in the new timeline. The lawyer Kenya helps him track down Yashiro, who now works as a councilman. Having a face-to-face meeting, Yashiro tells Satoru his demented motive of killing: he kills to prevent the children from having a bleak future. Just when he is about to commit suicide, Satoru stops him, causing himself to get mortally wounded instead, while Yashiro is arrested.  Ten years later, Sachiko holds a decennial anniversary of Satoru's death, attended by Kayo, her daughter, Kenya, and the others, while Airi, now a photographer, finishes reading Satoru's manga, ''[[Erased (manga)|Boku Dake ga Inai Machi]]''.

Everybody Wants Some!! (film)
  In Texas in the fall of 1980, college freshman Jake – a hotshot pitcher in high school – moves into the house with other members of the college baseball team and meets several of his new teammates, including his roommate Billy who has been nicknamed "Beuter" because of his [[Southern American English|Southern accent]]. He joins Finnegan, Roper, Dale, and Plummer cruising the campus by car, looking to meet female students. Stopping to chat with two women moving into their apartment, upperclassmen Roper – an unapologetic hound-dog – and Finnegan – adopting a false feminist tone – both "strike out" with them, but one of them – Beverly – comments that she likes Jake ("the quiet guy in the back seat"); he makes a note of her apartment number.  At a team meeting in the house, the baseball coach introduces the new players, which include Jake, Plummer, Beuter, Brumley – all freshmen – and two transfer students: Jay, recruited for his professional-level pitching, and Willoughby, a bearded philosopher-stoner. The coach cites two rules: no alcohol in the house, and no women upstairs, but the team disregards them, later hosting a drunken party, with several team members taking women up to their bedrooms. Jake tries to take a woman he's met to the downstairs room they'd set aside for sex, but it's occupied, and Beuter refuses to leave their room so Jake can't use it. The next morning, Beuter leaves temporarily for home, concerned that his girlfriend is pregnant.  Later, the team go out drinking and "cruising chicks" together, first to the local disco. Finnegan's patter about his "average penis", intended to impress women with his lack of ego, is interrupted when Jay's arrogant and racist remarks provoke a fist fight with one of the bartenders, and they are all ejected. Sending Jay home, they change their clothes and instead go to a western-themed bar to end their night on a high note. The next day Willoughby shares his marijuana, music, and philosophy with the freshmen, professing his love for [[Pink Floyd]] while stating his extreme distaste for [[Van Halen]]. That afternoon, Jake happens upon Justin, a former teammate from high school who has embraced [[punk subculture]]. He invites them to a punk concert, and with Jake's encouragement they go, briefly putting on yet another identity. Jake leaves flowers and a note on Beverly's apartment door that night before he and the rest of the team have a massive frat party at their house.  The next morning, Beverly calls him and they quickly agree to meet. She explains that she's a performing-arts major; Jake answers only that he's a baseball player, based on advice given to him by Finnegan. At the team's first unofficial practice session, Jay upsets the rest of the team by pitching to them aggressively. McReynolds, the team's captain and best player, puts Jay in his place when he hits a home run off of him, which causes Jay to throw a tantrum. The coach unexpectedly shows up and calls Willoughby off the pitcher's mound. It is later revealed that Willoughby is 30 years old, and has been fraudulently transferring to new colleges so he can continue playing ball and enjoying the student lifestyle.  Beverly invites him to come to "Oz", a costume party thrown by performing-arts students every Fall. Jake mentions the party to his teammates and tries to tell them they wouldn't enjoy it, but they cajole him into taking them. Although they initially don't fit in well with the "artsy" atmosphere and activities, they do their best to hit on the women there and eventually warm up to their surroundings. Finnegan is ridiculed by his friends for adapting his patter to pretend to be into astrology, and Jake takes part in an improvised ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''-themed take on ''[[The Dating Game]]''. Jake continues to get close to Beverly and they end up spending the rest of the night together.  The next morning, the semester begins and Jake and Beverly walk together from her apartment, parting to go to their separate classes. Two of the team – who know that Jake didn't return home the night before – razz him for it. He runs into Plummer in his classroom, and they settle in for their first lecture. Their history professor enters and writes the phrase "Frontiers are where you find them" on the chalkboard. As their first ever college class officially begins, Plummer and Jake fall asleep.  
Exposed (2016 film)
 A police officer, Detective Galban, investigates the circumstances behind the death of his partner, Detective Joey Cullen. The mysterious case leads to an attempted police cover-up and a dangerous secret involving an unlikely young woman. The two parallel story lines initially appear to have little in common, but as events gradually unfold in the two separate urban worlds, the young woman, Isabel De La Cruz, appears to somehow be involved in the detective's demise.  Detective Cullen was depraved and corrupted. His colleagues fear that the investigation into his death will bring these facts to light. The results would include bad press for the police department and the loss of his pension for his family. The fear is based on the fact that one of the prime suspects in the case is a young ex-convict who had allegedly been [[sexual assault|sexually molested]] with a broomstick wielded by Detective Cullen. Supervisors within the precinct would rather let the murderer go free than to open up a Pandora's Box of troubles for everyone concerned.   Meanwhile in Isabel's private world, Isabel befriends a young girl named Elisa.  Isabel suspects that Elisa is being abused at home by her father.  She also believes that the strange beings she has begun seeing on the streets are angels.  Accordingly, she thinks that her mysterious "impossible" pregnancy is a gift from God, which no one else is willing to believe.  Isabel returns to her parents’ home to live.  When Elisa says that Isabel’s father has hurt her, it triggers a sudden recollection in Isabel’s mind of [[domestic violence|sexual abuse from her father]] many years ago.  All of Isabel’s buried memories are suddenly released in an avalanche of images.  In truth, it turns out that Isabel's "angels" are a fabrication of her own mind. She created them to accompany a fictional narrative that would replace the unbearably [[traumatic memories]] of being [[rape]]d by Detective Cullen on the subway platform the night that her "visions" began. She further [[psychogenic amnesia|suppressed the memory]] of catching him off guard afterwards and killing him in a fit of [[Righteous indignation|righteous rage]].   In response to the memories and to Elisa’s crying, Isabel kills her father in order to protect Elisa.  Detective Galban is then sent to the scene of the murder.  When Galban looks at an old photograph of Isabel’s family it is revealed that Elisa is also a fabrication of Isabel’s mind.  The imaginary girl is actually Isabel as a child.  In the end Elisa disappears as Isabel is in church praying for the strength to accept everything that has happened.

The Exception
 During [[World War II]], Captain Stefan Brandt ([[Jai Courtney]]) is sent to head the personal bodyguard of exiled [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] ([[Christopher Plummer]]) at his [[Huis Doorn]] home in [[Utrecht, Netherlands]]. Following the [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]], [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] authorities are concerned that Dutch spies may be watching Wilhelm. Upon arriving at the residence, Brandt is drawn into an unexpected and passionate romance with Mieke de Jong ([[Lily James]]), one of the maids. Mieke soon reveals to Brandt that she is secretly Jewish. [[Gestapo]] Inspector Dietrich ([[Mark Dexter]]) informs Brandt that the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] has an agent in a nearby village. In addition to keeping an eye on the Kaiser, Brandt is ordered to determine and report the identity of the agent. It turns out to be Mieke, who reports to a pastor at the local church on events at the Kaiser's home. When [[Reichsführer-SS|SS Commander]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] ([[Eddie Marsan]]) decides to visit with a large SS platoon, Brandt is forced to choose between following the Nazi party agenda and protecting Mieke.  As his involvement with Mieke continues, Brandt notices a smell of gun oil from her room. He later sees Mieke leaving the residence grounds and follows. Mieke again visits the pastor and, unaware that Brandt is watching outside a window, tells the pastor that she is prepared to assassinate Himmler as revenge for the SS killing her father and husband. The SS then intercepts the pastor’s radio transmissions to Britain. They arrest and mercilessly beat the pastor. Shortly after, Wilhelm's wife [[Hermine Reuss of Greiz|Hermine]] ([[Janet McTeer]]) discovers the lovers' affair and notifies Wilhelm, expecting him to dismiss Mieke and discipline Brandt. Wilhelm, however, supports the relationship. In private, he reveals to the lovers that he fathered illegitimate children prior to meeting Hermine.  When the time comes to have the house searched before Himmler's arrival, Brandt himself searches Mieke's room to protect her ruse. After Himmler's arrival, Brandt learns that the pastor has revealed Mieke as the British agent. He locates and urges her to go. She refuses, insisting that she has a duty. Meanwhile, Himmler extends to Wilhelm an invitation from [[Adolf Hitler]] to return to Berlin. He then meets with Brandt and Dietrich, informing them of the gesture and its intention as a trap to expose and eradicate supporters of the monarchy restoration. Against orders, Brandt passes the information along to Wilhelm’s adjutant, Colonel Sigurd von Ilsemann ([[Ben Daniels]]).  Mieke does her duty and imparts to Wilhelm a message from [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]. Wilhelm is offered asylum in Great Britain and restoration to the German throne after the defeat of the Nazis. He refuses, preferring not to leave Utrecht. As the Gestapo closes in on the mansion, searching for Mieke, Brandt devises an escape plan. Wilhelm, Mieke, and Brandt escape in a van with Wilhelm pretending to have had a heart attack. Brandt kills Dietrich and another suspicious officer in the process. Deep in the woods, Mieke decides to flee, asking Brandt to join her. She fears he will be executed for the murders. Brandt, however, insists that he has a duty to Germany and a protective alibi (he brought Wilhelm to hospital, while Mieke killed the officers and escaped). The two decide to part ways, with Mieke telling Brandt to find her after the war. As Mieke departs, Brandt repeats a marriage proposal that Mieke had earlier refused in fear. This time, she accepts, and disappears into the woods.  Some time later, Brandt is seen at a desk in a Berlin office. He is delivered a package, which contains a book of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] writings that Mieke had shown him. Inside is written a London address. In London, Mieke is seated on a park bench when she is informed that the prime minister is ready to see her. Rising, Mieke puts her hand on her belly, clearly indicating that she is pregnant. In Brandt's office, an air raid siren sounds. While others evacuate, Brandt remains seated, reading Mieke's book. A plane is heard flying overhead as the screen cuts to black.

Fallen (2016 film)
  Lucinda "Luce" Price is sent to "Sword and Cross", a reform/college prep school for young adults, after she is blamed for the death of Trevor, a boy who Luce once had a crush on. After they kissed, Trevor was killed in a fire shortly after Luce saw the "shadows"; paranormal, ink-like smudges that Luce has been seeing since childhood.   Upon arriving at her new school, Luce meets various students, including Cameron "Cam", who has taken an interest in her; Arriane Alter, who takes Luce under her wing; Molly Zane, who harasses Luce; Pennyweather "Penn", whom Luce befriends; and Daniel. She also meets Miss Sophia, a religious scholar teacher.  During detention (picking up trash), Luce is almost crushed by an avenging angel statue. Later, Cam flirts with Luce and almost kisses her before inviting her to a party. At the party, Luce begins to develops a crush on Cam, but this is hindered by her constant feeling of an unusual connection with Daniel. Molly then shows up, then proceeds to harass and almost kill Luce before Arriane intervenes. As Luce leaves, she sees the "shadows" again.  Luce overhears Sophia telling Daniel that Cam may have been behind the angel statue almost falling on Luce. The two then realize that Luce is listening to them, and Daniel goes after Luce. After he finds her, he reveals that, during class, he was working on a graphic novel. In this novel, a boy and a girl are in love with each other, but are cursed such that every time they kiss, the girl dies; the girl then reincarnates, meets the boy (who never ages or changes) 17 years later, and they kiss again, only for the cycle to repeat.  Cam lures Luce to a club, where he tries to kiss her, only to be violently interrupted by Daniel, who yells that he had told Cam to stay away from Luce; Luce, fleeing the scene, then tells Penn what happened. Penn and another boy, Todd, help Luce sneak into the school and discover a photo from 1854 of Daniel and Luce. As Penn wanders off to retrieve the photo from the printer, Luce goes to the library, where she sees the "shadows" again. Another mysterious fire then occurs that ends up engulfing the library and killing Todd. Daniel rescues an unconscious Luce from the fire.  Luce finds Daniel on a roof top, where it is revealed that Luce and Daniel are the boy and girl from Daniel's graphic novel, and that Daniel is a fallen angel, which explains his immortality. The two kiss, but Cam arrives, telling Luce that she has not been baptized, meaning that Lucifer will come for her. He tries to convince Luce to pick him instead of Daniel, but Daniel whisks Luce away and drops her off with Sophia, leaving to fight Cam and keep Lucifer from coming for Luce.  As the two fight, Cam reveals that he was not the one behind Luce's murder; meanwhile, Sophia kills Penn. Luce screams, causing Daniel to come to Luce's aid and protect her from Sophia, who was actually the one trying to kill Luce. Sophia justifies her murders by explaining that, with Luce gone, Daniel would have been forced to choose a side and order would have been restored. The shadows show up behind Sophia as she is talking and consume her.  Daniel explains to a visibly shaken Luce that Luce's lack of a baptism would cause her next death to be permanent; Sophia thought that this would cause Daniel to choose Heaven. He also tells her that Lucifer will indeed come for her due to her lack of a baptism. He tells her that he must take her somewhere safe, which he proceeds to do as the two declare their love for each other.

Francisca, distraught at being completely alone, wanders the woods until she reaches a highway and catches a ride with a woman named Lucy back to the house. Lucy has a baby son named Antonio whom Francisca kidnaps upon reaching the house.

An Eye for an Eye (2016 film)
 In the weeks following the [[September 11 attacks], dozens of attacks against Muslims, Sikhs and other minorities were reported across America. Among the perpetrators was Mark Stroman, who began “hunting Arabs,” as he described his nightly prowling. His target was on people whom he believed were Muslim who came from the Middle East. He killed two and partially blinded a young man -- all immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Luckily, he was arrested before he fell through with his plan to massacre dozens of Muslim worshipers at a local Dallas Mosque. On April 5, 2002, Stroman was convicted and sentenced to Death.  In the weeks before in impending execution, his only surviving victim became his biggest advocate – [[Rais Bhuiyan]], a devout and recently half-blind Muslim. He began a campaign to spare Mark's life in the name of Islam and its notion of mercy, becoming one of the most vocal campaigners against Stroman's execution.  The Press at the time labeled this as the first post 9/11 hate crimes and even Stroman himself stated that "blinded by rage", he killed to avenge the United States of America. <ref></ref>  With in-depth interviews, the film follows Stroman's story through to his execution. Central to the film is the bond that developed between Stroman and the Israeli-born filmmaker Ilan Ziv.  
Fairy Dust (film)
 The film opens with Tove Lo (played by herself) returning to her motel room late at night. As she crosses the parking lot and ascends the stairs, she begins laughing maniacally, screaming in rage and crying shortly after (Fairy Dust - Chapter I).  The next morning, Lorna ([[Lina Esco]]) speaks negatively of women, motherhood and weddings and how much she enjoys being alone and that she's independent while smoking a cigarette. She hears the couple next door arguing and yells through the wall at them, telling the husband to stop being "a little bitch" and stating the wife is a hypocrite for being a feminist but wanting her sexual needs fulfilled. Lorna lays on the bed saying she has ways to numb the pain, with Tove laying with her. The two fornicate, cuddle and smoke marijuana together on the bed (Influence).  That night, Tove drives to a club. As she walks through the club, she wonders why "[it's] not working anymore" and that "it used to be enough as long as it was all the time". She sees Lorna across the room and begins to dance with the people around her, forming connections with them as they mimic her moves. At this, Lorna yells at Tove, only to have Tove retaliate with the help of her new friends. Eventually, Lorna and Tove reconcile, kissing as the lights flash (Lady Wood). After, Lorna and Tove drive back to the motel while Lorna recounts the first time they met when Tove was in love with an older man who did not reciprocate the feelings, leaving Tove alone with Lorna. Lorna begins to speak about how easy it is to die and forces Tove to crash her car, knocking her unconscious. When she wakes, Lorna is dousing the car in gasoline. Tove attempts to leave the scene several times, only to find herself back at the car wreck. There, Lorna sets fire to her clothes, killing herself ([[True Disaster]]).  Tove is later seen in her bathroom shaving her head. She dances around in the parking lot of the motel with the people she met at the club while her shaved head persona is burying Lorna in the desert. A short monologue reveals that while Tove is grieving the loss of Lorna, she believes pain to be a gateway to more pleasure, with pain removing fear and anxiety from an uncertain situation as she sets her motel room on fire ([[Cool Girl]]). While in the desert, she meets a guy and begins a relationship with him, with the two returning to the motel to have sex (Vibes). Afterwards, she sits outside her room and processes everything that's happened. A voiceover by Tove states that she feels like no one knows her.

Gabriel has since moved out, but still lives in the neighborhood, often getting in trouble with the law.  Troy left home at 14 after beating up his abusive father, and became a robber to sustain himself. After serving prison time for killing a man during a robbery, he met Bono and revealed himself to be a talented baseball player. He then played in the professional [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]]; but he never made it to [[Major League Baseball]], which had no black players in the years before 1947.

When called to bail Gabriel out of jail for disturbing the peace, Troy (who is illiterate) signs papers rerouting half of Gabriel's pension to a psychiatric hospital, forcing Gabriel to be institutionalized.  Troy is forced to reveal his affair to Rose when Alberta becomes pregnant, leading to an argument in which Troy aggressively grabs Rose. Cory intervenes and knocks Troy into the fence. Months later, Alberta dies in childbirth. Troy angrily challenges the Reaper to another fight.  Troy brings his baby daughter Raynell home, and Rose agrees to raise her as her own, but refuses to accept Troy back into her life. Cory is considering enlisting in the [[United States Marine Corps]], having missed his opportunity to attend college. One day, when he returns home, an intoxicated Troy blocks his path and instigates a fight in which Cory swings at Troy with a baseball bat.

Six years later, Troy has died of a heart attack, and Cory, now a USMC [[corporal]], returns home, but informs Rose he will not attend the funeral. Rose admits to loving Troy despite his many flaws and pleads that Troy is still a part of him, and Cory later reconsiders after interacting with Raynell. Lyons is serving three years in prison for fraud, and gets [[prison furlough|furlough]] to attend the funeral.

As Newt listens to her speech about how witches and wizards are real and dangerous, a [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Creatures|Niffler]] escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures.

However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.  After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her [[Magic in Harry Potter#Legilimency and Occlumency|Legilimens]] sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to marry or even meet No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Obscurials/Obscurus|Obscurus]], a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died, those afflicted rarely living past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, they re-enter the suitcase, which Tina returns to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing [[United States Senate|Senator]] Henry Shaw, Jr. Director of Magical Security Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|dark wizard]] [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death, but Queenie and Jacob rescue them, and they escape after retrieving Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old [[goblin]] informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the creatures.  Meanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]] under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, whom he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Squibs|Squib]] and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.  Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society; however, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and framing Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks, and begins to defeat all of them. After being subdued by one of Newt's beasts, he is revealed as Grindelwald in disguise and is taken into custody.  MACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a poultice as rainfall over the city that erases all New Yorkers' recent memories as MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina when his book is finished; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of silver Occamy eggshells to fund his bakery. His breads and pastries are unconsciously inspired by Newt's creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop.

Finding Dory
  Dory, a [[Paracanthurus|regal blue tang]], gets separated from her parents as a child. As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her [[anterograde amnesia|short-term memory loss]]. In the flashback of the previous film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', she joins Marlin – a [[clownfish]] looking for his missing son Nemo – after accidentally swimming into him.  One year later, Dory is living with Marlin and Nemo on their reef. One day, Dory has a [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]] and remembers that she has parents. She decides to look for them, but her memory problem is an obstacle. She eventually remembers that they lived at the Jewel of [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] across the ocean in [[California]], thanks to Nemo mentioning its name.  Marlin and Nemo accompany Dory. With the help of Crush, their sea turtle friend, they ride a [[California Current|water current]] to California. Upon arrival, they explore a shipwreck full of destroyed cargo, where Dory accidentally awakens a [[giant squid]], who immediately pursues them and almost devours Nemo. Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help and is captured by staff members from the nearby Marine Life Institute after getting entangled in [[six pack rings]].  Dory is placed in the quarantine section and tagged. There she meets a grouchy, but well-meaning [[octopus]] named Hank. Dory's tag shows that she will be sent to an aquarium in [[Cleveland]]. Due to a traumatic ocean life, Hank wants to live in the aquarium instead of being released back into the ocean, so he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted [[whale shark]], who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a [[beluga whale]], who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to [[animal echolocation|echolocate]]. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents, and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an [[Undertow (water waves)|undertow current]].  Marlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two [[California sea lion]]s named Fluke and Rudder and a disfigured [[common loon]] named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory's parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory believing that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty [[brain coral]] with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.  Marlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once on board the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo.  In a [[post-credits scene]], the tank gang from the first film, still trapped inside their (now [[algae]]-covered) plastic bags, reach California one year after floating across the [[Pacific Ocean]]. They are eventually picked up by staff members from the Marine Life Institute.

Webber|Bernard "Bernie" Webber]], a crewman at the [[Coast Guard Station Chatham|Coast Guard station in Chatham]], Massachusetts, on [[Cape Cod]], has fallen in love with a local girl, Miriam Pentinen.  The two plan to marry on April 16, but in accordance with Coast Guard regulations, Bernie must seek permission from the station's commander, [[Daniel Webster Cluff|Daniel Cluff]]. On the day he is due to ask permission, the oil tanker  shears in half off the Chatham coast after getting caught in a nor'easter. With the majority of the station's crew already underway with the rescue of the similarly damaged , Bernie is dispatched to pilot [[Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500|motor lifeboat ''CG 36500'']] to rescue the crew of ''Pendleton''. Andrew Fitzgerald, Ervin Maske, and Richard P. Livesey volunteer to join Bernie on the rescue mission.  Meanwhile, the ''Pendleton''s engineer, Ray Sybert, as the surviving senior officer, organizes the surviving seamen to steer the sinking stern of the tanker onto a submerged [[reef]], where it can lodge until rescuers arrive.  When Miriam hears that Bernie is leading the rescue effort, she, like a number of townspeople, thinks this is a suicide mission.  Few people in Chatham trust Cluff, since he is not from the area and does not know its treacherous weather. Miriam drives to the station, demanding that Cluff call Bernie back. Cluff refuses, and brusquely orders Miriam out.  Between [[Chatham Harbor]] and the open sea lies a bar, a series of [[shoal]]s that are very dangerous even in good weather. Bernie must time bursts of his engine to ride each approaching wave before it breaks as he pilots ''CG 36500'' across the bar. Although he makes it over the bar, he loses his compass.  Bernie steers ''CG 36500'' to the stricken tanker. Although his boat's designated capacity is only 12 people, Bernie manages to rescue 32 crewmen. The stern of ''Pendleton'' begins sinking more rapidly during the rescue and goes down shortly after the last crewman comes aboard Bernie's boat.  Relying on his knowledge of the coast and prevailing winds in place of his compass, Bernie steers ''CG 36500'' toward home—a task made more difficult as Chatham loses power. Miriam and the other townspeople drive their cars to the pier and turn on their headlights to guide Bernie in.  The film shows photographs from the event that briefly document the aftermath of the rescue. Two months later, Bernie and Miriam marry; they stay together for 58 years until Bernie's death in 2009.  Webber and his crew receive the [[Gold Lifesaving Medal]].

For his actions, he is prevented from flying a military aircraft again and in spite of that, he asks his father Igor (famous aircraft engineer) for help getting back on the scene. He applies to a passenger airline, with Leonid Zinchenko overseeing his examination in a simulation. During the test, Alexey demonstrates impressive flying skills, but fails the test when he is unable to prevent the plane from crashing into a building on landing. Leonid, under pressure from his peers, retries the test and also crashes, forcing him to hire Alexey as the second pilot-trainee on the [[Tu-204]]SM along with attendant Andrey under the guidance of Zinchenko. Meanwhile, Zinchenko is experiencing family problems due to his absence from home and his alienation from his son Valera, who has abandoned education. Meanwhile, Alexey begins a relationship with pilot Alexandra Kuzmina.  On one of their flights, Gushchin and Zinchenko evacuate tourists from an African country in a revolution, but Gushchin becomes appalled when he learns that Zinchenko refused to allow the locals to board the plane. Zinchenko tells him that he must just stick to his orders.   While preparing for a flight, Gushchin confronts a wealthy man who refuses to obey safety regulations. Eventually, this leads to a fight on a plane, and Gushchin is fired. At the same time, he and Alexandra strain their relationship. The next day, on the train, Gushchin is confronted by Zinchenko who, impressed with Alexey's abilities, wants him back. Zinchenko also plans to take Valera on the next flight as well to convince him to continue his education.  The crew boards the plane for their next flight to Southeast Asia. During the flight, the crew receives a message about a volcanic eruption on one of the [[Aleutian Islands]] called Kanwoo and decides to go to the epicenter of the disaster to evacuate people before the expected volcano eruption. The crew arrives at the Kanwoo airport, where they discover that many people were killed or injured. They must now evacuate the remaining people who are coming on minibuses. Gushchin goes to the airport, when suddenly a powerful earthquake destroys the airport's infrastructure and destroys one of the runways, while the other one is covered with burning oil.  The crew then receives word that one of the minibuses has become trapped in a rockfall. Gushchin, Andrey and Valera go on two minibuses to retrieve the passengers. After the minibuses leave, Zinchenko, Alexandra and the rest of the passengers observe the eruption of the volcano. Realising that the runway will be soon overflowed with lava, Zinchenko and Alexandra abandon Tu-204 in favour of An-26, intending to leave Tu-204 for Alexey. Meanwhile, Gushchin, Andrey and Valera find the stranded passengers, but on their way back to the airport, the road is blocked by a lava flow. Andrey, who has driven his minivan into the lava, tells the passengers to get out of the back and climb into Gushchin's van. He manages to then save himself just in time before the van is swept off the cliff by the flow.  The trio and the passengers make it back to the airport on foot, only to find Tu-204 standing empty and Zinchenko and the rest of the passengers gone. The group climbs into the plane. Seeing that it is impossible to take off at the main runway due to its damage, Gushchin decides to use the shorter runway, which is covered in burning oil. After a water tower breaks and puts out the fire, Gushchin is able to take off successfully. Despite several engine fires from the ash cloud, the crew manages to escape the zone. The crew then comes into contact with Zinchenko's plane. Valera, knowing of his father's actions and seeing them as unjust, tells him over the radio, "I will never forgive you".  The only appropriate airport of them to land in Elisovo Airport, but a storm is now approaching the airport. Zinchenko reports to Alexei the fuel tank was damaged during take off, resulting in them rapidly losing fuel. This means that they would not be able to reach the coast. Igor, who has discovered his son's whereabouts, and is now at the air company's HQ, tells him over the radio his proposed plan: using the cage on An-26, they can transfer the passengers from that plane to Tu-204, which has much more fuel. Gushchin accepts the idea, and is backed by Valera, Andrey and the passengers.   The planes meet at an acceptable height, and the passengers of An-26 transfer a cable to Tu-204, allowing them to begin evacuating the passengers on An-26 via the cage. The first two operations are successful, with Alexandra being amongst the ones saved, but on the third go, the cage's ropes snap, sending 11 people falling to their deaths, forcing Zinchenko to evacuate An-26 on the cable before the plane plunges into the ocean. The crew then receives the news that conditions at Elisovo have worsened, but the crew still decides to land there due to their plane having one engine and a faulty chassis, disobeying their order. Gushchin admits to fearing landing the malfunctioning plane in bad weather and risking the lives of passangers, but Zinchenko reminds him of his skill. At landing, the landing chassis breaks and one of the engines flies off with its wing, but nevertheless, the entire crew survives. Zinchenko congratulates Gushchin with the landing, and leaves the plane, helped by Valera, who has forgiven his father.  As emergency services begin to arrive, the survivors rejoice and mourn the loss of their loved ones. Victorious, Gushchin  leaves the scene into the night while Alexandra looks on.  Sometime later, Gushchin and Alexandra have married and Zinchenko has fully reconciled with Valera. Despite this, they are fired from their jobs as pilots by the flight company's director for disobeying the order to not land at Elisovo. However, after the two leave, the director make a call to Aeroflot, asking them if they "need any pilots in their company". Gushchin and Zinchenko are transferred to [[Aeroflot]] as flight interns, while Alexandra becomes a pilot in the same company.

Florence lives in a grand hotel suite, while Bayfield lives in an apartment with his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Kathleen Weatherley.  Florence suffers from long-term [[syphilis]], contracted from her first husband. The illness has caused her to have various health problems for which she takes medication, including [[Mercury (element)#Medicine|mercury]] and [[Arsenic#Medical use|arsenic]], that have toxic side effects. Due to the fear of passing the disease on to Bayfield, she remains abstinent, and Bayfield has sex with Kathleen.  Florence decides to resume singing lessons. She hires pianist [[Cosmé McMoon]], who is shocked that Florence is a terrible singer, but Bayfield and vocal coach Carlo Edwards, the assistant conductor at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], pretend she is wonderful. Bayfield warns McMoon of dire consequences if he criticizes her.  Bayfield arranges a small recital, hand-picking the attendees. On the night of the performance, loyal Verdi Club members watch respectfully, but others can barely contain their laughter. Feeling encouraged by her recital’s good reviews, she makes a recording as a Christmas gift for the Verdi Club. Florence gives McMoon a copy, which leads to her recalling that Bayfield was an unsuccessful actor and that she hid negative reviews from him. She also informs McMoon of her history as a piano player and teacher, having once played for the President as a child. McMoon realizes that Florence is not as musically inept as he had thought, strengthening their friendship.  Florence and McMoon write and perform original songs together, one of which gets airtime on the radio, much to the shock and horror of Bayfield and Kathleen, despite many listeners enjoying it, believing it to be comedic.

Bayfield fails to dissuade her. Bayfield stressed over the impending performance, gets into a fight with a group of men laughing at Florence and McMoon's song at a bar. Kathleen, resenting the lack of attention, leaves Bayfield. McMoon confides to Bayfield that he fears that the recital will humiliate him and ruin his career.  Bayfield replies that he gave up his acting career to support his wife and urges McMoon to possibly do the same for the sake of his friend. McMoon agrees, elated to at least play at Carnegie Hall.  The concert is packed and attended by the likes of [[Cole Porter]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. When Florence begins singing, the soldiers laugh and jeer. Her supporters and loyal friends, however, scold them and then cheer for her to keep singing. She happily continues her performance. Meanwhile, the columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] for the ''[[New York Post]]'' refuses to continue listening, telling a desperate Bayfield that he will write a damning review of the recital.  Bayfield, with McMoon's help, goes to great lengths so that she only receives good reviews by buying every copy of the ''New York Post'' in the vicinity and throwing them away. After being given sarcastically patronizing comments about her performance alluding to the ''New York Post'''s review by a pair of young men, Florence is driven to find a copy of the review in a [[Waste container|trash can]] and is upset to the point of collapse. As she is dying in bed, Bayfield by her side, Florence remembers a fancy angel costume worn for the concert as an angel and imagines herself singing beautiful opera.<ref></ref> She imagines that she, McMoon and Bayfield all take a triumphant bow to a [[standing ovation]]. She points out proudly that even though people can say she ''could not'' sing, no one can say she ''did not'' sing. Peacefully, she dies.  
A Flying Jatt
 Wealthy and influential businessman Mr. Malhotra ([[Kay Kay Menon]]) has built a factory on the shore of a lake into which pollutants and toxic waste are released.

After Malhotra fails to intimidate the Dhillon family into selling their land, he brings in Raka ([[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]]), a mercenary, to get the job done. Raka arrives at the tree with a chainsaw but Aman is present there and tries to stop him. Raka beats Aman badly but moments before he tries to decapitate him with the saw a lightning bolt hits the tree. The impact flings Raka away and he lands amongst barrels of toxic waste outside Malhotra's factory.  The next morning, Aman finds himself in his bed alive with no sign of any injury and presumes all that happened to be a dream. He also does not notice a [[Khanda (Sikh symbol)|khanda]] that has appeared on his back, the same symbol which was carved on the tree and had been imprinted on him during the attack. Later that day, he and his brother notice a few unusual things happening to him, such as increased agility and the ability to absorb information by touching objects. After escaping an ambush using super speed, Rohit and his mother confirm that Aman has somehow gained super powers. She immediately declares him a superhero.

However, believing Flying Jatt to be dead, the people decide to take on Raka on their own, with even Malhotra joining them after his daughter is affected by the increasing pollution. Raka returns to kill them once and for all, but Flying Jatt suddenly appears. Raka, in a fit of rage, drags Flying Jatt to the sacred tree and tries to kill him when his mother reappears before them and prays, giving more inspiration to Aman who gets up and takes Raka to an [[asteroid]] near Earth.

Initially, certain patients in the hospital are marked to be sent to the [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre]], where they are euthanized, but central authorities dictate that the euthanasia operation and decisions be transferred to individual institutions, leaving Dr. Veithausen to direct his nurses to execute patients under their care. The newly hired nurse, Sister Kiefer, has transferred from Hadamar and is willing to [[Child euthanasia in Nazi Germany|exterminate child patients]] using [[barbiturate]]s. Meanwhile Sister Sophia tries to protect the children from being poisoned.    Ernst befriends Nandl, a fellow patient, and over time they become aware of Dr. Veithausen's plans to execute the patients in the institution.  He attempts to work out an escape plan to save Nandl and himself. The doctor, following the logic of [[racial hygiene]], devises a plan to starve patients slowly by feeding them boiled vegetable soup with all nutrients removed, which satisfies his Nazi superiors. Not long after, Ernst plans his escape during an [[airstrike|air raid]], but he fails when a bomb drops nearby and the falling debris injures Nandl and kills Sister Sophia. After the nurse's funeral, Ernst accuses Veithausen of being a murderer.  Dr. Veithausen calls for Ernst's death, which is carried out by either Paul Hechtle or Sister Kiefer (both deny being the killer). Nandl breaks the news to the other patients by claiming that Ernst has finally made it to America.

The Forest (2016 film)
 The majority of the story is set in and around the [[Aokigahara|Aokigahara Forest]], a forest at the northwest base of [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan known as a popular destination for suicide.  Sara Price ([[Natalie Dormer]]), an American woman, receives a phone call from the Japanese police telling her that they think her troubled twin sister Jess Price (also Dormer) is dead, as she was seen going into Aokigahara forest. Despite the concerns of her fiancé, Rob, she journeys to Japan and arrives at the hotel where her sister was staying.  At her hotel, Sara meets a reporter named Aiden. They drink together, and she tells him of her parents' death. In reality, her father killed her mother, then committed suicide, but she tells him they were killed by a drunk driver. Her sister saw the bodies, but she didn't look. Aiden invites her to go into the forest with him and a park guide, Michi, so she can look for her sister.  As the three enter Aokigahara, Michi tells Sara that Jess has most likely killed herself. Sara refuses to believe this, explaining how, being a twin, she can "feel" that Jess is still alive. Deep in the woods, the group discovers a yellow tent that Sara recognizes as Jess's. With nightfall approaching, Michi suggests they leave a note for Jess and leave. Sara refuses, and Aiden volunteers to stay with her through the night.  That night, Sara hears rustling in the bushes and, believing it may be Jess, rushes into the woods after her. Sara finds a Japanese girl, Hoshiko, who claims to know Jess. The girl warns Sara not to trust Aiden and flees at the sound of his voice. Sara attempts to chase after her but falls and loses her.  The next day, Aiden and Sara become lost and begin to walk around the forest. As they walk, Sara's suspicions are raised and she demands Aiden to give her his phone and finds a picture of Jess on it. Aiden denies any involvement with Jess, but Sara runs into the forest alone. While running she begins to hear voices telling her to turn around. She appears to be unfazed by this until she hears the voice directly behind her. She turns around to see a hanging body and continues to run away. She then falls through a hole into a cave and goes unconscious, later she wakes up and discovers that she is in the cave with Hoshiko, who turns out to be a ''[[yūrei]]''. Hoshiko then turns into what appears to be a "demonic figure". Sara then runs back towards the cave's opening, where Aiden finds her and helps her out of the cave.  After some convincing, they continue to walk together.  Aiden brings Sara to an old ranger station he claims he'd discovered while looking for her. Sara hears her sister's voice coming from a locked basement, and finds a note which implies that Aiden is holding Jess captive in the basement. Convinced that he is a threat, Sara attacks and kills Aiden with a small kitchen knife. As he dies, Sara realizes that Aiden was telling the truth and that the picture on his phone, the voice at the basement door and the note had all been hallucinations.  In the basement of the ranger station, Sara sees a vision of the night her parents died. The ghost of her father suddenly appears and lunges toward her, grabbing her wrist. She cuts his fingers away from her wrist and escapes the station. Running into the forest, she sees Jess running toward the lights of the search party. Sara calls to her sister, who is unable to hear her. She realizes that her escape from the ranger station was another hallucination. When she cut at her father's fingers she was actually cutting deep into her own wrists, and is now dying from blood loss in the basement. As she succumbs to her wounds, hands of a group of ''yūrei'' pull Sara into the forest floor. Her very much alive sister is rescued by the search party and explains that the "feeling" of her sister is gone and it is assumed that Jess knows Sara is dead. As the search party leaves, Michi suddenly sees a dark figure at the edge of the forest and realizes that it's Sara who has turned into an demonic spirit. Sara attacks Michi.

The Founder
 In 1954, [[Ray Kroc]] is an unsuccessful traveling salesman selling Prince Castle brand milkshake mixers. While he has a supportive wife, Ethel, and has saved enough to live a simple and comfortable life in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]], [[Illinois]], he craves more. Ray also observes that many of the drive-in restaurants that he tries to sell to are inefficiently run, with a long waiting time for orders and [[carhop]]s more concerned with avoiding the groping from [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] than getting the orders right. After learning that a drive-in in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to [[California]] to see it. What he finds is [[McDonald's]]—a highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging, and a family-friendly atmosphere.  Ray meets with the two McDonald brothers, [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|Maurice "Mac" and Richard "Dick" McDonald]]. Mac gives Ray a tour of the kitchens and he notes the employees' strong work ethic. Dick explains the high-quality food and lightning-fast service are the backbones of their restaurant. Ray takes the brothers to dinner and is told the origin story of McDonald's. The next day, Ray suggests that the brothers [[franchising|franchise]] the restaurant, but they hesitate; pointing out that they already tried, only to have encountered absentee franchisees who were lackadaisical in upholding their system. Ray persists and eventually convinces the brothers to allow him to lead their franchising efforts on the condition that he agree to a contract which requires all changes to receive the McDonald brothers' approval in writing.  Initially, Ray begins building a McDonald's restaurant in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]] while attempting to entice wealthy investors (specifically fellow members at his country club) to open franchises, but encounters the same poor management ethic which doomed the original franchise efforts. After encountering a dedicated Bible salesman who is Jewish, Ray hits on the idea of franchising to middle-class investors, who have more incentive to be hands-on and are willing to follow the McDonald's formula. This proves successful, and new franchises begin opening across the Midwest, with Ray representing himself as the creator of McDonald's. During this time, Ray meets Rollie Smith, an upscale restaurant owner in [[Minnesota]] who wishes to invest, and his wife [[Joan Kroc|Joan]], to whom Ray is immediately attracted.  Despite his success, Ray begins to encounter financial difficulties as his share of franchise profits is limited due to his contract, a share that the McDonald brothers decline to renegotiate. The brothers also refuse to allow the use of sponsorships for fear of ruining the image of their restaurants. Meanwhile, the owners are encountering higher than expected costs, particularly for refrigeration of large quantities of ice cream for milkshakes. Joan suggests a powdered milkshake to Ray as a way to avoid these costs, but the brothers consider it degrading to their food quality. Ray is also called to the bank as his [[mortgage]] is past due, but this is overheard by [[Harry J. Sonneborn|Harry Sonneborn]], a financial consultant for [[Tastee-Freez]], who requests to review Ray's books. Sonneborn realizes that the real profit opportunity is in providing real estate to the franchisees, which will not only provide a revenue stream, but give Ray leverage over his franchisees and the brothers. Ray incorporates a new company, Franchise Realty Corporation, and attracts new investors. This move upsets the brothers and emboldens Ray: He increasingly defies them by circumventing their authority and providing powdered milkshakes to all franchisees. Ray also divorces Ethel, who gets all his assets except any shares in his business.  Ray renames his company to the McDonald's Corporation and demands to be released from his contract and buy the McDonald brothers out, the news of which sends Mac into diabetic shock. Ray visits him in the hospital and offers a blank check to settle their business. The brothers agree to a $2.7 million lump sum payment, ownership of their original restaurant in San Bernardino, and a 1% annual royalty, but when the time comes to finalize the agreement, Ray refuses to include the royalty in the settlement and instead offers it as a [[handshake deal]]. Afterwards, in the men's room, Dick asks Ray why he had to take over their business, when he could have easily stolen their idea and recreated it. Ray argues that the true value of McDonald's is the name itself, which expresses all the attributes of [[Americana]] (as opposed to his [[Czech people|Czech]] Slavic-sounding name of Kroc).  The McDonald brothers are forced to take their own name off the original restaurant and Ray opens a new McDonald's franchise directly across the street, finally putting the brothers out of business. The film closes in 1970, Ray with him preparing a speech where he praises himself for his success in his elaborate mansion with his new wife, Joan. An epilogue reveals that the McDonald brothers were never paid their royalties, which could have been in the area of $100 million a year.

After helping one family resist such a raid, he is pursued by Confederate agents and bitten by an [[attack dog]]. With the help of [[Abolitionism#United States|abolitionist]]-oriented Aunt Sally and multiple slaves, he escapes to a swamp where some runaway slaves led by Moses Washington tend to his wounds.  After the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], many Confederates abandon their post, and many of them end up at the swamp, where Newton becomes their captain. The ex-Confederates and runaway slaves form a revolt against the Confederacy. They raid Confederate convoys and capture a piece of south-east Mississippi, organizing it as the "[[Liberty|Free]] [[State (polity)|State]] of Jones".

Since he is possibly of one-eighth black descent, under Mississippi law at that time he is considered black, and therefore could not legally marry his long-time sweetheart. He is sentenced to five years in prison, but his conviction is thrown out by the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] in 1949, rather than risk the law being declared unconstitutional.

Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marina's body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that she's been seeing Marina too. Laura's video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina.

 Ben ([[Paul Rudd]]) is a retired writer.  Needing a new job, he takes a six-week course to become a caregiver. He gets a job from an English woman named Elsa ([[Jennifer Ehle]]), a registered caregiver and an office manager at a bank, whose 18-year-old son Trevor ([[Craig Roberts]]) suffers from [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]. Trevor is a sardonic, anxious boy with a fascination with American roadside attractions, and Ben suggests one day that they go to see some of them. Trevor initially refuses, and Elsa worries Ben is becoming too close to him, as Trevor's father left when he was diagnosed, only sending him letters throughout the years. Ben soon finds himself hounded by a court tracker hired by his wife and avoids his visits.  Eventually, Elsa agrees with Ben's road trip plan, and he and Trevor embark on a journey to the world's deepest pit. On the way there, Trevor says he wants to see his father, who owns a car dealership in [[Salt Lake City]]. Stopping at a gas station, the two meet a girl Trevor's age named Dot ([[Selena Gomez]]), who Trevor develops a crush on. When they encounter her again at a diner later on, they see her attempting to hitchhike, and Ben decides to give her a ride. Dot informs them on the way that she is heading to Denver to restart her life, and that her mother has died. As the three bond, especially she and Trevor, Ben notices a car that has been following them, and tells the two of it at a motel. He believes it is someone sent by his wife.  Further down the highway, the three find a pregnant woman named Peaches ([[Megan Ferguson]]), whose car has broken down. She is heading to live with her mother before the baby comes, as the father is currently on his second U.S. military tour. They give her a ride as well, and when they stop for the night, Trevor asks Dot on a date, which she accepts, and the two go to the diner across the street from them. Ben and Peaches watch through from the motel through the diner window, and can see it is going well. The next day, the four make it to Trevor's father's car dealership. When he meets with his dad, he informs Trevor he never wrote him letters, and that it was his mother this whole time, and his father stays distant. Outraged, Trevor berates Ben and tells him he wishes to go home, but Dot insists they continue to the world's deepest pit.  The group eventually makes it there, in awe of the abyss. Trevor, Dot, and Peaches head to the bottom, but Ben notices the car that's been following them. He walks over, and finds it's not his wife's tracker, but Dot's father, who wishes to make sure she's safe. Ben then receives a call from Dot, who tells him to quickly come down. When he sees a crowd gathered at the bottom of the pit, he worries and finds Peaches has gone into labor. Despite being tormented by the memory of his son's death, he successfully helps deliver the baby. Peaches thanks him as she and her newborn son are taken to the hospital. In the parking lot, Dot sees her father and walks up to him, the two reconciling. When she comes back, she tells the two she wishes to go the rest of the journey with her father, and the three say their goodbyes, Dot kissing Trevor before she leaves, promising they'll text. With the assistance of the ambulance staff, Trevor gets to fulfill his wish peeing standing over the pit railing.  Ben and Trevor make it home safely, and having finally coped with the loss of his son, Ben meets his estranged wife and gives her the divorce papers. He continues writing, his next novel being about Trevor. He narrates his writing the last few lines, informing the audience that he eventually quit as Trevor's caregiver, but the two remained friends. On Trevor's 21st birthday, Ben went into his room to find Trevor lying dead on the floor and his new caregiver crying on the floor next to him, only to find out Trevor was faking. The caregiver quit the next day.  
From Vegas to Macau III
 The film starts with the ending of ''[[From Vegas to Macau II]]'' where the cardshark Ken’s ([[Chow Yun Fat]]) lifelong lover-nemesis, Molly ([[Carina Lau]]), skydives without her parachute from her private jet. She now appears to be trapped inside some sort of laser bubble — unconscious, naked and horribly airbrushed — while her admirer, mad scientist Yik Tin Hang ([[Jacky Cheung]]) fumes about making Ken pay within his lair underneath Paradise Island, off the coast of Thailand. Over in Macau, Ken is busy having a meltdown over the wedding of the century of his daughter Rainbow ([[Kimmy Tong]]) to his godson Vincent ([[Shawn Yue]]). To help him snap out of it, his friend Mark ([[Nick Cheung]]) hypnotizes him into thinking Vincent is marrying his fat cousin. Things go very wrong when Michael ([[Andy Lau]]), the disciple of Ko Chun, phoned in with a warning to beware of Yik Tin Hang who has hired mercenaries to kill Ken. An explosion during the wedding causes both Rainbow and Vincent to fall into coma, while Ken and Mark are accused to have engulfed DOA’s illicit money. Enraged, Ken swears to seek vengeance and to pursue the mastermind who has entangled them in his evil plans.  Ken and Mark end up in prison, a convenient venue for them to play a card game using cigarettes as chips (so technically, it’s not gambling), but are then abruptly rescued from a criminal raid and take refuge in Michael’s home in Singapore. Michael’s spacious pad, whose open layout looks suspiciously like a sound stage, serves as a cost-effective location for a lengthy stretch, while a gaggle of characters drop in and out to deliver trite gags. These range from a mildly irritating demo of wonky weapons by an ammo expert ([[Law Kar-ying]]), to a criminally infantile cake-throwing match. Two romantic arcs unfold — one between Ken’s [[R2-D2]] doppelganger robot, Stupido, and Michael’s femme-bot, Skinny; the other a [[love triangle]] involving Michael, Ko’s younger sister Ko Fei ([[Li Yuchun]]) and Mark.  When Yik Tin Hang finally arrives to exact revenge, he challenges Ken and his friends to a game of table tennis. He later invites them to a “charity” mahjong, dice and three-person card game from China (called "Fighting the Landlord") event at a hall within the island resort on Paradise Island. A host of cameos are trotted out, including [[Psy]] of "[[Gangnam Style]]" fame, who was then escorted out of the hall. After the games, sleeping gas is released into the hall, causing Ken and the guests to pass out.  Ken and his friends sneak into a warehouse under the hall, where they battle Yik Tin Hang's mercenaries and four robots. Stupido and Skinny, who fly all the way to the resort, save them and defeat the robots, but are heavily damaged in the process. Michael encounters nine tough [[android (robot)|android]]s, who attack him, but he tricks them, and Only Yu arrives with [[Interpol]] officers, pressing a large button that forces the androids to dance and then self-destruct. Ken confronts Yik Tin Hang in the latter's lair, and Yik Tin Hang electrocutes him with a baton and a gauntlet on his right arm, destroying his laboratory in the process. Molly awakens from her laser bubble and calls Yik Tin Hang, allowing Ken to defeat Yik Tin Hang. As she dies in Ken's arms, Yik Tin Hang watches and dies as well.  At the end of the movie, Ken and his friends celebrate [[Chinese New Year]] in Michael's house. Stupido and Skinny, who had been repaired, are brought with their robotic offspring to Ken's celebration.

Gantz: O
  While fighting invading monsters, Kei Kurono rescues his friend, Reika. Though she protests, he attacks the monsters' leader, dying after killing it. Reika and her surviving teammates are teleported back to their base. Elsewhere, Masaru Kato dies attempting to save someone from a knife attack in a subway. He wakes up in a room with Reika and her teammates: Yoshikazu Suzuki, an old man; Joichiro Nishi, a surly teenager; and an angry, unidentified man. Suzuki explains that they have each died and woken in the room, and have been forced to fight against waves of monsters ever since. Before Suzuki can explain further, a black orb identified as "Gantz" announces that their next mission is about to begin. The angry man refuses to participate and is killed by Nishi, who reasons that he would have been a liability.  After putting on skintight suits containing advanced technology, the group is teleported to Osaka. When Kato presses for answers, Nishi threatens to kill him. Suzuki quickly explains the "game": the team is given two hours to kill every monster in the city; if they fail, the team members die. After Kato and his team meet another team, some of whom have exotic weapons, Suzuki tells him that players accrue points for killing monsters. Anyone who scores 100 points can choose from three bonuses: upgraded weaponry, resurrection of a fallen teammate, or freedom from the "game".   Nishi turns invisible to stealthily wait for high point monsters. The others watch as the better-equipped Osaka team easily slaughters monsters. Reika and Suzuki urge Kato to not engage the monsters needlessly, but he insists that they rescue the city's citizens. They refuse, saying they are too weak.  Anzu Yamasaki, a member of the Osaka team, follows Kato, trying to figure out his motivation. Kato says he is a student who has been living alone with his younger brother since the death of their parents. Yamasaki reveals that she has a young son and says they have something in common: both must stay alive to help someone who depends on them. Although Yamasaki initially believes that Kato is showing off, she eventually concludes that he genuinely wants to help others and joins him in killing a monster that was menacing civilians.  A gigantic monster rises from the water, and an equally large mecha appears, piloted by seven-time winner Hachiro Oka. Oka kills the monster but loses his mecha. In the mean time, another monster kills the two most competent players on the Osaka team.  Oka, wounded and weaponless, engages the lead monster, who appears in a series of increasingly deadly forms. Oka appears to win but tells the team it is not dead; it must be taken by surprise to be truly killed. After rising, the demon easily defeats the remaining players. Suzuki is heavily wounded after sacrificing himself to save Kato, and Nishi's arm is ripped off. Instead of killing them, it goes after Oka, who has left to retrieve better weapons.  Knowing someone must defeat the demon and Oka may be too wounded, Kato decides to act as a decoy while Reika and Yamasaki snipe the monster. Before the plan begins, Yamasaki proposes that, if she and Kato survive, they begin living together with her son and Kato's brother. Although surprised, Kato agrees, and they take their positions.  The demon, having killed Oka, attacks Kato, and the others shoot it from a distance. Before dying, the demon kills Yamasaki and maims Kato. Kato collapses beside Yamasaki's body, and the others assume him dead. Reika, Suzuki, and Nishi are surprised when he rejoins them at the base, where all are fully healed. When the scores are tallied up, Kato has 100 points; Reika and Suzuki encourage him to choose his freedom, but he resurrects Yamasaki. After Gantz allows them to leave, Kato races to his brother. The others reveal that this is Kato's second time in Gantz' game: after winning a previous game, he was granted his freedom and had his memories wiped. Although they do not know how he returned, they state that his self-sacrificing nature remains the same.

When Aishwarya and Catherine reach Hyderabad, they are met by Jai and the former's cousin Vamsi. Catherine is shocked to see that Jai is a lookalike of Gautham. After learning from Gautham's mother Yashoda about his death in an accident ten days earlier, she leaves his house grief-stricken. An investigative journalist named Nithya meets her and tells her that she suspects that Gautham was murdered. They initially suspect David, Catherine's uncle, who is admitted to a hospital after an overdose of narcotics.  Catherine reaches the hospital only to learn that Jai has kidnapped the comatose David. Nithya uncovers information about a potential accounting scandal in JaiGowri Finance, and learns that the suicide of Jai's uncle Mohan and Gautham's accident happened on the same day. Catherine and Nithya decide to spy on Jai. Aishwarya recommends Catherine to Jai for a job in the latter's company, to which he reluctantly agrees.

Catherine finds the discharge papers of David and Gautham and a document confirming transfer of 5 billion from Aishwarya's company. She later leaves for an orphanage where David is being treated and finds him dead. Catherine and Nithya spot Jai running away from the orphanage, which strengthens their suspicions.

After mustering courage, Jai kills Vamsi and manages to make it look like a road accident. Jai then destroys all the documents Vamsi had been using to blackmail him.  The following day, Aishwarya finds Jai's clothes and a photograph of him in Catherine's closet and suspects an illicit relationship between them. After Aishwarya calls off her engagement, Catherine confronts Jai and challenges to unveil his real self as a murderer and fraudster. Initially stoic, an emotional Jai reveals that he is Gautham himself by showing a wrist band Catherine had given him before leaving for London. The couple reconcile and Gautham starts narrating the truth.  Vamsi's jealousy at Jai's success made him persuade David, his old friend, to murder him. David agrees, assuming that he is Gautham, whom he considers his rival. Meanwhile, Gautham comes across Jai's photograph in an attempt to find sponsors for his club. He alters his look to resemble Jai and meets Mohan. A dying Mohan reveals that Vamsi coerced him to invest in betting, which resulted in a loss of nearly 5 billion, for which Aishwarya's father Ram Prakash agreed to reimburse him. Meanwhile, David fatally stabs Jai in a warehouse, which is secretly filmed by Vamsi. Gautham reaches the spot and promises Jai to save his company from Vamsi and others.  Gautham then places his clothes and wallet along with Jai's body in his car and pushes it into a lake, making it look like an accident. Yashoda helps him with this cover-up, and Gautham begins his new life as Jai. However, Vamsi, who has filmed all the events, edits the visuals and blackmails Gautham. With Catherine spying on him, Gautham had no option but to remain silent to avoid issues with Vamsi. Aishwarya overhears their conversation, and the families mourn Jai's death.

Ghostbusters (2016 film)
  Physicists Abby Yates and Erin Gilbert are authors of a research book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomena, such as ghosts. While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at [[Columbia University]], disowned the work, fearing it will impact her [[Academic tenure|tenure]]. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange by helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erin's belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves "Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a [[receptionist]].  [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillian's [[Proton pack|proton containment laser]], but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, "Ghostbusters". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed [[hearse]], "[[Ecto-1]]".  Unbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an [[occultist]] attempting to bring about the [[apocalypse]]. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural [[debunker]] Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.  The Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along [[ley line]]s, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in [[Times Square]], a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal.  Erin discovers a copy of her and Abby's book among Rowan's possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.  Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.  Rowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, a disused fire house. New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters. Patty listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others if they have heard of [[Gozer|Zuul]].

Later on, however, D'Souza is killed in a traffic accident in Panvel. Young blogger Zoya Saigal is shocked to discover that Joe was, in fact, shot dead. She had accidentally captured the murder on video, committed by Kabir Raj Bansal, son of business tycoon Raj Bansal. Zoya and her friends panic and want to take the video to the cops but Anushka's (Zoya's friend) grandfather infers that Raj Bansal had staged the road accident (where 8 other innocent people were killed) and stops them, due to Bansal's power. It is further revealed that D'Souza had visited Raj Bansal and directly accused him of a land grab. Bansal tried to buy him off, but an argument ensues, and Kabir, in a fit of rage, shot D'Souza. The accident was a cover up. Bansal privately realizes that Kabir is still a bratty kid and decides to enrol him into a military school.  Following her grandfather's advice, Anushka turns the video over to the lawyer, Kriplani, in order to ensure the children remain safe. However, Kriplani quietly returns it to Bansal, and his son Rohan, also a friend of Zoya, realizes that his father has given up the video and thus urges Zoya to reach Ajay Mehra. As the children hurry to reach Ajay, they are intercepted by Bansal's thugs. A chase ensues and Ajay saves the children, recovering the video. Riya takes the children to the hospital, but they are yet again abducted by Bansal's men.  It is soon revealed that Anushka is Ajay's own daughter. Kabir tortures the children until Bansal, tired of his son's tantrums, warns him away. Bansal holds Ajay's daughter and releases the other children. He tells Ajay that his daughter will henceforth stay with Bansal in order to ensure the safety of Kabir. Bansal's mother objects but Bansal, locked in moral conflict, waves her away. Bansal orders the Home Minister to arrest Ajay Mehra.  Ajay overcomes the cops and mounts an attack on the Bansal mansion to rescue his daughter. There is a fierce fight. Ajay rescues his own daughter as well as Bansal's daughter who gets trapped in the debris. Bansal surrenders and is arrested along with his son.

The Girl with All the Gifts (film)
  In the near future, humanity has been ravaged by a mysterious fungal disease (a [[mutation]] of [[Ophiocordyceps unilateralis]]). The afflicted have turned into fast, mindless flesh-eaters, referred to as 'hungries'. Humankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid, second generation children who crave living flesh but retain the ability to think and learn. The children are imprisoned, and go to "school" at an army base in the [[Home Counties]], where they are experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell. Helen Justineau is responsible for educating and studying the children. Among the children is an exceptional girl named Melanie.  The base is overrun and the lab is breached.  Melanie escapes the lab and wanders outside, where soldiers are violently attacked in a failing, chaotic mass breach.  Melanie is stunned by what she sees, but violently attacks and infects two soldiers who are trying to restrain Helen. Helen and Melanie jump aboard an escaping armoured van.  The soldiers want to shoot Melanie, but Helen shields her and Caldwell insists she needs her. Melanie is muzzled and restrained as the group escapes into the wilderness. After the van breaks down, the group reaches London on foot and barricade themselves overnight. Caldwell reveals to Melanie that "second generation" hungries were discovered after newborns killed their infected mothers by burrowing out of the womb. In the morning, the group realize they have been surrounded by a horde of hungries, and Melanie volunteers to help. She captures a small dog to use as bait, leading the hungries away so the group can escape.  As they progress through London they come across a mass of infected bodies encircling the overgrown [[BT Tower]]. Caldwell explains to the group that the fungal growth contains seed pods, which if released could end humankind. The group also come across a mobile laboratory in which they take shelter. Caldwell, injured during the group's trip across london, reasons that she can save Helen and the human race by sacrificing Melanie to complete her vaccine research. As the group runs out of food, a member ventures into the city alone and is trapped by a tribe of hybrid children. Caldwell stays behind as the remaining group forms an aborted rescue mission.  Upon their return, Caldwell sedates the group and confronts Melanie. Melanie comes to the realization that she is not an experiment, and that her kind will be the future. Melanie escapes to the centre of London and sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to release an immense cloud of airborne spores. Caldwell chases after her but is killed by the tribe of children. Sgt. Parks (a member of the group) finds Melanie by the tower ablaze. He cries out at end of the world, whereas Melanie simply states it's just "not yours anymore". He hands Melanie his sidearm, and she tearfully obliges as he is about to turn. Melanie then returns to the lab. Helen, standing just inside the hermetically sealed door, fearfully watches the spores fall around the lab.  The film closes with a tearful Helen awakening, secure but imprisoned inside the mobile med lab. Outside, the second generation children of the army base, along with the feral children sit together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Helen speaks through a microphone, once again to educate the children.

Gods of Egypt (film)
  Set in the mythology of ancient Egypt, the world is flat and the [[Egyptian gods]] live among humans, they differ from humans by their greater height, golden blood, and ability to transform into their divine forms.  A young thief named Bek and his love Zaya are attending the coronation of [[Horus]]. During the ceremony, [[Osiris]] is killed by his extremely jealous brother [[Set (deity)|Set]], who seizes the throne and declares a new regime where the dead will have to pay with riches to pass into the afterlife. Horus is stripped of his eyes, the source of his power, and almost killed. His love, [[Hathor]] pleads with Set to spare him and he is instead exiled in exchange for Egypt's surrender.  A year later, Bek has been working as a slave building monuments while Zaya is now under the ownership of Set's chief architect Urshu. Believing that Horus is the only one who can defeat Set, she gives Bek the floor plans to his treasure vault and also manages to get a glimpse of the plans for his pyramid. Bek is able to steal back one of Horus' eyes from the treasure vault. However, Urshu finds out and kills Zaya as the couple flee. Bek takes her body to the blind Horus and makes a bargain: Horus agrees to bring Zaya back from the dead for his eye and Bek's knowledge about Set's pyramid.  The two fly to the [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|divine vessel]] of Horus' grandfather [[Ra]]. Horus is unable to convince Ra to regrant him his power so he can defeat Set himself, as Ra is both neutral about their conflict and daily at war with the enormous shadow beast [[Apep|Apophis]] that threatens to devour the world. He does however allow Horus to obtain a vial of the divine waters that surround his vessel, which can extinguish the desert thirst and weaken Set gravely. Ra tells Horus that his weakness is the result of him not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.  Set asks Hathor to take him to the underworld, but she refuses and escapes. After surviving an attack by Set's Egyptian [[Minotaur]]s led by [[Mnevis]] and an attack by some of Set's minions and their giant cobras, Hathor finds and saves Bek and Horus. Horus at first doesn't trust her as she is a mistress of Set, while she tries to convince him that Set is her enemy as well. When they tell her of their plan regarding Set's pyramid, she warns them of a guardian [[Sphinx#Egyptian sphinxes|sphinx]] who will kill anyone not wise enough to solve a riddle. The group then heads to the library of [[Thoth]], so they can recruit him to solve the riddle.  Arriving at Set's pyramid, they overcome its traps including the sphinx, to reach the source of Set's power. But before they can pour the divine water, Set traps them and reveals to Bek that Horus cannot bring Zaya back from the dead. Set destroys their flask and kills Thoth by taking his brain. Horus is able to save Hathor and Bek. Horus admits to caring more about his revenge than the mortals. Hathor sacrifices her own safety for Zaya's payment into the afterlife by giving Bek her bracelet and calls [[Anubis]] to take him to Zaya, letting herself be dragged to the underworld.  Having combined Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, Horus's eye, and wings from [[Nephthys]] with himself, Set travels to Ra, questioning his favoritism for Osiris and denying him the throne and children. Ra claims that all of Set's prior mistreatments were tests preparing Set for his true role: taking Ra's place as the defender of the world aboard his solar barge, fighting against Apophis. Set is dismayed and wants to destroy the afterlife so that he can be immortal. Ra tries to fight Set by blasting him with his spear, though Set survives. He stabs Ra, takes his spear of power, and casts him off the boat freeing Apophis to consume both the mortal and underworld realms.  Bek finds Zaya, who refuses Hathor's gift as she doesn't want an afterlife without Bek, but then Apophis attacks and the [[Book of Gates|gate to the afterlife]] is closed. Bek returns to the mortal world, where Horus is amazed that Bek still wants to help take down Set. Bek tells him it was Zaya who told him to, as she still has faith in Horus.  Horus climbs up the outer wall of an obelisk Set is standing on and attempts to battle him, but is heavily outmatched. Whilst Bek fights Urshu who is thrown off to his death, Bek ascends on the inside and joins the battle, removing Horus's stolen eye from Set's armor, being wounded in the process. As Bek slides toward the edge of the obelisk, he throws the eye toward Horus, who must choose to catch it or save Bek instead. Horus reaches for Bek and apologizes for all he has put him through. As they plummet toward the ground, Horus regains the power to transform and he catches Bek and flies him to safety. Horus realizes that it wasn't the recovery of his eye nor revenge that was his destiny, it was the protection of his people that he needed to fight for. Now, Horus has the strength for battling Set, and he gains the obelisk and kills him. He then finds Ra wounded and floating in space, and returns his spear to him, allowing Ra to once again repel Apophis and for Anubis to reopen the gates.  As Horus returns to Bek, a child holds out his other eye, while people cheer him. Horus finds Bek dying from the wounds he sustained whilst fighting Set, carries him to Osiris's tomb and lays him beside Zaya. Ra arrives and offers to bestow any power on him to repay Horus for his life and Egypt's survival. All Horus wants is bringing Bek and Zaya back to life. The other gods are also revived and have their attributes restored (except for Osiris and Isis, who died a full year before). Horus is crowned king by Thoth and declares the afterlife will be for those who do good in the world. Bek is made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|chief advisor]], and he gives Horus back Hathor's bracelet letting him leave to rescue her from the underworld.

God's Not Dead 2
 [[Advanced Placement|AP History]] teacher Grace Wesley ([[Melissa Joan Hart]]), a devout evangelical Christian, notices that one of her students, Brooke Thawley ([[Hayley Orrantia]]), is withdrawn following the recent accidental death of her brother. Involved in little more than her studies, Brooke notices Grace's hope-filled attitude, and asks where Grace finds her optimism. Grace replies "Jesus", and Brooke begins to read the [[Bible]] for herself. As Grace lectures on [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], Brooke asks whether their peaceful teachings relate to the biblical account of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. Grace responds in the affirmative, and relates parts of scripture to his teachings. One student immediately texts his parents about the class, and the ensuing backlash draws the ire of Principal Kinney ([[Robin Givens]]). She reprimands Grace, saying that the teacher's faith clouded her judgment. Grace is subsequently brought before the School Board, who inform her that legal action will be taken against her as she has violated the [[separation of church and state]]. Grace's case draws the attention of Tom Endler ([[Jesse Metcalfe]]), a young defense attorney who is willing to aid her despite being an unbeliever himself.  After speaking to his friend Josh, Martin Yip, a college student, visits Pastor David Hill (David A. R. White) to ask him several questions about God. Former left-wing blogger Amy Ryan goes to the hospital to check in on her cancer, only to find that it has miraculously vanished. She talks to Michael Tait of the [[Newsboys]], who encourages her, stating that with faith, prayers can be answered. Amy ponders this, and later makes her blog a diary about her adventures with God.  The School Board brings Grace's case before a judge in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], hoping to secure her termination and strip her of her teaching license unless she issues an apology, which Grace refuses to do. To Brooke's horror, prosecutor Pete Kane ([[Ray Wise]]) declares that the lawsuit will "prove once and for all that [[God is dead]]". His opening argument suggests that the society of the United States will crumble should Grace fail to be found guilty. Endler responds by stating that Grace was simply doing her job, and that the law separating church and state was written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in an effort to protect the church, not persecute it. Kane builds a strong case against Grace by bringing forward witnesses such as Kinney and Brooke's parents, prompting Endler to rethink their defense. Meanwhile Brooke stands in solidarity with her friends against Kinney. The defense is dealt another blow when their key juror, David, becomes ill. [[Christian apologist]] [[J. Warner Wallace]] is called as an expert witness, arguing that it is illogical to think that [[the gospel]] was a conspiracy because despite facing persecution and death, none of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] ever retracted the accounts of seeing the risen [[Jesus]]. Kane is floored to learn that Wallace was formerly an atheist who was converted to Christianity.  Amy encourages Brooke to follow her heart, despite what others are making her do. Martin is surprised to find his father in his college dorm. Mr. Yip angrily rebukes Martin for following God despite the family's sacrifices. Martin refuses to deny God, and Mr. Yip disowns him, then leaves. A heartbroken Martin goes to the church, where he finds Brooke. They talk about God, and Martin eventually brings Brooke to God. Later, Brooke sets up a protest to support Grace.  Brooke is allowed as a witness. Kane is able to trick her into admitting that it was Grace and not Brooke who initiated their first conversation about Jesus. As Grace becomes more and more discouraged, Brooke and her friends sing her a song in an attempt to build up her spirits. Martin visits David in the hospital with his friend Paul, and announces that he feels his call is as a pastor in China. Using a tactic to position Grace as a hostile witness, Endler gets the judge to inform the jury not to let their bias or prejudices interfere with their verdict. The jury ultimately finds in favor of Grace, who rejoices along with Brooke and Endler as Kane stands humiliated.  In a post-credits scene, a fully recovered David, hungry after having ice chips for 2 days, returns to church with Paul who offers, "I'm hungry as well, David. How 'bout I take you for a nice, tuna melt?" Suddenly, David is then arrested for refusing to turn in his sermons to the government, (shown earlier in the film). Paul and Martin watch as David is taken away. Then, Martin wonders what to do next, and Paul replies "Same as always, Martin. We pray in faith." as David is driven off to jail, setting up the events for the sequel: ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.

Gold (2016 film)
 In 1981, Kenny Wells helps to run a prospecting company, Washoe, with his father whom he clearly admires. But seven years after his father dies, the business and Kenny are nearly broke after having lost the office, so Kenny and his colleagues now work out of his girlfriend's bar.  Kenny, now living with his girlfriend, Kay, has a dream that leads him to Indonesia where he meets up with geologist Michael Acosta. Both are struggling financially, but Kenny manages to convince Mike to go into business. Kenny then flies back to America and raises the promised money to finance their mine.  Unfortunately, the mine struggles and fails to show any gold, so the workers soon leave until Mike persuades them to come back with the promise of fresh water. Kenny contracts malaria and is bed-ridden for the next few weeks. When he finally wakes up, Mike reveals that they have had a strike and now have a gold mine.  After celebrating, Kenny goes back to America where he sets up a new office for Washoe and is approached by a major Wall Street bank. Mike accompanies Kenny to their meeting and, after a disagreement, decides to bring some of the bank associates to Indonesia in order to show them the mine. This wins the bank over and it invests $20 million in Washoe, leading the venture to become a public company. Washoe proves to be a huge success and increases 70 points in its first day on the stock market.  Kenny's life becomes celebratory as he goes from one party to the next, but Kay, fearing that he will be tricked and cut out, argues with him and then leaves after seeing him flirting with another woman, Rachael Hill. He is interrupted by Mark Hancock, a high-profile executive of a major mining company, who approaches him regarding buying the company. Kenny meets with him the next day and is offered $300 million for a portion of the mine, but his company's name would be removed. Offended by this, Kenny declines the offer and storms out. The next day on his way into the office Mike phones to tell Kenny that the Indonesian Government has closed the mine; it is also revealed that a previous US President sits on the board in Hancock's company and that he is a friend of the Indonesian president Suharto.  Kenny is disconsolate and seems to be defeated, but Mike flies to the US and offers a plan to win their mine back. They manage to convince the president's son to join them in business, after Kenny proves himself by stroking a tiger. The mine is reopened with Washoe receiving 15% of what now is a $30 billion business.  Kenny thinks of going back to Kay but, seeing her flirting with another man at her new job, decides against it. Kenny is then told that he has been honored with a golden pickax, the greatest prize for a prospector. The evening comes, and he goes with Mike, who walks out during Kenny's speech.  The next day something has gone wrong as Kenny drives to his office and has to push his way through an angry crowd of people. It is then announced that Mike had faked the whole mine as he planted the gold onto the stone using a method called '[[Salting (confidence trick)|salting]]'. The gold that he planted was in fact 'river gold' that had been seen earlier in the film. Mike had traded fresh water for the people's river gold so that he could fake the gold mine. Mike is reported to have fled.  Kenny is then questioned by the FBI. He retells his story from a chair in his hotel room that he now cannot afford. The FBI agents seem to believe him and state that Mike was later captured by the Indonesian authorities while on the run and then possibly forced to jump out of a helicopter, some 1000 feet above the jungle. The corpse had its hands and face chewed clean off by wild animals, so Acosta's death is never proven. The agents also say that both the Indonesian minister and Mike dumped their stocks before the scandal broke and that Mike possessed 164 million US Dollars when he fled.  Kenny returns to Kay's house where he apologizes and later looks through his mail received since they have been apart. He opens one envelope and finds the napkin Mike and he signed as a contract, reading "50–50". Beneath the napkin is a deposit slip for $82 million to First Bank of Gibraltar, Queens Lane Branch, United Kingdom.  
The Good Neighbor (film)
 Ethan (Miller) and Sean (Gilchrist) are tech-savvy high-school teenagers who decide to prank their neighbor Harold Grainey (Caan) by convincing him that his house is haunted. When Grainey leaves home one morning, the two set up equipment to simulate the haunting, as well as hidden cameras that will broadcast Grainey's reactions.  As the basis for a school project, Ethan requests Sean's assistance in setting up hidden cameras at Grainey's home so both can view a person's unfiltered reaction to being haunted by a poltergeist, despite Sean's initial reservations. The cameras are set up so that both can monitor Grainey's reactions for six weeks live from computers in Ethan's bedroom. Grainey has a reputation for being hostile, a recluse, and a "creepy old man" in the neighborhood, which makes it easier for Ethan to justify choosing him as his subject.  Ethan starts to initiate activities aimed at unsettling Grainey to make him believe the house is haunted, including making the kitchen door bang loudly in the middle of the night, disabling the heating system (which causes the bedroom window to shatter because of the freezing temperature), and activating the stereo in the middle of the night.  Throughout the movie, we are shown flashforwards to a criminal trial and flashbacks of Grainey and his wife. These flashbacks are all linked with the "paranormal" activities that the boys try to use to unsettle Grainey. For example, a flashback shows Grainey's wife dancing to music at 3 a.m. and crying, and one of the activities the boys do is play the same song at a similar time. Another example is how Grainey's wife used to complain about the door not shutting correctly and banging. The first activity the boys did was slam the door continuously, leading to Grainey destroying it with an axe.  But both Sean and Ethan are mystified by Grainey's ability to withstand all these strange occurrences. In one instance, they observe Grainey being disturbed by all the strange noises and then going down to the house's basement. The duo are not able to observe what he does, as they were not able to set up a camera there as the door was locked. Grainey goes down at about 11:30 p.m. and only emerges after 7:30 a.m. This leaves Ethan perplexed, and he vows to determine the reason. They try calling the police, claiming they heard a woman screaming in his basement. The police officer arrives and Grainey allows him to look in the basement, and the cop leaves after being satisfied there is nothing in there.   Ethan begins to push for them to break into Grainey's basement, but Sean refuses. In an argument with Ethan, Sean discloses to Ethan that he knows the true reason why Ethan has targeted Grainey: Grainey was responsible for sending Ethan's father to jail many years ago. Ethan's father was an alcoholic who beat his wife regularly. During one such episode, Ethan's mother ran to Grainey for help. Grainey informed the police, which led to Ethan's father being jailed and ultimately getting divorced from his wife. Ethan believes Grainey is responsible for destroying his family and making him lose his father. In the meantime, Ethan throws a Halloween party, and Sean and his new girlfriend decide to make out in a spare bedroom. His girlfriend notices a camera installed on top of the bed, which leaves Sean enraged.   Sean asks Ethan to return all his equipment, but Ethan refuses, threatening Sean with the fact that the equipment was purchased using his credit card and that it is covered in Sean's fingerprints. In the middle of their argument, they observe Grainey's cat toppling over one of the living room cameras. Ethan runs to his home to collect the camera, and in doing so finds the basement door unlocked. He goes down to find that Grainey had made a shrine to his late wife in the basement. Ethan lifts a bell which Grainey gifted his wife, causing the bell to make a sound which awakes Grainey. Fearing for his safety, Ethan hides in the living room, placing the bell on a table. Grainey sees the bell, and kills himself with his gun.  It is then revealed in a series of flashbacks that Grainey loved his wife dearly, and he had set up a room where he could take care of her, including arranging a nurse. The viewer then realises that every activity performed by the boys related to Grainey's wife somehow, and Grainey is convinced that he is being haunted by his wife. A flashback is shown when Grainey first gives her the bell, saying that whenever she needed him, she only had to ring the bell. The bell noise that awoke him and the fact that the bell was on the table leads Grainey to believe it was as a sign that his wife wants him to be with her, which is why he killed himself.  Ethan and Sean are arrested and sentenced to two years' probation and 500 hours community service. Leaving the courthouse, Ethan is surrounded by a slew of reporters and cameras. Having finally gained the attention he admitted to craving in an earlier scene, a slight smile appears on his face. Sean looks horrified as he realizes the ordeal may have sent his friend down a dark path.

Goldstone (film)
 Three years after exposing the corruption in his hometown of Winton, Indigenous Detective Jay Swan is sent to the small mining town of Goldstone to find a missing Asian tourist. He is pulled over by young local cop Josh for driving under the influence, who informs the town's corrupt mayor Maureen. Jay tells Josh of his case and Josh reluctantly lets him stay at his house.  Josh goes to the local mine, Furnace Creek, to meet with the mine's supervisor Johnny, who attempts to bribe Josh into helping Furnace Creek expand their operations. Johnny meets with Maureen, who is trying to help him get past the local Indigenous land council by bribing the land council's head Tommy into allowing the use of Indigenous land. Jay meets with a local Aboriginal elder, Jimmy, on his search for the missing Asian tourist, who leads him to Furnace Creek. Jay sneaks past the security checkpoint and observes several young Asian women leaving a plane and climbing into a van. The women are being forced into prostitution to pay off their individual, unspecified debts. As he returns to his car, he is arrested by Furnace Creek security and detained for the night, where Johnny attempts to intimidate him.  Upon release, Jay goes to Josh's house, where he is chastised. Jay receives an anonymous phone call offering information on his case. Johnny and Maureen attend a press conference where they announce the expansion, but Jimmy leaves, denying them his signature of approval. Jay receives one of the girls' passports from the caller, then notices Josh's car. He follows Josh to the local creek, where Jimmy's body is hanging from a tree. Jay suspects foul play, but Josh states that Tommy witnessed it.  Josh goes to the local bar/brothel, where the Asian girls are being kept. He befriends a prostitute called Mei and tells her to contact him if she needs help. Jay visits Tommy, who confesses and tells him that Jimmy's death was not a suicide and he was killed by the gang of bikers who work as hitmen for Furnace Creek. Jay consults the man who found the passport and explores the area where it was found. There he finds the skeleton who he assumes was the girl he was assigned to find.  May sees the bikers arrive at the brothel and sends Josh a message. He rushes to the brothel where the girls have disappeared. After interrogating the bartender, Josh is told they are in a trailer in the desert. Josh first visits Maureen who is anxiously shredding paperwork and demands she shuts down the operations. Josh arrives at the trailer to find it empty. The bikers arrive and ambush Josh, forcing him to dig his own grave. Jay, who has followed Josh, incapacitates the bikers with a rifle. Jay then enlists Josh in rescuing the girls.  Jay and Josh drive to the Furnace Creek offices and, after an intense shootout with the bikers, discover the girls' whereabouts. Jay sees Johnny's plane fleeing the mines and chases it while Josh finds and rescues the girls. Jay arrives at the airfield but is intercepted by an armed guard who causes Jay to crash while Johnny escapes. Jay and the guard stand off but decide to spare one another.   Jay and Josh contact state authorities, who retrieve the girls and begin an investigation into the corruption. At Josh's house, he tells Jay that Maureen has skipped town. Jay says goodbye to Josh and drives away from Goldstone into the desert.

The Great Wall (film)
   In an epic search for the secret of [[gunpowder]], a group of European mercenaries travel to China during the reign of the [[Renzong Emperor]]. A few miles north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], [[Khitan people|Khitan]] bandits attack them. Upon escaping, the survivors seek refuge in a cave but are attacked by a monster, leaving only William Garin and Pero Tovar alive. They cut off the monster's arm and bring it with them. The next day, they stumble upon the Wall and are taken prisoner by soldiers of the Nameless Order, led by General Shao and Strategist Wang.  The Nameless Order is a Chinese [[military order (monastic society)|military order]] commissioned by the [[Emperor of China|Imperial Court]] of the [[Song Dynasty]] to repel a horde of alien monsters called [[Taotie|Tao Tieh]]. The monsters, one of which William had slain, attack once every sixty years. The Order's commanders are stunned by the monster's severed hand, believing the invasion was still a week away. Suddenly, a large wave of monsters assault the Great Wall, and the Order is mobilized.  Both sides sustain heavy losses before the monsters' queen aborts the attack. During the battle, William and Tovar are freed by Ballard, a European who, like them, had ventured east twenty-five years ago in search of black powder, been detained, and now serves as an English and Latin teacher. William saves Peng Yong, a warrior, from the attacking monsters. William and Tovar's battle skills earn the Nameless Order's respect. William and Tovar meet with Ballard, plan to steal black powder, and flee while the Order is occupied in battle by the Tao Tieh.  During the night, two Tao Tieh reach the top of the Wall and kill several guards. Shao and Lin lead soldiers against them but are ambushed. The Tao Tieh are slain but Shao is killed, putting Lin in command of the Nameless Order. Around this time, an envoy from the capital [[Bianliang]] arrives with an ancient scroll which suggests that the monsters are pacified by magnets. Wang believes the stone William carries enabled him to slay the Tao Tieh he fought before entering the Wall. To test the hypothesis, William suggests they capture a Tao Tieh alive and agrees to help. This delays his escape plans, angering Tovar, who nevertheless postpones their plans to assist William over Ballard's protests.  During the next attack, the Tao Tieh are numerous enough to cause Lin to resort to using arrows equipped with black powder, whose capabilities had been kept secret from the Westerners until now. They capture a living Tao Tieh and prove the theory. The monster, however, is claimed and taken to the capital, [[Kaifeng|Bianliang]], by the Imperial envoy before it can be further studied. A short while later, a tunnel is discovered at the base of the Wall; the previous attacks had been a distraction, while the Tao Tieh dug a passage through the wall. While Lin investigates, Tovar and Ballard steal a supply of black powder and escape, knocking William unconscious after he tries to stop them.  William is arrested by the Chinese, and, though Peng Yong speaks up for him, is locked up in the Wall. Some distance away, Ballard betrays and abandons Tovar, but is captured by the Khitans, who accidentally kill themselves and Ballard after igniting the powder; the Chinese soldiers recapture Tovar. At the capital, the envoy presents the captive Tao Tieh to the Emperor, but it awakens and signals the Tao Tieh attack.  Rushing to protect the capital, Lin orders the use of hot-air balloons. Before setting out, Lin sets William free. Wang tells him to warn the outside world, but William boards the last balloon with Peng and Wang. They arrive just in time to save Lin from being devoured. They land in the Emperor's palace, where Wang proposes killing the queen by tying explosives to the captured Tao Tieh and giving it meat to be delivered. While transporting, a horde of Tao Tieh breach the sewers. Peng Yong sacrifices himself to save the others.  After releasing the Tao Tieh, Lin and William climb a tower for William to detonate the explosives via an arrow. Wang sacrifices himself to buy time for Lin and William to move to the upper floors. Two of William's arrows are deflected by the Tao Tieh queen's bodyguards, but William throws the magnet into the horde, creating a gap in the shields and allowing Lin's spear to get through. The queen is destroyed, and the rest of the horde is frozen solid. With the threat eliminated, William is allowed to return home and elects to take Tovar with him instead of the powder, much to Tovar's annoyance.

Green White Green
 Three teenagers seem to be on an interminably long wait for university. In the hiatus, they carry on with various shenanigans. Uzzie tries his hand on becoming an artist, his friend Segun keeps a bag packed for an always impending trip to New York and the other one tries to make his father believe in and respect him.  Their 'lounging and chilling' sessions help the audience understand what drives the average young Nigerian; the audience sees the American and hip hop influence, the Boko Haram issue, the hankering after 'going abroad' and the lack of direction that sometimes leads young people down the wrong path.  A group of Ajegunle boys are described as 'Future Thugs' and one of them actually looks in the camera and says – 'Make you look me o, I no well o' which sort of sums up the mental state of many young Nigerians driven half-mad by disillusion and the mess their parents have made of the country.  Green White Green is produced and directed by Abba Makama. It stars Ifeanyi Dike, Samuel Robinson and Jammal Ibrahim.<ref></ref>  
Graduation (2016 film)
 Romeo is a middle-aged doctor employed at a local hospital in a small Romanian town. He lives with his wife, Magda, and their 18-year-old daughter, Eliza, who has just won a scholarship to Cambridge University. She is preparing to write her final exams and needs to maintain a grade of at least 90%. Romeo is a doting father and drives Eliza to school regularly.   Romeo's girlfriend, Sandra, is a teacher at Eliza's school. One day while visiting Sandra he receives a message: Eliza has been assaulted near her school. She has a sprained wrist and is emotionally shaken up but is not seriously injured. She reveals that the assailant tried to rape her but did not succeed.   The next day Eliza must sit for her first examination. The headmaster tries to exclude her because she is wearing a cast on her wrist - notes can be hidden in a cast. Sandra intervenes and the headmaster backs down. The cast slows her writing and time runs out before she is finished - she will need nearly perfect results on the remaining exams to claim her scholarship.   At the police station the chief inspector suggests to Romeo that Eliza's exam results can be fixed in exchange for expediting a liver transplant for a corrupt official, a Mr. Bulai.   That evening Romeo discusses the plan with Magda and she immediately rejects it - she fears the ubiqitous corruption in Romania will infect Eliza's fresh start at Cambridge. Romeo argues that the exams are a mere formality, otherwise meaningless. She is unmoved. Romeo presents the plan to Eliza and implores her to accept a little help now to ensure a brighter future. She listens equivocally.    The next day Romeo waits at the school for Eliza to complete her second exam. He encounters her boyfriend, Marius and they chat amicably. Eliza and Marius go off together on his motorbike.  Eliza discovers Romeo's affair with Sandra. She threatens to skip her exams if he doesn't tell Magda about it immediately. She wonders aloud whether her other grades were also "fixed". She says she wants to remain in Romania with Marius in any case. At home that evening Magda asks Romeo to move out.  The next day Romeo arrives for work at the hospital and is confronted by a pair of prosecutors. They want to interview Romeo's patient, Mr. Bulai, about corruption allegations against him. Romeo resists because Bulai is waiting for the promised liver transplant and is also quite ill. The prosecutors caution Romeo they are aware of the quid-pro-quo for his daughter's exams - both he and Eliza could be facing charges themselves.    Romeo visits the police station again. The chief inspector assures him that his daughter's assailant will soon be identified in a police line-up.

The Greasy Strangler
 Big Ronnie runs a [[disco]]-themed walking location tour in his town, alongside his son Big Brayden. Ronnie allows Brayden to live with him on the condition that Brayden prepares excessively greasy food for him. Ronnie is a [[Pathological lying|pathological liar]] who fabricates stories about disco groups like [[Bee Gees|the Bee Gees]], as well as his supposed friendship with [[Michael Jackson]]. Brayden aspires to be a [[Science fantasy|space fantasy]] author. Ronnie asserts that Brayden drove his mother away, though Brayden says that she left Ronnie for a man named Ricky Prickles. Ronnie and Brayden frequently call each other "bullshit artists".  At night, Ronnie completely covers himself in grease and strangles residents of the town (becoming known as "The Greasy Strangler"), starting with three people he kicked out of his tour group, for heckling him on free refreshments. After his killings, he cleans himself of the grease by standing in a car wash run by a blind man named Big Paul. During one of the disco walking tours, Brayden meets a woman named Janet, and the two begin a romantic relationship. One night, Ronnie buys a hot dog from a vendor and forcibly covers it in grease, against the vendor's pleas. Later, as the vendor is defecating in his trailer, Ronnie strangles him through a window, causing his eyes to pop out of his head, which Ronnie cooks and eats.  Brayden and Janet have sex, and the next morning, Ronnie attempts to seduce Janet by eating a grease-covered grapefruit. Ronnie takes Janet out to a [[Nightclub|discotheque]], threatening to evict Brayden if he does not allow them to. Ronnie attempts to kiss Janet, but she resists, saying that she may be in love with Brayden. Ronnie kills Oinker, one of Brayden's friends, and goes to the discotheque with Paul. Against Brayden's wishes, Ronnie has sex with Janet, and he and Brayden have a heated argument the next day. Ronnie and Janet have sex again, and when Brayden confronts them, they mock him, prompting him to run from the house in despair.  One night, Brayden confronts Janet in the kitchen and admits that he is in love with her. Ronnie overhears this, covers himself in grease, and pretends to stand in the car wash, allowing himself to sneak up on Paul and strangle him. He decapitates Paul with a nearby saw and dances with Paul's head. The next morning, Brayden calls a detective named Jody and reports that Ronnie may be the Greasy Strangler. Jody comes to the house the next day, and Brayden and Janet show him a spot of oil left behind on the carpet as evidence that Ronnie is the Greasy Strangler. Downstairs, Jody concludes that the oil is meaningless [[circumstantial evidence]], and demands that they end all inquiries about Ronnie having committed the murders. Jody removes his glasses in a mirror, showing that he is Ronnie in disguise.  That night, Janet declares her mutual love for Brayden, and they decide to get married. Ronnie, hiding under the bed, reveals himself, claiming Janet as his lover and evicting Brayden. Janet replies that Brayden can stay at her residence, and Ronnie leaves. He re-enters, covered in grease, slaps Brayden, and grabs Janet by the arm, leaving with her. Brayden covers himself in grease as well, and follows Ronnie and Janet to a movie theatre, where Ronnie is strangling her. Brayden strangles Janet instead, causing her eyes to pop out of her head, which both he and Ronnie consume.   The next day, on a beach, Ronnie reveals that he cares for Brayden, despite his annoyance with him, and says that he would rather be with him than co-owning a discotheque with [[John Travolta]] in [[New Orleans]]. They bond over, in hindsight, their disgust with Janet. They cover themselves in grease and head to a forest where they murder Ricky Prickles, and then witness themselves be [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]], watching as liquid and confetti explode from their heads. They venture deeper into the forest, still covered in grease, and primally shake wooden spears at the camera.

After completing an interrogation, Sebastian comes into information regarding [[philanthropist]] Rhonda George, who is hosting a benefit called WorldCure and is a potential target for assassination, and is assigned to go. Nobby's pub friends also find out that his brother will be at WorldCure and convince Nobby to go and reconnect with him. Sebastian goes to the event and sees a hitman, later known as Pavel Lukashenko, who plans to assassinate Rhonda with a gun disguised as a video camera. As Sebastian prepares to shoot the camera, Nobby sees him and gives him a hug, accidentally causing him to shoot a Jewish-Palestinian boy with [[AIDS]] named Schlomo. The spray of blood lands in [[Daniel Radcliffe]]'s mouth, infecting him.  The brothers go on the run from the authorities and other assassins, with Sebastian breaking his ankle in the process. Despite Sebastian's protests, Nobby convinces him it would be best to hide at his home in Grimsby. Meanwhile, MI6 believes that Sebastian has gone rogue. The MI6 send orders to an assassin named Chilcott to track Sebastian down. However, Sebastian calls his handler Jodie and proclaims his innocence.  Chilcott and his men find the two brothers at a pub. Sebastian and Nobby spot them and run away with help from the pub clientele, but Sebastian is hit with two ''[[Lonomia]]'' poison darts in the process. Nobby is forced to first suck the poison out of his brother's shoulder and then his testicle to save his life.  The brothers travel to [[South Africa]], after Jodie informs Sebastian that Lukashenko was doing a deal with Joris Smit in Tshukaru Bush Lodge. Sebastian accidentally injects himself with [[heroin]], mistaking it for the bone strengthening treatment for his broken ankle. Nobby must assume his identity and go undercover.  Nobby tries to seduce Joris's wife Lina, but first seduces the wrong woman named Banu the Cleaner and is then interrupted by Joris and his two men. Sebastian arrives and saves Nobby. Lina tells them that Lukashenko bought some sort of virus, but she is fatally shot by Chilcott and his men from a distance before she gives any further information. To outrun Chilcott's men, the brothers hide inside an elephant's vagina, but in the process they become trapped inside after multiple male elephants begin having sexual intercourse with it in quick succession. As they wash off afterwards, Sebastian asks why Nobby abandoned him as a child. Nobby explains that Sebastian's adoptive parents only wanted to adopt one of the brothers but were unable to decide, and he ran away so Sebastian could have a better life.  The two brothers travel to [[Santiago, Chile]], the venue of football game final between [[England]] and [[Germany]]. They realise that the syndicate plans to unleash their weapon upon a football match in the area, but the syndicate captures Sebastian. Rhonda visits the captured Sebastian and tells him her plans to launch the virus—called WorldCure—into the arena via fireworks. Nobby finally finds Sebastian, but he is intercepted by Lukashenko. Lukashenko overpowers Nobby, but he obtains Lukashenko's gun and shoots him in the head. He easily kills the other henchmen before rescuing Sebastian.  The brothers go back to the arena and spot Rhonda. While Nobby tries to intercept Rhonda, Chilcott attempts to kill Sebastian, but Nobby's kids throw Schlomo's wheelchair at him, knocking him over and impaling him on a helmet. Nobby obtains a gun and spots Rhonda running through the arena. He goes after her. In the meantime, [[Raheem Sterling]], in the final match between England and Germany, attempts a shot from distance, however, the shot is going wide. Nobby shoots the ball and it conveniently deflects into the goal. Nobby also shoots the referee who was going to disallow the goal, resulting in England winning the match. Nobby then tries to shoot Rhonda but his gun jams and he realises he must stop the fireworks himself. He sits on one of the fireworks containing the virus; Sebastian sits on the other at the last minute, reaffirming his brotherhood with Nobby. The fireworks go off with the two atop them and the brothers are knocked unconscious upon landing. Nobby's gun goes off and hits Daniel Radcliffe, whose infectious blood spills into [[Donald Trump]]'s mouth.  It is reported that Rhonda has been arrested, the Grimsby brothers have "died" after saving the world, and Trump has AIDS. Schlomo is in custody after "killing" Chilcott. The brothers are actually recovering in the hospital. Jodie visits and gives them new identities, informing them that the virus did not affect them because its antidote is elephant semen. Nobby's family visits them.  In the final scene, eight weeks later, Nobby and Sebastian are on a mission in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. On a boat, Nobby is approached by a team of gunmen, whom he quickly kills. He reaches Sebastian, who asks him if he has met the team; Nobby realises too late that the gunmen were his team.

Growing Up Coy
  The film follows Jeremy and Kathryn Mathis and their five children over several years in Colorado. One child, 6-year-old Coy Mathis, identifies as [[transgender|female]] and after transitioning publicly from male to female in kindergarten, she was able to use the girls bathroom freely until the first grade when the principal informed the parents that moving forward, Coy would only be able to use the boys bathroom or the nurse's bathroom. Rather than comply, Jeremy and Kathryn pulled their kids from school and worked with the [[Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund]] to file a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division.  While awaiting a decision, the Mathises went public with their case and became a magnet for the issue in an international media firestorm, including a notable appearance on [[Katie (talk show)]] and a spread in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. The film goes on to show how the media pressure put strain on Jeremy and Kathryn's marriage, eventually leading to their separation. In the end, a ruling came down in their favor, enabling transgender people across the state to use facilities that match their gender identity.  The ruling was the first of its kind in the United States, and had ripple effects across the country. Shortly after the ruling, California enacted its own [[School Success and Opportunity Act|law]] allowing transgender students to pick bathrooms and sports teams they identify with. The [[Obama Administration]] also issued guidelines that protect transgender students using [[Gender identity under Title IX|Title IX]] as the basis for nondiscrimination. Many states resisted the guidelines and proposed so-called [[bathroom bill]]s, most of which would force transgender students to use that bathroom that matches their birth certificates. So far, one bathroom bill was made into law, [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act|HB2]] in North Carolina.

Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for [[Conscientious objection in the United States#Conscientious objectors with Medals of Honor|psychiatric reasons]] but are overruled, as Doss' religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers and continues training.  Doss' unit completes basic training and is released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination.

At his trial Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an [[Act of Congress]]. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.  Doss' unit is assigned to the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] and deployed to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theater]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th Infantry Division]], which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment ("Hacksaw Ridge"). Both sides suffer heavy losses during the initial fight. Doss saves his squadmate Smitty, earning his respect. As the Americans camp for the night, Doss reveals to Smitty that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage, and the two reconcile.  The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, while Howell and several of Doss' squad mates are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying the wounded to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded once presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell and the two escape Hacksaw under enemy fire.  Captain Glover tells Doss that the men have been inspired by his selflessness, and that they will not launch the next attack without him. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. After an ambush set by Japanese soldiers [[perfidy|feigning surrender]], Doss manages to save Glover and others by deflecting enemy grenades. Doss is eventually wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss descends the cliff, clutching the Bible Dorothy gave him.

A talented artist, the teenager earns a living by rearing and selling the ornamental fish – [[Guppy]]. He takes great care of his disabled Mother. He wants nothing but the best for her, be it the happiness in her life or the fully automatic wheelchair that he aspires to gift her someday. Her son fills her only prayers to the Almighty, that he may be guarded in all his ways. The little mischiefs that his gang gets into and the occasional glimpses from the teenage beauty, Amina, make his day. Their small fishing village, lately, is under a lot of excitement. Their dream project just got sanctioned – a railway overbridge, to bypass the railway gate en route. With great zeal, the people await the engineers from Road and Bridges Development Corporation.  Meanwhile, somewhere in the Himalayas, a rider starts his journey leaving his dear ones and 'Malu', heading for the village. He arrives at the small roadside stall where the boy works, stopping for a tea. Like the others present, Guppy, gets prejudiced with the unconcerned lifestyle of a rider, for people here strive hard to subsist. Gaps in communication and probably his biased views, offend the individual with the tea hence given. The experience ends on a bad note for the two, with both their egos getting hurt. Little did Guppy know the rider was here to stay, for he is '''Er. Thejus Varkey''' in charge of building the bridge. A near miss accident the next day give Guppy his upper hand and the teen gang loot the engineer for damages, when there actually is none.  Days pass by and the rest of the team arrive. Works start with initial planning and sketching. The engineer befriends the local village officer and convince him to slash the price per pair, the office pays to the boy. Being forced an apology, Guppy’s self-esteem urge him otherwise. The engineer find the boy near the office jeep, with flat tires, waiting for him. Instincts send the boy running, while the engineer chases after him and slap him, driving the rest of the gang to attack in defence. With a stone, Guppy smash that hand of the engineer that slapped him. Later, the team find their tent vandalized, burnt to ashes, leading Thejus to send back his team till he finish the unresolved task.  Thejus takes his time off, studying the canals and former civil undertakings. The secretive plan takes shape. The illegal pisciculture of the boy in the blocked drainage, causing floods during rain, along with the roadside stall where he works, are to be destroyed by the police, as part of the expansion of roads for the bridge. Giving no time to shift, the tank is mercilessly wrecked sending the fish down the drain, all the way. The engineer’s revenge is complete and the harm is done. From his meager savings, Guppy hire an outlaw to hurt the man in return. Something then happens, the boy didn’t expect. The engineer is stabbed, from the front, horrifying the kid.  Guppy now know, things spiraled out of hand. The engineer’s silence to the police frightens him even more, for the revenge will be something worse. Left all alone, helplessly watching his dreams slipping away and awaiting his assured fate, his pride and courage all drain out. His fear does not go unnoticed by his mother, to whom he reveal nothing. Thejus on the other hand, lonely on the hospital bed, is in pain, but not physically. He too awaits to regain strength, to meet the boy.  Amina, the girl fancied by the gang, lives with her grandparents as her parents are both dead. The grandfather (whom she calls '''Uppooppa''') works as the temporary gate operator at the railway gate, hoping to make her an engineer one day. Once the overbridge is commissioned, he will lose his job and at his age, is unable to find another. His mannerisms always irritated the team and he couldn’t make friends with any. The solution to the poor man’s problems, thought out by his slender perspective, was to drive the team away. He was the one who punctured the tires of the office jeep and destroyed their tent. When nothing seemed to work, at the end of his pitiful rope, face covered, he stabbed the engineer. But now the thoughts scare him. He is admitted in the hospital with chest pain and regrets his actions.  Thejus came to build the bridge and leave, intending no one no harm. Coming to know of the surrounding political scams, village officer’s illicit relationship, the peon’s corruption or even the guest house caretaker’s laziness; nothing bothered him. But, the wounded ego set him on a path chasing after a small child, probably not much older than his own, spending all his energy to drench the kid in pain. He realize that his very presence chocked the lives of two innocent souls and their dependents. The bridge, on the other hand, is just a political stunt targeting the vote bank; with nothing fruitful coming out of it for the society. Stating ‘technically unfeasible’, he stops the million-rupee project; delaying the construction for at least another ten years. He meets Uppooppa to say that he understands and he will help with Amina’s dreams; forgiving him for his insanity. Revealing the courage to correct his deeds, he rebuilds Guppy’s tank and gift it in grandiose; before leaving the place empty-handed. Guppy, relieved from his worries, run home to his mother with the happy news. Leaving him all alone, he finds her having breathed her last; another gift, the long-awaited wheelchair, still on its way.  It has now been days since the boy left. The old man, Tinku as he is fondly called, come back after weeks of caring for an old lady, who might have been his long-lost mother. He happened to have read about Thejus Varkey, who filled the news some years back. He was the engineer who constructed the much anticipated Omallur Bridge. On the day of the inauguration, his family met with an accident – killing his parents, wife and his 7-year-old daughter. Riding was his way out of his grief. To him, every child that he met was his daughter '''Malu'''; refusing to leave her with the dead. This railway bridge was likely the only work he undertook since.  Thejus is shown once again riding through the Himalayas with his dear 'Malu', never having been so relieved and content, with the happy child Michael in his care. Like an answer to the prayers of his mother, Michael will never be left alone and so will be Thejus.

Hands of Stone
 The film follows the life of Panamanian boxing legend [[Roberto Durán]], who made his professional boxing debut in 1968 as a 16-year-old and retired in 2001 at age 50.  Growing up in [[Panama]], Durán is [[homeschooled]] by Chaflan, who teaches young Roberto some vital life lessons. Later, Duran joins a boxing club with Nestor "Plomo" Quiñones as his coach.  As he reaches 20, an American legendary boxing trainer [[Ray Arcel]], who nearly lost his life after being attacked by an unknown assailant in 1953 in [[New York City]] and is now living with his wife Stephanie, notices Roberto's raw talent and punching power and takes the young fighter under his wing, becoming his coach. Not long after, Durán then meets a student, Felicidad, with whom he later has five children.  After his fights through the 70s and 80s, rising through the divisions with phenomenal success (just one loss) he challenges [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], dubbed as the "Fighter of the Year." However, Durán is disrespectful of Leonard, describing him as a "clown" and confidently predicts a knock out win for himself.  One night, Durán confronts Leonard in front of his wife and insults him by calling him a "homosexual." The incident frustrates Ray. Durán's hard feelings for Ray, on the other hand seem to stem from his resentment of Americans in general, because he recalls the ill-treatment meted out by the Americans to the nation of Panama, remembering how American troops took over the country by owning the [[Panama Canal]] — leading to conflict between the sides in 1964.  In June 1980, the day of fight between Durán and Leonard in which the venue is in [[Montreal]], Durán wins via Unanimous decision as a Welterweight Champion (148-147, 145-144, ). After the fight, Leonard states that being insulted is a strategy and calls for a rematch with an $8 million purse. At the house party, informed by his manager Carlos Eleta, Durán reluctantly agrees to the rematch. Chaflan is killed after being run over by a truck.  In November 1980, Durán and Leonard face at the ring for the [[Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán II|second time]], this time the venue is in [[New Orleans]]. But in the eighth round, the people of Panama are shocked when Durán gives up by saying "''No más''" (English: "No more") to the referee, thus Leonard wins via technical knockout (68–66, 68–66, and ).  Upon returning home in Panama, he faces angry protests. Durán tells his wife that he regrets letting them down and needs to go back in the ring in order to regain his popularity and the forgiveness of his fans. Due to this incident, Arcel is retired from his training and tells Durán that Plomo will be his coach. In June 1983, New York City, the day of his fight against [[Davey Moore (boxer, born 1959)|Davey Moore]], Leonard gratefully meets Durán for the first time since the rematch, saying that he forgives Durán. He tells Leonard that he gives his apology to his wife. As the fight with Moore goes up to the eighth round, Leonard is now a commentator, Durán wins the fight via technical knockout and eventually restores his popularity and pride with the people of Panama.  In the film's [[epilogue]], it states that Plomo was in Durán's side for each fight until his death in 2012; Leonard and Durán remain friends until now; Ray Arcel was the first boxing trainer to be inducted into both the World Boxing Hall of Fame (WBHF)as the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHF). He died on March 7, 1994, at the age of 94 after a 6 year battle with [[leukemia]].  
Hail, Caesar!
 In 1951, [[Eddie Mannix]] ([[Josh Brolin]]) is the head of physical production at Capitol Pictures and also works as a "fixer" to keep the scandalous behavior of its stars out of the press. He often has to fend off inquiries from Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both played by [[Tilda Swinton]]), twin sisters and rival gossip columnists. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] has been courting him with an offer of a high-level executive position, but he is unsure about taking it. When unmarried [[synchronised swimming]] actress DeeAnna Moran ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) becomes pregnant, Mannix arranges for her to put the baby in [[foster care]], and then adopt it without revealing herself as the mother.    The studio's major production is ''Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ'', an epic set in ancient Roman times and starring Baird Whitlock ([[George Clooney]]). During a shot, Whitlock drinks from a goblet of wine that was drugged by an extra ([[Wayne Knight]]); he passes out while rehearsing lines by himself behind the soundstage and is abducted. A ransom note soon arrives, written by a group calling itself "The Future," demanding $100,000. Mannix arranges to get the money from the studio's Accounting Department, as "petty cash."  Whitlock awakens in a beach house and finds his way into a meeting of The Future, a [[Communism|Communist]] cell. The members, who introduce themselves as mostly writers in the motion picture industry, explain their doctrine to him and begin to win him over to their cause. At the same time, Thora threatens Mannix by stating she will release an article about a scandal involving the earlier film ''On Wings As Eagles'', which gave Whitlock his break-out role. Mannix successfully negotiates for her to postpone the story by a day in exchange for information about the romantic life of singing Western film star Hobie Doyle ([[Alden Ehrenreich]]).  Doyle is cast in a [[comedy of manners]] helmed by posh director Laurence Laurentz ([[Ralph Fiennes]]) in an attempt by the studio to broaden his appeal. After Doyle's initial performance is hopelessly incompetent, Laurentz visits Mannix and asks him to remove Doyle from the project so that Laurentz can preserve his artistic vision for the film. Mannix informs Laurentz that Doyle's role is non-negotiable and convinces him to coach the young actor to give a better performance. Doyle comes to Mannix's office and admits that he feels the part is too far outside his comfort zone. Mannix reassures him that he has the needed acting abilities and tells him about Whitlock's kidnapping.  That evening, Doyle attends the premiere of one of his own Westerns with starlet Carlotta Valdez ([[Veronica Osorio]]), per instructions from Mannix. Doyle is initially disappointed that his lone singing scene is depicted in a comedic manner, rather than as heartfelt as he intended. However, after seeing the audience react positively to the scene, Doyle warms to it himself. Doyle and Valdez visit a nightclub, where the pair are genuinely developing chemistry until they are interrupted by both Thacker sisters, each looking to get a scoop on their relationship. Doyle suddenly spots the briefcase containing the ransom money, recognizing it because he had lent Mannix his belt to keep it closed. It is being carried by Burt Gurney ([[Channing Tatum]]), the star of a sailor [[Musical comedy film|musical comedy]] depicted earlier in an elaborate dancing scene.  Mannix and Moran meet with a surety agent, Joseph Silverman ([[Jonah Hill]]), an average man whom the studio has used to solve public problems; he has a solid reputation as completely dependable, reliable, and discreet. He will agree to provide foster care for Moran's child, preserving her image. Moran, who expressed frustration with her previous two marriages with a mobster and a Hollywood type, finds herself strongly attracted to Silverman.  Doyle follows Gurney to the beach house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] but, after walking in the front door, finds only Whitlock inside. The rest of The Future's members have rowed a boat containing Gurney offshore so that he can rendezvous with a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarine and defect to [[Russia]]. The members of The Future give him the money for the Communist cause. As Gurney boards the submarine, his dog jumps into his arms, causing him to drop the briefcase, which sinks into the ocean. Doyle takes Whitlock back to the studio just before the police arrive at the beach house to arrest the group, after Mannix's investigation led him to the house.  Whitlock tries to explain his new-found Communist leanings to Mannix, who cuts him off sharply, slapping his face numerous times, and orders him to finish his role in ''Hail, Caesar!''; the actor is chastened, but encouraged by a final directive from Mannix to be a movie star.  Mannix is notified the next morning that Moran married Silverman who will adopt the child with her. Mannix announces he has decided to reject the Lockheed offer and continue working at Capitol. Thora then meets with Mannix and informs him that the column she plans to publish about ''On Wings As Eagles'' will reveal that Whitlock got his major role in the film by having sex with Laurentz. However, Mannix has deduced that Gurney is her source for the piece and persuades her to not run the story since Gurney is a Communist who has defected—which would cause her own reputation to suffer by association. Mannix leaves the worried-looking Thora, secure in his station in life.  
The Handmaiden
  ===Part 1=== In [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]], a conman operating under the sobriquet of "Count Fujiwara" plans to seduce a Japanese heiress named Lady Hideko, then marry her and commit her to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. He hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee from a family of con artists to become Hideko's maid and encourage Hideko to marry him.  Hideko lives with her authoritarian Uncle Kouzuki. Kouzuki makes money by selling rare books, and he has Hideko give readings of the books for potential buyers. Sook-hee and Hideko grow closer, and Hideko allows Sook-hee to wear her dresses and jewelry. When Hideko asks Sook-hee what married life will be like, Sook-hee makes passionate love to her, promising her the same pleasures with her new husband. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about the plan, but when Hideko herself feels that she cannot go through with the marriage, Sook-hee insists she do so, causing Hideko to slap her and run away in frustration.  When Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, Hideko and Fujiwara elope. After cashing out Hideko's inheritance, it is then revealed that Hideko and Fujiwara double crossed Sook-hee and has convinced the asylum that she is the "Countess," and have her committed in Hideko's stead.  ===Part 2=== A series of flashbacks show that Kouzuki was abusive to both Hideko and her aunt. The books he sells are sadistic pornography, which he trains and forces his wife to read at private auctions for the books, a practice that he also teaches Hideko during childhood. Hideko's aunt is eventually found hanged from a tree in the yard. When Hideko suspects the death was not suicide, Kouzuki takes Hideko into his basement, where he tells her that he murdered her aunt after she had attempted to run away.  In the more recent past, Hideko has grown up, and Fujiwara plans to seduce her to steal her inheritance. He finds this impossible due to Hideko being desensitized to sex acts and can not be seduced, and he instead makes a deal with her: if they get married, he'll save her from her uncle in exchange for half her inheritance. Hideko agrees under the condition that when they marry, he gives her a vial of poison guaranteed to kill her quickly in the event she is caught by her uncle and taken back to the basement. Hideko further proposes to hire a maid and commit the maid to an asylum in her place.  All the while being instructed by Fujiwara, who takes advantage of Sook-hee's illiteracy, Hideko unexpectedly falls in love with her. Knowing that the woman she loved was planning on betraying her, even with her feelings and their love making, Hideko tries to hang herself. Sook-hee saves her, and confesses her culpability in trying to commit Hideko and steal her inheritance. Hideko admits her plan to commit Sook-hee in her place, and the two vow to get revenge on both Kouzuki and Fujiwara. Hideko shows Sook-hee her uncle's collection of pornography, and Sook-hee destroys the collection in anger. Hideko eventually joins her, calling Sook-hee "her savior" from her uncle's abuse.  ===Part 3=== Sook-hee's friend Bok-soon sets a fire at the asylum and poses as a firefighter to help rescue Sook-hee. Meanwhile, Hideko poisons Fujiwara's wine, causing him to pass out while she takes the money and leaves. Sook-hee and Hideko reunite and flee together, disguising Hideko as a man to avoid detection.  Kouzuki captures Fujiwara upon receiving a letter from Hideko detailing Fujiwara's deception. He tortures Fujiwara in his cellar with his collection of antique bookmaking tools and presses him for sexual details about his niece. Fujiwara makes up a story about their wedding night, but a flashback shows that Hideko had cut her hand on a knife to stain her sheets, refusing to consummate the marriage. When Kouzuki presses for more details, Fujiwara convinces Kouzuki to give him one of his cigarettes. After smoking for a while, a disgusted Fujiwara refuses to give any further details. Kouzuki notices the cigarettes are producing blue smoke. Fujiwara reveals that his cigarettes had been laced with mercury, and the toxic gas within the smoke kills them both.  On a ferry to Shanghai, China, Sook-hee and Hideko celebrate their newfound freedom by making love once again.

The match would be one of the biggest events in [[Finnish sporting history]], even though most people – including Olli – are skeptical: Moore's record vastly outclasses Olli's.  The preparations don't go without problems: Olli is [[lightweight]] and has to lose weight within the course of two weeks to go down to featherweight, Elis' enthusiasm about the match includes hiring a [[documentary]] film crew who become increasingly disruptive as the preparations go on, and staging various dinner parties with the sponsors of the match which require the uncomfortable Olli to adhere to protocol. The circus around the match disheartens Olli, who falls more and more in love with Raija – Raija, however, feels she's a burden on Olli's preparation, and leaves back to Kokkola.

As the match begins, Olli has a good start in the first round, but gets knocked down several times in the second and the referee calls for a [[technical knockout]].

After running towards the border, Tha and Baylor come across a field full of landmines. Aldrich and the party arrive at the edge of the [[minefield]], having tracked Baylor via the GPS. Tobias, angered by the death of his father, enters the minefield and dies by triggering it. The explosion gives Baylor and Tha enough time to hide in a cave, where Tha finds her missing brother, who is revealed as a previous target of Aldrich's group. He had managed to evade the hunting group's detection and hide.  In the morning, Tha and her brother run away, leaving Baylor behind. Tha and her brother are captured, and Baylor rescues them by capturing Landon. Tha then kills Sofia. Meanwhile, Landon is killed by Aldrich for recording all of the events, which was forbidden.

Hell or High Water (film)
 In [[West Texas]], divorced father Toby Howard ([[Chris Pine]]) and his ex-con brother Tanner ([[Ben Foster]]) carry out early morning robberies of two branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. Though the robberies are well-planned, Tanner's wild nature leads him to take unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby.  Two [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], Marcus Hamilton ([[Jeff Bridges]]) and Alberto Parker ([[Gil Birmingham]]), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. They take the stolen money to an [[Native American gaming|Indian casino]] in [[Oklahoma]] to be [[money laundering|laundered]]. They exchange the stolen bills for chips, some of which Tanner uses to gamble. Toby then has the casino convert them into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank – the same bank they robbed. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.  Back on the ranch they bury the getaway car in a deep pit. The brothers' mother died after a long illness, leaving their ranch in debt due to a [[reverse mortgage]] provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be [[foreclosure|foreclosed]]. Oil has been discovered on their land and Toby is determined to pay off the mortgage to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of [[frontier justice]]. It is revealed that Tanner shot and killed their abusive father, before graduating to armed robbery.  Hamilton stakes out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, but the brothers don't show. Hamilton figures a pattern to the robberies and determines their next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route when the final robbery occurs there. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist even though the bank is full of customers. A shoot-out ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers, and Tanner kills the guard and the civilian. Toby is shot in the abdomen as they are ambushed by a waiting [[Vigilante|posse]] of armed townspeople outside the bank.  The brothers race out of town with a larger posse in pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an [[automatic rifle]] at the posse, forcing them to retreat. The brothers then split, with Toby taking the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots with a sniper rifle, killing Parker. Hamilton uses a local resident's knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner, and kills Tanner with a single head shot using the local's rifle.  During the standoff, Toby (concealing his bleeding, but minor, abdomen bullet wound) passes through a police checkpoint without incident, then successfully launders the stolen cash at the casino, where he sees the news report of his brother's death on TV. He takes the casino's check to the bank just in time to avoid the ranch's foreclosure and deeds the ranch into a [[family trust]].  After retirement, Hamilton visits his former office to learn that the Rangers have cleared Toby as a suspect, as his record is clean and he has no motive to steal since the new oil wells earn more in a month than the total stolen in all of the robberies. The money from the ranch's oil wells is deposited at the Texas Midlands Bank, which refuses to co-operate with the investigation for fear of losing management of the family's trust fund.  Hamilton visits Toby's ranch, and while they stay civil, Hamilton states that he knows Toby masterminded and took part in the robberies, but wishes to know the reason. Toby says he's resolved not to let poverty affect his sons like it affected him and Tanner. Hamilton tells Toby he holds him responsible for the death of his partner, and Toby says he knows Hamilton killed his brother. An armed standoff ensues, but is suddenly interrupted when Toby's ex-wife and sons arrive. The ranch belongs to the trust and thus to them; Toby is only there to visit and fix up the house. As Hamilton departs, Toby suggests they meet again soon to "finish the conversation," to which Hamilton agrees.

Hentai Kamen: Abnormal Crisis
 After surviving his battle against Tamao Ogane, Kyosuke is now in college with Aiko. However, things hasn't been easy. Although he promised Aiko to stop being Hentai Kamen (Pervert Mask), he always used Aiko's panties to help him transform into Hentai Kamen to stop crime. He lost his pizza delivery job after running late to defeat a duo of bank robbers. In a conversation in the campus cafeteria, Aiko told Kyosuke that although she thinks Hentai Kamen's actions are good and she actually likes his heroics, she can't stand his perverseness and she prefers him to be normal. To insure he keeps his promise, she demanded her panties back. Kyosuke reluctantly returned them, but that's when trouble happened.  Just as Kyosuke decided to retire as Hentai Kamen, all the girls in his class had missing panties. Aiko thought Kyosuke did it, but he swears he didn't do it. The new biology teacher, Ayata Sensei, had Kyosuke privately come to her office to speak. Ayata confessed her feelings for him. Shocked at her claim, she told Kyosuke that he's her type and wants to be with him. While Kyosuke was flattered by Ayata's advances, he made it clear he's with Aiko. As he ran off, he heard a scream. When he ran to see what's happening, a classmate's panties seems to be tugged away by wind force. Kyosuke tried to grab the panties back, but Aiko walked into the situation, believing Kyosuke's perverse nature wouldn't allow him to give up panties and ran off disappointed.  While sulking towards home, he found himself bumping into Ayata again and was invited to her place for dinner. While talking, an angry ex-boyfriend of Ayata came to kill them both. Scared for his life, he tried to hide himself in Ayata's room and looked for panties to transform with. However, he remembered Aiko's words and resisted transforming. Kyosuke managed to disarm and punch the boyfriend to scare him off. Grateful for the save, Ayata walked with Kyosuke outside and pecked him on his cheek and found Aiko witnessing the whole thing in her car. Disappointed what she saw, Aiko drove away. At home, Kyosuke noticed there's been a power outage. Kyosuke's mom appeared with candles, ready for wax play on Kyosuke when he realized the outage isn't normal and he headed out to investigate. It was while following the flying panties that he found Mr. Vacuum, an agent of Tamao.   Mr. Vacuum has the ability to selectively suck used panties right off any woman and keep it in his backpack. The villain admitted this is part of the plan to take away all the women's panties so that Kyosuke have no more panties to transform with. However, Kyosuke made it clear that he'll never transform into Hentai Kamen ever again. With that knowledge, Mr. Vacuum had his henchmen beat Kyosuke. In such a desperate situation, Kyosuke needed panties to survive. He realized he has Ayata's panty and decided to use it. Charged with the power of forbidden ecstasy, Hentai Kamen returns and defeats all the henchmen with his martial arts and shocking them with his electrifying groin. Mr. Vacuum attempted to suck the panty right off Kyosuke's face to de-power him, but Kyosuke powered up and fly towards Mr. Vacuum, frog-splashing his groin to Mr. Vacuum and defeating him. It was when Hentai Mask was about to leave when Mr. Vacuum informed Kyosuke that Tamao is still alive. While swinging back home, Kyosuke noticed he feels very weak and drained of power.  The following day, the entire campus is abuzz about Hentai Kamen. Kyosuke looked for Aiko to warn her about Tamao, but she didn't believe him as no one could survive the explosion. She then brought up Kyosuke's love for being Hentai Kamen and him seeing Ayata. Aiko made it clear she'll be taking a break in New York and that Kyosuke should enjoy himself with Ayata. In an abandoned building, it has been revealed Tamao's body has been destroyed, but his head survived. He has been secretly plotting against Kyosuke to prevent Hentai Kamen from ever returning. Using a mind control device, Tamao mind controlled Kyosuke's classmate, Makoto, to come to his lair to offer him power. Makoto likes Aiko and Tamao offered him the power to remove Kyosuke as an obstacle. Eager to have Aiko, Makoto quickly accepted and fused his body between a guitar, king crab, and a Dyson vacuum to become Dynoson, a powerful cybernetic mutant.  Dynoson attacked the school campus and kidnapped Ayata. With Makoto's vacuum powers, he sucked away all the panties and Kyosuke was unable to stop him. However, Ayata had her favorite pair of panties with her and gave it to Kyosuke to transform. Although he managed to transform into Hentai Kamen, Dynoson proved to be too powerful and Kyosuke was defeated. Shortly after his defeat, the panties throughout Japan continues to be sucked away. Kyosuke is too weak and powerless to stop Tamao's evil. Kyosuke believed only the power of his beloved Aiko's panties can help him attain greater perverted powers to take down Dynoson and flew to New York City to find Aiko. Using his enhanced nose, he tracked Aiko's scent to her house. Unfortunately, the place has been wrecked and Kyosuke realized Dynoson beat him to Aiko. Kyosuke found Aiko and Dynoson at Times Square and attempted to stop him. In a spoof battle of Dr. Octopus Vs Spider-Man in Spider Man II, Dynoson and Hentai Kamen battled at the rooftops of New York as Kyosuke swings through the buildings with his bondage rope. Too weak to take down Dynoson, Tamao revealed himself in a message that he'll be holding onto Aiko until Kyosuke comes for her and runs off.   Severely weakened by the battle, Kyosuke realized his body has emaciated. While resting, the dead spirit of Kyosuke's father came to him to reveal why he's so weak. His dad explains him the reason why he has weakened so greatly is Ayata's panty. He explains the power of panties gives Hentai Kamen power, but those panties are cursed and that he shouldn't use them. His father told him that the only way to become stronger is to become even a greater pervert of justice. He advised Kyosuke to head to a secluded area in Japan to find the Great Legendary Pervert to attain greater power. At the top, he encounters the legendary pervert and he agreed to train Kyosuke to become a greater pervert.   After a week of mundane activity, Kyosuke felt it was time to master the new perverted technique to gain greater power. However, the legendary pevert told him he probably already attained it. Usually, Kyosuke can't transform with a fresh pair of panties. However, this time he can. As Hentai Kamen, he was confused what has happened. The legendary pervert revealed his true powers by wearing a bra. In his powered form, the pervert told Kyosuke that he used to be a passive pervert, but after a week without contact with women, he has become a stoic pervert. This means his perverted sensitivity has increased to the point that he can transform even with fresh panties. He told Kyosuke that he can use the power of fresh panties to track Aiko's scent. Ready to face Tamao, the pervert asked Kyosuke to help him pay off his utilities bill while heading back down and it was then Kyosuke realized the pervert is really his grandfather. As a parting gift, Kyosuke's perverted grandfather gave him a long nosed red demon mask as a parting gift.  At Tamao's hidden lair, Aiko is chained and Makoto talks about marrying her. It was when he rolled down the wedding cake that Hentai Kamen came out of the cake. Armed with his long-nosed demon mask, Kyosuke wore to give himself greater power. His groin now looks like a massive masked erection. Tamao's men fired at Kyosuke, but he used his demon mask to bat off any bullets at his direction. Appearing to bat off bullets with his penis, Kyosuke defeated the shooters and faced Dynoson. With Kyosuke's new powers, he was able to defeat Makoto and face Tamao. However, Tamao had Aiko and Ayata as hostages. With Tamao's new android body, Kyosuke was beaten to death. It was then that Ayata revealed that she's an agent of Tamao the entire time. Believing Kyosuke to be dead, Aiko still had faith he's still alive somehow.   Aiko wore a fresh pair of panties to make it hers and then took it off to mask it on Kyosuke. When it didn't work, Aiko thought she'll have to face Tamao alone and was quickly pushed away. It was then everyone realized Kyosuke survived and now powered by Aiko's panties, his power is even greater. Tamao was fed up and transformed himself into a kaiju version of himself to kill Kyosuke. Hentai Kamen rose to the challenge by throwing himself into Tamao's giant robotic mouth, where Kyosuke traveled through Tamao's body and landed on his robotic groin area. Using all his power, Kyosuke defeated Tamao for the second time by blowing the balls off his robot. Tamao's entire body was destroyed and Kyosuke managed to rescue Aiko. Ayata managed to escape the battle by peddling away in a bike.   In the aftermath, Makoto is normal again and friends with Kyosuke and Aiko. It was while some wind blew that a girl's panties was exposed. This time, both Kyosuke and Makoto had a massive erection to lift the table. Disgusted at his reaction, Aiko walked off with Kyosuke chasing her down while still having an erection. Unknown to Kyosuke, a black substance latched onto Kyosuke.

Hidden Figures
 In [[1961 in the United States|1961]], mathematician [[Katherine Johnson|Katherine Goble]] works as a [[human computer]] in the [[sex segregation|gender segregated]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] division [[West Area Computers]] of the [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], alongside her colleagues, aspiring engineer [[Mary Jackson (engineer)|Mary Jackson]] and their unofficial acting-supervisor [[Dorothy Vaughan]].  Following the successful [[Soviet]] launch of [[Yuri Gagarin]], pressure to send American [[astronaut]]s into space increases. Supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's [[Space Task Group]], given her skills in [[analytic geometry]]. She becomes the first black woman on the team.  Katherine's new colleagues are initially dismissive and demeaning, especially head engineer Paul Stafford. Meanwhile, Mitchell informs Dorothy that she will not be promoted, as there are no plans to assign a "permanent supervisor for the colored group". Mary is assigned to the space capsule [[heat shield]] team, and immediately identifies a flaw. With encouragement from the team leader, a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor, she submits an application for an official NASA engineer position and begins to pursue an engineering degree.  Katherine meets [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] Lt. Col. Jim Johnson at a barbecue, but she is disappointed when he voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes, and begins spending time with Katherine and her three daughters.  When Harrison invites his subordinates to solve a complex [[mathematical equation]], Katherine develops the solution, leaving him impressed. The [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts visit Langley and astronaut [[John Glenn]] is cordial to the West Area Computers.  Harrison is enraged when he finds out that Katherine is forced to walk a half-mile (800 meters) to another building to use the colored people's bathroom. Harrison abolishes bathroom segregation, knocking down the "Colored Bathroom" sign. Harrison allows Katherine to be included in their meetings, in which she creates an equation to guide the space capsule during re-entry. Despite this, Katherine is forced to remove her name from the reports, which are credited solely to Stafford. Meanwhile, Mary goes to court and convinces the judge to grant her permission to attend night classes in an all-white school to obtain her engineering degree.  Dorothy learns of the impending installation of an [[IBM 7090]] electronic computer that could replace human computers. She visits the computer room to learn about it, and successfully starts the machine. Later, she visits a public library, where the librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, to borrow a book about [[Fortran]]. After teaching herself programming and training her West Area co-workers, she is officially promoted to supervise the Programming Department, bringing 30 of her co-workers with her. Mitchell eventually addresses Dorothy as "Mrs. Vaughan," indicating her new-found respect.  As the final arrangements for [[Mercury-Atlas 6|John Glenn's launch]] are made, Katherine is reassigned back to West Area Computers. As a wedding and farewell gift from her colleagues (Katherine is now married to Jim Johnson), Katherine is given a pearl necklace, the only jewelry allowed under the dress code.  The day of the launch, discrepancies arise in the IBM 7090 calculations for the capsule's landing coordinates, and Astronaut Glenn requests that Katherine be called in to check them. She quickly does so, only to have the door slammed in her face after delivering the results to the control room. However, Harrison gives her a security pass so they can relay the results to Glenn together.  After a successful launch and orbit, the space capsule has a heat shield problem. Mission control decides to land it after three orbits instead of seven. Katherine suggests that they leave the retro-rocket attached to the heat shield for reentry. The instructions prove correct, and [[Friendship 7]] successfully lands.  Following the mission, the mathematicians are laid off and ultimately replaced by electronic computers. Katherine is reassigned to the Analysis and Computation Division, Dorothy continues to supervise the Programming Department, and Mary obtains her engineering degree and gains employment at NASA as an engineer. At the end of the film, we see Stafford, showing a change of heart, bringing Katherine a cup of coffee.  An [[epilogue]] reveals that Katherine calculated the trajectories for the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Space Shuttle]] missions. In 2015 she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. The following year, NASA dedicated the [[Langley Research Center]]'s Katherine G. Johnson Computational Building in her honor.

House on Willow Street
 Hazel, her boyfriend Ade, Ade's cousin James, and Mark plot to kidnap diamond heiress Katherine within the next six weeks.  The expedited time frame worries Mark, who believes it may cause them to make mistakes.  Hazel and Ade are adamant about the time frame, as Ade will soon go on trial for the accidental death of his brother George.  They stress the importance of both the timing and the need for a flawless execution.  Left with no other option, Mark agrees.  Six weeks later, the four break into Katherine's house, encountering no resistance and finding the alarm already deactivated.  After grabbing Katherine, they return to their headquarters in an abandoned warehouse and chain up Katherine.  They are surprised by her dirty and sickly appearance but continue with their plan regardless.  Katherine warns them to let her go free and initially refuses to play along in making a ransom video.  Hazel convinces her  by promising the ordeal will end faster if she cooperates.  However, the kidnappers can not contact her parents to make their demands.  Hazel sends Ade and James back to Katherine's house to investigate.  Less distracted, they realise the house is full of decaying food and smells horrible.  James finds two dead, mutilated priests in cellar, and Mark realises that Katherine's parents have been gruesomely murdered.  Both are haunted by apparitions from their past.  Worried they will be blamed for the murders, they flee the house after grabbing videotapes from the cellar.  On the way back, Ade swerves to miss an apparition of George, and James is assaulted by his dead mother.  Back at the warehouse, Hazel and Mark are also haunted.  Hazel sees her own dead mother, and Mark sees his dead daughter Sarah.  James' condition steadily deteriorates, and the others leave him in a room to rest while they watch the videotapes.  The first videotape is by Katherine and details the history of her house and its many unexplained deaths, including that of Hazel's mother.  The others are annoyed that Hazel kept this detail quiet, but they continue watching.  On the next videotape, a priest says a demon that feeds on grief is responsible for the deaths and has subsequently possessed Katherine.  The demon has chosen this house because it is the furthest point in the world from a holy relic kept in the Vatican.  Panicked by the demon's growing power, the priests attempt to immolate Katherine, but she kills everyone in the house.  Disturbed by the videotapes, Hazel, Ade, and Mark confront Katherine, who, as the demon, reveals that she only needs to possess two more people to be set free from hell.  James, infected by his mother's apparition, attempts to infect the others.  Katherine appeals to Mark, telling him that if he betrays Hazel and Ade, she will spare his soul and allow him to be with Sarah again.  Mark frees Katherine from her chains and delivers the others to her.  After hearing their anguished cries, he sacrifices himself to give them time to escape and becomes infected.  Haunted by guilt, Ade attempts to reason with George's apparition, to no avail.  He helps Katherine escape the warehouse and, to prevent himself from becoming the final possession the demon needs, Ade kills himself.  The apparition of Hazel's mom helps guide her to freedom.  The possessed Katherine, Mark, and James chase Hazel, who retreats to Ade's crashed van.  There, they nearly infect her, but she fights them off.  Hazel recovers a lighter from the van and traps Katherine in chains they used for the kidnapping.  As Katherine works to free herself, Hazel's mom appears and destroys Mark and James.  Remembering the priests wanted to immolate Katherine to stop the demon, Hazel incapacitates Katherine, douses her in gasoline, and sets the van afire.  Hazel flees the scene as sirens approach.

The Huntsman: Winter's War
 Evil sorceress [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]]'s powers allow her to know that her younger sister [[The Snow Queen|Freya]], whose powers have not emerged, is not only engaged in an illicit affair with nobleman Andrew, but is also pregnant with his child. Sometime after Freya gives birth to a baby girl, Freya discovers that Andrew murdered their child and, in a grief-fueled rage, Freya kills him with her sudden emergence of ice powers.  Freya abandons the kingdom and builds herself a new kingdom. Ruling as the Ice Queen, Freya orders children to be abducted so they can be trained to avoid the pain of love (as she suffered), and to be an army of fearsome huntsmen to conquer for her. Despite the training, two of her best huntsmen, [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric]] and Sara, grow up and fall in love, secretly marry, and plan to escape together. Freya discovers their secret and confronts them, creates a massive ice wall to separate them, then casts Eric out of her kingdom after first forcing him to watch as Sara is killed by their fellow huntsmen.  Seven years later, and after [[Snow White and the Huntsman|Ravenna's death]], Queen [[Snow White]] falls ill after hearing Ravenna's [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] calling her. Because of its dark magic, she ordered it to be taken to Sanctuary, the magical place that sheltered Snow White during the events leading to Ravenna's death, so the mirror's magic could forever be contained. Snow White's husband, William, informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing while en route to the Sanctuary. Eric realizes that he is being watched by Freya through magic. Knowing the magic of the mirror can make Freya even stronger, Eric agrees to investigate, but reluctantly allows Snow White's dwarf ally [[Seven Dwarfs|Nion]] and his half-brother Gryff to come along.  While travelling to the last known location of the soldiers, the trio are attacked by a group of Freya's huntsmen, but are rescued by Sara. Sara reveals that she was imprisoned by Freya the entire time, only to escape recently. While Eric was made to see Sara die she was made to see him running away rather than fighting to help her. Eric convinces her that Freya conjured these visions, and eventually has Sara join with him and the dwarves to thwart Freya. The quartet is ensnared in a trap set by she-dwarves Bromwyn and Doreena. They convince the she-dwarves to help them find the Mirror, and the two lead them to the [[goblin]]s that stole the mirror from Snow White's soldiers. The party fight off the goblins and retrieve the Mirror.  As the group nears the Sanctuary with the Mirror, they are ambushed by Freya and her huntsmen. Freya reveals Sara has been loyal to her all along, and that Sara was using her companions to find the Mirror. In the ensuing chaos, Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues, and Sara shoots an arrow into Eric's chest on Freya's order, killing him. Freya departs with the Magic Mirror, but she is unaware that Sara intentionally missed so that Eric could live. Back in her palace, Freya recites the iconic verse associated with the Mirror, resurrecting Ravenna, who became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her. Boasting a new suite of powers thanks to the Mirror, Ravenna usurps Freya's rule by coordinating Freya's huntsmen and army to reclaim the kingdoms Snow White liberated.  Eric infiltrates the ice palace with help of Gryff and Bromwyn. He attempts to assassinate Freya, but is stopped by Ravenna. When Freya realizes that Sara didn't actually kill Eric, she reluctantly sentences them both to death because of Ravenna's manipulation. However, Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to rebel, claiming the love of brethren. Ravenna begins to kill the huntsmen. Freya, realizing that she regards the huntsmen as her "children", protects them with an ice wall, separating the huntsmen from the sisters. As Eric, Sara and the rebelling huntsmen climb over the wall to fight Ravenna and Freya, the two sisters argue over the icy kingdom. Freya forces Ravenna (who as the mirror spirit must answer her summoner's questions truthfully) to reveal that she ultimately caused the death of Freya's child so she could remain the fairest of them all, so Freya finally turns against her sister. Freya is impaled by Ravenna, but with her remaining strength Freya freezes the Magic Mirror. Eric shatters the Mirror, thus destroying Ravenna. As Freya dies from her wounds, she smiles at the sight of a vision of her old loving self, and gladly witnesses Eric and Sara together.  With Freya's death, those who had been imprisoned by Freya's magic are set free, including Nion and Doreena, while a mysterious golden bird flies overhead. Eric, Sara and the huntsmen look forward to a new future while the dwarves pair off romantically and Eric and Sara share a kiss finally happy to have a life together for the first time in years.  In a [[post-credits scene]], [[Snow White]] with a crown on her head is seen from behind. The aforementioned bird flies and lands on the balcony next to her.

Hec is remote, but Bella quickly manages to break through Ricky's defensive shell by taking him hunting and giving him a dog for his 13th birthday, which he names Tupac after his idol [[Tupac Shakur]].  When Bella suddenly dies and Hec tells Ricky that child services will take him back, Ricky ineptly fakes his [[suicide]] by burning a barn and runs away into the bush with Tupac, where he is completely unable to cope and gets lost.  Hec finds him easily but breaks his ankle in a fall, forcing the two to camp for a period of time.  The authorities meanwhile have found the house empty and the barn burnt down, and come to the conclusion that the bereaved and mentally unstable Hec has abducted Ricky.  The impression is strengthened after an encounter with three foolish hunters who get the idea that Hec is molesting Ricky.  Hec reveals to Ricky that he has served prison time for manslaughter and is illiterate.  Ricky, in turn, says his only friend in foster care has died and that his only options are risking the same fate in the foster system, or serve time in juvenile prison.  The pair agree to disappear into the bush.  A national manhunt ensues, and the two slowly bond while working together to escape arrest. Upon finding another hut, they encounter an unconscious, diabetic ranger. Ricky leaves to find help and runs into a girl his age named Kahu. She takes him back to her house and introduces him to her dad. Ricky stays the night and returns next morning to the hut where Hec was supposed to be. Ricky finds the place to be swarming with police, led by Paula. Ricky runs away. He later encounters Paula and Andy in the bush, separated by a ravine. Paula attempts to bribe Ricky, asking him to say that Hec was a sex offender. In return, she tells him that he won't ever go to juvenile prison. Ricky declines and runs away.

Hunting for Shadows
 Nature and outdoor recreation enthusiasts Keith and Laura are on a week-long camping vacation with their 10-year-old daughter, Ellen. They spend their time sightseeing and touring nature reserves. Keith notices Ellen is bored, preferring to read illustrated books on mythological creatures. The tour guide explains a goanna species and how it can be blamed for damage to property around the campsites, before explaining that the [[Quinkins]], a variation on the classic Bunyip creature, is a [[Dreamtime]] creature that plays pranks on humans but sometimes these tricks can be dangerous. Ellen follows her parents to a lookout, whining about when they'll be visiting an opal mine. Laura apologizes that they may not have time and Keith is quick to assure her that they have a whole week for such activity. Laura is looking forward to telling scary stories by the campfire, which Keith remarks to Ellen as being amusingly ghoulish. On the drive to the next site, Ellen sleepily asks if there are quinkins among the trees but Keith assures her that they are just trees. Dismissing her daughter's claims, Laura notices Ellen has fallen asleep. Driving over a pothole, Ellen is startled and disoriented. Her parents are still nonplused by her nervousness.  At the campground, they meet James Beasley, the owner of the campsite. There is clear animosity between James and Laura. Keith explains to Ellen that James was a [[Scout leader]] when he and Laura were teenagers, before recalling a story about he nearly drowned on one of the obstacle courses. Later, Ellen asks why Laura hates James. Laura explains her own near-death experience while [[abseiling]] under James' supervision. She holds James accountable and cynically remarks about why her complaints were swept under the rug by other Scout leaders. Keith says this was inappropriate and reminds Laura to not influence Ellen with opinions that have nothing to do with her. Above all, Laura enjoys scary stories, therefore it is important to understand fear.  Ellen visits James in his [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] and he encourages her to retain her curiosity and quest for knowledge, making her promise to stay a kid for as long as possible. He laments having made mistakes in the past and carries the burden of blame.  After crafting a [[boomerang]], Ellen is disheartened when it does not fly and return like she expects. Laura and Keith try to comfort her as Tahlee, an Aboriginal girl, approaches and helps to soothe Ellen's concerns by telling the story of how the moon was created by a little girl's love for her tribe.  Later that night, Laura tells a scary story by the campfire. Ultimately building up to a punchline, it is discovered that Laura intentionally set out to scare Ellen and the rest of the adults are amused by this. Ellen is sent to bed as Laura comments that her tent is distant from the rest of the campers as she is a light sleeper.  During the night, Ellen is awoken by sounds of screaming and chaos as something unseen attacks the campground. In a series of quick cuts, we see Laura and Keith are brutally killed amid the [[hysteria]]. Overcome with fear, Ellen faints. When she wakes up, come morning, Ellen is quick to realize that she is the sole survivor of an apparent campsite massacre. Retreating to her tent, realizing she is without communications and aware that she is not in a dream, Ellen is forced to escape the campsite alone. She finds James slaughtered in his Winnebago and uncovers Laura by the cold campfire pit, before stealing her keys and fleeing the campsite.  Throughout Ellen's journey to escape, she stumbles upon the bodies of familiar characters as the Quinkins pursue her. Reuniting with Tahlee, who has also escaped the bloodshed, Ellen is forced to slaughter an emu and don its skin for a [[bone pointing]] ritual to banish the Quinkins before she is rescued by ranger.  Tahlee's fate is left open-ended and the ranger is skeptical that Ellen's story is even valid. Traumatised and an orphan, Ellen in resigned to the bleakness of her survival, but the ranger still struggles to draw conclusions without taking Ellen's story into account.

Hush (2016 film)
 Madison "Maddie" Young (Kate Siegel) is a deaf author. She temporarily lost her ability to hear and speak after a bout of bacterial meningitis at the age of 13 and lost both permanently after a corrective surgery gone wrong. She lives in an isolated house in the woods. Her friend and neighbor Sarah (Samantha Sloyan) visits her one day to return a copy of her book. That night, a masked killer (John Gallagher Jr.) chases her to Maddie's house. Sarah bangs on the door for help, but Maddie can't hear her, and the man stabs her to death.  After knocking on the door several times, the man quickly learns that Maddie is deaf and decides to make her the next victim. He sneaks into the house, steals her phone, takes photos of her and sends them to her laptop to make her aware of his presence. As Maddie realizes this, she locks herself inside the house. The man cuts the power and sabotages her car. Maddie writes on the glass-paneled front door "won't tell, didn't see face, boyfriend coming home" with her lipstick. However, the man responds by taking off his mask, saying that she has seen his face now. He then taunts her by propping Sarah's bloody body up against her bedroom window. Maddie tries to distract him with her car alarm so she can get Sarah's phone from her body. She fails to get it before he returns but successfully stabs his arm with a hammer's claw. He mocks Maddie revealing he has the phone as well as removing one of Sarah's earrings from her body.  She then makes several failed attempts to escape through the window and ends up climbing onto the roof. The man fires a crossbow bolt and hits her leg, but she manages to knock him off the roof and grab his crossbow. She staggers back into the house and removes the bolt from her leg before trying to reload the crossbow. Sarah's boyfriend John (Michael Trucco) arrives, looking for Sarah. The man meets John, pretending to be a police officer responding to a call, and delivers a false story of how he was rendered unconscious by an intruder. He asks for John's phone, faking a call for police backup. While handing John's phone back to him, Sarah's earring falls out the man's pocket. John points out the flaws in the man's testimony, stating that Maddie is deaf and mute, and therefore wouldn't be able to make a call. John, becoming suspicious with the man, lures him off the porch with a rock in hand, planning to attack him from behind. But at that moment, Maddie bangs on the door to get his attention. With John distracted, the man stabs him in the neck.  As John bleeds out, he uses his remaining strength to put the man in a chokehold, mouthing the word "run" to Maddie. Maddie imagines a vivid hypothetical situation of her doing so. Running on her injured leg is futile, and the man is able to quickly catch her, bludgeoning her to death with a stone. In a shift back to reality, she also realizes she cannot risk hiding inside the house, as she is dangerously close to bleeding out. Maddie decides her only hope for survival is to kill the man. John dies, and the man threatens Maddie's cat with a knife. Maddie prevents this by shooting him with the crossbow from the porch, hitting him in the shoulder. While running back inside, she drops the remaining bolt for the crossbow. While attempting to grab it, the man slams the sliding door shut on her wrist, crushing and stomping on her hand with his boot. Maddie pulls her mangled hand back inside, closing and locking the door. As Maddie lies on the ground writhing in pain, he threatens to enter the house. She taunts him by writing "do it, coward" on the door with her own blood. While the man begins bashing the glass door in with a tire iron, Maddie quickly types a description of the man and a message to her family on her laptop before running to the bathroom with a knife, waiting for the man to enter.  Having difficulty breaking through the glass door, the man smashes the skylight and enters through it unbeknownst to Maddie, who has her back turned to him watching the bathroom door. The man edges closer to her, preparing to stab her from behind, but Maddie feels his breath on the back of her neck. She turns, narrowly avoiding his attack, and stabs him in the knee. She stumbles into the kitchen, her vision beginning to blur. When approached in the kitchen, Maddie sprays the man in the eyes with insecticide and then triggers her specialized smoke alarm to disorient him. The man is able to overcome her, throwing her to the ground and strangling her. Her heartbeat starts to slow and her life flashes before her eyes. On the verge of death, she grabs a corkscrew on the floor just within arms reach and plunges it into his throat, finally killing him.  Maddie takes her cellphone from the man's pocket and dials 911 before stumbling outside and sitting on the porch. Maddie's cat sits next to her, rubbing against her leg. Bathed in the blue and white lights of an approaching police cruiser's sirens, Maddie closes her eyes, pets her cat, and smiles.

I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House
 Retired horror author Iris Blum suffers from [[dementia]] and lives in a remote New England house built in the early 19th century. Ms. Blum's estate manager, Mr. Waxcap, hires live-in nurse Lily Saylor to care for her. In a [[voice-over]] Lily explains that she just turned 28 years old, and that she will never reach 29 years old. Lily declares that a house with a death in it can never be bought or sold; it can only be "borrowed" from its ghosts. She notes that Ms. Blum's house was built by one man for his new bride, though the couple mysteriously vanished on their wedding day, leaving the home unfurnished.  Lily begins to experience strange events. On her first night in the house, while having a conversation with a friend, the telephone is wrenched out of her hands by an unseen force. A spot of black mold appears on a section of wall and slowly grows as the months pass. Lily often finds a corner of the rug at the base of the stairs has been flipped up, but she is the only person in the house who walks on the first floor. Ms. Blum only calls Lily "Polly," never using her real name. Mr. Waxcap explains that Polly Parsons is the protagonist of Ms. Blum's most popular novel, ''The Lady in the Walls.'' Lily presses him about how the novel ends, but he says she must read it herself. Lily responds that she is easily scared, and cannot bring herself to read it. Later, Lily opens a copy of the book in Ms. Blum's study, and it has a dried chrysanthemum pressed between the pages. Upon reading the first few pages, Lily discovers that the plot of the novel revolves around the point of Ms. Blum having known Polly during her lifetime, and is retelling her story. A flashback depicts a woman in white wearing a black blindfold, presumably Polly, walking through the empty house. A man wearing a suit can be seen in the other room, his distinguishing features hidden from the frame. Lily sets the book back on the shelf, too frightened to continue.  While rinsing berries in the kitchen, black mold spots cover Lily's hands and arms. Upon closer inspection, she realizes her arms have become noticeably bloated and have turned to a sickly grey color. Ms. Blum calls for Lily, which momentarily distracts her from her arms, and when she looks back at them, they are normal again. Later that evening, while turning the channel dial on the television set, she spots the reflection of a figure dressed in white standing in the archway of the room. When she turns around, no one is there.  Lily discovers a cardboard box accruing mold, hidden away in the shelf of a closet. She takes the box to her bedroom and uses a pair of scissors to cut the tape. The box contains an assortment of handwritten notes, presumably rough drafts for Ms. Blum's novel. Lily comes to believe that Ms. Blum's novel may not be fictitious, but rather rooted in reality, depicting an actual murder committed in the house. The flashback sequence continues. Polly, dressed in a wedding gown and blindfolded, uses her hands to feel her surroundings, coming across a section of the wall that has been stripped of its boards - the same section where mold is growing in the present day. Polly raises her blindfold to investigate and sees the hole, locking eyes with her husband in confusion. Her husband suddenly rushes towards her with a hammer raised above his head, and bludgeons her to death. The man, now covered in blood, hammers the boards back into place, hiding Polly's body in the walls.   In the present, Lily brushes Ms. Blum's hair, discussing the book with her. Ms. Blum addresses and converses with Lily as if she is Polly. Ms. Blum grows angry with Lily, explaining that she feels betrayed and abandoned, stating that even the prettiest of things eventually rot, and that she will "fall apart like flowers."  Later in the evening, Lily watches television in her bedroom. A ghostly apparition of Polly visits Ms. Blum, whispering in her ear. Lily hears a metallic clang, followed by a rhythmic banging sound. She exits her bedroom and descends the stairs to investigate. She finds the wall boards removed and piled beside the moldy wall. During her investigation, Lily suddenly encounters Polly's ghost, and dies of a shock-induced heart attack. Polly's ghost lingers near the opening in the wall, staring at the camera.   Several days later, Mr. Waxcap discovers Lilly's body. Because Ms. Blum never received visitors, she too dies. An ambulance removes the bodies, and Mr. Waxcap makes preparations to sell the house. A new family moves into the house, unaware of its history or ghostly occupants. The camera focuses on a ghostly apparition resembling Lily, who refers to herself as the "pretty thing you are looking at".

Ice Age: Collision Course
 Scrat, trying to bury his acorn, accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several [[asteroid]]s en route to a collision with Earth. Meanwhile, Manny is worried about the upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian. Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family, but their fierce appearance tends to scare kids. Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her, and he laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party (which Manny had forgotten prior to the event), some of the asteroids strike the place and The Herd barely escape with their lives. Meanwhile, at [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs|the underground lost world]], Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying [[dromaeosaurs]]<ref name="TheHuffPostReview"></ref> named Gavin, Gertie, and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.  Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation, and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them, believing that they could be safe from the impact, as they can fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species. Roger is reluctant, but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him into cooperating.  As The Herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties. Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs, The Herd arrives at "Geotopia", a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with,  immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone-like appearances.  Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and The Herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, but Buck convinces Roger that they will not be able to survive the asteroid, and he in turn convinces Gavin and Gertie to help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The Herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's grandmother, who stayed behind with them, regain their youth. After The Herd returns, Manny reconciles with Julian, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.  In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on [[Mars]], destroying all life on the planet.  In a mid-credits scene, Scrat finds his acorn, but gets beaten by some doors.  
I.T. (film)
 Mike Regan is a self-made [[aviation]] tycoon who lives in a state-of-the-art [[smart house]] full of modern technology with his wife Rose and 17-year-old daughter Kaitlyn. Mike's company is developing an app called "Omni Jet" which will increase business while the company raises much-needed [[financial capital]] with a [[stock offering]]. However, it requires [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) approval.  At the company, Mike meets Ed Porter, a 28-year-old [[information technology]] (I.T.) consultant and calls him to fix his home's [[Wi-Fi]] signal, which his daughter complains is slow. Porter also upgrades the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in Mike's car and claims that he also worked at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and had taken part in a military exercise in [[Kandahar]].  Porter meets Kaitlyn and starts a relationship with her through social media, but Mike fires him after Kaitlyn invites Porter into the house; this ends his promising career at the company. Devastated, Porter begins to remotely access Mike's private data and his house as he covertly monitors them through the security cameras and devices all over the house. He also spies on Kaitlyn and secretly records her masturbating in the shower.  Porter sends fake emails to Mike's clients and the SEC, threatening the company's survival. He also takes full control of the house's technology, which leaves the family terrified. He uses a [[email spoofing|spoof email]] to send Rose fake [[mammogram]] results, saying that she tested positive for breast cancer. Rose is extremely distressed, but her test results were actually negative according to her attending physician. After Mike becomes aware that Porter has done this, he attacks Porter and threatens to kill him if he does not stay away from his family.  Porter then uploads the video of Kaitlyn masturbating online, immediately catching the attention of her schoolmates; she is mortified and blames her father for installing the technology in their house. Angered, Mike drives to see Porter but he is also being monitored by Porter, who mockingly telephones him through the car navigation system and sends him the video. Porter then remotely activates the car's brake system, hitting a nearby stalled truck and destroying the car.  Mike requests help from Henrik, an I.T. expert, who says that Mike must destroy all the smart technology in the house and delete his emails, bank accounts and computer files. Henrik explains that Porter's real name is Richard Edward Portman and that his father committed suicide when he was six years old. He also reveals that he never worked for the NSA, as he claimed, and the photograph of him with soldiers in Kandahar was fake. To allow Mike to obtain evidence from Porter's apartment, Henrik creates a diversion by stealing the phone of a waitress at a coffee shop with whom Porter's obsessed and texting Porter, telling him to come to the coffee shop. While Porter is gone, Mike manages to steal the thumb drives containing the evidence and escape just as Porter realizes it is a diversion.

As he despairs and wonders who will miss him when he dies, he returns home to find a doppelganger of himself, who claims to be the devil. The "devil" tells the man that if he agrees that one type of thing, chosen by the devil, will be removed from the world (as if it had never been), then the man can have another day of life instead of dying the next day. The items are removed at the end of that day, giving the man one last day ostensibly to enjoy them before they disappear from the world. The story proceeds through successive days with new things being removed each day: after phones, then movies, clocks, and finally cats.

In Return: Just a Book
 Perumpadavam Sreedharan's novel in Malayalam [[Oru Sankeerthanam Pole]] (‘Like a Psalm’) was written in 1993 and dealt with 21 days in the life of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Those were the days Dostoevsky fell in love with Anna Gregoryevna Snitkina, who was his new stenographer taking down his novel [[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]. In heavy debt to his publisher, Dostoevsky was facing a deadline that carried a big penalty, to deliver the finished manuscript. ‘Like a Psalm’ describes with lyrical simplicity those 21 days of love and despair, imbuing the theme with empathy and emotional insight. Sreedharan's novel, now in its 61st edition and 21st year, continues to be a best-seller in Malayalam.  The film takes Sreedharan on his first ever visit to Russia and St. Petersburg, a country and a city he had imagined out of almost nothing, except for his reading in translation of the great Russian novelists, including Dostoevsky. His journey of discovery starts from his village in interior Kerala as he recalls how, as he wrote his novel, those 21 days of Dostoyevsky had entrapped him as if his life had caught fire and how he was entangled in Dostoevsky's traumatic and troubled personality. His memories of writing the novel, presented through brief face-to-face encounters and voice-overs, are supplemented by enacted moments that flash forward to the present, crystallizing the dynamics of recollection.  The film follows him in St. Petersburg as he explores a city he had once imagined from nothing, looking at its great landmarks, visiting Dostoevsky's home, sitting on Neva's shore, wandering in the country side. As he immerses himself in the city recollecting Dostoevsky and his intense creative engagement with him, visions and moments from his novel envelopes his present and he becomes an eye-witness to them. Soon Sreedharan is back in his village, merged into its quiet flow and the journey into the far-away world of his novel turned into a beautiful memory.  
Incarnate (film)
  An 11-year-old boy named Cameron Sparrow has done shopping with his mother, Lindsay. Cameron saw a hooded stranger who was standing next to the bonfire. As the two sleep, Cameron is attacked by a hooded stranger from outside. The hooded stranger tries to kill Cameron but he executes him back. Suddenly, he looks at the audience with his eyes red, revealing that he is actually possessed by a demon named "Maggie".  Meanwhile, in a night club, Dr. Seth Ember approaches a middle aged man named Henry and asks him what time it is. Dr. Ember reveals that time has not and will not advance, and then gives Henry a gift given to him by his partner at a law firm. Henry suddenly realizes that he is actually dreaming, and Ember reveals that the woman Henry has been with is a demon who has possessed his body. Dr. Ember and Henry are immediately attacked by two bouncers, but manage to escape and with Henry's help return to reality and free him from the demon possessing him. In the waking world it is revealed that Dr. Ember actually uses a wheelchair and now has a burn mark on his wrist from where the demon grabbed him in the dream world. Dr. Ember's assistant Oliver warns that the demons have started to adapt to Dr. Ember's efforts and that soon he may not be able to escape back to reality.  Dr. Ember is approached by Camilla, a representative from the Vatican, who asks Dr. Ember to exorcise Cameron. Ember refuses stating that his methods are not "exorcisms" and is uninterested, but Camilla reveals that the she believes the demon is one Dr. Ember knows named Maggie. Ember scoffs at her and asks her to leave, but later he visits a priest named Felix to question whether the demon could indeed be Maggie which Felix affirms. Felix offers Ember a vial of blood from a possessed man which, when injected, would allow Ember about 10 seconds of lucidity - just enough time to commit suicide, but Ember refuses to take it.  Dr. Ember travels to the boy's apartment with Camilla and meets Lindsay. The boy's mother initially refuses to submit to an exorcism, but Dr. Ember explains that he does not exorcise demons but evicts them by entering their host's subconscious to make them realize they are dreaming. Ember further explains that demons do not have the power to truly control those they possess and instead lull them into comforting dreams so they will be unaware while the demon uses their body. Dr. Ember then visits the possessed Cameron and confirms that he is possessed by Maggie and that the demon recognizes him. Later that night Dr. Ember reflects on his own dead wife and child, and puts on his wife's cross.  Dr. Ember, Oliver, and, the third member of their team, Riley prepare for the eviction. Riley explains to Lindsay that their equipment will monitor the brain frequencies of both Cameron and Dr. Ember, and that by entering a near death state Dr. Ember will be able to synchronize his brain frequencies to Cameron's and enter his subconscious. However in this state Dr. Ember has only about eight minutes before his heart will give out. Riley further explains that time in a possessed person's subconscious is stuck at the moment they were possessed. Dr. Ember enters Cameron's dream and sees him with his father, Dan, in a park, but suddenly begins bleeding and has a seizure and has to be pulled out of the dream to be revived.  After witnessing Cameron with his father in the dream, Dr. Ember demands that Dan be present to help evict the demon. Lindsay refuses, explaining that the couple separated after Dan broke Cameron's arm in a drunken rage, but she agrees to tell them where to find Dan when Ember insists that Cameron's father may be the only way to save Cameron. Dan's presence initially seems to help, but Maggie reasserts itself inside Cameron and lashes out at his father. In the struggle Ember pleads with Maggie to release Dan as he, Ember, is who Maggie truly wants. Maggie agrees to release Dan but he dies as a result of his injuries. Lindsay, alarmed, demands to know Dr. Ember's history with the demon and his true motives regarding Cameron. Dr. Ember reveals he discovered at the age of 26 that he had the power to perform [[Astral Projection]] and enter the dreams of other people, but hid his power to live a normal life. Unwittingly, however, this power made him a target for demons. One day, while driving with his wife and child the three are hit head on by another car driven by a possessed driver. The attack left Ember's family dead and is the reason that he needs to use a wheelchair, and ever since he's been hunting the demon "Maggie" who he named after the woman it had possessed.  Preparing for the worst Dr. Ember visits Felix to acquire the blood vial, but discovers Felix's loft in disarray. Ember retrieves a vial of blood, but discovers that Felix has been possessed. Felix attacks Dr. Ember who suddenly slits his own throat. As he dies, Felix taunts Ember, telling him that Maggie wants to consume him and tells Ember he should pray for a quick death. Returning to Cameron's dream, Ember finds him with his father. Ember begins trying to reason with Cameron, and using a ring that Cameron had received as a gift from his real father, makes him realize he is in an illusion. Ember and Cameron flee from Maggie in the form of Dan, and Ember helps Cameron escape before struggling with Maggie and seemingly defeating it using his wife's cross. Ember and Cameron wake up, but Ember suddenly wakes up again in a hospital with his wife and son who explain he's been in a coma for the three days since the accident. Ember realizes he's now inside his own dream and flees, running into Maggie. Ember begs Maggie to release Cameron and take him instead, to which the demon agrees. However when Cameron wakes up Riley administers the blood and Ember uses his ten seconds to fling himself from the apartment balcony. As he dies, Riley warns everybody not to touch Ember's body.  In an ambulance paramedics, joined by Camilla attempt to resuscitate Dr. Ember. They succeed in getting a heart beat, allowing Maggie to possess Camilla, before Dr. Ember dies.  
In This Corner of the World (film)
  A young woman named Suzu, who is innocent and loves drawing, lives in a seaside town called Eba in [[Hiroshima|Hiroshima City]]. In 1943, 18-year-old Suzu, working for her grandmother's small family business of cultivating [[Nori|Nori (edible sea weed)]], is told by her parents that an unknown young man has come to propose marriage to her. The man, whose name is Shusaku, lives in [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure City]], a large naval port city 15 miles away from Hiroshima City, as a navy civilian. He remembers that he and Suzu had first met during one of Suzu's childhood visits to the city. Suzu decides to marry him and moves to join Shusaku's family in Kure. As Suzu adjusts to her new life in Kure, the threat of the [[Pacific War]] slowly begins to encroach on the daily lives of the townspeople.  As food shortages become commonplace, the government implements [[food rationing]]. Warning and evacuation preparations against U.S. air raids also begin. Suzu, as a young housewife in a [[Tonarigumi]], takes turns overseeing food distribution and attends training against air raids. Like other Japanese housewives, she makes women's trousers fit for emergency evacuation by cutting traditionally designed clothing, such as kimonos, into parts. As officially allocated food becomes scarce, Suzu looks for any way to feed her family, picking edible plants and trying recommended recipes. Suzu, maintaining her cheerful character, makes efforts to improve the living conditions and to prepare for the air bombing with her family and neighbors. The family build the [[air-raid shelter]] in the garden. Her daily lives are full of humorous and lovely episodes.  The family house of Suzu & Shusaku is located on a hillside in the suburbs of [[Kure]], with a view of the [[Combined Fleet|Japanese Naval Fleet]] in the harbor, including the largest battleships, ''[[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]]'' and ''[[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]]''. Suzu enjoys touching nature and viewing boats moving on the sea with her niece, Harumi. One day, as Suzu draws pictures of floating warships, the military police accost her and come close to accusing her of espionage. In December 1944, a navy sailor named Tetsu comes to visit Suzu: he was a childhood friend of hers, and he has been assigned to the [[Japanese cruiser Aoba|Japanese cruiser ''Aoba'']], which is stationed in Kure. Understanding it might be Suzu's last chance to see Tetsu alive, Shusaku leaves them alone to talk without a chaperone. The next spring, Shusaku is drafted by the Navy and temporarily quartered with troops in [[Ōtake, Hiroshima|Otake City]], 40 miles away from Kure.  In 1945, the U.S. begins air raids on the Japanese mainland; in [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], U.S. naval airplanes [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|heavily attack warships and its naval facilities]]. In July, urban areas of Kure are firebombed, and most of the city burns. Suzu is nearly killed by a U.S. low-level strafing run, but saved by Shusaku. Like many other Japanese, Suzu is unable to avoid tragedy; in addition to the death of her brother Yōichi, Suzu loses her niece, Harumi, and her right hand, which she describes as an "irreplaceable" part of her body due to its dominance, when a delay-action bomb detonates very close to them. Keiko, Harumi's mother blames Suzu for her daughter's death. As she suffers from depression, Suzu debates returning to the relative safety of her hometown (Eba) in [[Hiroshima|Hiroshima City]] in time for the local summer festival on August 6; when she is unable to see a doctor, however, she decides to stay an extra week in Kure. On that particular morning, Suzu, still at her marriage home in Kure, notices a bizarre light and an abrupt quake from a distance. Strangely, Hiroshima Radio Station of [[NHK]] goes off the air, and a towering, roiling cloud rises ominously over the mountain from the direction of Hiroshima City. Soon, Suzu learns what has occurred in Hiroshima City; [[the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|a new, devastating bomb]] has fallen on the town, destroying countless citizens and buildings in Hiroshima City. For a while, Suzu is unable to enter or get information about her hometown.  A few days later, in [[Jewel Voice Broadcast|a radio address]], the [[Hirohito|Emperor of Japan]] announces the end of the War. Suzu, having faced countless setbacks and tragedies during the war, and had grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: [[Occupation of Japan|US occupation]] forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi herself has fallen seriously [[Effects of nuclear explosions on human health|ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation]]. Shusaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan struggling to survive in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in the Hojo residence, sewing clothes with her own hands, aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan.

Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then pick up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a [[space tug]]. They head for the wreckage in the [[Van de Graaff (crater)|Van de Graaff]] crater, where they recover a large container. An alien mothership suddenly appears,<ref name="Space" /> responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of the Earth's planetary defenses before landing over the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], where it starts to drill down toward the Earth's molten core. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug are able to avoid capture and return to [[Area 51]].  Whitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in [[eusociality]] and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson hypothesizes that, if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and retreat. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.  In Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of [[virtual intelligence]]. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refuge from worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls "Harvesters", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.  Knowing the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location, the ESD hide her in an isolation chamber and use a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a [[suicide mission]], leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus sacrificing himself but destroying the enemy ship. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an [[Force field (fiction)|energy shield]] and a fight breaks out. Initially, the ESD soldiers' weapons cannot penetrate the Queen's shield, but after the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a good shot by Whitmore's daughter Patricia disables her shield. This allows Dylan's party, which arrives just in time, to ultimately kill her before she can take the sphere. With the Queen dead, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive, while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a potential [[counterattack]] on the Harvester's home world.

Inferno (2016 film)
 [[Harvard University]] professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], with no memory of what has transpired over the last few days, but being plagued with visions of a scorched Earth. Dr. Sienna Brooks, one of the doctors tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. Another doctor says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the doctor while heading down the hall. Sienna helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment.  Among Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Sienna find a [[Mechanically powered flashlight#Shake type design|Faraday pointer]], a miniature image projector with a modified version of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[Map of Hell]]'', which itself is based on [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']]. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire [[geneticist]] who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's [[Human overpopulation|growing population]], and who committed suicide after being chased by armed government agents.  Langdon and Sienna figure out that Zobrist, who is obsessed with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], has created a virus he has dubbed "Inferno", with the potential of decimating the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and agents from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The WHO agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's, and are trying to prevent the release of the virus. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called "The Consortium", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability.  Langdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and [[Venice]], while killing Vayentha and evading the WHO. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he stole and hid the Dante [[Death Mask]], a crucial clue, an event he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the virus, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Sienna are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man purporting to be working for WHO, warning them that Sinskey has a double agenda and is after the Inferno virus for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again.  Langdon figures out that the virus is in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]]. With that knowledge, Sienna abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the virus. Zobrist and Sienna used to play [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]] games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard, but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Sienna to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with [[benzodiazepine]] to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged.  They realize the virus is in a plastic bag hidden under water in the [[Basilica Cistern]] in Istanbul. The WHO team &ndash; joined by Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey &ndash; race to locate and secure the bag, while Sienna and her allies attempt to detonate an explosive that will rupture the bag and [[aerosolization|aerosolize]] the virus. Sims is killed by Sienna, and when Langdon confronts her, she commits suicide in an attempt to release the virus. The detonation is able to rupture the bag but because it was already contained in a special containment unit, the virus was secured in time and Sienna's allies are killed. The virus is then taken by WHO, and Langdon goes back to Florence in order to return the Dante Death Mask.

In the summer of 1951, before his first year of college, Marcus's synagogue in [[Newark, New Jersey]] mourns the death in Korea of one of his classmates. Marcus has been awarded a scholarship to Winesburg College, a private Christian school in Ohio, which allows him to defer [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]]. His father, who runs a kosher butcher shop, is unnerved by the deaths in the war of boys like his son and becomes overwhelmed with paranoia.  At Winesburg, Marcus is a studious, introverted pupil who feels disconnected from the rest of the student body, including fellow Jewish students. He meets Olivia Hutton, a beautiful student majoring in [[French literature]]. The daughter of a Cleveland surgeon, Olivia is freethinking, sophisticated, and sexually frank, but also fragile and disturbed; she feels as alienated and out-of-place as Marcus. On their first date, Olivia ends the evening by performing [[fellatio]] on him. The inexperienced Marcus is so shocked that he rejects her for a time. As he and Olivia continue to have sexual relations without intercourse, he learns that she tried to commit suicide and was treated at the [[Menninger Foundation|Menninger clinic]]. Olivia's parents sent her to Winesburg hoping that the "squareness" of the school would help her become stable.  Marcus decides that he can no longer tolerate his noisy, intrusive roommates and requests to switch to a single room. The university administration schedules a meeting with Dean of Men Caudwell. Though the discussion is ostensibly about the change in his living situation, it becomes an interrogation about Marcus's atheist beliefs and his dislike of Winesburg's conservative culture. The already ill Marcus becomes so agitated that he vomits and passes out. During recovery from what he learns was [[appendicitis]], Marcus's mother visits him and says that she wants a divorce from his father, who is growing increasingly deranged and can no longer run the shop. She meets Olivia, who has come to bring red and white roses to Marcus, and sees the wrist scar from her suicide attempt; they speak away from Marcus when leaving. The next day, Marcus's mother apologizes to him for oversharing her marital problems and promises not to divorce, but only if he stops dating Olivia. She warns him of the dangers of getting too involved with people who have mental illness and that a relationship with her would ruin his potential.  When Marcus returns to school, he find that Olivia has disappeared from the campus and goes to Dean Caudwell to find out what happened to her. Olivia suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized again. The school had been hesitant to accept her, given her history of [[electroshock therapy]] and relapses, but her father was an esteemed Winesburg alumnus who requested her admission. The Dean demands to know whether Marcus raped and impregnated Olivia; Marcus is outraged and leaves after using an obscenity.  Marcus is expelled after the Dean learns that he paid a student to evade the mandatory chapel requirement, and is drafted. In Korea, Marcus is stabbed with a bayonet during combat. As he collapses, he thinks back on Olivia and wishes that he could tell her that "it's okay, whatever it is. 'Cause someone did love you. At least, I think that's what it was". Decades later, Olivia lives in a nursing home. She notices the red and white roses on the wallpaper and smiles.

A novice nun at the convent is grieving the death of another nun. Confined to her cell, she engages in morning prayer.  Later the Abbess discloses to the doctor that several nuns at the convent were raped by Russian soldiers, relating that the experience was nightmarish, and they wish to keep this a secret. Seven of the nuns are pregnant. Some of the pregnant nuns are reluctant to be examined intimately by the doctor, believing this will violate their vow of chastity. One of the nuns confesses to Mother Superior that her faith has been deeply shaken by these events.  Soldiers come to the convent believing the nuns are harboring an enemy soldier. However, the doctor convinces them she is there to deal with an emergency outbreak of typhus. The Mother Superior is badly shaken by this, and thanks the doctor for her presence of mind. The doctor realizes she too was raped. The Master of Novices tells the doctor that every day she is reminded of these harsh events. She relates how faith has become more difficult for her but it is the cross she bears.  When the doctor returns, her boss chastises her for having been away without leave, stating that the military is a place of order and discipline.  At a later visit at the convent, another novice nun  gives birth unexpectedly. This nun had not realized she was pregnant, and even now does not seem to know she has given birth. The Abbess had given orders that she be notified of all births, but Beaulieu requests that she not be notified immediately, in order to focus on care for the child. A different nun, Sister Zofia, takes responsibility for the child,  Beaulieu asks the Master of Novices if she ever regrets her life as a nun. The novice replies "Faith is 24 hours of doubt with one minute of hope", going on to describe her difficulties with the practice.  The doctor returns to the army medical unit, and discovers the unit is going to be transferred out of the area. Her head trusts they will all be happy.  Multiple nuns are about to give birth at once. The doctor returns to the convent with a male Jewish colleague. She assures the nuns that he will keep their secret. The doctor visits the baby whose existence has been kept secret from the Abbess. The Master of Novices plans to take the baby to the Zofia's family, but the baby is discovered by the abbess. The Abbess is upset that she was lied to and tells the Master of Novices that she has been corrupted by "that French woman" who has brought scandal and disorder to the convent. The Master of Novices replies "Forgive me, but scandal and disorder were already here".  The Mother Superior has been telling everyone that she takes the babies to families that have agreed to adopt, but takes this baby and abandons it in front of a crucifix on a country walking path, after baptising it. Zofia is distraught, knowing the child is mysteriously missing. The Mother Superior privately prays that she have the courage to continue on the path she has chosen. Meanwhile, Sister Zofia commits suicide by jumping from an upper ledge, dying shortly after her wounded body is discovered.  When the Maria goes to Zofia's family to report her death, she discovers that Zofia's mother never knew Zofia had  a child, nor has been caring for the baby. Maria decides to not tell the mother the truth. This is the Maria's first realization that the Abbess has been dishonest about the fate of the babies. She confronts the Abbess demanding the truth. She says she entrusted the child to God saying "Don't you believe in Providence?"  At the medical base, the doctor is getting ready to finally leave the area. The Master of Novices has brought a new baby to the medical base to protect it from the Abbess. The doctor first notices that many orphans living on the street have been helping personnel at the base from time to time. It occurs to her that the nuns could start raising many of these, opening an orphanage, thus avoiding questions about where the babies are coming from.

The final scene is three months later, with a photographer at the convent taking pictures of the nuns and happy orphans.

Arul was a renowned film director until he fell out with the producer of his latest directorial film, because of which the film never released. To overcome his sorrow, he became a chronic alcoholic and started harassing Yazhini. Though Yazhini often threatens to divorce Arul for his behaviour, she changes her mind each time due to her love for him.  Michael, an artifact dealer, is forced to marry Ponni, despite being in love with a widow Malar ([[Pooja Devariya]]). However, Malar has no love for Michael, merely considering their relationship as [[Casual sexual relationship|friends with benefits]]. Michael, openly reveals to Ponni that he is not interested in being her husband and ignores her.  Yazhini tries to convince Arul to seek the producer's forgiveness and get his film released so that they both could return to a normal life. When Arul refuses, the producer himself steps in and asks Arul to pay him 4,00,00,000 to get his film released. Michael and Jagan, with the help of their friend Ramesh ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]), steal a temple idol and sell it for 4,00,00,000, so that Arul's film can be released. Unfortunately, the producer has already decided to remake Arul's film with an entirely new cast and with his own brother as the director. Arul confronts the producer, who tries to kill him. In a fit of rage, Michael bludgeons the producer to death and is soon sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for his crime.

In order to get the money, Michael and Jagan again team up with Ramesh to steal an idol from a [[Kerala]] temple and sell it. However, Ramesh drugs Michael and runs away with the idol. Michael is arrested the following morning, but he manages to escape from the police and returns to [[Chennai]]. On confronting Ramesh, he finds out that Jagan was responsible for getting him arrested at Kerala. Jagan was also in love with Ponni and was disgusted at the way Michael treated her.

Further investigations lead them to Peter ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]), a scientist who is on Love's payroll. Peter turns approver and tells them about the drug, which is called "Speed". The drug causes a person who inhales it to have extraordinary strength for five minutes before falling unconscious, and if the person inhales the drug again within a few hours, he/she will suffer a massive heart attack. Peter also reveals that a shipment of ''Speed'' inhalers is to be dispatched to Love within the next fifteen minutes. Akhilan and Aayushi pursue the lorry carrying the inhalers. But a lorry driver inhales Speed and subdue the duo, who are then taken to Love's hideout. As Akhilan moves to arrest Love ([[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]]), who turns out to be [[transgender]], he is knocked out by none other than Meera, who is shockingly still alive, has been working for Love as a computer hacker, and now goes by the name of Rosy. It is then revealed that Meera suffers from [[retrograde amnesia]] after being shot in the head four years ago and that Love took advantage of her situation to employ her as a computer hacker. She has no mind of her own, following whatever Love says. However, when Love orders her to kill Akhilan and Aayushi, she instead points the gun at Love, and calls the police, who arrest Love. Meera then reveals that she had been forced to take ''Speed'' by Love to work faster, but the drug caused her old memories, including those with Akhilan, to return, and she soon regained her full memory after continuous use of the drug.  Love manages to obtain a ''Speed'' inhaler while in custody and inhales it, helping her to escape and destroy the entire police station, killing everyone present including Aayushi. Akhilan finds out that Love had made a satellite call to Chang, the Transport Minister of Malaysia who had allowed Love to send shipments of ''Speed'' inhalers to [[India]] to perpetrate terror attacks there in return for money. He rushes to the hospital where Chang is admitted and interrogates him. During the interrogation, Love sneaks into the hospital and hiding in the AC vent, sprays a neurotoxic gas in Chang's room, causing Akhilan and Chang to get paralysed. She then kills Chang and puts the knife on Akhilan's hand, framing him as Chang's assassin. Now a wanted criminal, Akhilan, despite being paralysed, somehow manages to escape from the hospital and the Malaysian police.  Akhilan and Meera then decide to finish off Love once and for all using Love's kill switch activation device which had been restored and hidden by Aayushi before she was killed. However, as the device can only be opened with Love's fingerprint, they plan on obtaining her fingerprint. They sneak into an illegal airfield owned by Chang, where Love is planning to leave for India with the shipments of Speed inhalers. Akhilan inhales Speed and fights Love, who has also inhaled Speed, and manages to get her fingerprint before collapsing after the drug's effect wears off. On regaining consciousness, he finds out that Love has already left for India. He then uses the fingerprints to open the kill switch activation device, deactivates Meera's kill switch and kills all of Love's henchmen, including those piloting the plane. The plane crashes into a remote jungle, killing Love, destroying the Speed shipments and thus averting a major terrorist attack.  One month later, Akhilan and Meera are seen enjoying a holiday cruise sponsored by the [[Government of Malaysia]] as a reward for killing Love. After discussing their future plans about having babies, Akhilan reveals he has kept a Speed inhaler and inhales it.

Ishti (film)
 ''Ishti''<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto"/> is set in mid-twentieth century Kerala when young [[Namboothiri]] Brahmins successfully challenged the orthodox, patriarchal traditions of their community which allowed the patriarch, the eldest male member of the family, sole control of family property and denied normal education to its members, particularly women.  The film has a feminist angle, too.  Stubborn prejudices behind a veneer of wisdom. Inequities bordering on extreme cruelty. Silent sobs of womanhood in the corridors of traditional mansions. Burning discontent, and some signs of change. Amidst all these, patriarchs who preserve the fire for their own cremation. ''Ishti'' recreates the ultra conservative ambience in an evolutionary stage of a community.  Namboothiri Brahmins have made tremendous contributions to life and culture in the South Indian State of Kerala. There have been great writers from among them. Namboothiris have led several progressive movements. But until some seventyfive years ago the community lived in a regressive social milieu. Orthodoxy reigned supreme. The eldest son, called Achchan Namboothiri, inherited all the family property. Only he could marry from his community. His younger brothers, called Apan Namboothiris, took their wives generally from Nair and other lower caste groups. Children born out of such alliances had no claims whatsoever on their fathers; they were in fact "untouchable" to the latter.  Ramavikraman Namboothiri ([[Nedumudi Venu]]), the 71-year-old head of a family, is a Somayaji. That is, he has performed the [[Somayaga]]. His ambition is to perform an [[Agnicayana|Athirathram]], or the [[Agnicayana|Agniyaga]], yaga that will make him an Akkithiri. A Yajamanan preserves the fire from the yaga until he dies in order to use it to light his own funeral pyre. The fire from the yaga would be preserved to light his funeral pyre. He is willing to sell the family silver to achieve his ambition, but is unwilling to part with some money for the treatment of his brother's ailing son, born to a woman from a lower caste.  Tradition allowed only the eldest brother to marry from within the community and bring home the spouse. It is often polygamous: in many cases elderly men married teenaged girls.  Ramavikraman Namboothiri has three wives. The third one, Sreedevi, is 17, almost the same age as his daughter, Lakshmi. Sreedevi was married for money; the yagas had caused a deep dent on the family's resources. Ramavikraman Namboothiri has also a son by his first wife, 26 year old Raman Namboothiri. He can recite mantras, but is illiterate. He spends much of his time making Kathakali costumes. Ramavikraman Namboothiri's younger brother Narayanan Namboothiri has had an alliance with a Nair woman. The poor soul, unable to pay for his son's medical treatment, can only weep helplessly as the boy dies.   Ramavikraman Namboothiri's third wife, 17-year-old Sridevi, is literate. Sreedevi knows to read and write, and her arrival upsets the conservative set-up. She argues for education beyond the confines of traditional knowledge. She inspires Raman Namboothiri to learn to read and write. This is much more than what the household and the community can tolerate. Conspiracies are soon hatched. An illicit relationship between Sreedevi and Raman Namboothiri is invented. As per custom, elders in the community gather for the trial of the "sinner", Sreedevi, before the inevitable excommunication.   Ramavikraman Namboothiri's eldest son, Raman Namboothiri, can chant Vedic hymns but cannot read or write.  He gets convinced by Sridevi's arguments, and this enrages the elders in the community.  Soon a conspiracy is hatched against the two, alleging an illicit relationship between them.  This is such a serious crime that the woman should be tried and expelled.  To Sridevi's shock, her husband supports the conspirators.  Then comes the revolt. Sreedevi, the wounded victim, stands up to her tormentors and speaks for all silent sufferers of her kind. Before the judgment comes she walks out of the darkness. And,  the fire Ramavikraman Namboothiri preserves goes out.

Jane Got a Gun
 Jane and her husband Bill "Ham" Hammond live in an isolated house with their five-year-old daughter Katie. One day Ham returns home with several serious bullet wounds. As Jane is attending to his injuries, Ham tells her that "the Bishop Boys are coming".  This is a gang of vicious criminals, led by John Bishop, that Ham himself used to ride with.  Realizing that she is going to need help in order to defend her home and family from the Bishops, as Ham's injuries have rendered him helpless, Jane takes her daughter to a place of safety, with a woman friend whom she trusts. She then rides to the home of a neighbor, Dan Frost, and asks him if he will help her to protect her property from the Bishop Boys. Dan, a somewhat surly man who lives in a squalid, dirty house, refuses to help. It is obvious from their brief conversation that there is some past history – and bitterness - between Dan and Jane.  Jane rides into town to buy guns and ammunition and hopefully find someone who will help her family. As she is leaving the gun shop, she is waylaid and dragged into an alley by one of the Bishop gang. He threatens her at gunpoint and – despite Jane protesting that she "hasn't seen Hammond in years" – he demands that she take him back to her house, as he is convinced that Ham is there, having recognized the gun Jane is carrying as one belonging to Hammond. However, at this point Dan Frost suddenly appears and tells the thug to leave Jane alone. While the two men are distracted, Jane draws her gun and kills the outlaw.  Leaving the body in the alley, Jane and Dan ride back to her house. Ham is still alive, but very weak. Dan has changed his mind about helping Jane, so they start preparing for the expected attack from the Bishop gang.  Meanwhile, Bishop has already set out with his gang to find Ham. His men spread out over the area to extend their search, and one of them chances upon Jane's house. He recognizes Jane, but Dan kills him before he can raise the alarm.  Dan digs a shallow trench in Jane's front yard, and they fill this with jars containing kerosene, nails and pieces of glass. As they work, we see flashbacks of their previous lives. Jane and Dan were once engaged, but he enlisted in the army to fight in the [[American Civil War]]. Captured by the enemy, he was [[Prisoner of war|held for years in a prison camp]], and when he finally returned home, Jane had left. He travelled from state to state trying to find her, showing her photograph in every town. Eventually, he heard that she had [[American frontier|moved west]] on a [[wagon train]] led by John Bishop. Dan talked to Bishop, who told him that during the journey Ham and Jane ran off together. He said he would gladly help Dan to track them down, as he had his own scores to settle with Ham, but Dan refused, saying that he preferred to ride alone.  Dan eventually found Jane, but by then she was married to Ham, and they had had a child. Dan realized that he had lost her forever and was left broken-hearted by the discovery.  Later, Jane tells Dan her side of the story. After Dan left to enlist, she discovered she was pregnant. When Dan did not return, or write, she assumed he was dead. By the time their child, a little girl called Mary, was two or three years old, life in Jane's war-torn town had become so wretched that she decided to take Mary and move West on the Bishop wagon train. Too late, she and the other women on the wagon train realized that Bishop's intention was to start a brothel in another town, and he intended to force the helpless women into prostitution.  A further flashback shows that Ham, having taken a fancy to Jane during the wagon train journey, tells Bishop that he would like to marry her. But Bishop tells Ham that Jane is his "property". Later, Ham finds that Jane and her daughter have gone missing; searching for Mary, he sees a child's boot in the river, and thinks the child has drowned. He goes to the brothel where Jane has been forced to work, and rescues her. Jane is distraught when Ham tells her that Mary is dead.  Back in the present time, the Bishop gang finally arrive at Jane's house, under cover of darkness. Dan and Jane fire into the booby-trapped ditch, igniting the [[kerosene]] "bombs". Most of the gang are killed, but some – including Bishop himself – escape. Jane and Dan manage to move the dying Ham into a shallow storage space beneath the floor, to protect him from the gunfire, but the strain is too much for him and he dies. Dan and Jane continue to fight it out with the remaining gang members, although both are wounded. Finally, Bishop (the only gang member left alive) manages to corner Dan and is about to kill him, when Jane sneaks up behind Bishop and draws her gun on him. Trying to persuade her not to kill him, Bishop tells Jane that Mary is not dead, as she had thought. Jane shoots him several times, wounding him badly, until in his agony he reveals that Mary lives at the brothel. Jane then kills Bishop.  Jane and Dan go to the brothel and find their daughter, Mary, who is working as a servant. Jane takes the bodies of John Bishop and his gang to the sheriff and collects a huge reward. Then she, Dan, Mary and Katie ride off together to start a new life as a family.

Jason Bourne (film)
 A decade after he exposed Operation Blackbriar (as seen in ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'') and disappeared, [[Jason Bourne]] has finally recovered from his amnesia, isolating himself from the world and making a living by taking part in savage, bareknuckle fighting bouts. In [[Reykjavík]], Nicky Parsons, who has been collaborating with a [[hacktivism|hacktivist group]] led by Christian Dassault, hacks into the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s mainframe computer server to expose its "black" (top-secret) operations programs. This alerts Heather Lee, the head of the agency's cybersecurity operations division, and CIA director Robert Dewey. In the process, Parsons finds documentation concerning Bourne's recruitment into Treadstone and his father's role in the program. She travels to [[Athens]] to find and inform him.  In Greece, Parsons and Bourne meet at [[Syntagma Square]] during a violent anti-government protest. They evade CIA teams sent after them, but Parsons is shot by the Asset, an ex-Blackbriar assassin who also holds a personal grudge against Bourne, having been captured and tortured as an unintentional consequence of Bourne's exposure of Blackbriar. Before she dies, Parsons passes Bourne the key to a locker which holds the CIA files.  Seeking answers about his past and family, Bourne locates Dassault in [[Berlin]]. Decrypting Parsons' files, Bourne discovers that his father, Richard Webb, was a CIA analyst involved in the creation of the Treadstone program. A "[[malware]]" program implanted in the files gives the CIA Bourne's location, and Dewey sends a team to capture him, while Lee remotely erases the files. Dassault attacks Bourne, but is incapacitated. Lee alerts Bourne to the team closing in, as she believes that he can be persuaded to return to the agency. Using the few leads he gathered in Berlin, Bourne tracks Malcolm Smith, a former Treadstone surveillance operative, in [[London]] and arranges to meet him in Paddington Plaza.  Lee persuades Dewey's boss, Edwin Russell, the [[Director of National Intelligence]], to allow her to contact Bourne in person to attempt to bring him back in. Dewey, who opposes her plan, secretly authorizes the Asset to eliminate her team and kill Bourne. Bourne evades Lee and the Asset long enough to confront Smith. Smith admits that Richard Webb created Treadstone, but tried to prevent them from recruiting his son. Under Dewey's orders, the Asset killed Richard Webb in [[Beirut]], making it look like a terrorist attack, in order to persuade Bourne to join Treadstone. Smith is killed by the Asset, while Bourne escapes and finds Lee. She admits that she is not comfortable with Dewey's methods and directs Bourne to a technology convention in [[Las Vegas]].  Dewey is scheduled to attend the convention for a public debate on privacy rights with Aaron Kalloor, CEO of [[social media]] giant Deep Dream. Kalloor is the public face of [[corporate social responsibility]] in the Internet age, but he was secretly funded by Dewey in the startup stage. Dewey intends to use Deep Dream for real-time [[mass surveillance]] alongside the latest incarnation of the CIA's targeted assassination 'Beta' program, known as "Iron Hand". When Kalloor has second thoughts about giving the CIA access to Deep Dream, Dewey authorizes the Asset to assassinate Kalloor and Lee - having discovered her conspiracy moments ago. Bourne thwarts the assassinations and confronts Dewey in his suite. Dewey appeals to Bourne's sense of patriotism as he stalls for time, before his right-hand man Craig Jeffers intervenes. Bourne kills Jeffers, only to get shot in the process; however, he is saved when Lee shoots Dewey dead before he could shoot Bourne. After covering Lee's involvement in Dewey's death, Bourne pursues the Asset on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and chases him down into the sewers after the pair end up crashing into a casino; they engage in one-on-one brawl that ends with Bourne snapping the Asset's neck, killing him.  In the aftermath, Lee convinces Russell that Dewey's methods were outdated and offers herself as Dewey's replacement as CIA director and Russell's eyes and ears within the CIA. She outlines her plan to use Bourne's trust to bring him back to the agency, but is prepared to kill him if he refuses. Lee meets with Bourne, promising him that the CIA will become the organization he thought it was when he joined. Bourne asks for time to consider her offer and walks away.  Lee returns to her car and finds a recording, made by Bourne, of the conversation she had with Russell which reveals her true intentions about murdering Bourne as she says "he needs to be put down".

The Journey (2016 film)
 It is October 2006, and the Northern Ireland peace process is debating a [[St Andrews Agreement|new agreement]] in St Andrews, Scotland. Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness meet for the first time and the negotiations begin. Paisley, however, needs to return home to his wife in Northern Ireland for his 50th wedding anniversary. Bad weather closes the nearby airport, so it is suggested that Paisley be driven to another airport where a private jet will take him home. McGuinness allows the change in plans, but only if he travels in the car and plane with Paisley.  The two enemies are then driven in a van for a number of hours. Unbeknownst to either of them, [[MI5]] is listening in with a spy camera and microphone, and can communicate with the young driver, who is given leeway to speak to his passengers and encourage discussion.  Paisley and McGuinness remain implacable to one another in defense of their past actions. Paisley sees McGuinness as a terrorist and murderer, while McGuinness sees Paisley as a man who used his influence and power to encourage violence. McGuinness, seeing his past actions as part of a broader civil war that might soon be over, continues to speak to Paisley in the hope that they can seal a permanent peace agreement.  Meanwhile, back in St Andrews, Tony Blair and MI5 agents watch the conversation with interest.  The driver is then instructed by MI5 to take a diversion into a forest. This, along with the departure of a security detail following the van, begins to raise suspicions in McGuinness. Suddenly the van driver hits the brakes and the vehicle slides into a stack of timber next to the road, piercing a tire. The driver claims to have hit a deer, but McGuinness and Paisley see no blood on the front of the car. While McGuinness and Paisley wander in the woods and continue to talk, the driver urgently speaks to MI5 and reveals that he does not know how to change a flat tire.  In the woods, the two enemies continue to argue their points and defend their actions to one another. McGuinness also begins to wonder if their current situation had been planned, with the possibility that one or both of them might be assassinated in a forest in the middle of nowhere. The discovery of the fatally wounded deer confirms to them both that their situation was not planned. When encouraged to kill the dying animal by Paisley, McGuinness picks up a heavy rock but eventually refuses to do the deed, surprising Paisley.  As the driver changes the tire, the two then find their way to a disused Protestant church, where Paisley identifies various martyrs in the stained glass windows as being from ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]''. They wander outside in a cemetery, and the topic of the [[Remembrance Day bombing|Enniskillen bombing]] is brought up. Paisley rages at the IRA and McGuinness for the bombing, which killed innocent bystanders and not the soldiers that were being targeted. McGuinness admits that the bombing was wrong and that it caused the IRA to question its actions. He also reveals to Paisley the conversation he had with his young daughter about the bombing, and how it made him feel. Paisley viciously responds to McGuinness' honesty by claiming that he was crying [[crocodile tears]].  The heated argument convinces McGuinness that there is no point continuing, and he refuses to re-enter the van. Paisley then states that his own "bark" is worse than his "bite", which indicates to McGuinness that while Paisley may not be apologetic, he is at least conciliatory. The van drives off with both men inside.  As the van gets nearer to the airport the driver realises they need fuel. They pull over at a service station but the driver's credit card no longer works since it was bent during the changing of the tire. The driver asks McGuinness and Paisley if they have a credit card, but they do not, Paisley stating that charging interest is [[usury]] and is apparently against the Bible. At an impasse and needing to hurry, Paisley enters the service station and uses his fame and his public speaking voice to convince the clerk to try the driver's card again. This time the card works.  McGuinness and Paisley then walk back to the van, where McGuinness notices a hidden pistol in the driver's belt and confronts him. The driver then admits that he is with MI5 and that he was in touch with them the whole time - but that their agenda is peaceful and directed at getting the two to talk. McGuinness tries to tell Paisley this, but Paisley has collapsed inside the van with [[angina]]. McGuinness helps Paisley to retrieve his medication and settles him down.  Reflecting upon the stained glass windows he saw in the church, Paisley then orders the van off the road and exits, speaking to McGuinness alone. He then speaks about how he saw himself as being a potential martyr for his cause but here he was at age 81 having suffered no violence upon himself at all. McGuinness encourages this line of thought, and tells him that if peace should come, Paisley's people will hate Paisley, and McGuinness' people would hate McGuinness, and that would be a courageous act.  The van enters a secure part of the airport and stops in a hanger with a private jet and a heavily armed security detail. Paisley then asks for time alone with McGuinness, so the driver leaves. Paisley then issues an ultimatum to McGuinness: he will support the peace process and sign the accords if McGuinness offers a heartfelt apology to him for all the actions of the IRA. McGuinness refuses, saying that he plays "the long game" and that any apology he might offer Paisley privately would go against everything he stands for, thus he apologises for nothing. At this, Paisley smiles and praises McGuinness for being a real politician and never apologising. Paisley then says that he despises everything that McGuinness has done, and McGuinness says that he despises everything Paisley stands for. But the two shake hands as friends, and the peace process is sealed. The film ends with actual pictures of Paisley and McGuinness working and smiling together as first and deputy ministers of Northern Ireland.

The Jungle Book (2016 film)
  [[Mowgli]] is a "man cub" raised by the wolf [[Raksha (The Jungle Book)|Raksha]] and her pack, led by [[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]], in an Indian jungle ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the [[black panther]] [[Bagheera]]. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela disapproves of him using human tricks like building tools instead of learning the ways of the pack.  One day, during the [[dry season]], the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a [[drought]] that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a scarred tiger named [[Shere Khan]] arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.  En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous python named [[Kaa]] who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan. The vision also warns of the destructive power of the "red flower" (fire). Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a large brown [[sloth bear]] named [[Baloo]], rescuing an unconscious Mowgli. Baloo and Mowgli bond while retrieving some difficult-to-access honey for Baloo, and the boy agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.  Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is angered that Mowgli has not joined the humans as agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of [[Indian elephant]]s gathered around a ditch and uses his vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are both impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.  Mowgli is kidnapped by the "[[Bandar-log]]" (monkeys) who present him to their leader, a giant ape named [[King Louie]]. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak him out, but their plan is discovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him. Furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone.  Mowgli steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.  In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo, and Bagheera.

Julieta (film)
 Julieta lives in [[Madrid]] and is about to move to Portugal with her boyfriend Lorenzo. In a chance encounter on the street with her daughter Antía's childhood friend Beatriz, she learns that Antía, from whom she has long been estranged, is living in Switzerland and has three children. Overcome by her desire to reestablish contact with Antía, she abandons plans to leave Spain and instead leases an apartment elsewhere in the building in Madrid where she raised Antía, knowing that address is Antía's only means of contacting her.  Anticipating word from Antía, and aware that she owes her daughter an explanation of the events that led to their separation, Julieta fills a journal with an account of her life as mother, spouse, and daughter. She begins with the story of meeting Xoan, a fisherman and Antía's father. In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Julieta recounts meeting Xoan on a train, having fled to the restaurant carriage from an older man. He tells her about his life as a fisherman, and his wife who is in a coma. The train stops sharply, having hit the older man, who committed suicide. As Julieta blames herself for his death, Xoan comforts her, and they have sex on the train. Later, at the school at which she works, Julieta receives a letter from Xoan which she takes as an invitation to visit. She learns his wife has recently died and that he is with Ava, a friend. Julieta and Xoan resume their relationship, and she informs him that she is pregnant with his child. Two years later, Julieta and Antía visit Julieta's parents. Her mother is ill and apparently suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], at first not recognising her daughter. Her father is having an affair with the maid, to Julieta's chagrin.  While an older Antía is at a [[summer camp]], Xoan and Julieta argue over his occasional dalliances with Ava, prompted by the housekeeper. Julieta storms out to walk and Xoan goes fishing. A storm rolls in and, as Julieta watches the news in panic, Xoan is killed. At camp, Antía has become inseparable with a girl named Beatriz. Julieta travels to Madrid to break the news of Xoan's death to her daughter, and rents a flat there. At the age of 18, Antía embarks on a spiritual retreat and announces that she will be incommunicado for three months.  When Julieta drives to the location of the retreat in the Pyrenees three months later, she is informed that her daughter has already left, and does not want her location disclosed to her mother. Julieta is racked by the loss and her attempts to find Antía are unsuccessful. The only contact she has is a blank card on her 19th, 20th and 21st birthdays. After the latter she is enraged and destroys most traces of her daughter in her life, moving from her apartment. She visits Ava, who has [[multiple sclerosis]] and is dying. Ava tells her that Antía knew about the argument that precipitated Xoan's death and blamed Julieta and Ava, and that she had ultimately internalised guilt about this because she was away at camp at the time. At Ava's funeral, Julieta meets Lorenzo and the two embark on a happy relationship, which distracts Julieta from her loss. She tells him nothing of Antía and he respects that she has some secrets in her life.  Back in the present, Lorenzo has gone to Portugal and Julieta's mental state is deteriorating as she visits places she used to go with her daughter. Beatriz encounters her, and reveals she and Antía had a lesbian relationship. After attending the spiritual retreat, Antía told Beatriz she was ashamed of it, and cut her out of her life just as she had Julieta.  Later Julieta is hit by a car and collapses in the street but is seen by a newly-returned Lorenzo. He visits her flat where he finds a letter from Antía, which he brings to Julieta - along with her memoir, apparently unread. Antía speaks of the death of her son, which has deeply affected her and allowed her to understand how Julieta must feel at their separation. She has also included a return address. Lorenzo and Julieta drive to Switzerland and Julieta resolves not to demand an explanation, simply wishing to be with her daughter.

The trapped people meet the ghost of Raj Nayak, the head of all the 13 ghosts. Rajnayak asks Kaashmora to help him and his 13 subordinates reach the spiritual world. He then locks them in the castle. That night, a young girl in Kaashmora's dream leads him to a locked door within the castle.  Waking up, Kaashmora follows the same route, but is stopped by Yamini, who reveals to him that Chelapathy Rao, the man who led him here, died 75 years ago and it was his ghost that led Kaashmora as well as Yamini to the bungalow. Kaashmora searches the castle and gets hold of an old book that dates back 700 years. Raj Nayak ([[Karthi]]) was a self-obsessed warlord and a womanizer. The King remained silent and didn't interfere with Rajnayak's growing atrocities because of his military prowess. One day, the princess Rathna Mahadevi ([[Nayanthara]]) elopes with her lover who is the enemy nation's prince. The King announces that he'll marry off Rathna and give away half of his kingdom to the man who finds her. Rajnayak kills the prince and forcibly brings Rathna back. He demands to be wedded to the princess, and wants the other half of the kingdom as dowry. When opposed, he kills the crown Prince and the King. He marries Rathna and coronates himself as the King. However, Rathna has other plans. She and her friends seduces Rajnayak and his subordinates. While his subordinates are burned alive, Rajnayak is beheaded by Rathna. However, he kills her before dying. Before breathing her last, Rathna places a curse on the 14 men, banishing them from reaching the spiritual world.  Ever since, Rajnayak and the other 13 ghosts had haunted the palace and its occupants. An exorcist once had predicted that Raj Nayak and the other ghosts would reach eternal power if they are able to sacrifice the lives of 5 people belonging to the same family with the same birth star (Rohini). The sacrifice should be performed by a lady who is the only woman in her generation. This should happen during the Navakaali Pournami that occurs once every 1000 years. Kaashmora recollects that his family members all have the same birth sign and that Yamini is the only woman in her family.  That night, Navakaali Pournami occurs and Rajnayak forces Kaashmora and his family to a guillotine. The young girl from Kaashmora's dream apparates and she turns out to be Rathna Mahadevi's reincarnation. While Rathna and Raj Nayak fight each other, Kaashmora fends off the subordinate ghosts with the help of a magical sword. Rathna's conscience leads him to a chamber within the castle where Rajnayak's remains are. Using the sword, Kaashmora destroys the remains, making Rajnayak vulnerable. Rathna destroys Raj Nayak's spirit and it goes to the underworld. The other spirits flee the castle to the spiritual world. Kaashmora and his family get out of the castle and he claims that he has destroyed the spirits and cleansed the centuries haunted bungalow. Kaashmora's family told the politician that the money stolen from the politician has been kept by the Ghost.  
Kabali (film)
  A [[Kuala Lumpur]]–based [[boss (crime)|don]] Kabaleeswaran alias Kabali ([[Rajinikanth]]) is released after spending 25 years in prison on a false charge of starting a massacre at a local Hindu temple that killed many, including his wife Kumudhavalli alias Kumudha ([[Radhika Apte]]). He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan alias Loga ([[Mime Gopi]]), a drug smuggler. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran ([[Kalaiyarasan]]), whose father Tamilmaaran (Charles Vinoth) was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer ([[John Vijay]]) to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.  Kabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan ([[Nassar]]), a don who fought for the rights of the [[Tamil Malaysians]]. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran alias Veera ([[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]]), a member of his gang who disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. But Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.  Kumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu ([[R. Amarendran]]), one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for [[Thailand]], where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi ([[Dhansika]]), a [[contract killing|contract killer]] hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee alias Tony ([[Winston Chao]]), who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. But Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]]. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.  Kabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva ([[Attakathi Dinesh|Dinesh]]) was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join the Gang 43; and the Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony once and for all. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including the Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.  Some months later, Kabali, Kumudha, Kumaran and Yogi attend a function organised by the Free Life Foundation. One of the Free Life alumni, a youngster name Tiger (Hari Krishnan), who is known to be aggressive and reckless, walks up to Kabali, with scenes showing him speaking to the police prior to the function. The screen cuts to black, and the sound of a gun clicking and a gunshot afterwards is heard.

Justice League vs. Teen Titans
  The [[Justice League]] battle the [[Legion of Doom]] ([[Lex Luthor]], Toymaster, [[Weather Wizard]], [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]). Weather Wizard flees when his comrades are beaten, but becomes possessed by the shade of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]'s  minions. [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] (Damian Wayne) disobeys [[Batman|his father's]] orders to get civilians to safety, thinking he can help the Justice League fight the possessed Weather Wizard, and sets the Batwing to crash into Weather Wizard and explode, defeating him and forcing Trigon's shade to leave his body. Upset that there's no answer to this occurrence, and in order for his son to learn teamwork, [[Batman]] sends Robin to join the [[Teen Titans]]. Meanwhile, Trigon's  minion possesses [[Superman]], plaguing him with visions of demonic shadows.   Robin meets the Titans' leader [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]], who is [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]'s girlfriend and members [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], [[Beast Boy]] and  [[Blue Beetle]], but his lack of respect for the others causes friction. Blue Beetle and Robin fight until Blue Beetle's suit instinctively uses an energy blast to severely burn Robin. Raven heals him, but during the process her empathic powers cause both to see into the other's memories. Robin later thanks Raven, but is curious about an entity he saw in her mind. With Raven unwilling to answer, Damian tries looking in the Titans' records, but finds no useful information. Starfire tells Damian that the team isn't just for fighting crime, but also a surrogate family, as they are all lost souls in a world with no place for them.  Superman finds and brutally beats down [[Atomic Skull]], alerting Wonder Woman and Batman to his [[Demonic possession|possession]]. The latter uses kryptonite to drive Superman back. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] tries to locate Superman and a "female with supernatural powers", whom Trigon is searching for, and he and Batman conclude that if the host is damaged or overwhelmed, they will be freed from it. In the meantime, in order to loosen Damian up, Starfire takes the group to a carnival, where Raven encounters Trigon in spirit form and his demonic emissaries, who wants to find her so he can use her for his plans. With the help of the other Titans, Raven resists and fights the emissaries until they cannot maintain their presence on the Earthly plane and dissipate.  Afterward, Raven reveals that [[Arella|her mother]] was a member of a cult who married her off to Trigon, who took a human form. Her mother fled after discovering his true nature and was saved by the Azarathians, benevolent people from another dimension, where Raven grew up. After unwittingly summoning her father and thus causing the obliteration of [[Azarath]] and her mother, Raven was taken by him so he could conquer Earth, but she imprisoned him inside a crystal in Hell. The Titans offer their support, but the Justice League arrives in order to take Raven away. However, before they can act, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], Cyborg, and Wonder Woman are taken over by Trigon's shadow and turned into demon emissaries. Batman counteracts his own possession by injecting himself with a [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|nerve toxin]], putting himself in a comatose state and thus causing the shade to abandon him.  The Titans battle the League without success, causing Raven to surrender herself. Just before the League and Raven use a portal to leave, Blue Beetle frees Cyborg from Trigon's control. Robin locates Raven in the Middle East, revealing he put a tracking device on each of the Titans, and Cyborg and the Titans portal to the Middle East, to discover that Superman has unearthed a mystical shrine that Raven uses her powers on so that Trigon can pass through the shrine as a gate. Robin stabs Superman with [[kryptonite]] to free him from Trigon's control, and Superman defeats Flash and Wonder Woman, which frees them as well. The Titans save Raven, but not before Trigon returns to his physical form.  Following Raven's plan, the Titans and Cyborg portal to Hell to retrieve the crystal to re-imprison her father, while the League vainly engage Trigon to prevent him from reaching innocent civilians. The Titans battle their way through hordes of demons, but an undead [[Ra's al Ghul]], turned into Trigon's servant after his death at the hands of [[Deathstroke]], shatters the crystal. He tries to persuade Robin to join him and Trigon by killing Raven so that he may return to life, but Robin declares himself a Titan; they battle, and Robin eventually defeats and kills Ra's al Ghul. Overcoming her inner doubts and Trigon's telepathic attempts to dissuade her, Raven uses her powerful magic and her telepathic link to Trigon to re-imprison him in a shard of the broken crystal.  Raven informs the Titans that the shard must stay in Hell and be watched always, in case Trigon tries once again to break free. She puts herself forward as Trigon's keeper, but the Titans assure that her home is with them. Back at [[Titans Tower]], the group - now joined by Robin and Cyborg - are lauded by the Justice League for saving Earth, and Raven has her father's crystal prison attached to her forehead for safekeeping, while Trigon seethes with rage over his renewed imprisonment.  In a mid-credits scene, [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] is seen approaching Titans Tower, riding a boulder across the sea.

Terrified, Vidya escapes from the hospital after recovering from the coma and returns home in search of the address that the kidnapper asked her to come to. She is caught by Halder and Inderjeet at her home. However, she is successful in escaping from there, as she shoots Inderjeet in his arm. Vidya then arrives at [[Kolkata]], where she goes to the docks as ordered by Mohit. Vidya offers to pay the ransom to the kidnapper policewoman. Mohit shoots the policewoman when she takes interest in the ransom money. He then tries to strangulate Vidya, but is shot dead by Minnie, who picked up his fallen revolver. Vidya then calls Inderjeet to seek his help, but Haldar and other police officer ask Inderjeet to call her to a place where they can arrest her. Inderjeet asks Vidya to come to his paternal house, where they are surrounded by the police force. Halder tries to come near to Vidya, but she shoots him in the leg. Later, she sets the house on fire.  It is finally revealed that Vidya's real name is Durga Rani Singh and she was married to Inderjeet Singh at a very young age, but got separated later. Durga after recovering from the coma asked Inderjeet for his help and they planned her escape. It was Inderjeet, who helped Durga in arranging the real passports for Vidya and her adopted daughter. He helped her in escaping to [[Kolkata]] in the police Ambassador car, inside the car trunk, and he helped her escape from the burning house.  It is seen that Durga is alive, (who is believed to be dead by the police) and is traveling to [[New York City]] for Minnie's operation. Inderjeet is seen happily driving with his family.

Choukai uses Searchlight and gets medium damage, but they win in the end. A New Fleet Girl gets "dropped", emerging from the sea.  It is Kisaragi. Kisaragi is brought back to the temporary base in Solomon Islands, but she is suffering from PTSD and has amnesia, unable to remember anyone from back in the anime, excluding Mutsuki.  Meanwhile, the fleet celebrates their victory in the Ironbottom sound campaign. During the time Kisaragi slowly starts turning into an Abyssal Vessel, but she is still able to retain her consciousness and starts crying. Seeing the situation, Kaga finally reveals the secret: At the start of this war, there were two factions, Fleet Girls and Abyssal Vessels. Both fight for an unknown reason, but if Fleet Girls sink, they become Abyssal Vessels, and the vice versa can happen where a sunk Abyssal Vessel can turn into a Fleet Girl.  There is this crimson aura in some areas in the ocean, which indicates a source of heavy Abyssal power resides in there. Kaga was originally an Abyssal Vessel and retains her memory as an Abyssal Vessel. The Fleet decides to investigate and commences an operation, consisting of 4 task forces, where the true goal was to escort Fubuki into this dark portal in the middle of the Crimson Sea, which is a source of the Abyssal Vessels' power. (This portal looks practically the same as the final map in PS VITA KanColle Kai.)  Several battles occur, where several Fleet Girls become heavily damaged from battle but no one gets sunk. When they arrive at the Dark Portal, only Yamato, Mutsuki and Fubuki remain. Yamato and Mutsuki become Heavily Damaged from battle but out of nowhere, half-transformed Abyssal Kisaragi comes to their aid, and Fubuki takes the chance to jump into the Dark Portal.  It is revealed that this area was the place where the actual IJN Destroyer Fubuki got sunk in 1942 (Cape Esperance, the infamous 'Ware-Aoba'). The secret is revealed, that when all of the Ships sunk during back in World War II, their Souls left the ships, wandering around the sea, while constantly switching back and forth from Abyssal Vessels to Fleet Girls. Fubuki meets her Dark Persona, an Abyssal Fubuki, who tries to persuade Fubuki into becoming an Abyssal Vessel. Fubuki refuses, and both go through a mental breakdown through a Mind Battle, through which Fubuki and her doppelganger become one.  Afterwards, the Dark Portal disappears, similar to when an Event map is cleared. Abyssal Vessels disappear from the area, but Abyssal Kisaragi disappears as well, after exchanging few last words with Mutsuki. Fubuki is afterwards promoted to both 11th Destroyer Division, as well as the Vanguard of the 2nd Torpedo Squadron for her efforts, but is immediately after called out for a mission, to which she promises her Dark Persona to make peace in the oceans one day.  In a post-credits scene, Mutsuki is able to reunite with Kisaragi; the movie concludes just as Mutsuki jumps to embrace her sister.

Karvva
 The film is a compendium of two linear story lines, related to the final plot. The first story line follows a documentary film crew who are out to debunk a rumor about a haunted house, while the other recounts the kidnapping of a rich businessman’s daughter. The connection between the two linear story lines is a classic, which is set in a worn down mansion located somewhere in the [[Karnataka]] countryside.  When a non-residing Indian (NRI) attempts to sell his ancestral property, he finds that it has a nasty reputation as a haunted house. In an attempt to improve his chances of a sale, he enlists the help of a documentary filmmaker,  specializing in investigations of supernatural events. The TV crew also has some kind of spiritual adviser and a scientist with a machine that measures ghost activity. However, despite all their skepticism, the crew finds more than they bargained for in the abandoned house. In a plan to exorcise the spirit, they aim to return at a more auspicious time.  The other storyline follows [[Tilak Shekar|Thilak]], a spoiled, rich kid who lives the high life; until he loses a large amount of money gambling.  When his father ([[Devaraj]])   decides that enough is enough after hearing a fake need for more money from Tilak and refuses to bail him out. Amruta ([[Anisha Ambrose]]), Thilak’s sister, tries to get her father to help Thilak, but is kidnapped and a ransom note sent to Devaraj. The kidnappers choose Thilak to deliver the ransom money and the directions he follows take him to an abandoned mansion somewhere in the Karnataka countryside. Thilak is shown to be conniving with the kidnappers to extort money from his father so that he can continue living his flamboyant lifestyle. When they decide to escape after obtaining the money from Thilak, the car refuses to start, leading Amruta to suggest that they spend that the night at the mansion itself.  It is revealed that this mansion is the same as the one the TV crew was investigating in order to debunk the rumors of supernatural elements living in it. The five youngsters find an old book, which tells the story of Vaidehi, a woman who lived in that very mansion long ago. Vaidehi was considered to be an ill-omen right from the time of her marriage, and was tortured to death by her family members who had plotted to kill her. After her death, her spirit haunted the house, taking the lives of all those who entered. Mysterious happenings in the house terrify the five people, culminating in Rohit being mortally wounded, who warns Thilak about an evil spirit that his sister is housing, before apparently dying.  Thilak and others flee the house and return to Bangalore, where they resume their normal lives. It is revealed that Thilak was conned by Rohit and Amruta working together to defraud him of a large sum of money, and all the mysterious happenings were engineered by Rohit (who is actually alive) and Amruta. Rohit plans to swindle other people as well, and is shown selling the house to some investors. When he goes into the bungalow after finalizing the deal with the buyers, the mysterious happenings at the house begin again (on the anniversary of Vaidehi's death), and the movie ends with the couple trapped in the house with Vaidehi's spirit.

Thamba was also responsible for chopping off the leg of Amudhavel and Gnanavel's father Rajarathinam when he had tried to intervene in the fight between Thamba and his sons, confining him to a wheelchair. To escape from Thamba and his gang and not cause any more harm to his family, Amudhavel had emigrated to the USA.

Amudhavel confronts Vadivel, forcing him to reveal that he was the murderer of Thamba in front of Thamba's teenage son, who then kills him.  In the end, it is revealed to the audience that, though Vadivel had plotted to kill Thamba, the real murderer of Thamba was none other than Amudhavel. Amudhavel, who was determined to take revenge against Thamba for the atrocities he committed against him and his family, had stabbed Thamba and escaped before Vadivel's men arrived and further stabbed a dying Thamba to death.

One day, Tamizhselvan is kidnapped by some goons in retaliation for his thwarting of a black money scam six months ago. Arjun rescues Tamizhselvan and takes him home, only to reveal that he is actually a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] officer who had discovered 250 crore stashed in Tamizhselvan's house as black money. 300 crore had been seized during the black money raid, but it was publicly announced that only 50 crore had been seized. Arjun takes away all the money but does not arrest Tamizhselvan due to his public reputation, instead of telling him to personally surrender later that day.  However, Tamizhselvan soon finds out that Arjun is not a CBI officer from a terrorist, but is a criminal who had recently been released from prison. He pursues Arjun with the aim of getting back the money. During the chase, he opens fire on Arjun's [[sports utility vehicle|SUV]], causing Arjun to lose control and meet with an accident, losing consciousness. Arjun wakes up in a hospital, having lost his memory. Tamizhselvan keeps Arjun in custody in a house, where a psychiatrist Dr. Boothri ([[Vadivelu]]) is assigned to restore Arjun's memory so that he can reveal where he has kept the money. But, unknown to anyone, Arjun had not lost his memory; he is only pretending as part of his mission to retrieve the black money. At night, he sneaks out of the house and steals the black money of a Union Minister ([[Jayaprakash]]), converting it to white money with the help of a [[hawala]] trader. However, Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister soon find out that Arjun had not lost his memory and has stolen even more of the black money. Arjun, confronted by Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister, reveals his motive for stealing the black money.  Arjun is from Manimangalam, a remote village with no basic amenities like roads, water, high schools and even proper housing and sanitation facilities. When the building of the only primary school in the village collapsed, he confronted the local [[Member of Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] Sivagnanam, who had falsely claimed to have developed the village, instead pocketing all the money which was to be used for developing Manimangalam. Sivagnanam rudely sent him away, defending his corruption and even declaring that he would never develop the village. Following this, Arjun approached the Union Minister, who also turned out to be corrupt like Sivagnanam. Arjun's friends confront Sivagnanam and his men, who kill them all. It is at this stage that Arjun had decided to get back all the black money acquired by Sivagnanam (which was the 300 crore recovered earlier in the film) and the Union Minister and use it to develop Manimangalam.  Arjun takes Tamizhselvan, the Union Minister and Divya to Manimangalam, which is now a very well developed village. He reveals that he had used the money hoarded by the Union Minister along with Sivagnanam's 300 crore to develop the village and had given the credit to him, because of which the villagers now hold the Union Minister in high regard. Tamizhselvan drops all charges against Arjun, seeing that he had stolen the money which was black for good intentions and arrests the Union Minister. In the credits, it is revealed that Divya and Tamizhselvan involve themselves in the development of Manimangalam along with Arjun.

At the strip club after the run, Clarence accidentally smokes some Holy Shit, and experiences a drug trip in which he appears in the music video for [[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]] by George Michael, and Keanu speaks to him in the voice of [[Keanu Reeves]].

Rell – who never learned to drive – hijacks Bacon's escape car with Bacon and Keanu in the back; Clarence gives chase in a car that belongs to Bacon's son. The chase ends at Clarence's house, where Rell crashes into the front yard, sending Bacon flying through where the windshield of the car would have been, had it not been removed in the chase. Bacon gets up and attempts to shoot Rell, but Clarence runs him over. Bacon gets up again, but is shot and killed by Cheddar and the Blips. The Blips threaten Rell and Clarence, but Hi-C – secretly a police officer – breaks her cover and forces the Blips to drop their guns. When Cheddar attempts to shoot her, she kills him. The police arrive, and Hi-C reveals that Faris and her party guests were in on the whole operation and are all still alive, but Rell and Clarence will still have to go to jail for the activities they've taken part in, including the killing of the Allentown Boys. She promises to testify for leniency and agrees to go on a date with Rell after they get out of jail.  Six months later, Rell and Clarence have only three weeks left on their jail sentences, but have commanded respect among the inmates – including the remaining Blips – for killing the Allentown Boys. Hi-C, who has been taking care of Keanu, speaks with Rell through a visitation phone, where she reveals that she's just been to the veterinarian and discovered that Keanu has a rare disease: he will remain a kitten permanently.

Right then, he hears Ian escaping in German's truck. Chook angrily drags Sam off with him as they attempt to intercept Ian. When they pass German's corpse, Sam notices that Ollie is missing. Once inside Chook's car, he insults Ian for abandoning Sam, but Sam believes that Ian took Ollie with him. Sam tries to fight Chook, leading to him crashing into a tree, knocking them both unconscious.  As night falls, Ian arrives at the police station and asks for help. He accompanies two officers to the campsite. Sam awakens in the wreck of the car with her hands tied to the steering wheel and Chook absent. The officers spot the wreckage when Sam flashes the head beams on the car, but Chook kills them as they exit their police car. Chook shoots Ian in the arm and holds him hostage. He demands that Sam drive him to a safe location. Sam complies and runs up to save Ian from bleeding to death.  Sam asks Ian if Ollie survived, but Ian tells her that Ollie was never with him and he ran off to the police as he didn't know what to do. Ollie is shown to have crawled away from German's corpse as Banjo sits silently guarding him. His final fate remains unknown.  While driving out of the campsite, Sam resolves to stop Chook and violently crashes the vehicle. Ian falls unconscious, and Chook - badly injured - manages to get away from the wreckage.

At the German embassy in [[Oslo]], German envoy [[Curt Bräuer]] is instructed by the military attaché to encourage the Norwegian government to allow [[German occupation of Norway|occupation troops]] into the country, under the pretext of defending Norway from a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] invasion. Early the following morning, Bräuer brings the German offer to Foreign Minister [[Halvdan Koht]]; after consulting with the Cabinet, Koht refuses, stating that Norway is a sovereign nation.  Meanwhile, at [[Oscarsborg Fortress]] near [[Drøbak]], Colonel [[Birger Eriksen]] prepares his undermanned and inexperienced garrison for combat, while receiving reports from the outlying fortresses of incoming German ships. Early on the morning of 9 April, Eriksen spots the [[German cruiser Blücher|German cruiser ''Blücher'']] entering [[Drøbak Sound]]. Despite having no instructions from Oslo to engage, Eriksen considers the German ship to be an enemy and [[Battle of Drøbak Sound|gives the order to fire]], and the fortress' guns and torpedo battery sink the ''Blücher''. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold telephones the King, informing him of the [[Operation Weserübung|impending invasion]], and advises him to flee Oslo. The Royal Family boards a train for [[Hamar]], where the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] convenes to discuss negotiations with Germany.

Bräuer receives instructions from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] himself to go directly to the King and convince him to accept Quisling's government.  As German troops advance towards Hamar, the Royal Family and the Cabinet relocate to [[Elverum]], where the decision is made to send Olav's wife and three children to [[Sweden]] while the King and the Crown Prince remain in country. Just after midnight on 10 April, the German paratroopers [[Battle of Midtskogen|attack a roadblock]] at [[Midtskogen]], and are beaten back by the Norwegian volunteers. At [[Nybergsund]], the Cabinet meets to discuss Bräuer's request to meet with the King alone to end the hostilities. Despite Olav's objections and fears for his father's safety, Haakon agrees, and leaves to meet with Bräuer at Elverum. Bräuer urges Haakon to follow the example of his elder brother, [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian]] of [[Denmark]], to capitulate without further resistance. Haakon relays the German demands to the Cabinet and states he cannot accept Quisling as Prime Minister, offering to abdicate if the Cabinet felt otherwise. Inspired by the King's decision, the Cabinet informs Bräuer of their refusal. In response, the Germans bombard Elverum and Nybergsund, forcing Haakon and the Cabinet to flee into the woods. The King and the Crown Prince eventually escape to Britain, where they remain until the end of the war.

  In the spirit realm, Oogway fights against a [[bull]] adversary named Kai, who has defeated all the other kung fu masters in the realm and taken their [[Qi|chi]]. Oogway too is ensnared and has his chi stolen, but warns Kai that the Dragon Warrior, Po, will stop him. Kai takes this as a challenge to steal the Dragon Warrior's chi and returns to the mortal realm.  Meanwhile, Master Shifu announces his retirement from teaching and passes the role of teacher to Po. An initially excited Po realizes that teaching kung fu is not as easy as he thought, and the Furious Five are injured as a result. Po is demoralized because of his failure, but Shifu advises Po that instead of trying to be a teacher, he should try to be himself. Po returns home where he meets a panda, Li Shan, whom they both realize is his long-lost biological father. They quickly bond with each other, much to the jealousy of Po's adoptive father, Mr. Ping.  After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, Po and the Five defend the Valley of Peace from [[jade]] [[zombie]]s that Kai has created from the chi of past kung fu masters. The team learns through research that Oogway and Kai were once brothers-in-arms. After Oogway was injured in battle Kai carried him to a village of pandas who healed him with their mastery of chi. The pandas then taught Oogway how to utilize chi to help others. Kai on the other hand wanted all the power for himself and tried to steal the panda's chi, forcing Oogway to banish him to the spirit realm. It then reveals that in order to defeat Kai, Po must learn to master the use of chi himself. Li offers to teach him by taking him to his secret panda village. Po and Li travel to the village while Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to deal with Kai; Mr. Ping follows the pandas, worried that he will lose Po's affections to Li. Although Po is eager to learn chi, Li tells him he must first learn the relaxed life of a panda in the village.  Kai takes the chi of nearly every kung fu master in China, including Shifu and the Furious Five except Tigress, who warns the pandas of Kai's intentions. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po demands that Li teach him how to use chi, Li confesses that he does not know how, and that he lied out of fear of losing his son again. Po is hurt over his father's misdirection and isolates himself to train vigorously in preparation for fighting Kai; Mr. Ping, who realizes Po has become happier with Li in his life, encourages Li and the other pandas to stay and ask Po to train them so they can fight back. Tigress confronts Po and tells him that he has no other way of defeating Kai. Realizing what had previously made him fail as a teacher, Po agrees and teaches them to use their everyday activities as their weapons.  Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, who sets the pandas, Ping, and Tigress upon them, distracting Kai. They defeat the jade zombie army, but when Po tries to use his signature Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai to send him back to the spirit realm, Kai reveals that it only works on mortals, not a spirit warrior like himself. Kai gains the upper hand in their fight, but Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold again on himself while gripping Kai, transporting them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, and Kai subdues Po and begins to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po, his friends and family use their chi to empower him. Po harnesses their chi to create a giant dragon figure with which he overloads Kai, killing him and restoring all of the fallen masters to normal.  In an ethereal golden pond, Oogway appears to Po and informs him that his journey as the Dragon Warrior has come full circle, declaring Po to be his successor. By choice, Po wields a mystic jade [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]] staff bestowed by Oogway to return to the mortal world. He and his extended family all return to the valley, where they continue practicing kung fu.  
Kubo and the Two Strings
 In [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu-(who bears a scar over her left eye as the result of sailing accident at the beginning of the film) in a mountain cave near a small village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the townsfolk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and his mother herself cannot recall the ending due to her mental state deteriorating. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his estranged grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.  One day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor while she fights off her sisters before the screen goes black.  Kubo wakes up in a distant land during a [[blizzard]] to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, who has come to life. While taking shelter inside the mangled corpse of a whale, Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of "Little Hanzo", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice in the past.  Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle find the "Sword Unbreakable" in the Hall of Bones, a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]], but they defeat it and escape with the sword. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the "Breastplate Impenetrable" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the "Garden of Eyes", who can entrance its victims with its many eyes by showing secrets and eating them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and kills Karasu-(as shown when her broken mask is floating in the ocean).  They go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the "Helmet Invulnerable" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them. Beetle is killed, and Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.  At the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own lock of hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human being without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' spirits during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden [[Heron|herons]] and fly to the spirit world into the sky.

However, he soon learns from a ''[[Nothronychus]]'' member of his dad's troupe named Wild Arms that his father became stranded in the wilderness when the ''fire mountain'' erupted, leaving the rest of the herd to go on without him. They ask Wild Arms for help, but he belligerently says no. The other grownups agree. After worrying about his father, Littlefoot sets out alone at first. However, the others soon catch up with him. They do fine at first, but run into the ''earth divide''. It is suggested that they follow the ''Long Valley'' instead, but Littlefoot says that that will take too long, and that they must cross there. Luckily, they are able to knock down a tree, and get across.  After two close encounters with a duo of ''[[Yutyrannus|featherhead sharpteeth]]'', night falls and the children go to sleep. Meanwhile, the elder dinosaurs learn about their children's trek, and decide to go after them with two younger ones - Chomper and Ruby. They attempt to have Wild Arms guide them back to where Bron was last seen, but he faints at the mere sight of Chomper, a ''sharptooth'', and has to be carried, leaving Chomper to lead the way with his nose. The next morning, and a disagreement between Littlefoot and Cera on which path to take causes Littlefoot to decide to go ahead alone. A sand cloud (sandstorm) then occurs, and Littlefoot is trapped in a cave, where he meets a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' named Etta, who knows his father. Meanwhile, Cera, Ducky, and Spike lose Petrie, who comes across a tribe of ''diggers''. They soon find him, and they soon leave the diggers, who elect themselves a new leader.  Meanwhile, Etta tells Littlefoot what happened to Bron, and that he may well be dead. She also says that it was because Bron had rescued Wild Arms that he got into that mess. After many failed attempts to dig their way out of the cave, they head deeper into the cave itself, she sings a song to lead him on his way. The rest of the kids, meanwhile, run into a predatory ''[[Carnotaurus]]'', though Etta is able to hit a hole through the cave ceiling and help them get away.

Later, the grownups, plus Chomper and Ruby, come across the Horned Sharptooth (''Carnotaurus'').

Just before the "sharptooth" discovers them, it is distracted by a flock of ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Back at the fire mountain, Etta and the kids spring into action to save Bron. They are able to halt the Flowing Fire by sending water onto it, and use a tree to free Bron, though the flowing fire returns and Littlefoot and his father are trapped on the other side. Bron scoops him up, however, and jumps across the lava, and right after, the adults, Chomper, and Ruby, find them.

John makes a decision to split up and explore an un-mapped route. As he goes deeper into the cave, he gets stuck in a small passageway. As he tries to go back and free himself, he falls into an even smaller hole and passes out.  John wakes up upside down in an 18-inch wide hole and realizes he is completely stuck. He manages to alert Josh to his location, who then tries to pull John out himself but is unsuccessful. Josh, at John's behest, reluctantly leaves him to go get help. While alone, John passes out again due to his upside down position. Hours later, he is woken by Susie, a rescue worker. She tells him many rescuers are on the scene and are doing their best to get him out. Susie then climbs back up to the entrance where she meets with an expert. The expert states that if John is in the tunnel for extended periods of time, his body will begin to shut down. Soon another rescuer, Aaron, is brought to the scene. He has been involved in past rescues that have ended tragically, and he vows to not leave without rescuing John.  Aaron climbs down and finds John, whose condition is starting to deteriorate. He assures John that everything will be all right, and promises him that he'll get out of the cave. John falls asleep and has a vision of his daughter in a field, but with an older man wearing grey clothing, whom he has seen before in hallucinations. He sees him as a threat, and wakes up and suffers a panic attack. Aaron manages to calm him down, but not before John injures himself. John begins to talk to Aaron about his relationship with Emily. His conversation is overshadowed with flashbacks from when he first met Emily to them dating. That night, Josh drives Emily to the entrance of the cave where he convinces the lead rescuers into letting her stay at the entrance.  John's condition continues to worsen as the hours go by. Aaron, Susie and other workers plan to pull John out of the hole by drilling pulleys into the walls and hooking the ropes to his feet. Aaron continues to talk to John, occasionally feeding him lemon-lime Gatorade to keep him hydrated. John continues to tell him about his relationship with Emily, and reveals that when he first proposed to her she declined, and his family did not take to it kindly. He still continued to date her, amid rising tensions between her and his family. A radio is lowered into the cave and John is able to speak with Emily, who reveals she is pregnant. Shortly afterwards, he suffers another panic attack and begs Aaron to get him out of the hole. While talking with Aaron again, they each realize they are of the same religion and both served LDS missions in Spanish speaking countries. They both sing "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing" in Spanish.  The drilling into the walls finish and the attempt to pull John out commences. However, as John is starting to get pulled out, one of the drills come undone, making dirt explode in all directions, and resulting in John falling back in the hole. The workers rescue an injured Aaron, who struggles to get back to the cave, distraught over another failure and the loss of his new friend. Emily mourns at the entrance, and is able to speak with John one last time. Some time later, John suddenly awakens, and to his surprise, has the strength to push himself out of the hole. He calls for Aaron and Susie and finds the pulley ropes. He notices that the injuries he sustained have disappeared. As he finds his way back to the entrance, he finds it deserted and realizes he has died and is now a spirit in the afterlife. Saddened, John goes back into the cave.  In the cave, John encounters another spirit in the form of an infant. As he talks to the baby, he realizes the baby is his soon to be born son. He then reflects on the hallucinations and visions of the boy and man in grey with Emily and Lizzie. He realizes that man was always his son, and tearfully tells the infant to watch over his mother and sister. As he takes the baby from his cradle and exits the cave, the boy is born at a hospital and is placed into Emily's arms, who happily announces that she has named him after John. Epilogue captions state that the cave's entrance has since been sealed, with John's body still inside, and provides a thank you to the rescuers from the family.<ref></ref>

John and his wife Hilary (Amy Kay Raymond) threaten to send his father to a retirement home but his son Taylor (Blaze Tucker) adores his grandfather and resists any effort to send him away. After receiving a letter from Pete, Eagle pulls out his late wife's 1958 [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] and decides to set out to find the surviving members of his old bomber crew.  The cross-country odyssey begins badly when Eagle runs into Romy ([[Kate French]]), a young, gun-toting desperado who is escaping from her abusive partner, Joe Scanlin (William McNamara) with his ill-gotten money. The odd couple create an unlikely team as they search for other crew members, first finding Will Hodges ([[William Morgan Sheppard]]) Eagle's former co-pilot and saving Will from Diamond Jim ([[Jake Busey]]), his domineering boss. The  veterans later meet up with another crew member, Grady Reeves (Richard Riehle), who is suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], and dies in their company.   The two old friends continue their epic trip, with Eagle declaring to Romy,  “Nothing is impossible if you have faith and an open heart.”  Romy soon becomes the catalyst to the plan the two veterans hatch, sometimes getting them in more trouble as the police and Scanlin are hot on their trail.   Discovering an old [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman]] biplane, with Romy's help, the two old pilots are able to get their hands on the controls once more, but their flight ends in a crash. Undeterred, the trio continue to try to find the "last man in the club".   When Eagle, Romy and Will finally locate Pete, he is about to be transferred to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. The trio of veterans, now back in their old uniforms, commandeer a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] at an air museum and take the ancient bomber up once more, rekindling the old memories that were their bond in war.   After the unsanctioned hop, police officers are waiting for the group, taking them all into custody, although even Romy will have an easy time with the authorities, as she turns state's evidence against Scanlin. Eagle ultimately presents Romy with the keys to his wife's car as a gift.

League of Gods
 During the reign of [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]] (Tony Leung Ka-fai), an official enters his bedchamber, and is devoured by the monstrous tails of [[Daji]] (Fan Bingbing), his concubine. Outside their city, several warriors within a metal wagon discuss their strategies to free the Invisible People and their Chief, when [[Jiang Ziya]] (Jet Li) appears to them. He tells them that when King Zhou was younger, he let himself become possessed by the Black Dragon for his quest for power. Jiang Ziya later departs riding his [[Crane (bird)|crane]].  Within the city, King Zhou and Daji hold a festival, and torture the chief of the Invisible People to foretell his future. The chief shows King Zhou a vision of himself pleading for mercy and disintegrating away, causing the King to order his guards to remove the chief's eyes. At the same time, the warriors sneak into a prison and fight several guards, where [[Leizhenzi]] (Jacky Heung), a member of the Wing Adept tribe, uses his powers to destroy the metal bars that seal the Invisible People, even though he was warned not to use them there. His powers attracts [[Shen Gong Bao]]'s (Louis Koo) attention, and he rides on his black leopard to pursue them. Several of the Invisible People are then killed by more guards. Nonetheless, the warriors manage to escape with the Invisible Children, who use their powers to teleport to another location. To stop Shen Gong Bao from advancing any further, Leizhenzi destroys a wall and creates a barrier. As Leizhenzi and [[Ji Fa]] (Andy On) talk, he explains about his past in which his father was killed by an invading army that exterminated most of the Wing Adepts, and his father's wings were torn off his back.  Jiang Ziya arrives to interrupt the festival and stops time, allowing him to free the Invisible chief, and help the warriors and the Invisible Children to escape. As Jiang Ziya avoids Daji's tails, she casts a magic spell at him. To save him, the chief digs out one eye and throws it towards Daji to distract her, but he gets destroyed by her tails instead. Jiang Ziya escapes to his crane with one of the chief's eyes, while the other eye is obtained by Daji.  The warriors return to their capital. Leizhenzi tries to grow wings where King [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] (Zu Feng) requests Jiang Ziya to use the chief's eye to find a way to defeat King Zhou and the Black Dragon. Jiang Ziya answers that it is by using a sword known as the "Sword of Light", which can only be used by the chosen hero "Golden Dragon", and that they must find the sword before the three suns converge, in which the Black Dragon will be released. But while doing so, Jiang Ziya becomes younger, as he warned that Daji cast a spell on him that reverses his age, and for each time he uses his magic the reverse-aging accelerates.  Leizhenzi volunteers to find the sword, and Jiang Ziya tells him that he must take three gifts from the Spring of Life with him. He also summons an egg from the well, out of which [[Ne Zha]] hatches and causes mischief. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha depart into a wasteland, where the first of Jiang Ziya's gifts, a one-eyed plant, gives Leizhenzi advice. Ne Zha plays with the plant, and the three are chased by an legendary desert centipede-like worm, which Leizhenzi kills. Ne Zha steals from Leizhenzi the second gift: a baby Dragon Prince whose growth was stunted by Ne Zha, and it subdues the quickly-grown Ne Zha (Wen Zhang) by breathing a gas on him, making him unconscious while turning him into an adult. Upon waking, Leizhenzi forces him to help him find the Sword of Light, while promising to him that he will help Ne Zha find his Fire Wheels.  Shen Gong Bao constructs and animates an [[automaton]] (Angelababy), and instructs her to find and kill Leizhenzi. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha stumble into a collection of pillars within a marsh, which turn into a palace in a desert, where a hermit (Huang Xiaoming) manipulates sand with magic.Irritated, the hermit attacks them, but is defeated. The hermit is revealed to be [[Erlang Shen]]. Leizhenji gives Erlang Shen the third of Jiang Ziya's gifts: his faithful dog Howling Celestial. Erlang Shen then leaves them to find his Golden Armor.  Leizhenzi and Ne Zha travel to a port, where the former encounters a beautiful woman who entertains children with glowing butterflies, whose name is Lan Die, in reality the automaton. Leizhenzi and Lan Die go find a sorceress [[Taiyi Zhenren]], who uses his dreams to read into his mind. After being woken by the plant, Lan Die steals the artifact that they use as a ship to sail out of the port, and Ne Zha follows. That ship is supposed to sail to any location that its user desires. While in the ship, Ne Zha torments the baby Dragon Prince, who breathes gas on Ne Zha again to put him to sleep and reverting him back to a child. Lan Die and Leizhenzi admire the sunrise, but Shen Gong Bao takes her memories away, revealing her to be an automaton.  Leizhenzi wonders why is the ship going to the middle of the ocean, and the plant answers that it is because someone else, the baby dragon prince, has controlled the ship to return to his father's palace. As the Dragon Prince sings, the [[Ao Guang|Dragon King of the East Sea]] (Waise Lee) hears him and orders his giant octopus to bring Ne Zha and his son back to him. While in the sea palace, Ne Zha demands the Dragon King to return his Fire Wheels to him. The Dragon King orders his guards to attack Ne Zha, but he defeats them by urinating and passing gas at them. The Dragon King gives Ne Zha the Fire Wheels, and is given the baby dragon prince in exchange. With the fire wheels, Ne Zha turns into an adult and flies away.  The ship is now able to fly to Leizhenzi's former home, which is now in ruins. He finds the Sword of Light, which is guarded by several rapidly-moving rings that surround its floating island. Shen Gong Bao arrives with a fleet of flying ships, and subdues Leizhenzi. In exchange for Leizhenzi's life, Lan Die overcomes the rapid rings, and retrieves the sword, but it inadvertently destroys the rings and blows Shen Gong Bao and his fleet away. Leizhenzi grows new wings and carries the dying Lan Die to see the sunset. She turns into a wooden mannequin, and he leaves her to rest at the sword's island, taking the sword with him. As he notices the suns beginning to converge, he hurries with Ne Zha and Erlang Shen (who has found his golden armor) back to the capital, which is now under siege by another fleet of King Zhou's flying ships. As Jiang Jiya struggles to use the city's defense system properly, Daji uses her magic again to revive Shen Gong Bao, which turns him into an invincible monster.  The three heroes return with the Sword of Light to find Jiang Ziya being reverted to a young boy. They fight Shen Gong Bao, who during the fight kills Ji Chang. With his dying breath, Ji Chang passes his command and the sword to his son, Ji Fa. Ji Fa rushes to the Spring of Life and dives in to charge the sword. As the heroes draw Shen Gong Bao into the Spring of Life, Ji Fa emerges as the "Golden Dragon" with his charged sword and new golden armor, and kills the monster.  The movie ends with Ji Fa mobilizing his forces for a counter attack and flies his fortress towards the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang kingdom]], while King Zhou turns into the Black Dragon awaiting for the heroes to attack, with a baby Jiang Ziya in their possession.

Days later, when Jane is briefly distracted while driving, a girl appears in the road. Jane swerves and her car flips. Jane wakes up in the hospital but doesn't know Alan and Alice. A doctor explains that the crash aggravated a childhood head injury, the reason for her missing childhood. Jane is visited by Liam, the hospital's  psychiatrist.

The Legend of Tarzan (film)
 As a result of the [[Berlin Conference]], the [[Congo Basin]] is claimed by King [[Leopold II of the Belgians]], who rules the [[Congo Free State]] in [[personal union]] with the [[History of Belgium#Empire|Kingdom of Belgium]]. The country is on the verge of bankruptcy, Leopold having borrowed huge amounts of money to finance the construction of [[Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|railways]] and other [[infrastructure]] projects. He sends his envoy [[Léon Rom]] ([[Christoph Waltz]]) to secure the fabled diamonds of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]]. Rom's expedition is ambushed and massacred. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga ([[Djimon Hounsou]]), offers Rom the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy: [[Tarzan]].  The man once called "Tarzan", John Clayton III ([[Alexander Skarsgård]]), has left Africa behind and settled down in London with his American-born wife, [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]] ([[Margot Robbie]]), taking up his birth name and ancestral family residence as Lord Greystoke. In the eight years since returning from Africa, John's story as Tarzan has become legendary among the Victorian public, although John himself wishes to leave the past behind him. Through the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] ([[Jim Broadbent]]), John is invited by King Leopold to visit [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] and report on the development of the Congo by Belgium, though Greystoke declines. An American envoy, [[George Washington Williams]] ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), privately reveals his suspicions that Leopold is [[History of slavery|enslaving]] the Congolese population to recoup his debts. Williams persuades John to accept the invitation in order to prove his suspicions. Jane is disappointed when John says that she should not come, as he thinks the trip would be too dangerous, remembering Jane's recent miscarriage and how both his parents died as a result of the jungle's brutality following their shipwreck there — his mother of disease and his father later killed by the [[Mangani]] apes — leaving the baby John to be raised as Tarzan by his Mangani "mother" [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] and "brother" Akut. However, Jane reminds him that she grew up in Africa as well, and misses her home and friends there. John relents, and allows Jane to accompany him.  John, Jane, and Williams take the trip to [[Congo Free State|the Congo]]. There, the trio encounters a tribal village and villagers who knew John and Jane during their previous stay in the jungle. Jane explains to Williams that her husband was once considered an evil spirit by the African tribes, including that of Chief Mbonga. Jane recalls how, when she was younger, she and her father lived in the tribal village helping to care for local children. There she met Tarzan who was made feral and physically enhanced by his life with the apes. The naked ape man saved Jane's life by shielding her from a vicious mangani attack, suffering severe injuries in the process. Jane took the injured Tarzan home, nursed him back to health, and the two fell in love. That night, as the tribe sleeps, Rom and his mercenaries raid the village and kidnap John and Jane and kill [[Muviro|the tribe's leader]]. They then escape to a nearby steamboat with Jane and several of the tribe's members, but Williams is able to rescue John before he can be taken to the boat.  With the aid of the tribe's warriors, John and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured [[slaves]], providing Williams with the evidence he needs to expose King Leopold. They also discover that Rom intends to use the diamonds to pay for a massive army to subdue the Congo, and allow Belgium to mine its wealth for Leopold's benefit. As John and Williams continue onward, John encounters the adult Akut, who is now leader of the apes. Aware that Akut considers him a deserter, John prepares to fight Akut, though he soon loses. That night, as John recovers, Williams recalls the massacres of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] during the [[Indian Wars]], comparing to those of Rom and Leopold.  On Rom's steamboat, Jane dines with Rom, before escaping and swimming to shore. Jane stumbles into a group of mangani apes, where she is rescued by Rom, whose men then shoot and kill many of the apes. John saves the remaining group, reconciling with Akut, before pursuing Rom. He is cornered by Mbonga and his tribe, where it is revealed that John once killed Mbonga's only son for previously killing Kala. A defeated Mbonga tearfully accuses John of lacking honor, as his son was just a young boy when John killed him. John spares Mbonga, just as Akut and the manganis arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom takes Jane and the diamonds to Boma, where he plans to take control of the army. John, Williams and Akut trigger a massive stampede of [[wildebeest]] through Boma, destroying the town and distracting the soldiers, allowing John to rescue Jane. As Rom attempts to escape by boat, Williams sinks it with a machine gun as John swims aboard. Rom incapacitates John by strangling him and then tying him by the neck to the ship's railing, before trying to escape again. John then summons crocodiles with a mating call to devour Rom, before escaping the destroyed vessel himself.  Williams returns to [[England]] and presents the Prime Minister with evidence exposing the [[slave trade]] in the African Congo. One year later, John and Jane have remained in Africa and settled in Jane's father's old house. John  returns to his rightful place among the great apes as Tarzan and finally actualizes his dream of having a [[Korak (character)|child]] with Jane.

As a result, Shaggy and Scooby decide to not eat Scooby Snacks again. After they solve the mystery, the gang goes to the malt shop where Shaggy and Scooby win a hamburger eating contest and win the whole gang a trip to [[Hollywood]].   Once they arrive, they first visit Brickton Studios, an old horror film studio that is about to be closed down. The studio's employee Junior, an avid fan of horror films, welcomes them and offers to give them a tour. Joining them on the tour is Atticus Fink, a developer who wants to buy and level the studio. During the tour, they drive their truck through a dark storage facility, causing Fink to leave. After Fink leaves, a Headless Horseman appears and chases the gang.   After they escape, they go to ask the manager, Chet Brickton, about their encounter. Brickton tells them that all the monsters used to be played by an actor named Boris Karnak, who died years ago and that his ghost may have come back to haunt the studios through various costumes of the monsters he played. In addition to the Headless Horseman, there have also been sightings of a mummy and a zombie, which is why he must sell the studio to Fink to avoid bankruptcy. The gang offers to help Brickton solve the mystery.   First, the gang goes to the set of a romantic comedy film that the studio is currently working on, much to Junior's displeasure. Suddenly the Headless Horseman attacks and ruins the set, making Brickton forlorn. The gang offers to help him finish the movie. Brickton appoints Fred as the director and casts Shaggy in the lead. Brickton then casts TV show talk host Drella Diabolique as the female lead, much to Daphne's dismay. After a long film making process, a mummy attacks and destroys the set.   Later, Fred and Velma go to look for clues, while Drella coaches Daphne on being a movie star. Finding his footage unharmed, Fred decides to continue filming his movie. While shooting a particularly extravagant scene involving a plane, both the Headless Horseman and the zombie appear. After Scooby has a wild ride on the plane and the monsters disappear, Brickton reluctantly signs the studio over to Fink, much to Junior's sadness. Velma mentions that the Headless Horseman and the zombie appeared at the same time, meaning the ghost of Boris Karnak cannot be in two places at once. The gang decides to capture the monsters and solve the mystery.   The gang heads back to the studio and with Drella's help and Fred's elaborate trap, they catch the zombie and the Headless Horseman. The Headless Horseman is revealed to be Fink, who used the costume to get a cheap ownership of the studio. Daphne tells Fink that the evidence of fraud violates the terms of his contract, making it null and void. The zombie is revealed to be Junior, who was also the mummy. Junior tells them that he is actually Boris Karnak Jr., and wanted to carry on his father's legacy. Brickton orders the police to take Fink away and allows Junior to go free, but says that the studio will still have to close down due to lack of a movie. They then realize that the security cameras have recorded the gang being chased by the monsters and decide to make a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] movie. With the studio saved, the movie ends with the gang at the premiere of "Security Cam Monsters: The Adventure Begins".

Unfortunately, this allows Joker to trick Superman into freeing Harley Quinn, Penguin, Poison Ivy and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] from Arkham. Superman calls Cyborg in hopes of gaining assistance to stop the escaped villains.  Back at the vacation site, Batman, Nightwing, and Batgirl end up falling down a waterfall in the cave. During their time falling, Batman explains his past with Deathstroke where Madame Mantis favored a young Bruce Wayne over him. Deathstroke ultimately dropped out due to the fact that Mantis believed Deathstroke was not ready to learn "The Forbidden Move." At the bottom of the waterfall, Batman, Nightwing, and Batgirl uncover an underground kingdom of Trogowogs (a hidden underground race of short, green humanoids which Madame Mantis did not introduce to humanity to avoid corruption). The primitive (yet optimistic, prim and proper) residents immediately attack Batman and co. and Batman ultimately surrenders to Deathstroke when the latter threatens to kill Nightwing and Batgirl. They are then introduced to the Trogowog leader who turns out to be [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], who gained his position with the use of a pink crystal known as the Psyche Stone. Using the Psyche Stone, Bane was able to give the Trogowogs his fury and Deathstroke's fighting skills. All he needs to make them unstoppable is the knowledge of the "Forbidden Move" from Batman's mind since Madame Mantis has too strong of a will.  Back in Gotham City, Superman and Cyborg are easily defeated by Poison Ivy. Superman reluctantly summons Wonder Woman, but Poison Ivy is able to coat all three of them in her pheromones to stun them. By the time the effect wears of, they have been taken to Joker's funhouse where all the escaped villains are present and Scarecrow is able to douse the Justice Leaguers with fear gas, making them cowardly enough for the villains to torment them long enough to put them in molten [[Kryptonite]] and more pheromones to boil them into soup. Robin notices this and goes to save the Justice League.  Back in the Trogowog kingdom, Batman, Nightwing and Batgirl are held in the dungeon, stripped of their utility belts and imprisoned with Madame Mantis and the Trogowogs' cowardly prince Grungle (the only Trogowog not to fall victim of the Psyche Stone). Prince Grungle reveals that the Trogowogs were once a peaceful and friendly race until Bane found out about their kingdom and used the Psyche Stone to teach them hatred and violence. In addition, he killed Grungle's father and locked away Grungle. Luckily for the prisoners, Batman stashed away a brick separator and uses it to break them free. Unfortunately, they are recaptured after Bane threatens to kill them and Batman reluctantly succumbs to the Psyche Stone's power (while repeatedly saying "Dance") and reveals how to use the "Forbidden Move," which involves harnessing one's own [[Qi|chi]] to create a projectile of destructive power.  Back in Gotham City, Robin is able to save the captive Justice League members and they shake off the pheromones. Robin and the Justice League then leave the amusement park, causing the villains to believe that Gotham City is now defenseless and theirs for the taking. Superman apologizes for ignoring Robin's warnings and Robin teaches the Justice League the skills they need to defeat the villains.  In the Trogowog kingdom, the Trogowogs are fed with the knowledge of the "Forbidden Move," and Grungle is held hostage by Bane. When Deathstroke attempts to use the move to kill Batman, he immediately stops himself, believing that using it would be too easy. At that moment, Deathstroke regains his honor, helps Batman, Nightwing, and Batgirl to escape and allies with his former classmates against the Trogowog army. As the Trogowogs are ready to kill Batman and Deathstroke, Batman utters "[[Batusi]]", causing the Trogowogs to dance uncontrollably. It turns out while Batman was under the power of the Psyche Stone, he applied a mental command in addition to the "Forbidden Move." At the same time, Nightwing and Batgirl arrive to free Prince Grungle, but are pinned down by Bane's use of a monolith. This gives Prince Grungle the courage to fight back against Bane and his small size allows him to avoid all attacks from Bane's [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]]-augmented physique. Freeing themselves from the monolith, Nightwing and Batgirl use the Psyche Stone to reveal Prince Grungle's battle with Bane to the other Trogowogs. Prince Grungle is able to defeat Bane by breaking the tubes of his Venom injector, reducing Bane to his normal form.  In Gotham City, Scarecrow, Penguin, and Poison Ivy are defeated by Robin and the Justice League and are put back in Arkham Asylum. Joker and Harley Quinn have managed to tie [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]] to the Bat-Signal until the Justice League arrive, free Commissioner Gordon, and send Joker and Harley back to Arkham as well as confiscate "Spoony" so that Joker can't dig his way out again.  In the Trogowog kingdom, Bane is locked in the dungeon, Prince Grungle is made the new king, and Deathstroke bids farewell to Batman (although he states that the team-up didn't mean they were friends). Batman, Nightwing, and Batgirl use the Psyche Stone to erase the Forbidden Move from the Trogowogs memories and restore them to their normal, peaceful and friendly selves. They then leave back to Gotham and say their goodbyes.  Back in the Batcave, The Justice League and Teen Titans discuss not to mention any of the events that happened while Batman was gone. When Batman, Batgirl and Nightwing do return, Superman confesses. To his surprise, Batman actually congratulates him, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and Robin for putting them back in Arkham. The Justice League and Teen Titans then continue their party.  
The Legend of Shankhadhar
 Shankhadhar catches sight of the porters and is surprised to see the two excavating sand from the river early in the morning. He encounters them again, while they are resting at a sattal—their kharpans stacked with sand lying next to them. When Shankhadhar inquires into where they are hauling the sand to, they inform him of their destination: Bhaktapur.

The Light Between Oceans (film)
 Tom Sherbourne, a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|traumatised and withdrawn]] hero of [[World War I]], is hired as a [[lighthouse keeper|lightkeeper]] at Janus Rock, a lighthouse off the coast of [[Western Australia]]. He falls in love with a local girl, Isabel Graysmark, and they marry in 1921. Isabel loses two pregnancies in three years and fears she may never become a mother.  Shortly after Isabel's second [[miscarriage]], a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes ashore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that regulations require him to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an [[orphanage]] and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own. Tom grudgingly agrees. He buries the man on the island, and the couple names the girl Lucy.  As Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy [[Infant baptism|christened]] on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave bearing the names of Frank Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923. Tom fears that Lucy might very well be Hannah's missing daughter. He writes anonymously to Hannah to tell her that her husband is dead but that her baby is safe and well cared-for.  Four years later, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy, who have enjoyed an idyllic life together, attend a ceremony for the anniversary of Tom's lighthouse, and they strike up a conversation with Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts. They learn that Frank was a German, that Hannah's marrying him so soon after the First World War was controversial, and that he had been accosted in the street by a drunken crowd. He jumped into a rowboat and fled with his baby daughter.   Tormented by his conscience, Tom sends Hannah a small rattle that was found with Lucy on the boat. One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster and reports him to the police.  Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying. Isabel is enraged that Tom is willing to give Lucy away and breaks off contact with him after his arrest.  Lucy is returned to her birth family but initially rejects and hates them, having no memory of them. She refuses to answer to "Grace" and even runs away in an effort to return to the lighthouse.  The police accuse Tom of murdering Frank and are unable to draw an answer from the distraught Isabel as to whether or not Frank was dead when they discovered him. Lucy runs away to look for the lighthouse, and a search team is sent to rescue her. She is found and returned to Hannah, but the events lead Hannah to realize that Lucy now belongs to Isabel.   Hannah promises to return Lucy to Isabel as soon as Isabel testifies against Tom. Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, confiding he had not deserved his happiness with Lucy and how carrying the blame will assuage his [[survivor guilt|guilt for surviving the war]].   Isabel jumps on the boat and confesses everything. Moved by their gesture and reminded by Frank's words to always forgive others, Hannah offers to speak on their behalf at trial. Lucy has at last begun to bond with her biological mother and grandfather, who agrees to call her "Lucy-Grace" as a compromise.  In 1950, an adult Lucy-Grace Rutherford, accompanied by her baby son Christopher, tracks Tom down. She has not been in contact with the Sherbournes for over twenty years, as they had agreed not to contact her for the rest of her childhood. Isabel has recently died, still tormented with guilt for her actions, and Tom gives Lucy-Grace a letter that Isabel had written in case Lucy ever made contact. An emotional Lucy-Grace thanks Tom, the only father she knew, for rescuing and raising her for the few years on Janus, and they promise to stay in touch.  
Lights Out (2016 film)
 In a textile factory, an employee named Esther encounters a silhouette of a woman when the lights are off, but cannot see it when the lights are on. She warns her boss Paul. After she leaves, Paul encounters the woman and notices that she will not come into the light. He is killed by the woman after she chases him through the factory.  A short time later, a young woman named Rebecca is called into the school nurse’s office of her brother, Martin. Rebecca and Martin are half-siblings, sharing the same mom: Sophie. The nurse was unable to get in touch with Sophie to inform her that Martin has been falling asleep in class lately. An official from Child Protective Services questions Rebecca about Martin’s living conditions. Rebecca tells the official Sophie has depression, and is taking antidepressants. Rebecca also tells the official Paul was her stepfather, and that her real father ran away when she was a child.  Rebecca and her boyfriend, Bret, take Martin to Sophie’s house. Martin tells Rebecca that Sophie has been talking to a woman named “Diana”. Rebecca assures Martin that Diana isn’t a real person, and that she had also heard Sophie talk to the imaginary Diana when she was a child. Rebecca gets in an argument with Sophie when she realizes her mom is not taking her medication, so she takes Martin to her apartment so he can rest.  That night, Rebecca is woken by the same woman that killed Paul after she notices her scratching at the floor. Rebecca narrowly escapes an attack from the woman when she turns the lights on and the woman disappears. The next morning, Rebecca notices the word “Diana” has been scratched into her floor, along with a stick figure drawing of a woman. Rebecca has a flashback to when she found the same name and drawing as a child, and realizes Diana is real.  While her mom is running errands, Rebecca sneaks into Sophie's house and finds a box of medical records and other research in Paul’s office. Paul's findings reveal that Sophie was admitted to a mental hospital as a child. While there, she befriended a young patient named Diana. Diana suffered from a severe skin condition, and was accidentally killed by the hospital staff when they performed surgery on her under intense light. Rebecca also learns that Diana was admitted to the mental hospital after her dad committed suicide, and that it was believed that Diana was able to "get into people's heads".  Rebecca, Bret, and Martin stage an intervention at Sophie’s house about how Diana’s spirit is haunting them all. Sophie becomes irate, says she won’t abandon her friend, then locks herself in her bedroom. The team decides to stay the night at Sophie’s, intending to get her help in the morning. To avoid an attack from Diana during the night, they rig the house to be as brightly lit as possible. This proves to be useless when Diana cuts the power to the neighborhood. Diana traps Rebecca and Martin in the basement, and attempts to kill Bret. Bret escapes Diana, and drives to get help from the police. In the basement, Rebecca finds a black light while searching for light sources to brighten the basement. When Rebecca clearly sees Diana with the black light, she realizes it’s not powerful enough to harm her.  Bret returns with two police officers. The officers free Martin and Rebecca from the basement, only to be murdered by Diana. As they’re fleeing the house, Rebecca remembers Sophie is still in her bedroom. As she climbs the stairs to retrieve her mom, Diana tells Rebecca that she killed Rebecca’s father years ago. Diana throws Rebecca off the second floor landing. As Diana prepares to kill Rebecca, Sophie appears, with a gun from one of the dead officers. Sophie realizes she is the tether for Diana to exist in the real world, and commits suicide. As Sophie falls to the floor, Diana vanishes.  Later, Bret comforts Martin and Rebecca in an ambulance outside of Sophie’s house. The three of them appear to be slightly spooked when the ambulance lights flicker.  
The Limehouse Golem
  A series of murders has shaken the community of [[Limehouse]] in [[Victorian London]] to the point where people believe that only a legendary creature from dark times – the mythical so-called [[Golem]] – must be responsible. When music-hall star Elizabeth Cree is accused of poisoning her husband John on the same night as the last Golem murders, assigned Inspector John Kildare discovers evidence linking John Cree to the Golem murders, and finds himself determined to crack both cases before Elizabeth is hanged for her accused crime.  Having found a diary of the Golem's crimes, written by the Golem himself in a book on the art of murder, kept in the reading room of the library, Kildare determines that the Golem must be one of the four men in the library on the date of the last entry; [[Dan Leno]], [[Karl Marx]], [[George Gissing]] and John Cree. Kildare acquires handwriting samples of the other three men while listening to Elizabeth's story about how she was the daughter of an unmarried mother and went from sewing sail-cloths at the docks to becoming a music-hall star.  When Elizabeth’s abusive mother died, she befriended Dan Leno and fell in with his music-hall troupe, performing bawdy comic songs while dressed as a man. Her act quickly becomes second in popularity only to Leno himself, but she aspires to also become a dramatic actor. John Cree, a struggling playwright, begins trying to woo her, offering her a leading part in his new play. She does not respond to his advances but her fellow performer, Aveline Ortega ([[María Valverde]]), becomes jealous and sabotages her first dramatic role.  Elizabeth is entrapped by the theatre’s owner, a man known as ‘Uncle’([[Eddie Marsan]]), and is forced to pose nude for photographs and to beat him for his sexual gratification. She tells John, who offers to marry her and keep her safe. Elizabeth accepts, and Kildare notes that Uncle died suddenly only days later, leaving the theatre to Dan Leno. John’s career stalls, and he grows bitter towards Elizabeth, who supports him financially, eventually beginning an affair with Aveline and suspending work on ‘’Misery Junction’’ to spite Elizabeth. The two remained estranged until John Cree’s poisoning.   Kildare finally finds a handwritten copy of the play written by Cree before his death on the day that Elizabeth is to be hanged.  He gets an hour's postponement to her sentence, hoping that revealing John Cree's crimes will cause her sentence to be commuted. However, after speaking with Elizabeth, Kildare realizes that ''she'' is the true Golem rather than her husband. She killed 'Uncle', and then began committing murders as the Golem to make a lasting name for herself, poisoning her husband when he found evidence of her crimes.   Broken at this revelation, Kildare delays announcing the revelation that Cree was the Golem to the press until after Elizabeth is hanged, granting her the 'fame' of eliminating the Golem rather than the greater fame of being a killer. In the final scene, Dan Leno's troupe perform John's play, rewritten to tell Elizabeth's life story, but Aveline Ortega, playing the part of Elizabeth, dies accidentally during the hanging scene. Leno covers up the death and takes the curtain call dressed as Elizabeth, and we see Elizabeth take a bow on stage with him, using Leno's catchphrase: "Here we are again!"

 After his elderly father dies, Brian Jardine ([[Greg Kinnear]]) moves his wife Kathy ([[Jennifer Ehle]]) and 13-year-old son Jake ([[Theo Taplitz]]) into a [[Brooklyn]] apartment they have inherited. The two-story building has a tenant in the ground-level space; a dress shop run by Leonor Calvelli ([[Paulina Garcia]]) and her 13-year-old son Tony ([[Michael Barbieri (actor)|Michael Barbieri]]). Jake and Tony become fast friends despite having very different personalities. Jake is quiet and reserved and spends much of his time sketching or painting, whereas Tony is talkative and gregarious.

Jake decides he wants to attend the same school for his painting. The boys bond through everyday activities like skating around the borough, attending a teen [[rave]], and giving their respective parents the [[silent treatment]] when disagreements occur. Tony even starts (and gets the worst of) a fight with his classmates when they insult Jake's sexuality.  The Jardines discover that Brian's father has been charging Leonor an unusually small rent on her store. Since Brian's acting career is stagnant and the family is almost entirely supported by Kathy's work as a psychotherapist, they inform Leonor that her rent will need to be tripled, still placing it below market value for the changing neighborhood. Leonor makes emotional appeals to Brian, claiming that she and his father were close friends and that he would want Brian to be generous to her. Brian is reluctant to take direct legal action against Leonor, partly due to the fact that he's simply glad his introverted son has finally made a friend. After receiving an ultimatum from his sister Audrey ([[Talia Balsam]]), he formally evicts the Calvellis.  Jake is devastated and tearfully pleads Tony's case, but is made to face reality. Brian encourages Jake to return his focus to his art and his upcoming application to LaGuardia. Some time later, Jake accompanies a group of fellow art students on a museum visit and is surprised to see Tony and some of his classmates on a tour.

Rehana Abidi ([[Plabita Borthakur]]), a fresher in college, lives in the same neighborhood and sews [[Burqa|burkhas]] for her family's store. She steals make-up to wear at college, where she takes off the burkha which she is forced to wear and transforms into a jeans-wearing singer who loves [[Miley Cyrus]].   Leela ([[Aahana Kumra]]), a young beautician who runs her own parlour and Shireen Aslam ([[Konkona Sen Sharma]]), a burkha-wearing house-wife, also reside in the neighborhood. Leela wishes to travel the world with her secret lover, Arshad ([[Vikrant Massey]]), who runs a small photo studio. She frequently arranges meetings with professional destination wedding businesses and offers her make-up services and Arshad's photography, in hopes of free world-wide travel for both of them. Shireen is a mother to three boys and secretly works as a door-to-door sales-girl. Her husband Rahim ([[Sushant Singh]]) is sexually dominating and forbids the use of contraceptives, due to which she gets multiple secret abortions and repeatedly takes emergency contraceptives to prevent more pregnancies. Rahim maintains a cold attitude towards Shireen and uses her only to please his sexual urges, while she yearns for his affection.  Rehana decides to audition for her college's band and catches the attention of Dhruv ([[Shashank Arora]]), the band's drummer, only to be snubbed by popular girl Namrata. She decides to participate in the ongoing protest against the ban on jeans and openly expresses her opinion on the oppression of women. Later, Rehana is pleasantly surprised when Namrata invites her to a weekend house party. To prepare for the event, Rehana steals a dress and boots from the mall. Usha arranges for Leela's marriage with a man named Manoj ([[Vaibhav Tatwawaadi]]), at the request of Leela's impoverished mother ([[Sonal Jha]]). On the day of her engagement, during a power outage, Leela has sex with Arshad and films it on her cellphone. Her mother catches her in the act and scolds her for tarnishing their reputation but manages to cover up the situation. It is revealed that Leela's mother makes her living as a nude model for art students. Usha takes the children of her relatives for their swimming lessons, where she is pranked by one of them and almost drowns in the pool. She is rescued by the swimming instructor Jaspal ([[Jagat Singh Solanki]]), who calls her by her real name and suggests that she take swimming lessons. Usha begins to fantasize about Jaspal and buys a swimsuit to begin taking lessons from him. She eventually engages in phone sex with him, under the alias of "Rosy", while he is under the impression that she is Komal, a young girl who takes lessons from him. Shireen is told by her doctor that she has an infection in her uterus and that she should only use condoms as a contraceptive. She discreetly buys them in chocolate-flavour from the pharmacy, but her husband Rahim refuses to use them while they are having sex.  At Shireen's workplace, her colleague urges her to tell Rahim about her job so that she can secure a promotion and work full-time in an office. Meanwhile, Rehana attends the house party and while she is drunk, becomes affectionate with Dhruv. She also discovers that Namrata is pregnant. Leela arrives late to a business meeting scheduled with Arshad, who is angered that she is distracted by Manoj and becomes upset with her. She still plans on eloping with Arshad after she realizes that Manoj wishes to keep her as a mundane housewife. Rehana is arrested alongside other college students as she participates in another protest against the jeans ban; however, she manages to handle the situation and receives only a warning from her strictly religious father. Leela tries to convince Arshad to elope with her but he rebukes her and simultaneously, her mother prepones her wedding to the day after [[Diwali]]. In her attempts to confront Rahim about her job, Shireen discovers that he is cheating on her with a woman whom he meets regularly at a café. She watches as he treats the woman affectionately and she follows the woman to her home, where she subtly warns her to keep a distance from Rahim and introduces herself as his wife. Usha, feeling confident in Jaspal's positive response to their phone relationship, invites him to the community's Diwali festival. Rehana also decides to go on a date with Dhruv at the same festival, while Namrata is shown to be recovering from an abortion.  Leela attends the festival with Manoj and successfully evokes jealousy in Arshad by kissing Manoj at his photo booth. Arshad fervently kisses Leela when Manoj leaves to get snacks and promises that he will elope with her. Despite this, she attempts to get over him and tries to have sex with Manoj inside the car, who foils her attempt by proclaiming that he wishes to wait until their wedding night. While waiting for Leela, Manoj discovers her sex tape with Arshad and accuses her of cheating, thereby breaking off their engagement.   Rehana passionately kisses Dhruv, while police search for her and find her with Namrata's help. They reveal footage from the mall's security cameras, proving Rehana's theft and arrest her. Dhruv immediately distances himself from Rehana and Namrata reveals that Dhruv was responsible for her pregnancy. Rehana is bailed by her father, who tells her he is ashamed of her and forbids her from returning to college.   As Shireen is receiving her promotion, Rahim steps in to coldly congratulate her before he takes her home and rapes her as punishment for resisting him and approaching the woman he secretly meets. He then mocks her and tells her to quit her job and stay at home.   Usha decides to wear a sleeveless blouse and sari. She gets her armpits waxed with the help of Leela and gets her grey hair dyed black. She looks at herself in the mirror and feels young and eagerly wants to meet Jaspal. Usha spends some time with Jaspal, who eagerly searches for Komal and departs from Usha. He is bewildered when he tries to flirt with Komal and she responds by publicly shaming him. Jaspal realizes that Usha is "Rosy" when he finds her novel by the swimming pool and confronts her family members, accusing her of sexually exploiting him. They raid Usha's room and condemn her for ruining their reputation before they throw her erotic novels and swimsuit on the street as the neighbourhood watches.   Rehana, Leela and Shireen help Usha gather her belongings from the road and Usha asks Rehana to finish reading the last few pages of ''Lipstick Dreams''. The four ladies reflect on each of their repressions as they pass a cigarette amongst them and revel in their collective desire for freedom.

Live by Night (film)
 In 1926, Joe Coughlin ([[Ben Affleck]]), a [[World War I]] veteran of Irish descent and the prodigal son of [[Boston]] [[police captain]] Thomas Coughlin ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), falls in love with Emma Gould ([[Sienna Miller]]), the mistress of notorious gangster Albert White ([[Robert Glenister]]), the boss of the Irish Gang of Boston. Thomas objects to the relationship and advises Joe against his criminal activities, warning him that his wrongdoing will catch up with him eventually.  White's rival, [[Italian Mafia]] boss Maso Pescatore ([[Remo Girone]]), finds out about their affair and blackmails Joe to kill White. Joe refuses but he and Emma decide to flee to California. To fund the trip, Joe commits a bank heist with his partner Dion Bartolo ([[Chris Messina]]), during which three police officers are killed in an ensuing chase. When Joe tries to leave with Emma anyway, she lures him into a trap set by White. Joe is brutally beaten by White and his men and nearly killed before the police arrive and arrest Joe for the policemen's murders.  Thomas tells Joe that Emma drowned while being pursued by police. He also blackmails Chief Inspector Calvin Bondurant ([[Clark Gregg]]) to ensure that Joe is sent to prison on a relatively minor charge rather than murder. Two weeks before Joe's release, Thomas dies of a heart attack. Wanting revenge against White, Joe volunteers his services to Pescatore and is recruited as an enforcer for Pescatore's rum empire in [[Ybor City]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], which is under attack by White. Joe reconnects with Dion and together they protect Pescatore's business in the area and receive orders to bring gambling and drugs into Tampa. Joe also develops a relationship with Graciela Corrales ([[Zoe Saldana]]), the sister of a local [[Cuba]]n businessman, and they are soon married.  Joe befriends Sheriff Irving Figgis ([[Chris Cooper]]). Irving's daughter Loretta ([[Elle Fanning]]) heads to Hollywood to become an actress, but instead becomes a heroin-addicted prostitute. Irving's brother-in-law, R. D. Pruitt ([[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]]), a member of the local chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], starts bombing Joe's clubs and killing his men. Joe promises Irving to help get Loretta off drugs and back to Ybor City in exchange for his betrayal of Pruitt. Joe kills Pruitt and, in the ensuing mob war with the Klan, he and his men beat or kill enough Klansmen to weaken the group's standing in Florida.  Recognizing that [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] will eventually come to an end and unwilling to follow Pescatore's orders to invest in narcotics, Joe focuses on building a casino near Sarasota. He intends to persuade the government to legalize gambling, but Loretta, who has become a devout Christian under her father's strict and punishing discipline, begins preaching that alcohol and gambling are against God's word. Her ministry is popular enough that the government decides not to legalize gambling. Joe recognizes that Pescatore will be enraged, particularly since Joe still refuses to invest in narcotics.  During a private meeting in a restaurant, Loretta confides to Joe that she does not truly believe in God and her sins cannot be forgiven. The next day, Joe is despondent to learn that Loretta committed suicide. While visiting his brother-in-law, an amateur photographer, Joe finds a recent picture of Emma, whom he believed to be dead. He decides to pursue her in [[Miami]], but only after informing Graciela first, much to Dion's dismay.  Pescatore forms an alliance with White and lures Joe into a meeting at a hotel, intending to have him killed and replaced by White in retaliation for Joe's recent failures. Anticipating Pescatore's betrayal, Joe distracts White by showing him Emma's picture, as White also believed her to be dead. Dion and his men ambush Pescatore's men through a series of underground tunnels that Joe used to move rum. Joe kills White, Pescatore and Pescatore's son, Digger ([[Max Casella]]). Joe names Dion as his successor before locating Emma at a brothel in Florida. She relates how she faked her death to escape from White and enjoys her newfound freedom, and claims she never reciprocated Joe's love for her.  Joe and Graciela move to Miami, where they have a son and spend their days building houses for the impoverished. Driven insane by Loretta's death, Figgis tracks them down and shoots up their house, killing Graciela before being fatally shot by Joe. Joe arranges for Graciela to be buried in her homeland in Cuba and spends the rest of his days dedicated to charity and to raising Tommy, who soon voices his desire to become a police officer.

London Has Fallen
 Western intelligence services of the [[Group of Eight|G8]] track down Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi ([[Alon Abutbul|Alon Moni Aboutboul]]) as the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks, and authorize an American drone strike on Barkawi's compound, apparently killing Barkawi and his family.  Two years later, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] James Wilson suddenly dies, and arrangements are made for the Western world leaders to attend his funeral in London. Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs ([[Angela Bassett]]) assigns agent Mike Banning ([[Gerard Butler]]), a close friend of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Benjamin Asher ([[Aaron Eckhart]]), to lead Asher's security detail while overseas, even though Banning's wife Leah ([[Radha Mitchell]]) is due to give birth to their child in a few weeks. The entourage arrives via [[Air Force One]] at [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted Airport]], and Banning pushes their arrival at [[Somerset House]] in London via [[Marine One]] to earlier. As Asher's [[Presidential State Car (United States)|Presidential State Car]] arrives at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a series of coordinated attacks by terrorists disguised as [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], the [[Queen's Guard]]smen, and other [[first responders]] erupts, killing the other Western leaders, damaging or destroying major landmarks and generating mass panic. Asher's early arrival has thrown the attack on him at St. Paul's off-guard, and Banning is able to rescue Asher and Jacobs and rushes them back to Marine One. As the helicopter and its escorts takes off, terrorists fire [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]] at them, destroying the escorts and forcing the damaged helicopter to crash-land in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Banning and Asher suffer only minor wounds, but Jacobs is fatally injured, and she makes Banning promise to stay alive for his unborn child and get back at whomever did this. Banning quickly escorts Asher into the [[London Underground]] as the city's power is lost and people take shelter in their homes.  In Washington, D.C., [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] Allan Trumbull ([[Morgan Freeman]]) works with the British authorities to investigate the incident while trying to track down the President. Trumbull receives a call from Barkawi, still alive after all and operating out of [[Yemen]]. The man takes responsibility for the attacks, coordinated by his son Kamran ([[Waleed Zuaiter]]). Barkawi purposely had Wilson poisoned to lure the Western leaders to London to attack them. Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that if Kamran captures him, he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet. Trumbull orders his intelligence staff to locate Barkawi's known operatives to find any connection to the attack, while British authorities have all first responders stand down, so that any left in the open can be identified as terrorists.  After leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite tracking, Banning leads Asher to an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] safe-house, where Jacqueline "Jax" Marshall ([[Charlotte Riley]]) briefs them on what their intelligence has learned. Marshall receives a voice message from Trumbull that confirms they saw Banning's sign and that an extraction team is en route. Security monitors show the approach of a [[Delta Force]] team, but Banning suspects they have arrived far too soon and may be more terrorists. He covers and fights off the terrorists before Asher and Banning drive away, but their car is struck by a truck driven by terrorists, allowing them to kidnap Asher. Banning is rescued by the extraction team, a combined Delta Force/[[Special Air Service|S.A.S.]] squad. They also suspect that there is a mole in the British government.  Trumbull's staff have identified a building in London owned by one of Barkawi's companies, which still appears to be drawing massive amounts of power despite supposedly being under construction and unoccupied, and suspect it is Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building and stop Kamran before he can kill Asher. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall has worked with British authorities to restore London's security system and, discovering that MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster ([[Patrick Kennedy (actor)|Patrick Kennedy]]) aided in Barkawi's attack, she kills him. Meanwhile, Trumbull contacts Barkawi to tell him that his plan failed, and then to look outside, moments before the building is destroyed by another drone strike, killing him.  Two weeks after the attack on London, Banning is home spending time with Leah and their newborn child, named Lynne after his deceased boss. He sits in front of his laptop and contemplates sending his letter of resignation. On TV, Trumbull speaks regarding the recent events, leaving an inspiring message that the U.S. will prevail. This convinces Banning to delete the letter.

The Lost City of Z (film)
 Ireland, 1905: [[Percy Fawcett]] is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]. A skilled horseman and marksman, he brings down the stag swiftly but is snubbed at the after-hunt party. A year later, Fawcett is sent to London to meet with officials of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS). The governments of [[Bolivia]] and [[Brazil]] are nearly at war over the location of [[Bolivia–Brazil border|their mutual boundary]] and its direct effect on the region's extremely lucrative rubber trade, and have asked the British government to survey it. Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. Aboard a ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the [[Amazon rainforest]]. At a large [[natural rubber|rubber plantation]] in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron de Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a city in the jungle covered in gold and full of people. Fawcett dismisses such stories as insane ravings, but discovers highly advanced broken pottery and some small stone statues in the jungle that convince him of the veracity of Tadjui's story.  Fawcett is praised upon his return, where his wife, Nina, has given birth to their second son. In the [[Trinity College Library]], Nina discovers a [[conquistador]] text which tells of a city deep in the Amazonian jungle. Fawcett meets the renowned biologist [[James Murray (biologist)|James Murray]], who agrees to back Fawcett's expedition to the Amazon to find what Fawcett calls "the [[Lost City of Z]]". Fawcett attempts to convince the members of the RGS to back the expedition, but is publicly ridiculed. Nevertheless, the RGS backs the expedition to further exploration of the Amazon basin. Murray, unfamiliar with the rigors of the deep jungle, slows the party down significantly. Fawcett's party is attacked while traveling along the river. However, Fawcett makes peace with the natives. Murray suffers a leg injury which becomes severely infected, and begins to go mad. Fawcett sends him off with a native guide and the group's last pack animal to find aid. Fawcett's team are forced to abandon the expedition after discovering that Murray poured [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] on their remaining supplies.  Murray survives and, in front of the RGS trustees, accuses Fawcett of abandoning him in the jungle. Fawcett elects to resign from the society rather than apologize. [[World War I]] breaks out in Europe, and Fawcett goes to France to fight. Manley dies in the trenches at the [[Battle of the Somme]], and Fawcett is temporarily blinded in a chlorine gas attack. Jack, Fawcett's eldest son—who had long accused Fawcett of abandoning the family—reconciles with his father as he recovers.  In 1923, Fawcett is living in obscurity in Britain. North American interest in exploring the Amazon has reached fever pitch, primarily due to Fawcett's stories of the lost city. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and a consortium of US newspapers finance a new expedition by Fawcett. The RGS co-funds the expedition at the last moment to maintain British pride. Fawcett shows Sir [[John Scott Keltie]] a compass, informing Keltie that should he (Fawcett) find the lost city, the compass will be sent back to Britain. Fawcett and his son intend to go alone this time, traveling as light as they can for up to three years in order to find "Z". Fawcett invites Costin, but he declines. Fawcett and Jack are attacked by natives and escape, only to be ambushed again. This second tribe gives the Fawcetts a fair hearing, but are puzzled by them, noticing that their spirits aren't wholly of their own world but also not wholly of the Amazon. They declare that the spirits of the Fawcetts "must belong" somewhere and they will help them find their rightful place. Fawcett and Jack are drugged during a ceremony and carried away.  Some years later, Nina Fawcett meets with Keltie, claiming she has heard that Fawcett and Jack are still alive and are living among tribespeople. The RGS, having sent more than a hundred people to search for Fawcett in the intervening years, declines to send another expedition. Keltie advises Nina to come to terms with her husband's death, but she refuses. Nina instead opens her purse, to give Keltie the compass Fawcett had promised to send were he to have found the lost city.  
Love & Friendship

But Reginald says their relationship is not romantic. However, it is not long before he and Lady Susan have reached an understanding.  Meanwhile, Lady Susan's daughter, Frederica, who has been attending a boarding school which her mother cannot afford, runs away and is then expelled. Frederica arrives at Churchill and, shortly thereafter, is followed by Sir James Martin, a man who is both very wealthy and very foolish. For example, upon arrival at Churchill, he explains that he struggled to find the estate as he had been looking for "church hill", a church and/or a hill. Later, he mentions the "Twelve Commandments" and when told there are only ten, he wonders which two should be disregarded.  While in London, Lady Susan's relationship with Lord Manwaring suddenly explodes into scandal.

Sir James goes on to speak fondly of his newfound friend and long-term house-guest, Lord Manwaring, who was invited to stay by Lady Susan, and with whom he shares a love of hunting. Lord Manwaring, says Sir James, is someone who always enjoys hunting game of whatever merit, both "large and small".  
Lost in the Pacific
 The year is 2020, two armed soldiers pass through the dark forest of Fortune Island, a seemingly deserted island in the middle of the Pacific. Suddenly, something in the darkness catches their attention, they scream in terror On the other side of earth, the owner of Ocean Airlines, Mr. Gary Gao, launches the maiden voyage of his luxurious new passenger aircraft, the state-of-the-art, A390. The trip begins in Rio and much fanfare will await the aircraft's arrival in Hong Kong. The VIP guests on board include billionaire Prince Khadsa of Saudi Arabia, famed pop singer Colin, award-winning Hong Kong actress Lily Young, retired American sports star Rodman, renowned journalist, Mia Ren and her cameraman, Bob, of International News Web, celebrated Sichuan chef Mr. Liu, and the acclaimed blind cellist Kim Woo Nam.  Unbeknownst to all but himself, Gary and Ocean Airlines are in dire straits financially and Gary intends to confirm Prince Khadsa's proposed investment during the flight to save the company. Soon after takeoff it is learned that Chef Liu became ill and could not make the flight. Chef Liu has sent Mike, a handsome American, to replace him. As a Sichuanese, Ruoxin, the beautiful and decisive Co-Captain, doubts if this clumsy westerner can make proper Sichuan food, so she keeps finding fault with him. While everybody is enjoying the many amenities of the luxury flight, the aircraft passes through a major thunderstorm over the Pacific and gets struck by lightning. The crew, fearing the plane has been damaged, wants to land somewhere as soon as possible to inspect the aircraft. At first Gary, who wants to reach Hong Kong in record time, resists the crew's insistence on landing and tells them to push on at any cost. Eventually Gary decides to allow the crew to land the plane on the seemingly deserted Fortune Island, so they can see if there has been any irreparable damage. To avoid any notice of the emergency landing, Gary turns off the plane's location tracker.  Despite the tremendous storm, the crew successfully lands the A390 on the island. While the passengers have been ordered to stay on the plane, Ruoxin and Captain Jason Anderson go outside to inspect the engines. When they are about to return inside, Ruoxin discovers that journalist Mia Ren and her cameraman have secretly slipped out of the cabin and are now under attack from horrifically terrifying, unknown creatures. Suddenly, a multitude of black shadows jump out of the bush and kill Cpt. Jason and the cameraman. When Ruoxin and Mia Ren are about to be ripped to shreds by the creatures, gunshots are heard and they are momentarily saved. The bullets are from two armed soldiers moving swiftly in a jeep. The soldiers rescue the people on the ground and they all get on the plane together. The soldiers are Vincent Rigs and Nikki Lee. They claim to have been sent by the Army to eliminate the monsters that are inhabiting the island. When the A390's radio communications system is discovered to be badly damaged, Vincent suggests re-routing the flight to an Army coordination point in the Pacific.  It turns out that chef Mike was a formerly Special Ops and he recognizes that Vincent and Nikki are not who they say they are. He doubts the validity of the coordination points, but neither Ruoxin nor Gary believes him. In the meantime, a series of dreadful events happen, one after another. First, Peter is killed for discovering Vincents true identity, then Lily Young and an air hostess are killed by one of the creatures that has managed to get on the plane. Facing the panic and the rebellion from the now-convinced Ruoxin and Mike, Vincent and Nikki reveal their true purpose, proceed to hijack the plane, and take everyone onboard hostage. The so-called destination is a retired Nimitz aircraft carrier. After several tries Ruoxin dramatically lands the plane on the carrier, clipping the wing as she does so. Most of the survivors reach the deck, while the broken A390 slides off the carrier and sinks into the ocean.  Vincent asks Nikki to watch the hostages, while he goes below deck to find Dr. Han who has promised him $10 Million for a soil sample from the cave that the creatures inhabit. The fact that there seems to be no other people on the carrier makes Vincent nervous. Vincent finds Han who tells him that the experiment went out of control and the creatures had mutated, killed everyone else on the carrier, and were now reproducing. Dr. Han reveals to Vincent that as a last ditch effort he has rigged the carrier's nuclear power engine to explode to destroy the experiment and the creatures. Vincent quickly realizes that he will need to stop the explosion from happening if he is to live and ever see the $10 Million. On his way to the engines he is stopped by Mike and after a heated fight, Vincent is dead.  Ruoxin successfully starts the ignition of a helicopter on the deck of the carrier. Mike makes his way back up to the deck and narrowly jumps onto the helicopter as it leaves the ground. As the helicopter flies far away from the carrier, a huge mushroom cloud arises from the horizon, the carrier, experiment, and creatures have been destroyed.

He is a disciplined person and always tries to make his relatives behave in the same way. To avoid bad remarks from the society about his family, he sets up a family constitution of discipline. His mania for discipline is such big that if any one of his family members commit 100 Mistakes, that person would be banished from the family and that mistake can be anything which Shibo Prasad hates which includes laughing out loudly. Thus all of the family members maintain a disciplinary life to avoid being banished from the house. In detail, the family consists of Shibo Prasad's wife Aparna, an Asthma patient; his daughter Kavita, his son in law Vikas and their kids.

Chinnarasu and Kittu try to fight against the rampant caste discrimination meted out to them by the upper caste people, but are unable to do much about it as the police and courts are biased towards the upper castes. One day, Kittu sees his classmate Gomathi ([[Sri Divya]]), who is from the upper caste, discriminate against a Dalit girl. He admonishes her publicly for her act of caste discrimination, which makes her repent her behaviour. Gomathi eventually falls in love with Kittu, but Kittu maintains a distance as they are from different castes, though he too is in love with her.  When the news spreads through the village that Gomathi is in love with Kittu, upper caste men kill Gomathi's father and frame Kittu, who is imprisoned, but is soon released on bail as there is no evidence that he had killed Gomathi's father. Kittu then assaults the village inspector Selvaraj ([[Harish Uthaman]]), who holds a grudge against the Dalits and was responsible for framing him for the death of Gomathi's father. In retribution, Selvaraj arrests Kittu and thrashes him mercilessly in the police station. Kittu does not return home the next morning, despite Selvaraj's pleas that he had released him, prompting the villagers to think that Selvaraj had killed Kittu while in custody as his hatred towards the Dalits is well known in the village. The Dalits led by Chinnarasu protest outside the police station, leading to Selvaraj's suspension.  However, it is then revealed that Kittu had not gone "missing" but is living in a tribal village near [[Kodaikanal]] as part of a plan hatched by Kittu and Chinnarasu to expose the upper caste men involved in the death of Gomathi's father, with Kittu deciding to return to the village after he is cleared of all involvement in the murder. Gomathi, who is aware that Kittu had not killed her father, finds out Kittu's location and runs away from her home to be with him. At this juncture, the upper caste men and the police find out that Kittu is alive and in hiding and leave for Kodaikanal to capture Kittu and bring him back to the village with the intention to imprison Kittu, humiliate Chinnarasu and reclaim their domination over the Dalits. Kittu finds out about their plan and asks Gomathi to return to the village, promising to marry her once he is cleared of all charges.  Sadly, Kittu and Gomathi never reunite as Kittu had decided to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff in order to save the reputation to Chinnarasu and expose the upper caste discrimination against the Dalits. He is found dead by the police, which exposes the upper caste hatred towards the Dalits.

Manchester by the Sea (film)
   The story takes place in the present, while the narrative includes flashbacks that inform the viewer of significant events from the past and the characters' motivations. The protagonist is Lee Chandler, a janitor and handyman, who lives a solitary life in a basement apartment in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].  The movie opens with scenes of him performing tasks for tenants of the apartment complex where he works. His interaction with them is minimal. After being reprimanded by his boss for swearing at an irritated tenant, he gets into a drunken bar fight with two businessmen believing they were "looking" at him.  Lee receives word that his brother Joe has suffered a [[cardiac arrest]], but he dies before Lee can get to the hospital. Lee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son, Patrick, about his father's death. While making funeral arrangements, they learn that Joe's body cannot be buried until spring when the ground thaws. Lee opts to remain in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts]] until the delayed burial.  At Joe's lawyer's office, Lee is shocked to discover that his brother named him Patrick's [[legal guardian]]. During the scene, the viewer is shown — through flashbacks — that Lee once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi and their three small children. His negligence, however, while intoxicated led to a house fire that killed the children. No criminal charges were filed against him. However, after being questioned at the police station, Lee grabbed a gun from an officer's holster and attempted suicide. In light of these events, Lee is reluctant to commit to the guardianship and unwilling to move back to Manchester, where the locals treat him as an outcast. He begins planning for Patrick to move to Boston with him. Patrick is deeply rooted in the Manchester community and strongly objects to the idea. Lee commits to staying only through the end of the school year.  Over time, Patrick and Lee re-establish their bond, despite conflicts about Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. Through flashbacks, Patrick's mother Elise is shown to have had substance abuse problems and abandoned the family, so Lee is opposed to Patrick reconnecting with her. Even so, Patrick emails Elise about Joe's death, and she invites him to have lunch with her. She has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fiancé, Jeffrey, but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds himself unable to connect with her. He is unsettled further when Jeffrey emails him, insisting on being an intermediary in any future communication between Patrick and his mother. Lee's subsequent positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe his uncle is trying to get rid of him, assertions Lee denies.  In response to this strain in their relationship, Lee takes steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester, and begins to seek ways to spend more time with Patrick.  One day Lee runs into his ex-wife Randi, her newborn Dylan, and her friend Rachel. After Rachel leaves to get the car, a sobbing Randi expresses remorse for her treatment of Lee during their divorce and asks him to have lunch. Lee deflects her apology, feeling that he doesn't deserve it. When she insists that they reconnect and pleads with him not to "just die," he leaves before he can become emotional. Distraught, a drunk Lee picks a fight with strangers at a bar and is knocked out. He awakens in the living room of George (a family friend) and breaks down in tears. At home, Patrick shows his uncle deference after observing his battered state and seeing pictures of the deceased children in Lee's bedroom.  Lee arranges for George and his wife to adopt Patrick so the boy can remain in Manchester while Lee gets a job in Boston. When Patrick asks Lee why staying is not an option, Lee admits that he "can't beat it." At this, Patrick cries and Lee comforts him. During a walk after Joe's [[Funeral#Burial service|burial service]], Lee tells Patrick that he is searching for a residence in Boston with an extra room so that Patrick can visit whenever he wants. In the final scene, Lee and Patrick go fishing on Joe's refurbished boat that Patrick has inherited.

He attends an after work party hosted by the publishing magnate Hobbs where, for the first time, he meets Caroline Crowley.

Caroline invites Porter to her apartment where she shows him confidential police reports related to the death of her husband. She wants Porter to investigate the death and as an incentive seduces him even though he is married and has children.   Caroline's husband Simon kept footage of many things that he had shot over the years, some with hidden camera.  Hobbs learns that Porter is having an affair with Caroline, and summons him to his office to give his employ a new assignment. Hobbs is soon making threats to Porter's family to convince him to find a memory card Hobbs is sure that Mrs Crowley is using to blackmail him. At the same time Caroline also says she is also looking for the same memory card but she could not find it in a case in which Simon used to keep his cards. She then asks Wren's help to find the card. She said Simon asked her to have sex with a stranger after she lost a game with him. It is the card which has those moments captured. Wren is disappointed to know that Caroline's relationship with him is just to find the card. Soon after, thugs employed by Hobbs have cornered Porter in front of his home, search him for the video and rough him up badly to motivate him to try harder to find the missing video.

In wanting to repay her and her husband for the kindness, he made arrangements to pay them a monthly fee. Mrs. Segal felt obligated to do something for the money so treated her visits to Simon's father in the nursing home as a care giving service in billing Simon's estate. Additionally, Simon asked her to mail something to a third party on a random basis for which Porter deduces is the missing video that Hobbs and Caroline has been looking for. Porter gets Mrs. Segal to hand it over, and he watches it, seeing that it as intimate encounter between Hobbs and Caroline.  Wren returns the video to Hobbs so that all threats are removed. In the spirit of alls well that ends well, Hobbs gives Wren a key that his goons had found when snooping through Caroline's apartment looking for the video.

He goes there again and talks to the neighbor and finds a way to get into the basement. There he finds a small camera hidden at the corner. He takes the memory card and watches it. There, he finds Simon took Caroline to the building in an attempt to force her to tell him the secret between her and her stepfather which she revealed to Hobbs in the video. Caroline refuses to tell Simon. Wren watches as he sees Simon's extortion plan go terribly wrong.  After Wren watches the video, he accepts to meet Caroline for breakfast.

Adhiseshan, though, is not satisfied with the fee paid by the Dewans. Sakthi, desperate to have some money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan's acquittal.

They involve Loomis [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]] driver David Scott Ghantt ([[Zach Galifianakis]]). After some awkward training in preparation for the robbery, the team has David go inside Loomis' vault and load the entire money supply into the company's van. Before he leaves, David takes out three [[CCTV]] tapes, but misses one. The next day, David flees to [[Mexico]] with $20,000 and takes the cover name "Michael McKinney", which is the name of a friend of Steve's. Meanwhile, Steve takes most of the heist, around $17 million.  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Scanlon ([[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]) and her partner ([[Jon Daly]]) take the case, and immediately have David as the prime suspect, but have no idea of Steve's involvement. Steve plans to cut David loose but Kelly thinks it would be wrong to abandon him. In Mexico, David narrowly escapes from the three [[Interpol]] agents looking for him, and then calls Kelly about what happened. Unfortunately, he inadvertently learns Steve's name from the ID in a wallet that Kelly gave to him. With his cover blown, Steve hires the real Michael McKinney ([[Jason Sudeikis]]) to find and kill David. He travels to Mexico and attempts to shoot David, but the gun backfires and David escapes. David phones Kelly and learns that Steve is trying to kill him, and that Steve will not send the money for him as expected. David is then knocked unconscious by McKinney. When David regains consciousness, McKinney is about to kill him but reconsiders upon looking at "McKinney"'s birth certificate, thinking that David was born under the same circumstances; they become friends.  David calls Steve, threatening to surrender himself to Interpol if Steve doesn't wire $6 million into his bank account in two days. Kelly is then confronted by Jandice, who, learning of her engagement to David, attacks her. When Steve refuses to wire the money, his two friends kidnap Kelly after her escape from Jandice, and he tells David to get a ticket to South America in exchange for releasing her. At the airport, he meets McKinney, who is returning to the States, but as he bids farewell he sees Kelly's name written on his hand and he tells McKinney that he knows her. Realizing that he can't bring himself to kill her, they switch tickets just as the three [[Interpol]] agents show up but he manages to escape.  While Steve is hosting a party, the FBI puts a wire on one of the party members in an attempt to record Steve's confession. Unbeknownst to them, David sneaks in and rescues Kelly. They escape by stealing Steve's [[BMW]] but unfortunately the car is destroyed when they try to smash it through the front gate. Steve catches and assaults him, until David realizes he is near the FBI van with the agents inside. David tricks Steve into admitting that he was the mastermind of the whole plan, giving the agents enough reason to arrest all of them, including Kelly. David is sentenced to seven years in prison, while Steve serves 11 years. About $2 million of the money is still unaccounted for. Upon David's release, he is picked up by McKinney and they drive to visit Kelly.

Maximum Ride (film)
  Jeb wakes a young Max inside her cage and leads her out of the school to his car, where the other kids are waiting. As they drive away, Ari bursts out of the building, calling for his father.  In the present, Max runs through dark woods, fleeing searchlights. She stops at the edge of a cliff and jumps, only to wake up from her dream. She goes through the house, eating breakfast and encountering other members of the Flock. Nudge wants to leave the house and go shopping, but Max forbids it. She also confiscates a bomb that Gazzy is making.  Iggy explains that they have six months' worth of food, which may force them to leave, but Max wants to remain in the house where Jeb left them for safety. Fang says she still thinks Jeb is coming back.  Meanwhile, Angel senses voices and goes outside, where she is captured by Erasers. The Flock runs after her, but is too late. Ari, now an Eraser, beats Max up.  In a flashback, Max speaks with Ari. They talk about Jeb, and it is clear that Ari is jealous that Jeb spends more time with Max.  Max wakes up. The Flock returns to the house and reads through Jeb's files, looking for the School's location. They find a map. It is decided that Fang and Max will go to rescue Angel, while the others, who aren't as fast at flying, will remain home with Iggy watching over them. However, Ari has stayed behind and is watching the house. He later comes in looking for Max, but encounters the younger three. They fight him off and Gazzy detonates his bomb. They escape, but behind them, Ari's fist emerges from the rubble.  Meanwhile, Angel begins to cry after extensive testing and electric shocks. A mysterious scientist instructs the others to let her rest.  Max and Fang stop to eat on a rooftop in Moab, Utah, where Max hears a girl being attacked. They argue, and Fang tells Max not to intervene. Max seems to agree, but then flies down to help. At first she's fighting well, but then she is shot in the shoulder and collapses. Fang smashes the gunman through a window and turns to help Fang; the girl, Ella, tells him that her mother is a doctor. They rush Max to the veterinary practice. When Dr. Martinez arrives, Fang hides. Dr. Martinez reluctantly operates on Max.  In a flashback, young Max is rushed through the School on a gurney, struggling against the whitecoats as they try to restrain her. She wakes up in the present in Ella's room. She sees Fang waiting outside, but agrees to stay for breakfast.  Elsewhere, Iggy, Gazzy and Nudge are walking through a small town. Iggy has a plan to meet up with the others at Lake Mead. Gazzy realizes Nudge is gone; she has walked into a clothing store. They go back and get her, arguing, with no idea that Ari is observing them.  Dr. Martinez gives Max a checkup, noting her shoulder is already almost fully recovered. However, her X-rays are more concerning; she has a tracking chip in her shoulder, and of course wing bones in her skeleton. Dr. Martinez promises Max support; Max excuses herself. After checking her wings and cutting apart a gifted shirt to accommodate them, she rejoins Fang. The pair reach the cabin at Lake Mead, where they begin to argue. Fang doesn't think Max should have risked herself like that; she insists that protecting Ella was the right thing to do. He tells her that he can't lose her, but then they're interrupted by a sound. Iggy, Gazzy and Nudge have arrived.  Max tells them about the tracking chip. They tell her about the house and about Ari, who they recognized by a scar on his face. Fang explains that Max gave him the scar with some scissors, but she doesn't want to talk about it.  A flashback reveals that young Ari was taunting Max, calling her a monster and showing her the key card to her cage, while hiding scissors behind his back.  That morning, while everyone else sleeps, Max leaves the cabin. Ari confronts her and seems about to overpower her, but Fang grabs him, flies him into the air, and slams him into the ground. The Flock stands together, only for more Erasers to emerge from the woods. Ari turns on a noise device that causes the Flock to collapse in pain, and Max can only watch as they're captured one by one.  They recover at the School, in cages, but are initially overjoyed to find Angel. She warns Max not to listen to "him," just before Ari arrives, saying, “Somebody wants to talk to you, Max.”  He escorts her to an empty white room, where Jeb is waiting. Jeb offers her chocolate chip cookies, but she no longer trusts him, realizing that he never really rescued them, and their safe house in the woods was a test all along. He tells her that she was created to help people and save the world, but now that they know the truth, they must remain at the School. He shows her a note hidden beneath the cookies that says "You don't know everything. Trust me." He also tells her that it was Ari's choice to become an Eraser.  Max leaves the room. She taunts Ari as he forces her back into her cage, telling him that he won’t hurt her because Daddy wouldn’t like it. In his rage, he doesn't notice her stealing his key card.  Meanwhile, one of the whitecoats is secretly reporting on Jeb to another authority, saying that Jeb may be too emotional and attached. The woman she's talking to says that the Flock is expendable, but dangerous and must be controlled.  Ari returns to the cage room to taunt Max, but this time Max has unlocked her cage and jumps on him, pummeling him. She hands the key card to Iggy before Ari chases her out of the room. The Flock escapes from their cages and Nudge knocks out the building's power, while Gazzy creates a bomb.  Ari and the Erasers corner Max, only for the Flock to arrive with the bomb. Max leaps out of the way and escapes safely.  Jeb arrives, calling Ari's name. The Flock stands there, watching. Jeb pleads with Max, telling her she doesn't understand, but she tells him "this Experiment's over" and opens her wings.  Afterwards, the Flock walks through the woods. They pause and Max comforts Angel, only to collapse. She sees a vision of events throughout the movie, of child Ari moving to stab her with the scissors, and of New York City. When she awakens, she describes it to the Flock and they decide to go to New York City to look for more answers.  The final shot is of a video playing over and over again, of Max's final words to Jeb: "The experiment's over."

He is approached by Renee Tran, who knows his true identity and explains that her employer wishes for Bishop to kill three targets and stage them as accidents. Seeing her mercenaries waiting nearby, Bishop makes his escape, and flees the country to [[Thailand]]. He takes shelter at the resort island beach house of his friend, Mei, and learns that Tran is working for Riah Crain. Bishop and Crain were orphans who grew up together but were sold to a gangster and trained as warriors. Bishop made his escape and left Crain behind.  Sometime later, a bruised woman, Gina Thornton, approaches Mei for first aid before returning to a boat anchored nearby. Mei observes Thornton being beaten by a man aboard the boat and alerts Bishop. Bishop and Mei rescue Thornton from the man, but in the scuffle, the man hits his head on the boat's equipment and dies. Finding no evidence of his identity, Bishop sets the boat ablaze. While Mei tends to Thornton's injuries, Bishop finds that Thornton is also connected to Crain, and believes Crain anticipated Bishop would become romantic with her; Crain would then have kidnapped her to make Bishop take the assassination jobs. When he charges Thornton with his theory, she reveals that Crain threatened the children's shelter in [[Cambodia]] where she works unless she participated. Over the next few days, Bishop gets to know Thornton better and falls in love, but as expected, Crain's mercenaries arrive and abduct them.  Crain threatens Thornton's safety to coerce Bishop to undertake the assassination jobs. The first target is a warlord named Krill, who is incarcerated in a [[Malaysia]]n prison. Bishop travels to Malaysia and gets himself imprisoned to access Krill. Bishop gains Krill’s trust by killing a man already planning on killing Krill. Bishop kills Krill and escapes the prison with the help of Crain's operatives. The next target is Adrian Cook, who runs an underage trafficking ring from [[Sydney]]. Bishop bypasses the tight security of Cook's penthouse apartment and breaks the glass bottom of Cook's overhanging pool, plummeting him to his death.  While relaying details of the third target, Crain allows Bishop to speak to Thornton, who sends Bishop signals to help him identify Crain's boat. Bishop locates the boat and attempts to rescue her, but Crain recognizes Thornton's attempt in time and foils him. Crain demands Bishop complete the final assassination in 24 hours, identifying the target as Max Adams, an American arms dealer in [[Varna]], Bulgaria. While planning the attempt, Bishop recognizes that Crain's targets were his only other major competition in arms dealing. Bishop instead approaches Adams and warns him of Crain's plan, and gets Adams to help. Bishop fakes Adams' death, and reports his success to Crain, who directs him to a meeting point.  There, Bishop fends off attacks by Crain's mercenaries and makes for Crain's boat anchored nearby. He fights off more of Crain's men and rescues Thornton. He discovers the boat is rigged with explosives and places Thornton in an escape pod. Crain attacks Bishop, but Bishop overpowers him and secures him to the boat. The bombs explode, killing Crain and apparently Bishop.  Thornton is rescued and the remains of Crain's boat are salvaged. Thornton returns to Cambodia and her teaching duties, where she is surprised when Bishop meets her there. Adams discovers how Bishop survived but destroys the evidence to protect Bishop's secret.

La mécanique de l'ombre
 Duval, a lonely, middle-aged accountant, has lost his job due to his alcoholism. He joins [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], where he meets Sara, another recovering alcoholic, and they gradually become friends. Two years later, with Duval  still out work, he has an apparent chance meeting at a funeral with a former business acquaintance, Chalamont, who recommends Duval to Clément, the head of private surveillance company.  Clément hires Duval to transcribe recordings of phone intercepts, but he insists on very specific work conditions. Duval's new workplace is an unfurnished apartment, where he must work alone every day from 9am to 6pm, transcribing phone conversations from cassette tapes, using only an old [[IBM Selectric]] typewriter. Any pages that have errors must be shredded, he is forbidden to leave the apartment during work hours or take any material away, he cannot smoke in the apartment, interact with anyone else in the building, or tell anyone about his work, and he is always paid in cash. At the same time, two major political events are underway - France is nearing a Presidential election, in which an [[Alt-Right]] candidate is standing against the incumbent, and the race is complicated by a political crisis involving a group of French citizens being held hostage in the Middle East.   Although he initially pays little heed to the content of the tapes, Duval gradually becomes aware that they are evidently intercepted conversations with senior government officials - many involving a government official called Labarthe, and a Middle Eastern lawyer called Al Shamikh - and that all the taped individuals appear to have intimate knowledge of the hostage crisis. Duval is also surprised to discover that Clément is having him watched, and on several occasions he turns up for work to find typed notes from Clément, containing orders not to smoke in the apartment.  Although the job is at first uneventful, and his life is getting back on track, things take a sinister turn after Duval transcribes a conversation between Al Shamikh and Labarthe, in which Al Shamikh claims to have notebooks that contain critical information about the hostage crisis. The tape ends abruptly with what sounds like a struggle and, soon after, Duval is shocked to learn that Al Shamikh has been murdered. He starts to have serious doubts about his work and decides to quit, but at this point he begins to be visited at the apartment by Gerfaut, who claims to work for Clément.   Increasingly disturbed by the content of the tapes and their apparent connections to the hostage crisis and the murder of Al Shamikh, Duval tells Gerfaut that he wants to quit, but Gerfaut convinces him to wait. On a subsequent visit, Gerfaut demands both the cassette and the transcription of the Al Shamikh tape, and soon after he insists that Duval accompany him to Al Shamikh's office, where he intends to steal the notebooks. When they arrive, Gerfaut demands that Duval assist him, but when Duval refuses, Gerfaut turns on him and strangles him with the car seat-belt until he agrees to help. They enter the office and Duval keeps watch while Gerfaut searches for the notebooks, but Duval is surprised by a cleaner entering the office, and to Duval's horror, Gerfaut brutally knocks the cleaner to the ground and strangles him to death to prevent him identifying them.  Panic-stricken, Duval returns home, determined to flee. He grabs his passport and all the cash he has saved from his job, and leaves his apartment, but within moments he is seized by two men and bundled into a car. After covering his head they drive Duval to an unknown location. He is led into a house where Clément interrogates him briefly about his interactions with Gerfaut and his knowledge of the notebooks' whereabouts. Clément then leads Duval into a bare room where he sees Gerfaut, tied to a chair and bleeding from numerous wounds. Clément demands to know where the notebooks are, but Gerfaut is defiant and refuses to say, and it is clear that Clément will to kill him either way.  Duval is told that Gerfaut used to work for Clément but is now working on his own, and he also realises that Clément has had him under close surveillance the whole time but, to his surprise, Clément orders him to return to work, and he is driven back to town. Arriving home, he is dismayed to see Sara waiting for him; at first he suspects she is in league with Clément, and he angrily demands to know how she knew where he lives, then orders her to leave, but then he collapses, she returns to assist him, and he tells her all that has transpired.   The next day on his way to work Duval is detained by two men who, it transpires, work for the secret service. He is held for some time before being interrogated by two men, one of whom turns out to be Labarthe, the other voice from the Al Shamikh tape. Labarthe tells Duval that the secret service are investigating Clément's activities and want to find him, and he reveals that he has surveillance camera vision from Al Shamikh's office that shows Duval in the room with Gerfaut when he murdered the cleaner. Duval resists, pleading that Clément is watching them all, and that he knows from the tapes that Clément has been tapping Labarthe's phone, but Labarthe secures his cooperation by threatening to give his file to the public prosecutor.  Duval reluctantly returns to work but he is panic-stricken when he walks into the apartment, picks up a typed page from the typewriter, realises it is a transcript of a conversation between himself and Labarthe, and that Clément still has them under surveillance. He rushes back to his home to find that it has been ransacked by Clément's men, who are seaching for the notebooks, and he realises they have also kidnapped Sara, who had stayed the night there. The terrified Duval rushes out to call Labarthre from a public phone, pleading that he and Sara are in mortal danger, and that Clément clearly knows all about Labarthe's investigation and is monitoring them both closely, but Labarthe orders Duval to contact Clément and arrange a meeting, under the pretext of giving Clément the Al Shamikh notebooks he has been searching for. Labarthe also reveals that the notebooks don't really exist, and that he is merely using their supposed contents as bait to lure Clément out so that they can arrest him.  Duval tries to find the secretive Clément, at first without success, but then he remembers Chalamont, the business friend who had originally recommended Duval for the job. He goes to Chalamont, who at first claims ignorance, but when the now-desperate Duval uses physical force to intimidate him, Chalamont relents, gives him Clément's phone number, and Duval arranges the meeting.  The climactic meeting takes place in an empty sports arena. Before they enter, Labarthe tries to allay Duval's fears by assuring him that they will be watched by his agents throughout the meeting. When Clément arrives, he and Labarthe dismiss their minders, and Clément makes a series of stunning revelations - he too works for a shadowy branch of the French security services, he has had Labarthe's agency under surveillance the entire time and knows all about his operation, and that he, Clément, is a close ally of the new "alt-Right" President. He also admits that the knows the notebook story was a ruse, and reveals that the delay in releasing the hostages was a deliberately ploy to discredit the defeated President, and give the kudos for securing the hostages' release to the incoming  President. Clément then effectively blackmails Labarthe into acquiescence by telling him that unless he drops his attempts to stop Clément, he will have no future under the new administration.   Labarthe hesitates, but to Duval's dismay he finally agrees to Clément's terms, but the tables are dramatically turned when Duval takes matters into his own hands - he seizes Labarthe's wrist, on which has a microphone to communicate with his agents, and he shouts "Engage! Engage!". Labarthe's agents take this as a order and the sharpshooters open fire, killing Clément and his bodyguards. A stunned Labarthe realises the game is over and Duval is released. The film concludes with Duval going to the hospital where Sara has been recuperating from her ordeal, and the final scene depicts Duval and Sara seeing each other across the hospital corridor, but the movie ends at this point, without revealing whether or not their relationship will continue.

The Menu (film)
 The invention of [[smart phone]]s has accelerated the decline in [[print journalism]], which [[online journalism]] has been replacing. Two years after the death of Kenny Wong and the departure of editor-in-chief Alma Wong, ''Smart Post'' is facing a direct challenge from ''Flash Post'', whose online articles receive considerable [[click rate]] on its first date of publication. Fong Ying ([[Catherine Chau]]), ''Smart Post'''s interim editor-in-chief, is warned by CEO Chong Nga-yuen (Justin Cheung) that the newspaper will be forced to shut down if it loses in the competition with ''Flash Post''. On her first day as [[photojournalist]], Mallory Mak ([[Kate Yeung]]) comes across the award-winning photo "[[Kevin Carter#Prize-winning photograph in Sudan|The Starving of Sudan]]" and discusses the ethics behind photojournalism with her colleague and boyfriend Lok Ka-fai ([[Gregory Wong]]).  Young entrepreneur Ko Yin-yan is interviewed at the television station C99. Seven years ago, he raped and murdered a 17-year-old girl but was acquitted of all charges after he bribed a key witness. Although the witness admitted to [[perjury|giving false testimony]] later, Ko was unable to be charged again owing to the principle of "[[double jeopardy]]", which forbids the prosecution to press the same charge against the same person again. Furious at seeing the murderer of her daughter remain at large, Tam Yui-chi ([[Ng Man-tat]]) has long been under [[hunger strikes]] protesting the government's slow progress in abolishing double jeopardy despite professional recommendations, but his solo actions have been constantly ignored and at one point mocked by Lok, who told him he can never gain any media attention unless he has a mass support group or he commits a crime. Seeing Ko's visit to the television studio as a chance, Tam, a technician at C99, detonates explosives and takes Ko hostage along with several colleagues of his. Tam demands the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], Lo Kin-kuen, to meet with him before midnight, otherwise he will kill all the hostages and himself. He then sends a voice message to his wife Chim Sui-wah (Mimi Kung) informing her of his action, which triggers her cardiac attack and causes her minibus to crash at a high speed.  Mak and Lok witness Chim's accident along with many journalists near the scene. Although Lok acts fast to discover Chim's mobile phone and to establish her relation with the hostage-taker, ''Flash Post'' overtakes ''Smart Post'' in sending the [[push notification]] of the breaking news. Fong decides to gain back click rate by asking Lok to break into the studio and to conduct a [[live streaming|live online interview]] with Tam via a handheld transceiver. After Tam discloses the story of her daughter to the public, the interview is cut short by the police. ''Flash Post'''s Fung (Ben Yeung) and Zhong Kaiqi (Jeana Ho) follow suit but intentionally provoke Tam to make him assault Ko while broadcast live.  Lok traces the threatening messages in Chim's phone to Ko's father, a Guangzhou tycoon with a close relation with Lo, whom he confronts in person. Blaming himself for instigating Tam's action, he questions Fong's order to publish online the secretly-filmed video and instead takes it to the government [[Office of the Chief Executive#Information Coordinator|Information Coordinator]] (Deon Cheung) to demand Lo's immediate intervention. Lo initially refuses, but agrees to send a delegate to negotiate after Fong reveals Ko's uncle is the legislator delaying the law reform regarding double jeopardy.  The preliminary talk between Tam and Lok as Lo's delegate goes well, and Tam releases four of the hostages. However, after seeing the photos of his wife's corpse published by ''Flash Post'', a desperate Tam cuts the connection with the police and sets off the explosives to kill some of the hostages. Amidst a public uproar against ''Flash Post'', Zhong resigns from the newspaper and Mak vows to take photojournalism back to the right cause. ''Smart Post'''s infographic video goes viral on social media and online forums, and attracts thousands to flood into the streets outside C99 station. Half an hour before the deadline, knowing about the mass of people gathering outside in support of him, Tam surrenders to the police.  Although ''Smart Post'' loses in terms of click rates by a narrow margin to ''Flash Post'', whose editor-in-chief has just resigned, Fong is indifferent to this but summarises journalists' attitude with [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]'s message on the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'': "Stay hungry. Stay Foolish."  
Mercury Plains
 Mitch Davis, unhappy with his life and seeing no prospects for work, leaves with a friend for a trip to Mexico.  After getting a prostitute a bar, Mitch's friend leaves without paying.  When Mitch refuses to pay his friend's debt to the pimp, he is beaten and robbed.  Another American, Jesse, buys him a meal.  As they talk, Jesse offers him a job working for a man known as the Captain, an American veteran who runs a paramilitary vigilante group that targets the Mexican cartels.  Mitch answers noncommittally and listens to the Captain's recruitment speech.  The Captain, recognizing his ordinary speech that emphasizes glory and power will not appeal to Mitch, flatly offers him $5000.  Mitch at first declines but reconsiders after the Captain points out that anyone who comes to Mexico on a lark must be leaving behind an even worse situation than what he offers.  At the Captain's compound, Mitch meets Camarillo, the Captain's second in command; Alyssa, the Captain's girlfriend; Paul, a surly skinhead; Benito, a young Mexican thief; and several other young recruits, including the Captain's teenage son, Jack.  The Captain's first job has them build a ditch.  When Benito is bitten by a scorpion, Mitch protests when Camarillo forces him back to work.  Camarillo orders Paul to beat Mitch.  When Mitch turns out to be a competent fighter, Camarillo knocks him out with a Taser.  Mitch wakes in a thick wooden box, where he is given limited rations.  After being stuck there for a day, Mitch escapes by knocking loose a hinged slot and using it to dig a tunnel.  Impressed with his ingenuity, the Captain allows him to rejoin the others as they eat.  Mitch also impresses Alyssa, who flirts with him when the Captain is not around.  The two later have sex.  Speaking privately with Mitch, the Captain says Mitch has become his favorite recruit, as Mitch reminds the Captain of himself.  The Captain explains his philosophy: lawlessness allows common men to become great, though they must then combat the lawlessness to retain their power.  The Captain point blank asks Mitch if he is having sex with Alyssa, which Mitch denies, satisfying the Captain.  Their first mission is to rob a drug runner named Brad.  After kidnapping him, they find no drugs on Brad.  When Brad goes for Paul's gun, Paul accidentally shoots Brad in the struggle.  Mitch insists they take Brad with them, but Camarillo orders them to leave him for dead.  Before they leave, Benito steals Brad's expensive shirt.  When they get back to the compound, Benito, being illiterate, has Mitch read a letter he found in the shirt.  In it, Brad's parents tell him they love him and support any decision he makes about staying in Mexico.  With the money stolen from Brad's credit cards, they purchase more guns.  Dressed as FBI agents, they stop a cartel car and attempt to restrain them.  When the cartel men become suspicious, a gunfight ensues, causing Jesse's death.  The next hit turns out to be federal police officers.  Mitch tries to abort the mission, but the others continue.  Paul is killed in the resulting fight, but Mitch recovers a suitcase full of cash from the federales' car.  Shortly after they return to the compound, the police raid it.  Mitch, the Captain, and Camarillo escape in Mitch's car together.  When Camarillo later reads them a Mexican newspaper, the Captain learns Jack died during the fight, and he deduces Benito was a police informer.  They pick up Benito, drive to a secluded area, and the Captain drags Benito out of the car.  Mitch at first does nothing, but then strangles Camarillo when he decides that he has to do something to prevent what is about to happen.  After helplessly watching the Captain kill Benito, Mitch flees with the money.  The two men wound each other, and after a long chase, the Captain finally catches up to Mitch, who has crossed most of the desert on foot trying to get back to the States.  Further elucidating on his philosophy, the Captain says war is like love and allows men to express themselves.  As he prepares to kill Mitch, Mitch surprises him with a small, single-shot pistol favored by Benito.  After killing the Captain, Mitch returns to the city, buys new clothes to replace his bloody and torn rags, and visits Brad's parents.  He secretly leaves them the money stolen from the federales.

Shan insists that Xuan leave her, but he continues to carry her to safety. While Ruolan and George get arrested, Xuan collapses from his wounds.  Three years later, a student arrives at Xuan's home to thank him for setting up a scholarship for research into environmental protection. The student asks Xuan whether merpeople are real and if the story that he fell in love with a mermaid is true, but Xuan denies it. Xuan then introduces the student to his wife, "Lucy", who is actually Shan in a human disguise. Xuan tells the student to not believe in fairytales and myths.

Message from the King (film)
  Jacob King, living in [[South Africa]], receives a message from his estranged sister Bianca, who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and step-son, that she is in trouble and has something "they" want. King flies to Los Angeles with a return ticket in seven days' time, intent on finding his sister and a booking at a cheap motel. Arriving, he meets a neighbor who held some of Bianca's belongings, given to her shortly before Bianca disappeared. The neighbor also informs King that his sister's husband disappeared, and the husband left Bianca with his son. He finds her landlady, who says that a local business owner suddenly paid Bianca's rent before she left, and that she had descended from sobriety to drug use and prostitution. King finds the business owner, Duke, with a group of men—part of a gang—and they deny any knowledge of her. A local shopkeeper tips King off that his sister is dead, and he finds her in the morgue, tortured and murdered.  Among Bianca's belongings, King finds several photographs of herself with various men, including a gang member who had denied knowing her, a dentist's-office card, and a pack of cigarettes. He confronts the gang member and mutilates his face, telling the man that this is "a message from the King", and steals his phone. At a party held by Bianca's neighbor, he finds out from the neighbor that the husband was pimping Bianca out to pay debts. He lures Bianca's dealer to the party and beats him for information, then steals his phone. Meanwhile, King accidentally interrupts a prostitute at the motel. The prostitute, glad he did not call the police, allows King to borrow her car for some money.  King goes to the dentist under the guise of a referral from his sister; he meets the connected Dr. Wentworth, who says that she was being pimped for her husband's debts and that she often disappeared. After the meeting, it is revealed that she was involved with a politician running for office, Frank Leary, who gives Wentworth the contact details for two hitmen to make the problem disappear. King follows Wentworth to the home of a wealthy [[Hollywood]] producer, Mike Preston, whom Wentworth shakes down for $100,000 to cover the cost of the hitmen, and another $750,000 of blackmail money due to his involvement with Bianca's death.  At the house, King notices his sister's son, Armand, living at the mansion. Wentworth notices King's car when leaving Preston's house, and calls the hitmen.  Later that day, the hitmen, two [[LAPD]] officers, arrest King. King, realizing he is going to be killed, manages to escape, taking a beating in the process. His motel neighbor, Kelly, who is the prostitute who had lent King her car, finds him near the motel and nurses him back to health in her room. The gang realizes that Kelly's car was not stolen. King recovers from his beating and creates a bomb out of materials from a hardware store, then finds an encrypted SD card in Bianca's belongings, hidden in a pack of cigarettes. Realizing that this is what her killers wanted, he is only able to listen to snippets of audio but understands that Preston is the target. He sneaks into Preston's home and forces him to decrypt the file, which reveals camera footage of Preston committing acts of pedophilia on Armand during a party.  Preston reveals that Bianca's husband had fallen into serious debts and the debtors pimped Bianca out, forcing her on drugs, to pay them back. They killed her husband but continued to pimp her out, so she sold her son to Preston for money. When she realized that he was raping her son, she stole the footage and called King for help. Preston asked Wentworth to fix the issue, and Wentworth killed Bianca using the gang members. King lures both Duke and his gang members and Wentworth to Preston's mansion. He kills Preston, then plants a bomb in a packet of money. Duke and Wentworth open the packet, and both are killed. King takes Armand back to Kelly's motel, intent on rescuing the boy, but the sole surviving member of the gang—the one maimed a few days earlier—ambushes him in the room. The boy escapes before King is able to win; King gives chase to Armand, but ultimately gives up.  King drops Kelly and her daughter on the bus to her home town in New Mexico. He hands her a bag which has money he took from Preston's mansion earlier. As he is walking Leary's posters can be seen on the walls of the city of [[Los Angeles]]. King returns to South Africa where he is welcomed back and is revealed to be a detective of the local police force.

Freeman bids a fond farewell to his coworkers, who barely acknowledge him, and takes his mother's 1953 Oldsmobile on a road trip to Las Vegas, where he intends to audition for a standup competition run by Vegas showman Monte Guy.  Freeman, an obsessive fan of vaudeville and other early 20th century comedy, becomes confused by the more obnoxious and transgressive humor preferred by the people he meets.  Along the way, he picks up a hitchhiker nicknamed Hitch whose previous rides are shown to have either disappeared or died mysteriously.  When Hitch learns that Freeman intends to become a standup comedian, he shares career advice and agrees to become Freeman's manager.  On Hitch's advice, Freeman performs at a local comedy club's open mic night.  Freeman follows T-Bird, the town's most popular comic, and bombs horribly, alienating the audience with his stale jokes and clean-cut persona.  In convincing Freeman not to give up, Hitch advises him to instead visualize himself murdering the hecklers and incorporate this edginess into his act.  The next morning, Freeman finds the corpse of a heckler in his car.  Fearing that he murdered the heckler in fit of drunken rage, Freeman drives into the desert to bury the body.  This proves more difficult than anticipated, necessitating dismembering the corpse and exhuming it when it becomes obvious the spot they chose is not suitable.  Hitch insists Freeman appear again at the open mic now that he has inspiration for new material.  In shock and wearing a bloodstained shirt, Freeman makes a public confession to the murder and subsequent attempts to cover it up.  The audience interprets this as black comedy, and Freeman displaces T-Bird as the town's most popular, transgressive comic.  Freeman further draws the enmity of T-Bird when Freeman stands up for Grail, T-Bird's abused girlfriend.  As Grail and Freeman grow closer, Hitch reveals he was the one who murdered the heckler.  Although relieved that he is not a murderer, Freeman panics over the growing body count, as Hitch robs local stores to pay off a debt to Monte Guy.  Intimidated and unwilling to give up Hitch's connection to Monte Guy, Freeman agrees to keep quiet and continue his act.  While making out with Grail, Freeman discovers a dismembered body part in his car.  Freaked out, he yells at Grail to leave, offending her.  T-Bird sees her leave and confronts Freeman with a shotgun.  T-Bird demands to see the car's trunk, where Hitch and Freeman have hiding the bodies.  Freeman reluctantly open the trunk, only for one of the victims, who was armed with a pistol, to shoot and kill T-Bird before dying.  Unable to handle any more death or killing, Freeman convinces Hitch to drive into the desert with him and leaves him for dead.  Freeman leaves a note apologizing to Grail for his behavior and confesses to the police.  The man who he confesses to turns out not to be a cop but a talent scout for Monte Guy.  The scout interprets the confession as a comedy routine and agrees to watch his next set at the club.  At the comedy club, Freeman attempts to distance himself from his previous performances, reverting back to clean humor.  It goes poorly, and he leaves the club to seek inspiration from the bodies in the car's trunk.  When he finds it empty, he returns to his hotel room, where he finds Hitch, horribly sunburned and surrounded by the corpses.  Hitch threatens to kill Grail, whom he has taken hostage, in retaliation for Freeman's betrayal, but Freeman kills Hitch.  Grail, freaked out, shouts for help.  Freeman panics, and, attempting to quiet her, puts a pillow over her head, forlornly insisting that she is supposed to love him. Freeman fantasizes that she expresses her love, and that the talent scout witnessed this as part of "performance art comedy" and drove them to Las Vegas where they married, and he becomes a star on Monte Guy's show.  This is interrupted when the police arrive, finding Freeman laughing hysterically among the arranged bodies, arranged like the celebrity couch for Monte Guy.

Midnight Special (film)
  In a motel, Roy Tomlin ([[Michael Shannon]]) and his friend Lucas ([[Joel Edgerton]]) watch an [[AMBER Alert]] for 8-year-old Alton Meyer ([[Jaeden Lieberher]]) and his reported abductor, Roy, while the boy reads on the floor.  At the Ranch, a [[religious cult]] in rural [[Texas]], Pastor Calvin Meyer ([[Sam Shepard]]) dispatches two of his parishioners ([[Bill Camp]] and [[Scott Haze]]) to retrieve Alton. He then faces his congregation as the FBI storms their church. [[NSA]] communications analyst Paul Sevier ([[Adam Driver]]) asks Calvin how numbers sent via encoded satellite transmissions made their way into his sermons. Calvin explains that Alton [[Glossolalia|speaks in tongues]] and gave the numbers to Calvin. As Alton's powers grew, his mother Sarah ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) abandoned him, and members of the Ranch have been raising him, with Pastor Meyer as his adoptive father. It is also noted in this sequence that Roy is Alton's biological father.  After a violent confrontation with a state trooper, Roy and Lucas seek cover at the home of Elden (David Jansen), a former Ranch member. During the night, an earthquake seems to wake Roy and Lucas. When they break down the door to Alton's room, they find him linked to Elden by blinding beams of light directly from his eyes into Elden's. Roy knocks out Elden and covers up Alton, who is extremely photosensitive. They take Elden's van and continue on toward a location that Alton specified. Members of the Ranch seem to know this location, but the FBI is desperately trying to figure out where the trio are headed.  When they stop at a gas station, Alton seems to destroy a satellite, creating a debris crashing down on them. They drive to Sarah Tomlin's house, and she is overjoyed to be reunited with her son. After they watch the news together, Alton explains that he caused the satellite to crash because the police were using it to track him.   As the fugitives, now including Sarah, continue their trek, Alton appears to be growing sick and weak. He convinces Roy to let him see the daylight, while Lucas and Sarah go ahead to a motel. After witnessing his first sunrise, Alton's eyes begin to glow, and an enormous dome of light surrounds the duo. They reunite with Lucas and Sarah, and Alton is healthy. He explains that seeing the sun helped him realize his true identity. He explains that there is a world "built on top of" this one, and that he belongs to it. Roy confirms that he briefly saw this hidden world inside the dome of light.  When they leave the hotel room, they are ambushed by Calvin's trackers from the ranch, who abduct Alton but are soon captured by the police. The boy is taken to a government facility where he insists that he will only talk to Sevier. After Sevier experiences Alton's powers, he helps reunite him with his parents. Having deduced their destination from Calvin's sermons, Sevier warns the fugitives that there is a 5-mile security perimeter around the location, on the [[Florida panhandle]].  Roy barrels through a roadblock, driving inside the perimeter as the Army scrambles to chase them. Alton and Sarah exit the car and run into the woods. Roy and Lucas lead the Army on a wild goose chase while Alton and Sarah reach the edge of a swamp. There, Alton creates a dome of light that engulfs much of Florida and surrounding states; everyone inside it can see the futuristic structures of a parallel world. Eventually, other beings of this world gather around Alton, and the entire dome disappears, taking Alton with it.  Roy and Lucas are arrested. Lucas is interviewed by the FBI. He tells them the story, but they are unsatisfied. Sevier then enters to interview him, with Lucas the only one aware of Sevier's previous involvement. Sarah cuts off her cult traditionalist hair braid in a local gas station. Roy, incarcerated and wearing an [[electroencephalography]] device, watches the sunrise as his eyes glow faintly, indicating that he is from the same world as Alton.

With their younger sister Jeanie's wedding in [[Hawaii]] approaching, their parents tell them they must bring dates to the wedding to keep them out of trouble. Mike and Dave put out an ad for dates on Craigslist. The ad goes viral and the brothers go on ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'' to advertise themselves.  Meanwhile, Tatiana and Alice are slacker party girls who have just been fired for showing up to their waitressing jobs drunk. Tatiana sees the brothers' appearance on TV and decides that this free trip is just the vacation they need. They clean themselves up and Tatiana, to get their attention, throws herself in front of a moving car outside the bar where the brothers are meeting women. After letting the brothers think Mike saved Tatiana's life, they all go on a date. Tatiana, posing as a school teacher, flirts with Mike but has no intention of having sex with him. Alice, who is pretending to be a [[hedge fund]] manager, thinks sleeping with Dave is just what she needs to get over her ex-fiance, who left her at the altar. Thinking their family will like these girls, the brothers invite them to Hawaii.  In Hawaii, Tatiana and Alice charm the Stangle family but are almost exposed when Alice, suffering [[PTSD]]-like flashbacks of her own wedding, gets drunk and makes jealous, offhanded comments to Jeanie. At the same time Mike and his [[bisexual]] female cousin, Terry, begin competing for Tatiana's attention. The brothers book a swim-with-dolphins package for the family; however, the girls convince Jeanie and her fiance, Eric, to take an ATV tour through the mountains instead. Alice and Tatiana show off and perform tricks on their ATVs. Mike attempts the same trick but ends up crashing into Jeanie and severely bruising her face. Alice feels bad and bribes a masseur to give Jeanie a massage with a tantric style "happy ending".  Tatiana goes into a sauna and runs into Terry. She offers Tatiana backstage passes to [[Rihanna]] if Tatiana fingers her. Dave finds himself falling for Alice and opens up to her about his dream of drawing full-time. Later Mike walks in on Jeanie having an orgasm during the massage. Upon finding Tatiana and Terry together, Mike storms off and Tatiana admits she was only interested in the free vacation. At the rehearsal dinner, Jeanie opens up to Alice about her fears about getting married. To help calm her nerves, Alice gives her [[MDMA|ecstasy]], which causes a bad trip. Mike drags Dave backstage and demands he practice their speech instead of spending more time with Alice. They get into an argument, and Mike reveals what happened in the massage parlor - unaware that they are being broadcast over the speaker system. The argument gets physical in front of the entire wedding party.  Jeanie and Alice take off their clothes and release a stable of horses.

The next day, the brothers make up and agree to work together to get the wedding back on track. At the same time, Tatiana and Alice feel guilty and also agree to fix the wedding. All four of them go to Jeanie and Eric's room to apologize, which ends in an argument. Eric silences and berates all of them, and gives Jeanie an early honeymoon present: tickets for a hot air balloon ride, even though Eric is afraid of heights. With the wedding back on, the four scramble to get a venue for the reception and food for dinner. Jeanie and Eric end up getting married outside the stables. After the wedding, Tatiana and Mike decide to get into business together. Alice deletes her wedding video before making out with Dave in front of everyone. The brothers perform a heartfelt duet to celebrate Jeanie's marriage. Alice and Tatiana then join them for a raunchy dance number. The fireworks display the brothers set off catches fire, scattering the wedding party. Tatiana and Mike later have sex in the stables.  
Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life (film)
  Rafe Khatchadorian ([[Griffin Gluck]]), who enjoys a passion for art and has an incredible imagination, transfers mid-year to Hills Village [[Middle School]] after being kicked out of his previous one. On his first day, he meets the strict and exceedingly vain [[Head teacher|Principal]] Ken Dwight ([[Andy Daly]]) and his stern, obsequious [[Vice-principal|Vice-Principal]] Ida Stricker ([[Retta]]). Dwight runs the school with an iron fist and forces students to comply with an extensive list of rules that are mostly senseless and unlawful ones while Stricker follows along with his antics. Later that day, an assembly focused on the BaseLine Assessment of Academic Readiness standardized test, led enthusiastically by Dwight, is interrupted when another student grabs Rafe's sketchbook in which he had humorously drawn the principal as a zombie repeating "B.L.A.A.R." over and over. Dwight responds by destroying the sketchbook, much to the dismay of Rafe as it had been filled with his personal work.  Later that day, Rafe is back in his room with his best friend Leo ([[Thomas Barbusca]]) who suggests that to get even, Rafe should destroy Dwight's rule book. To show the ridiculousness of Dwight's rules, Rafe and Leo pull several pranks such as papering the walls of the hallways as well as Dwight's office with colored sticky notes, changing the period bell to end with the sound of flatulence, filling the teachers' lounge with plastic balls, putting pink hair dye in Dwight's hat, and turning the trophy case into a fish tank complete with coral and several sea creatures, including an eel. These pranks gain the attention and admiration of Rafe's fellow students, including Jeanne Galletta ([[Isabela Moner]]), the lone member of the AV Club who also sees the pointlessness of Dwight's rules, and on whom Rafe develops an immediate crush. Leo suggests strongly to Rafe that he not reveal himself just yet.  In the midst of the chaos, Dwight, obsessed with his school's performance on the BLAAR, realizes that if he can stop the remedial class, which includes Rafe, from taking the test, then the average scores will improve enough to earn a number one ranking and a generous bonus for him and Stricker. To rig the BLAAR, Dwight frames several students from the class by secretly putting items in their lockers that make it appear like they were responsible for the pranks, and suspends the whole class for a week. He also uses the opportunity to unlawfully fire Mr. Teller ([[Adam Pally]]), the compassionate remedial class teacher who, along with the other teachers, disagrees with Dwight and Stricker's antics and sees through Dwight's plan. Rafe immediately goes to Dwight's office and begs him not to suspend the other students since he was the one responsible for the pranks; when Dwight refuses, Rafe creates a crazy dance party by activating the [[sprinkler system]] and [[fire alarm]], which soaks the school and the students in colored [[dye]] that was intended to be yet another one of his pranks, which prompts Dwight to [[expulsion (education)|expel]] Rafe permanently.  Now expelled from Hills Village Middle School, Rafe is confronted by his mother Jules ([[Lauren Graham]]) who tells him that her fiancé Carl "Bear" ([[Rob Riggle]]), who seriously loathes Rafe and his sister Georgia (Alexa Nisenson), has found a military school where Jules should consider sending him. While acknowledging that it is not ideal, it represents what may be the only option left, as Hills Village was the last school that would accept him. She also pauses to reflect the passing of Rafe's younger brother Leo, two years earlier, revealing that Leo had been imagined the whole time by Rafe. Later that evening, Jeanne shows up at Rafe's house with concrete evidence: a [[VHS tape]] containing video surveillance footage and a [[documentary]] about the school she had recorded of Dwight putting the items "found" in the student lockers himself. With this evidence, Rafe, Jeanne, and Georgia gather the suspended students from the remedial class outside the middle school, along with the disgruntled janitor Gus ([[Efren Ramirez]]), who also dislikes Dwight's rules, and pull together a plan to get revenge on Dwight and Stricker.  The next morning, Jules discovers that neither Rafe nor Georgia are home and becomes concerned about their disappearance, but when Bear shows more concern in the fact that his car (a red [[manual transmission|stick-shift]] 2009 [[BMW 3 Series (E90)#Sedan (E90)|BMW 328i (E90)]] sedan with doors that sometimes jam when opening) is missing as it was stolen by the kids, she finally realizes that he is nothing more than a selfish jerk, as Rafe claimed.  Meanwhile, with B.L.A.A.R. testing ready to begin, Rafe and his classmates interrupt procedures and expose Dwight's deceitfulness. Fed up with Rafe's inferred disobedience, Dwight begins to chase him, but one of the students trips Dwight, so Stricker begins to chase Rafe but ends up getting tripped as well. Gus shows up in a cart to pick up Rafe. Dwight then steals a student's bike and gives chase, only to have a pile of manure dumped all over him. Just as Dwight catches up with Rafe and Gus, Mr. Teller arrives with [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] Hwang (Angela Oh) to whom Rafe hands over the video proving Dwight's guilt. He and Stricker are subsequently fired by Hwang for creating unlawful rules, unlawfully firing Mr. Teller, and for illegally rigging the B.L.A.A.R. Hwang also reveals that she will bring their crimes to court. When Jules arrives to pick up Rafe and Georgia, Rafe is re-enrolled, she breaks up with Bear, and gives him back the engagement ring to pay for the damages to his car (courtesy of Georgia).  Rafe is later seen that night outside the school conversing with Leo, who tells him that since Rafe has now made friends with some of his classmates, he is no longer needed to fill that void. As Leo departs on a [[spaceship]] with [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] that Rafe has created in his earlier sketchbook, Rafe and Jeanne share a kiss, breaking rule #86 which is the final rule Rafe needed to break for an [[ends justify the means]] deed.

Mindhorn
 Actor Richard Thorncroft is best known for playing Detective Bruce Mindhorn, a detective with the power to see truth with a cybernetic eye, in the 1980s television show ''Mindhorn.'' Twenty-five years later, on the [[Isle of Man]], where ''Mindhorn'' was filmed, police hunt an escaped lunatic, Paul Melly, wanted for murder. Melly says he will only speak to Detective Mindhorn, not realising that Mindhorn is fictional.  Richard is now washed up and reduced to adverting embarrassing products. Hoping to boost his career, he returns to the Isle of Man to help the case but irritates the local constabulary with his arrogance. Melly's scheduled call to the police station leads to a meeting with Melly, culminating in Melly's arrest. Richard sets out to reconnect with his ''Mindhorn'' co-star Patricia, but discovers she is living with his former stuntman Clive, and Patricia and Richard's estranged daughter Jasmine. Another of his ''Mindhorn'' co-stars, Pete Eastman, now stars in a successful spin-off series. Dejected, Richard is detained after a night of drunken antisocial behaviour and dropped by his agent.  Waiting for his ferry home, Richard opens fan mail, including a videotape revealing that the murder was committed by the mayor. His former manager Moncrieff proposes using the tape to blackmail the mayor, but appears to concede after a brief altercation. Richard meets Melly and the police, but discovers that Moncrieff has swapped the tape. Moncrieff confronts the mayor but is shot by DC Baines, who is part of the conspiracy.  Melly and Richard escape to Melly's secret lair, which is filled with Mindhorn merchandise and homemade espionage equipment. Melly equips Richard with an extensive Mindhorn outfit and explains that he has a copy of the tape in the car used in ''Mindhorn''. Richard and Melly escape Baines when Melly throws defective ''Mindhorn'' merchandise in her face.  At Patricia and Clive's house, Richard learns that Clive has been hiding letters to Patricia from Richard. Richard, Melly and Patricia hijack the car from a parade, and are pursued by DC Baines to the beach. Richard discovers the tape is a plasticine model and Melly is hit by a bullet. Richard captures a confession from Baines on an old ''Mindhorn'' recorder belt that Melly had insisted he wear. Richard rescues Jasmine from Baines as she fires at him; realizing too late the gun she was firing was not loaded with blanks as he thought, Richard collapses. He survives, Baines and the mayor are jailed, and Melly is found alive in his lair.  
Miss Stevens
  Rachel Stevens ([[Lily Rabe]]) is a 29-year-old high school English teacher who takes three of her students to a drama competition in California for the weekend. On Friday, she starts her day teaching her class discussing ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' when one of her students Billy ([[Timothée Chalamet]]) interrupts the class to ask her for her opinion for the ending. After the class another student, Margot ([[Lili Reinhart]]) goes over the itinerary for the weekend. After their meeting, she talks to Billy about a makeup test that he hasn't taken yet. Later, she meets with the principal of the school ([[Oscar Nunez]]) to discuss how the weekend will go, primarily about Billy since he is on medication for an unmentioned behavioral disorder. She then leaves for the competition with Billy, Margot, and a third student Sam (Anthony Quintal).  During the car ride, her car's tire pops and she calls for [[roadside assistance]], which then leads to her getting a new tire. Afterward, a song plays on the radio that both Rachel and Billy like, which leads them to sing it together, annoying Margot. They arrive at the competition late and check into their rooms before heading out for dinner and orientation for the competition. During a mixer, Rachel meets another teacher from a different school named Walter ([[Rob Huebel]]). They talk about the urge to have sex, despite him having a wife and then proceed to have sex in his hotel room. During this, Billy is shown to hang out with himself, mainly eating snacks in a hallway of the hotel. As Rachel is back in her room, she recites lessons, watches movies and looks at old text messages from her deceased mother.  The next day, Rachel goes to a car mechanic and Billy insists on joining her while the other two students rehearse their monologues. After being told her car needs to be repaired, she and Billy talk and bond together about them not having many friends. They then have lunch together. When they get back to the hotel, Sam asks where they were, particularly Billy since he wasn't rehearsing with everyone else. During the first round of competition, Margot goes first and panics while giving her monologue from ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. She runs into the bathroom and Rachel follows her. Rachel comforts Margot telling her that everything will be okay, not at the moment but later on. Margot then tells Rachel that her parents paid for the entire trip with the chance they win, their school can put on a play. During dinner, Margot suggests that Rachel get the number of the waiter serving, which she doesn't want to. Billy asks Margot to leave her alone, but calls her by her first name, in which she leaves. Back at the hotel, Rachel visits Walter and attempts to hang out with him, but he is disinterested and she leaves. Billy then visits her room and apologizes for dinner. He then proceeds to run around the hallway and then into Rachel's room, in which they hang out. Rachel then confides in Billy about her favorite memory about her mother, and Billy comforts Rachel. After this confession, she tells Billy to leave. Sam then comes in, followed by Margot. Sam tells everyone about an encounter with a boy he met up with during the competition who stood him up. Rachel tells him that they are there for him, which prompts Billy to leave.  On Sunday, Billy gives his monologue from ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', which gains a positive response from the audience. After the round, Billy tells Rachel that he is nervous and that he is off his medication. Rachel is then concerned for Billy and calls the principal about it. She then goes outside and sees Walter, smoking a cigarette. They talk about their jobs, particularly about how he doesn't care about his students' personal lives, which Rachel disagrees with him. The awards are then presented and Billy gets second place. As they prepare to leave, a boy comes up to the car and asks for Sam, which then leads them to a possible relationship. On the car ride back to the school, Rachel forgets about the test and stops at a mini mart for Billy to take the test, with Margot and Sam being the moderators for it. Rachel gives him a B-. Back at the school, Rachel suggests that Billy talk to his parents about his medication or to see a therapist. Billy then suggests that Rachel needs someone to take care of her as well.  
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)
  For years, Abraham Portman has told stories to his grandson Jake about his childhood surviving in [[World War II]], battling monsters and living at a secret home for children in Cairnholm, Wales. According to Abe, the home's children and their headmistress Miss Alma Peregrine possess paranormal abilities and are known as "Peculiars". When Jacob turns sixteen, Jake responds to a panicked phone call from Abe, and goes to his house to find him dying with his eyes removed. Abe tells him to go to "the loop of September 3, 1943". After Abe dies, Jake glimpses a monster exactly like the ones described in Abe's stories hiding in the forest.  Jake's parents sign him up for psychiatrist check-ups, and following advice from his psychiatrist, Dr. Golan, and the lead of a letter from Miss Peregrine to Abe, Jake travels to Cairnholm with his father to investigate the children's home, whereupon he learns that it was destroyed during a [[Luftwaffe]] raid. However upon visiting the ruined house, he finds the children there alive and well. They take him through a portal in a cave and he emerges in the year 1943 when the house was still intact. Miss Peregrine greets him and explains that she belongs to a class of female Peculiars called "Ymbrynes" who can [[shapeshift]] into birds (in Miss Peregrine's case, a [[peregrine falcon]]) and manipulate time. To avoid persecution, she and the children hide from the outside world in a [[time loop]] she created, accessible only to Peculiars and set to September 3, 1943. This time loop allows them to live the same day repeatedly and avoid aging as long as they stay inside of it.  Jake is introduced to the rest of the children, including aerokinetic Emma Bloom, to whom he is attracted. Jake learns that he himself is a Peculiar and, like Abe, has the ability to see the invisible monsters from Abe's stories, "Hollowgast" (or "Hollows"). Hollows are invisible disfigured Peculiar scientists that resulted from killing an Ymbryne in a failed experiment to become immortal by harvesting her powers. Led by shapeshifter Mr. Barron, they hunt Peculiars to consume their eyeballs, which allows them to become "Wights", Hollows with regained visible human forms, but with milky-white eyes.  A wounded Ymbryne named Miss Avocet arrives and explains that Barron and the Hollows and Wights raided her January 2016 time loop at Blackpool, England, killed her children, and is trying to repeat his failed experiment by using more Ymbrynes. Jake realized earlier that a Hollow could be in the island after he sees eyeless sheep corpses in the present. Worried, Miss Peregrine decides to move out with her children and Miss Avocet. Jake returns to 2016 and realizes the Hollow is even closer after another victim was killed, so he goes back to the cave to warn his friends. However, he is followed by another visitor on the island, ornithologist John Lamont who reveals himself to be a disguise for Mr. Barron.  Barron reveals that he was about to gain Miss Peregrine's loop from Abe, but his hungry Hollow companion Mr. Malthus killed him before he could. Barron then posed as Dr. Golan and encouraged Jake to go to the island so he could find the loop. Using Jake as a hostage at the children's home, Barron forces Miss Peregrine to trap herself in bird form and takes her to Blackpool, leaving Jake, the children, and Miss Avocet as prey for Malthus. Malthus arrives and kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape just as the Luftwaffe bomb is about to destroy the house. Without Miss Peregrine to reset it, the house is destroyed and the loop closes, leaving Jake and the children stuck in 1943, but safe from Malthus, who is killed in the explosion. Rescuing a sunken ocean liner, they travel to Blackpool and enter its January 2016 loop, fight Barron's Wight and Hollow allies, and rescue Miss Peregrine and other captive Ymbrynes. Barron disguises himself as Jake, hoping to confuse the children who have come to finish him off. When the last remaining Hollow arrives it mistakes Barron for Jake and kills him, and is in turn killed by Jake.  Before the time loop closes, Emma tells Jake that because of Miss Peregrine's injury in the battle, the children will live in 1943 and that they will handle the Hollows. Jake says goodbye to them as they exit and return to their ship in 1943, while he stays in his year of 2016. He travels back to Florida and relates his adventures to his grandfather, who is alive and well, as Barron’s death in the beginning of 2016 erased his presence in Florida later on. Abe gives Jake a map of international time loops and money from different countries and urges him to seek out Emma.  After months of searching and traveling, Jake reaches Emma and the children in 1943. Emma and Jake confess their feelings, and start traveling along with Miss Peregrine and the other children, searching for a new home.  
Misconduct (film)
 Arthur Denning (Hopkins) is the owner of a major pharmaceutical firm. He is very controlling of his girlfriend Emily Hynes (Åkerman), and she is physically intimidated by his security guards. She is abducted, and Denning is sent photos of her bruised face. He is ordered to go to an art gallery with the ransom. When a man approaches him, Denning attacks him, only to find out later that he was the gallery owner.   Before her abduction, Hynes reaches out to her ex-boyfriend Ben Cahill (Duhamel). Over drinks, she hints at Denning's abuse and some dirt she has on him. Back at her apartment, she shows Cahill files that she has stolen from Denning's laptop that reveal his criminal behavior during drug trials. She attempts to seduce Cahill. Later, she convinces a stranger to beat her up for the photo that she sends to Denning.   Cahill uses the information from Hynes to pitch a class action lawsuit to his boss Charles Abrams (Pacino) which he then files as a class action suit against Denning. Later that evening, Cahill is stunned to find Hynes dead in her apartment. With a bottle of pills in her hand, and a lethal cocktail of drugs in her system, her death is suspicious but possibly just a suicide. Cahill decides to leave the scene without reporting it to the police and tries to cover his tracks secretly telling only his wife about it.  At a preliminary deposition to the lawsuit, Denning suddenly settles the suit for $400 million, provided that the stolen documents are returned to him.  A short time later, Hynes body turns up in Cahill's home. Convinced he is being framed, he then confronts Denning who is amused at Cahill's passion, but assures him that he had nothing to do with it.   A hitman kidnaps Cahill and his wife Charlotte (Eve). Cahill manages to overpower and kill him. When he inspects the hitman's files he realizes that the villain of the piece is actually Abrams, who has been Denning's attorney for years. The settlement was all just an elaborate way of protecting Denning from criminal liability.   Cahill submits the hitman's files to the police who arrest Abrams. Before he can be taken into custody, Abrams grabs an officer's gun and commits suicide.   As Cahill packs for a move to a new house, he notices that some of his wife's clothing smells like Hynes' perfume. He asks her what happened between the two of them. Charlotte confesses that she confronted Hynes about her involvement with her husband. They had an argument in which Charlotte hit Hynes, causing her to fall and hit her head. Though Charlotte is a nurse, she did not help her and staged the scene for the police.  
Miss Sloane
  Elizabeth Sloane ([[Jessica Chastain]]) is a cutthroat lobbyist who has been called to appear at a congressional hearing led by Senator Ronald Sperling ([[John Lithgow]]) to answer questions about possible violations of Senate ethics rules during her tenure at [[Washington D.C.]] lobbying firm Cole Kravitz & Waterman.  Three months and one week earlier, Sloane's firm is approached by gun manufacturing representative Bill Sanford ([[Chuck Shamata]]) to lead the opposition to the proposed Heaton-Harris bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases, specifically by targeting female voters. Sloane ridicules Sanford's idea and is later approached by Rodolfo Schmidt ([[Mark Strong]]), the head of rival lobbying firm Peterson Wyatt, to instead lead the effort in support of the bill. Sloane agrees and takes most of her staff along with her, though her assistant Jane Molloy ([[Alison Pill]]) refuses to leave.  At Peterson Wyatt, Sloane selects Esme Manucharian ([[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]) to conduct the majority of the firm's media appearances, and they begin to make significant progress in garnering votes for the bill. Sloane confronts Esme with knowledge of her background as having witnessed a school shooting, and promises not to disclose the information, but Sloane breaks her promise and reveals Esme's secret during a live television debate. Later, Esme is held up at gunpoint while leaving her office, but her attacker is shot dead by another civilian who is legally carrying a gun. The gun lobby capitalizes on this event, which causes the Heaton-Harris bill to lose support in the Senate. This is compounded by the news of the senate inquiry into Sloane's potentially illegal lobbying practices.  The narrative returns to the congressional hearing. Senator Sperling produces a form requesting approval of overseas travel for a senator. It was filed by a non-profit organization but completed in Sloane's handwriting, indicating she illegally played a role in arranging the travel. Sloane also swears under oath that she has never practiced illegal wiretapping.  In her final statement at the hearing, Sloane admits she anticipated the opposition might attack her personally if Peterson Wyatt made too much progress with the Heaton-Harris bill. She reveals that she had someone (Jane Molloy) secretly working for her the entire time, and that she had indeed used wiretapping, to record Senator Sperling accepting bribes from Cole Kravitz & Waterman boss George Dupont ([[Sam Waterston]]).  Ten months later, Sloane is visited by her lawyer in prison, and it is revealed the Heaton-Harris bill passed but at the cost of her career.  The film ends with Sloane being released from prison.

She raises her three kids Vyom (Satyam Sharma), Saloni (Aashna Mehta) and Vismay (Saumya Shah), with much love and care, and now that the kids are grownups, she is wondering if she should resume her career. Over the years, she has devoted her time and sacrificed her career for her children. But the kids now find her ‘old fashioned’ and start to visualize a new image of her on their own. They demand their mother to be a modern and trendy lady. When Aparna wants to resume her career, the kids gradually intensify their demand to make mummy a modern woman. Their definition of modern is simple: everything has to be ‘western’ and not ‘Gujarati’. Aparna tries to pacify them but peer pressure makes the kids more resolute in their demand for a modern mummy. They call it ‘mission mummy’. The mission is then implemented and everything changes in that family, forever.  The film beautifully touches on the important issue that in ‘happy families’ of Gujarati community, there is a ‘set trend’ of growing gap between mother and kids. It is not just a schism between the generations, it is a gap between the culture within the house and the culture outside. The strength of this film is that it presents a serious issue in a light-hearted and vibrant manner.<ref></ref>  
Missing (2016 film)
   Ji-sun is a workaholic divorced woman working at a PR Company. Her job doesn't leave her with a lot of time to spend with her 1 year old daughter, Da-eun. Once, when her former nanny, a Chinese woman, had hit and injured Da-eun, Ji-sun had fired her but not being accustomed to taking care of her little girl, she had desperately been in need of a new nanny. Enter, Han-Mae, a young Chinese woman claiming to have a lot of experience with kids. Due to her poor conversational skills, Ji-sun had been hesitant in employing her, but when she managed to calm a crying Da-eun down within seconds, Ji-sun changed her mind and employed her immediately. She had also been entangled in a custody battle with her ex-husband, Jang Jin-hyuk, for her daughter. While her husband, a physician by profession, himself isn't too keen to have his daughter, her mother-in-law doesn't want to give up her granddaughter.  One day she received a call from her lawyer asking why she had not reached the court yet. Turns out Han-Mae had received the notice but had not mentioned it to Ji-sun, not knowing the importance of the document. She goes looking for Han-Mae to confront her about the mail, but neither she nor Da-eun are in the house. Ji-sun recalls that she had mentioned going to the clinic for Da-eun's vaccination. In the court, the judge reaches the conclusion that due to her workaholic nature and mental instability due to work and her divorce, Ji-sun had been told to hand over the girl to her in-laws months ago, but she did not abide by it. Her lawyer advises her to beg to her husband to let her keep the girl since there was no other way for her to achieve that.  On reaching home, Ji-sun finds it weird that none of the chores are done and on searching the house, Han-Mae and Da-eun are still not home. She goes around the neighbourhood, calling their names and starts becoming worried when she doesn't get any answer back. Her calls to Han-Mae also go unanswered. The security guard calls Han-Mae's protectiveness towards Da-eun peculiar. She even goes all the way to China-town to look for Han-mae, but that's a dead-end. Growing tired from all the worrying, Ji-sun falls asleep only to be woken up the next morning by her mother-in-law banging on the door. She has come to take Da-eun away. Ji-sun avoids her and heads for her car, determined to find Da-eun. She goes to the clinic that Han-Mae said she would take Da-eun to, only to find out that they had last come in 2 days ago and she had filled a prescription for a month's worth of flu medicines for the baby, something that mothers do when going on a long trip with their babies. To top it off, her neighbour's nanny, who had introduced Han-Mae to her as her niece, calls her back after getting a frantic voice-message from her. To Ji-sun's horror, she tells her that Han-Mae was not her niece and that she had paid her to introduce her in such a way. She reaches the police-station, now growing suspicious of Han-Mae. Her lawyer calls her after getting a call from her husband's lawyer, suspecting that she is trying to hide Da-Eun so her mother-in-law won't be able to take her away. He warns her of the price she would have to pay if does anything like that. Scared, she runs away from the police station not even realising that Han-Mae had forged her Foreigner Identification documents and the actual Piao Han-Mae was someone else.  She reaches home where she sees a man lurking around her flat. She grows suspicious of him when she recalls seeing him in front of her flat a few days ago as well. On confronting him, he reveals that Han-Mae owes him some money and he came here in order to get it back. She tells him that Han-Mae and her daughter have gone missing and he takes her to a Prostitution Bar in China-town, where Han-Mae used to work before. He takes her to a room where all the girls are waiting and in her paranoia, she mistakes another girl for Han-Mae and walks in on her and a customer in a room. The owner sympathises with her once she hears that her daughter is missing and promises to call her if she ever comes across or hears news of Han-Mae.  Just as she leaves the bar, she gets a call from a man claiming to have her daughter hostage. The man warns her not to calls the police and scares her even more when she hears Da-eun and Han-Mae's voices crying for help. Scared, she transfers all the money she has in her account to the kidnapper and is then instructed to go to the Yeouido Wharf. She runs around shouting Da-eun's name when she reaches the wharf, only to be greeted by a bag of her toys by the river, one of which she had bought for her very recently. The police arrive there shortly, Ji-sun having called them on the way.  She finally goes to the police station to lodge a missing person's report and the officer, Detective Park, finds it suspicious that she is lodging the report so late, having last seen the duo 2 days ago. She also realises that the call earlier had just been a [[Voice phishing]] call. Since Han-Mae can't be contacted at the moment, the police ask her to provide their photos. But, while there are plenty of Da-eun's photos, surprisingly, there is not even a single photo of Han-Mae in her phone while she distinctly remembers the 3 of them clicking a photo together on Da-eun's 1st birthday. In the midst of this, her mother-in-law bursts into the police station and demands to know where Ji-sun is hiding her daughter. She claims that Ji-sun and Han-Mae are working together in order to hide Da-eun. This is news to Detective Park who then proceeds to call her lawyer. He finds it suspicious as well that her daughter disappeared just days after she was served a detention. He tells her how big the problem is considering she doesn't even know Han-Mae's personal details and that her Foreigner ID was fake and even her phone was a burner phone.  She slips out of the police station and goes straight to her building, analysing the CCTV tapes from Thursday. She sees that they left on Thursday morning and were not seen since then. While she is reviewing the tapes, the security guard brings a high-schooler with him. The boy tells her that he had seen Han-Mae once, back when the other Chinese nanny was working for Ji-sun. The woman had brought Da-eun out shopping for fruits and were on their way back when a woman on a bicycle kept circling them. She had jerked the bag of fruits out of the nanny's hand, who then ran after it to collect the fallen produce. While the nanny was distracted, the woman had unbuckled Da-eun's safety belt and pushed the stroller downhill, causing it to crash and resulting in Da-Eun getting seriously injured. The high-schooler had revealed himself then and the woman had given him her bicycle and instructed him to keep quiet. It is now that we see that the woman was indeed Han-mae.  Distressed by this new information, Ji-sun hurriedly drives out her building premises just as the detectives come in to see her. With the resolution that she will find Da-eun on her own, she goes back to the bar. While she is waiting on the couch for the girl she had seen the other day, the owner tells Ji-sun how similar her and Han-Mae's habits are, referring to their shared habit of scratching the couch in their nervousness. In a flashback, we see Han-Mae when she had first come to the bar, looking for a job. In her broken [[Hangul]], she had promised to work hard because she needed money. She had given her the name 목련 (Mok-ryeon - Magnolia). Just then a customer had walked in, who turned out to be Park Hyeon-ik, the man who had brought her there before. He had fallen in love with Han-Mae at first sight and had grown closer since he knew how to speak Mandarin. During one of their sessions, she had asked him about local anesthesia and had told him that she wanted to give her liver to someone. Mysteriously, she went somewhere everyday at 2pm and stayed out for 2–3 hours at a time. She never told anyone where she went. Amongst the things she left behind at the bar, Ji-Sun is surprised to find a photo of a baby. At the back of the photo, she finds the name of the studio and the date on which the photo was taken.  While Ji-Sun goes in search of 'Mihwa Studio', she ignores calls from the detectives and her husband. At the police station, CCTV footage shows her entering the lift with Park Hyeon-ik, who seems to be well known amongst the detectives. While they decide to look up Park Hyeon-ik, Ji-sun reaches the location of Mihwa Studio, which has now been renamed to 'Baby Love Studio'. Reaching the gates, she suddenly hears Da-eun calling out to her. Following the voice she sets out into the dark town. She seems to be in a nightmare as she sees Han-Mae and Da-eun and remembers her husband and mother-in-law admonishing her and she sees Han-Mae, with her back towards Ji-sun, holding a bloody Da-Eun. As she turns around, Ji-sun's face is seen covered in blood and she wakes up from her nightmare with a start, having fallen asleep in her car.  She wakes up just in time to see the owner opening shop for the day. He tells her that the photo was taken before the remodeling of the shop. He finds the negatives of the photo she brought and Han-Mae was indeed the mother of the child, so protective that she didn't even let the owner hold her daughter. He had registered the father's name as Han Suk-ho and the mother's name as Kim Yeon. The detectives come to the bar, having come across the same information. They find Han-Mae suspicious, having come to Korean after marriage, had a baby, then disguised herself as a nanny with a fake name and disappeared with the baby. They also suspect that she and Park Hyeon-ik conspired together. Meanwhile, Ji-sun pays a visit to Han-Mae's last known address in Chungcheon, having gotten it from the studio owner. She pays a visit to the now empty house but is soon interrupted by a neighbour who empathised with Han-Mae as his wife was a foreigner as well. They remember coming to their house so that the 2 women could learn Hangul together, but her mother-in-law and husband had strongly refused that. She is abused by both of them, both physically and emotionally, for not speaking the same language and for not being able to provide a child. They punish her by cutting off her long hair which draws sympathy from the neighbour's wife. He further tells her how things improved a bit when she finally conceived and she became much happier.  But things went back to being worse when one day her daughter, Jae-In, got sick. Having told to go to a hospital to avoid complications, her in-laws take the child away from her and leave in their car not wanting to spend much on a girl, leaving Han-Mae stranded in front of the clinic. She had run after the car, pleading and crying, but to no avail and that was the last time the neighbour saw her, having run away with her daughter a few days later. She had then once contacted the wife to tell her that her daughter got better after treatment in Seoul and she shows her a picture of the healthy baby. That is when the police chase her and take her to the police station. Han-Mae's mother-in-law is there to report her son missing since the last 2 days, but Ji-sun can't connect the names. She looks at the photo of the baby and realises the hospital she got treated at must be the Gangnam Catholic Hospital (the same hospital her husband works at), having seen an ID tag from the hospital amongst her belongings in the bar. The detectives release 'Missing' posters of Jae-in and it is revealed that Jae-in suffered from [[Biliary atresia|Congenital Biliary Atresia]] and she needed a liver transplant. She was not a suitable match and the father never got tested. They connect the dots and figure out that that must be why she abducted Da-eun, the process being easier with Hyeon-ik being an infamous Organ Trafficker. An elderly nurse at the hospital seems to recognise the kid, but keeps it to herself when no one seems interested in hearing her out.  The detectives head to an accident site where a man fitting Han Suk-ho's description is burnt inside the car. Ji-Sun is relieved to hear that no kid's body was found but is a little disturbed to hear that the accident must have taken back a week ago. A flashback from a week ago shows us that Han-Mae had returned home late in the night and Ji-sun, worried for her, had walked in on her undressing - her face was a nervous sweaty mess and her back had scars from abuse. In the present, Ji-sun enters the hospital with the detectives when she hears the same lullaby that Han-Mae used to sing. Following the sound, it turns out to be the elderly nurse from before. She tells them that Han-Mae was famous in the hospital as 'The Singing Chinese Woman'. People were subconsciously attracted to her when she sang to her daughter, some nurses stopping to listen to her. She had come across some financial problems with her daughter's hospital bills and had asked Hyeon-ik for help. He had convinced her to sell her organs in exchange for money, but help didn't come fast enough and her daughter was forcibly discharged. She hit her surgery site and started bleeding and in an attempt to get up, she accidentally snatched Ji-sun's husband's ID card. Looking back at the bed her daughter had just occupied, Han-Mae looks at the new occupant with hatred, the new occupant being Da-eun.  The nature of the case is changed to a Case of Kidnapping and Ji-sun goes home to a crowd of investigators, now investigating from a new angle. In a flashback, Da-eun was taken to the hospital for acute Pneumonia and her father was furious at her not being given a bed and for being kept in the ER for hours. Being an employee, he had pulled some strings and forcibly discharged Han Jae-in and this realisation strikes Ji-sun as she feels that that is where it all began. As she moves to the table, she sees a patchwork quilt that Han-Mae had made herself and embroidered the name 'Jae-in' at the back. She recalls back to how she had once fed her frozen kimchi. This prompts her to search the kimchi fridge. As she throws down all the boxes in the fridge, she comes across a cooler at the bottom. She opens the box and inside is a body of a child wearing the same clothes that Da-eun was wearing on her 1st birthday. She collapses in shock while her mother-in-law insists that the child is not Da-eun.  We flashback to after Han-Mae had discharged Jae-in and taken her home with her. Yellow with disease and burning with fever, Jae-in became very sick. Han-Mae ran out with Jae-in in her arms, but stopped on the way when she realised that Jae-in had already passed away. She broke down in the middle of the street, loudly mourning her loss. In the present, Ji-sun slips out of the house now filled with detectives and goes to sit on the swing in the playground. She remembers one day when she had come home to see Han-Mae sitting on the same swing with Da-Eun in her arms and how she had been so fond of her, even making plans to go to the beach in summer.  Park Hyeon-ik is taken into questioning where he refuses to disclose anything about Han-Mae, willing to take the fall himself. But he wavers when Ji-Sun falls at her feet and says she will do any thing and everything, begging him to return Da-eun to her. Another flashback takes us shortly after Jae-in had been discharged. He had given her the money which she then gave to her husband, as without his consent Jae-in couldn't be treated. We also see that he had indeed brought the money as soon as he could, running to her. But he was still late as he reached the hospital to find Han-Mae sitting outside with Jae-in in her arms, anger burning in her eyes. In the present, Hyeon-ik explains to Ji-sun that he didn't see her after that incident until a month ago when she asked him to kill her husband. When he hesitates, she offers Da-eun in exchange, saying that he could either ask for ransom or sell her off somewhere. But she had not held up her end of the deal and had run off with Da-Eun instead. Ji-sun vows to kill her if she touches a hair on Da-eun's body. Seeing her grieved, Hyeon-ik says that she had asked him to make a passport for her baby long ago, having had plans to go back to her country after earning some money. But now her baby's dead, so everyone joins the dots and assume she wants to flee with Da-eun.  The closest escape route seems to be a China bound ship for 1pm, and everyone heads there. Running into the boat when the officers are not looking, Ji-sun goes from room to room looking for the 2 when she spots them outside the window of a room. She runs to them but Han-Mae spots her before she can reach her and a chase ensues, resulting in the two women facing off on the hull. Han-Mae is in an illusion, thinking that Da-eun is Jae-in. She threatens to jump off when she sees herself surrounded by the police. Ji-sun tries to lure her with the patchwork quilt that Han-mae had made for Jae-in. She wavers after seeing the quilt. Ji-sun offers to jump off the ship herself as she apologises for the hospital incident, saying that Da-sun doesn't deserve to die and she wouldn't like to see her die either as she knows that Han-mae loves Da-eun as well. As she looks down at Da-eun, she sees Jae-in instead and finally realising that she is not her daughter, she hands Da-eun to Detective Park. Out of grief, Han-Mae jumps off the ship as Ji-sun throws herself after her to save her. She catches hold of her, but Han-Mae pulls her hand away from Ji-sun and she goes further and further down the deep sea, clutching Jae-in's quilt. As she goes down, she thinks back to the time she was pregnant with Jae-in and was telling her that she was going to make her the happiest baby in the world.  Ji-sun wakes up in her hospital bed, her first thought being Da-eun. The nurse brings her outside where she sees Da-eun playing with the other kids. Ji-sun kneels down and calls for Da-eun. She gets a bit depressed when Da-eun doesn't react to her at first, but then starts tearing up when she gets up and toddles towards Ji-sun, walking straight into her open arms and calling her "Mama".  
Mohenjo Daro (film)
 The film opens in 2016 B.C. with Sarman, a young man from the village of [[Amri, Sindh|Amri]], who lost his parents at a young age. Sarman kills a crocodile that has been terrorizing his village's fishermen and is hailed as a hero. He asks his uncle, Durjan, to allow him to go to Mohenjo Daro to trade their family's goods, but his uncle refuses. Sarman attempts to sneak away to the city at night with his friend Hojo, but is caught by Durjan, who relents and allows both friends to go. He gives Sarman a seal that contains an inscription of a unicorn that Sarman often sees in his dreams, suggesting he use it only in a life or death situation.  Arriving in Mohenjo Daro, Sarman learns that the city is ruled by the tyrant chief Maham and his wicked son Moonja. He also learns that the unicorn he sees in his dreams is the symbol of the city, and feels as if the city is oddly familiar to him. While Sarman is trading, Maham proposes to impose an additional tax on the farmers so that the city may grow, but Sarman leads the farmers to oppose the taxes so that their families don't starve to death. Sarman gains access to the upper city by showing his uncle’s amulet and falls in love with Chaani, daughter of the head priest of Mohenjo Daro. Upon meeting, the head priest strangely appears to recognize Sarman. Chaani reveals that she has been forcibly betrothed to Moonja, Sarman's enemy, who is cruel and ruthless. Maham discovers Sarman and Chaani love each other and that Sarman is the leader of the tax revolt, and so he challenges Sarman to fight Bakar and Zokhar, his two champions. Sarman proposes that if he wins, Chaani will be released from her engagement, and Maham accepts the terms.  The head priest reveals to Sarman how Maham was expelled from Harappa for illegal trade with the Sumerians. Maham entered Mohenjo Daro as a trader and quickly rose to become the trade chief. Maham had discovered that the mighty Sindhu River held vast gold deposits, so he decided to place a dam on the river and divert its course to mine the gold. The wise Senate Chief Srujan, who is revealed to be Sarman's father, opposed this but Maham won the vote to build the dam. He had Srujan framed and arrested for hoarding gold. Chaani's father and Durjan - Sarman’s uncle - were coerced by Maham to betray Srujan, and the latter was killed. Maham then took Srujan's place as the new Senate Chief. It is now up to Sarman to defeat the evil Maham and gain revenge for his father.  In the arena, Sarman faces the ferocious Tajik mountain cannibals Bakar and Zokar in an arena before the city. After a vicious battle, he kills one of the cannibals but spares the other and the people of Mohenjo Daro surge even stronger behind him. Enraged, Maham urges Moonja to finish off Chaani and the priest. Moonja kills the priest but Sarman saves Chaani and kills Moonja.  Chaani exposes Maham’s plan to use the gold from the Sindhu to enrich himself and to smuggle in weapons from the Sumerians. All the chiefs now stand against Maham. The people elect Sarman as the new chief but Sarman suggests Mohenjo Daro needs a people’s government, not a chief. Sarman realizes that the dam will burst and the Sindhu River will flood the city. He rallies the people to lash boats together and form a floating bridge. They evacuate Mohenjo Daro and cross to the other side of the river. The dam collapses, and Maham, chained in the city square, is drowned. The once renowned Mohenjo Daro is no more. The survivors migrate to another river, where Sarman sees the unicorn of his dreams and names the river [[Ganga]].  
Moana (2016 film)
  On the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean, using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[Māui (mythology)|Maui]], the shapeshifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by Te Kā, a volcanic demon, losing both his magical giant fishhook and the heart to the depths.  A millennium later, Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, is chosen by the ocean to return the heart to Te Fiti. However, Tui arrives and takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Moana's mother, Sina, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, rotting the coconuts and dwindling the number of fish caught. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back on Motunui.  Moana's grandmother Tala shows her a secret cave, where a number of ships are hidden, revealing to Moana that their people used to be voyagers. Tala explains they stopped when Maui stole Te Fiti's heart and that Te Kā's darkness is poisoning the island, but it can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill shortly after and dies.  Moana sets sail on a [[camakau]] found in the cavern. She is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds the stranded Maui, who traps her and steals the camakau, but Moana catches up to him with help from the ocean. She demands that Maui return the heart but he refuses. Maui is accompanied by a sentient "Mini-Maui" tattoo, acting as his conscience.  They are attacked by Kakamora—coconut-armored pirates—who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to obtain his magical fishhook, which is located in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, and is in the possession of Tamatoa, a giant, greedy [[coconut crab]]. Maui retrieves his fishhook while Moana distracts Tamatoa, but Maui discovers he cannot control his shapeshifting and loses self-confidence, quickly becoming overpowered by Tamatoa. Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing and regains control of his powers.  The two arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te Kā, who badly damages Maui's fishhook. Fearful he will lose his hook, and therefore his power, Maui angrily abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart from Moana. Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te Kā. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te Kā, destroying his fishhook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te Kā is Te Fiti without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to restore Te Fiti's heart, transforming her back to normal. Te Fiti then heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his fishhook and falls into a deep sleep.  Moana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people on a voyage.

The Monkey King 2
  500 years after Sun Wukong's ([[Aaron Kwok]]) imprisonment under the Five Fingers Mountain, a young Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang ([[Feng Shaofeng]]) sets out for a journey to the Thunder Monastery in India to collect Buddha's scriptures. When he is attacked by a tiger, he is forced to free Wukong and the Monkey King learns that he has to protect the monk throughout the journey, because the Bodhisattva Guanyin ensured he would be bound by an enchanted circlet that can cause him pain whenever Tang Sanzang chants a certain sutra. Soon the duo meet Zhu Bajie ([[Xiaoshenyang]]), a lustful pig demon, and Sha Wujing ([[Him Law]]), a djinn-like monk.  The company travel to the Yun Hai Xi Kingdom, a land terrorized by the White Bone Demon ([[Gong Li]]) who has been eating people in order to extend her unnatural life and avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation. As the demoness learns about Sanzang, she decides to eat him in order to stop her reincarnation cycle and achieve everlasting demonhood. She takes the appearance of an old woman and lures the group into a cottage in the woods. To prevent Wukong from using his truth-seeking eyes to see through her disguise immediately, she throws tainted dust into his eyes that clouds his sight. Then while her disguised minions keep Wukong, Bajie and Wujing occupied, the demoness tells Sanzang a story about how she was forced to marry as a young girl, and when her village suffered famine, the people blamed her for it, even calling her an evil demon, and attempted to kill her as a sacrifice to the gods. As Tang comforts the old lady, she attempts to kill him, but is stopped by Wukong. The demoness escapes before Wukong can deal the killing blow and leaves the dead body of the old lady behind. Sanzang and the others don't believe Wukong that all the women he murdered were demons, and blame him for killing the innocent. Sanzang punishes Wukong by chanting the sutra and causing the circlet to tighten painfully on his head. Afterwards, Sanzang climbs to the top of a mountain where Wukong is sulking. Sanzang tells Wukong he thinks they are both very alike, for they both only trust what their own eyes sees. But together, they are better able to discern the truth. This is why they were all chosen to be on this journey together.  The group arrives to the kingdom's capital and the King ([[Fei Xiang]]) throws a feast for them, begging Sanzang to exorcise the bloodthirsty demoness from their land. Suddenly Lady White appears and demands the monk, but he offers her his help in enlightenment instead. She tells Wukong that they are both very alike, and tries to persuade Wukong to let her devour the monk, but he deceives her instead and a fight ensues. During the chaos, the King's guards kidnap Sanzang. It is revealed that it's been actually the King kidnapping and killing the children in a desperate attempt to cure himself of a cursed disease by drinking their blood. He tries to kill Sanzang, but Wukong arrives and saves the monk and the surviving children as well. All of the group are celebrated as heroes, but as a little girl approaches Sanzang, Wukong beats her and her mother to death as well, because his truth-seeking eyes perceive both were possessed by the White Bone Demon. In a fit of anger and disbelief, Tang banishes Wukong away. As soon as Wukong leaves, Sanzang gets kidnapped by the demoness.  In the demoness' lair, The White Bone Demon gives Sanzang a day to convince her to give up her evil ways and embrace nonviolence and enlightenment as the true path to immortality. She reveals to him the story she had told him earlier was true, recounting her previous life as a mortal. Right before Sanzang's time is up, he is saved by Wukong at the last minute. Wukong, Baije and Wujing fight the White Bone Demon and her army and finally defeat her, with Wukong mortally wounding her. The Buddha comes down from the Heavens to collect the defeated demoness' soul and banish it to oblivion but Sanzang pleads Buddha to grant her mercy and give Sanzang one last chance to save her soul from destruction. Buddha tells him that he would have to lead her on the path herself, meaning he would have to sacrifice his own life. The monk begs the demoness to show remorse and accept the Wheel of Reincarnation, but the White Bone Demon would rather die as a broken tainted soul in Sanzang's body instead of returning to the Wheel of Reincarnation. Saddened, Tang begs Wukong to kill him, too. The Monkey King refuses at first, but Sanzang explains how he used to think he just had to recite Buddha's teachings to convince people to become good. Now he understands he must also lead by example and do good in order to convince people. Sanzang had to do this for his own journey towards enlightenment. Wukong finally understands the monk's desire to help the demoness change her fate, and tearfully agrees, promising Sanzang to wait for his return. Wukong brings his staff down and Sanzang's body is changed into a statue. In return Sanzang says if he gets a chance to do so in his next life, he would be glad to be Wukong's master again. Because of Sanzang's sacrifice, he succeeds in leading the demoness to her next reincarnation, freeing her of her pain and hatred.  Some time later, Wukong and his friends still wait for the return of the monk, but continue their journey to the Thunder Monastery. Wukong rides on Sanzang's horse with Sanzang's statue strapped to his back. From Heaven, Guanyin drops a bead of water from her magic vase that falls to earth and hits right at Sanzang's hand. The surface cracks, revealing a human finger underneath.  
Money Monster
 Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, ''Money Monster''. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview about the crash, but Camby unexpectedly left for a business trip to Geneva.  Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. He is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on the show. Kyle was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, he will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.  With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and find Camby for him, though Kyle is not satisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He also is not satisfied by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied by her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues to contact a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position unless someone meddled with it.  Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. New York City police find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, seemingly taking pity on Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong.  Once Camby finally returns, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that he did not go to Geneva but to Johannesburg.  With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the ''Money Monster'' team contact a group of Icelandic [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] to seek the truth. After a police sniper takes a shot at Lee and misses, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], where Camby is headed according to Diane. They head out with one of the network's cameramen, Lenny, plus the police and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers.  It turns out that Camby bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owners stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. If Camby's plan had succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when work resumed at the mine and the stock of the mine's owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe the union leader, Moshe Mambo, in order to stop the strike, but Mambo refused and continued the strike, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the flailing company.  Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. Camby admits to his wrongdoing to Kyle on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away, then much to Lee's dismay gets fatally shot by the police. In the aftermath, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] announces that IBIS will be put under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].

A Monster Calls (film)
  Twelve-year-old Connor O'Malley must face his mother's terminal cancer, his strict grandmother, his estranged father, and the school bully, Harry. One night at 12:07&nbsp;a.m., Connor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells Connor it has come to tell him three true stories, after which Connor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Connor refuses to do.  ; First story An old king who has lost his entire family (with his sons killed in fierce battles and his wife committing suicide in her grief) save a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes of age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the kingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep under a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman murdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have done it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the queen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the rest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the farm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered the farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster, the prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.  ; Second story An [[apothecary]] follows old traditions and beliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less popular as a local [[parson]] tells his congregation not to accept the apothecary's old ways and denying the apothecary use of an old Yew tree. When the parson's two daughters become sick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and deliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he cannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.  While the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved lives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life. The parson was a man of belief but was willing to discard his beliefs when they were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.  ; Third story A man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the Monster to ensure people would notice him. Though people now notice him, the man finds himself more alone than before.  ; Fourth story Connor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has been pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and Connor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails and his mother falls. The Monster forces Connor to confess the truth: Connor loosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in order to stop the pain of having to hold on.  Through the Monster, Connor ultimately understands that although he does not want his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Connor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Connor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.

Tired of taking care of her abusive, alcoholic mother, Lizzy makes it clear she wants to live with her father permanently. As night falls, Kathy hits a [[wolf]] with her car.

Morgan (2016 film)
 Lee Weathers is a "risk-management specialist" for genetic-engineering company SynSect. She arrives at a rural site hosting its L-9 project, an artificial being with nanotechnology-infused [[synthetic DNA]] named Morgan. The "hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision making and sophisticated emotional responses" is smarter than humans and matures quickly, walking and talking within a month and physically a teenager despite being five years old.  The cold and precise Weathers—she insists on calling Morgan "it"—is at the site to assess the project after a psychologist evaluates Morgan, after she used a pen to stab Dr. Kathy Grieff in the eye. Over dinner with the team of eight scientists, Weathers (who speaks Chinese) and project leaders Dr. Lui Cheng and Dr. Simon Ziegler discuss an incident in Helsinki involving Cheng in which 21 SynSect researchers were killed in an hour by "crude prototypes."  Lee learns that Morgan attacked Grieff when she was prohibited from leaving her room, a glass cell, after killing a deer impaled on a fallen tree while outside. The scientists have raised Morgan from birth following two failed attempts, and most consider her to be their child; Grieff defends Morgan to Weathers despite her injury, and Dr. Amy Menser wants to resume taking her on outings. The latter promises Morgan to take her to a nearby lake that she describes as wonderful; the behavioral therapist understands that Morgan is, despite her intellect and physical appearance and abilities, emotionally childlike. Although Morgan considers Cheng to be her "mother," the scientist is pessimistic about the project; she ended the outings because, Cheng tells Weathers, it is cruel to expose Morgan to a world she cannot be allowed to enter.  Psychologist Dr. Alan Shapiro arrives; when the [[artificial intelligence]] expert aggressively taunts Morgan as part of his evaluation, she kills him. Weathers tranquilizes Morgan after a brief escape, and decides that she is too unpredictable and must be terminated. The scientists refuse to kill Morgan; before Weathers can do so, they inject her with sedative and imprison her in the cell in which Morgan had been held. The scientists plan to escape with Morgan, but after waking she kills most of them, while Ziegler commits suicide.  In the scientists' house, Cheng records an apology for the failure of the project. The scientists tried to make Morgan "more human" than the previous attempts so she could exceed her design as a combat weapon, but found that the result was harder to control. Morgan arrives and, after conversing with her "mother" in Chinese, suffocates her. Weathers escapes the cell and briefly fights Morgan, able to match her. Morgan flees with the terrified Menser, who Morgan says is the only scientist who was a real friend to her.  Weathers and nutritionist Skip Vronsky follow the pair. The latter deduces that Morgan has forced Menser to take her to the lake, which entrances Morgan. She and Weathers fight again, seemingly matched in strength and speed. Morgan knocks down Weathers, who is impaled on the branch of a fallen tree. Morgan flees again but Weathers catches up and kills her. She shoots Menser and Vronsky to eliminate witnesses.  Weathers's superior at SynSect and another executive discuss the incident. They decide that it proves that the company's earlier L-4 project—Lee Weathers—is superior as a "perfect," less-emotional, human hybrid weapon. Elsewhere, Weathers makes the same gesture with her hands as Morgan.

She also never wants to spend time with him after midnight. After the two consummate their relationship on March 1, Takatoshi discovers Emi's journal that she purposefully left on the table.

The next day, Emi reveals that she is a being from a world in which time runs backwards; what humans perceive as the future she already experienced as her past, and vice versa.

Because her memories of him fade as time goes on (and her time goes backwards), she keeps a journal to remind her of him.

On March 16, the last day they would be together as equals, Takatoshi draws a sketch of Emi, then the two wait for the day to pass at the train station where they first met, after which Emi disappears.

Appa ([[Nana Patekar]]) who has been an acclaimed theatre actor during his days, garnering fame and fortune by acting in plays based on various works, especially of [[William Shakespeare]] and he also won the award and the highest title of ''NAT-SAMRĀT'' (emperor of acting in theatre).  Subsequently, Appa bequeaths all of his wealth to his children. He never keeps anything to himself and express his views very frankly. He does not mind adding expletives while expressing his views. Only his wife Kaveri ([[Medha Manjrekar]]), whom he fondly calls as 'Sarkar' and his close friend Rambhau ([[Vikram Gokhale]]) and  are able to understand his nature. His daughter-in-law Neha ([[Neha Pendse]]) and son Makrand ([[Ajit Parab]]) do not seem to appreciate his frank nature, which at times causes embarrassing situations for them when they have guests or when their daughter hurls expletives in school. The high point in their relationship comes when their granddaughter performs a folk dance taught by Appa, which is not appreciated by  her mother Neha. An argument follows between them and when they return home Neha slaps her daughter. Next day, Neha proposes to part ways with them by moving out, a ploy in which she anticipates Appa to grant them their space. Appa sees through her plan and decides to move out, while passing on a comment to his son "The whole world is a stage and unfortunately my part is a sad one."  Appa's wife Kaveri is very devoted to him and she does not question his decision. They move to their son-in-law and daughter Vidya's place. Appa continues with his carefree and frank ways, at times laden with few expletives. Their son-in-law, Rahul Barve ([[Sunil Barve]]) is a high ranking engineer in his company and is of a caring nature. Vidya ([[Mrunmayee Deshpande]]) also confronts similar embarrassing situations as Neha, but her husband Rahul does not seem to mind it. He appreciates Appa's poetry (To be or not to be, that is the question) and his fluent style of recitals.  On Vidya's anniversary Appa comes in an inebriated state and embarrasses Rahul's boss. Although next day Appa apologizes, Rahul does not seem to mind it and discards as one off incident.  Meanwhile, Appa remembers about his friend Rambhau and pays a visit to him. Rambhau is devastated after the demise of his wife Kumud. He lashes out at Appa for leaving him alone in his final days. The scene that follows is a heart touching conversation between Karna and Krishna enacted by Rambhau and Appa respectively while Rambhau is lying on his hospital bed. Mesmerized by Rambhau's performance and pitying his condition, Appa grants Rambhau his last wish.  The next day Appa returns to his son in law's house. Kaveri tells Appa that Rambhau had overdosed on sleeping pills and that he is no more to which Appa confesses that he gave the pills to him implying that, it was his last wish.  On another occasion Appa insults Rahul's boss's son when he could not stand his weak adaption of Othello. This irritates Vidya and she confronts her father. She makes their arrangement in her outhouse; however her husband still stands by Appa and regards this as a non-issue. Vidya makes sure that the outhouse is well maintained and they are taken good care.  One fine day Vidya misplaces money given to her by her husband and in a turn of events, she blames her parents for stealing it. This creates a rift between them. Vidya realizes her mistake later when she finds the money. She apologizes to her parents but it is too late as Appa and Kaveri have already decided to move out. Vidya's husband Rahul is still sympathetic with her parents but cannot change their hearts. In that night, they escape from the outhouse for their ancestral village where they have an old house in a dilapidated state. On the way they halt at a village, where Kaveri dies of fever. Appa is destroyed by this loss. He is supported by a boot polishwala named Raja. Raja is extremely poor and a homeless person who lives with his family under a bridge. Appa is at times in delusional state and suffers from the fact that the grandeur with which he had lived through as an actor is now making his pain unbearable in his state of loneliness and poverty. Appa serves tea at a tea stall where he enthralls his customers with his poetry recitals and dialogue from his plays. A man named Siddharth, who has a respect and great fondness for acting, continuously follows Appa, since, for Siddharth, he is a noble actor and an idol. Appa hides his real identity from Siddharth and refuses to acknowledge that he is 'Natsamrat'. Siddarth, however continues with his conviction regarding Appa being the great actor.  One day, Appa reads in the papers that his favorite theatre had burnt down in a fire. He goes there immediately and is completely shattered to see the theatre reduced to ashes. Siddharth also arrives there as he was following Appa. Here Appa starts reliving his old memories and also accepts Siddharth's clain that he is the real Natsamrat Ganpatrao when Siddharth reveals that he knew all about him and his past. His family and Raja also come there to find him. They request him to come home with him and to live with them but he refuses. The film ends magnificently albeit it has a tragic end. Appa is in a delusional state and shuffles between reality and the great personalities he had once portrayed as an actor on the very same stage. He gives his last performance on the theatre stage for Siddharth and says that, "Do you understand, dear Siddarth, this is what theatre acting is all about? To fulfill one's longing" He unexpectedly screams by placing a hand on his throat and collapses. Immediately everyone runs to hold him, but they find that he has already departed.<ref></ref>

Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising
 Two years after the events of the first film, Mac ([[Seth Rogen]]) and Kelly ([[Rose Byrne]]) are trying to sell their home with the arrival of another baby. A couple, Eric ([[Sam Richardson (actor)|Sam Richardson]]) and Jessica Baiers ([[Abbi Jacobson]]) are looking to buy; the realtor ([[Liz Cackowski]]) tells Mac and Kelly that their house is in escrow for 30 days, so the buyers will check in every now and then to make sure everything is okay. Meanwhile, Mac's friend, Jimmy ([[Ike Barinholtz]]), and his once-again wife Paula ([[Carla Gallo]]) are also expecting a baby. At the Phi Lambda sorority, Shelby ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), a freshman, learns that sororities are not allowed to host parties, and can only attend frat parties. Shelby goes to a frat party and meets two other freshmen, Beth ([[Kiersey Clemons]]) and Nora ([[Beanie Feldstein]]). They are disgusted by the sexist and perverse nature of the party and leave. Bonding over their dissatisfaction, the trio decides to set up a new sorority, Kappa Nu, to host their own parties.  Meanwhile, Teddy Sanders ([[Zac Efron]]) is at a dinner with his old frat brothers Pete ([[Dave Franco]]), Scoonie ([[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]), and Garf ([[Jerrod Carmichael]]). Since graduating, they had been successful in their own jobs: Pete is working as an architect and has [[Coming out|come out of the closet]], Scoonie has launched his own app, and Garf is now a cop. Due to the events from the first film, Teddy now has a criminal record and cannot get a worthwhile job to support himself (having been fired from his job as a shirt model). Since that time, he had continued blaming the Radners' for both the record and the loss of career opportunities. Pete's boyfriend Darren ([[John Early (comedian)|John Early]]) then proposes to him, and Pete accepts, leading Pete to ask Teddy to move out, which later escalates into an argument between the two. The following day, the girls try to rent the adjacent house to the Radners', but do not have enough money to pay for it. Teddy, finding an opportunity where he can be valued, offers to help them and suggests a successful way to afford the rent. That night, they throw their first party. Horrified to learn they are a sorority, Mac and Kelly ask Shelby to keep the noise down. Mac and Kelly report them to Dean Gladstone ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), but she is unable to intervene since they are an independent sorority and she fears that shutting it down may lead to a public relations nightmare regarding sexism.  The couple contact Shelby's father ([[Kelsey Grammer]]), but he fails to control the situation. Feeling outraged, the girls constantly haze the Radners. Mac, Kelly, Jimmy, and Paula retaliate by causing a [[bed bug infestation]] in the house, resulting in a [[fumigation]] just in time for the Baier's visit. The girls plan to raise money by selling weed at the school's tailgate and eliminating all the other competition by getting all the other weed dealers on campus arrested. Teddy strongly objects and the girls vote to kick him out of the house. Spurned, Teddy decides to join forces with the Radners to take down the sorority. They all go to the tailgate event to steal the weed. Teddy distracts the girls while Mac steals their weed supply. Shelby catches Mac, but he manages to escape. As gratitude for Teddy's help, Mac and Kelly allow him to stay at their place until he decides what he wants to do with his life, where he grows closer to them.  In retaliation for the tailgate, the girls switch Mac's and Kelly's phone numbers with their own, leading Kelly to become paranoid, and Mac to end up in Sydney, Australia. When he returns, Mac and Kelly find that they have been robbed and the sorority is selling their stuff and has spray-painted "Kappa Nu Steals From You" in the house. This causes the Baiers to threaten to pull out from the deal, while Mac and Kelly also reflect if they have been good parents. When the realtor of the sorority house reveals the girls are late on their payments, the Baiers give Mac and Kelly a day to get them out of the house. The girls find an eviction notice on their door. With barely any money to support themselves, Shelby says the only way they can win is to abandon their morals and resort to having a basic frat party with more sex appeal. They advertise the party to everyone on campus, leading to more people showing up at the house.  Jimmy and Paula sneak into the party while Teddy tries to shut off the power. Teddy gets into the electrical box, but the girls have a backup power source. While Jimmy ends up getting roofied, Shelby enters the Radners' house to cut off their phones. Mac and Teddy chase her to the garage, but get locked inside. They break out by using airbags from an old car.  Disgusted by how much they have degraded themselves, Beth and Nora decide to quit the sorority and blame Shelby for the disaster, leading the other girls to leave as well. Mac and Kelly feel sorry for the girls after hearing that Shelby only formed the sorority so she could make friends since back in high school she had none and was constantly bullied and rejected. They also realize that they too are setting a terrible example for their daughter with their behavior in ruining Kappa Nu by trying to evict the girls so they could allow the Baiers to move in to their old home. Relating to her own experience in being rejected through high school, Kelly helps the girls mend their friendship and to go back to what they believe in. The girls then kick the frat boys out and have a more empowering girl party. The success of being the first sorority to throw a party brings girls from Phi Lambda and other sororities who want to pledge for Kappa Nu. By the end of the night, the girls make enough money not only to keep their house, but to give the surplus to Mac and Kelly so they can rent out their house due to overflowing pledges. Mac and Kelly happily agree, as long as they get five money-buckets per month. Paula goes into labor, meanwhile Teddy apologizes to Pete and Darren for his behavior and gets reassurance that he will never lose his best friend. Mac and Kelly's anxiety about their parenthood is also alleviated as they realize they have been good parents all along.  Three months later, Teddy is helping Pete get ready to walk down the aisle. Teddy has become a wedding planner for gay couples and enabling him a worthwhile career. Mac and Kelly have now moved into their new home. They bring home their new baby, Mildred, to join Jimmy and Paula with their new son, Jimmy Jr.  
Neerja
 The film opens with 22-year-old [[Neerja Bhanot]] ([[Sonam Kapoor]]) arriving late for a house party. Later that evening, her mother Rama Bhanot ([[Shabana Azmi]]) expresses concern about Neerja's job as a flight attendant, suggesting that Neerja should return to her old modelling career. Neerja insists on keeping her job. She is driven to the airport by her friend Jaideep ([[Shekhar Ravjiani]]).  Neerja reflects on her brief, unhappy arranged marriage to Naresh ([[Kavi Shastri]]), a professional in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], who abused her over her small dowry and inability to perform household work. She eventually returned home for a modelling contract. Naresh sent her parents a letter complaining about the dowry and their daughter's lack of domestic skills, demanding that Neerja either bring back money or not return at all. Neerja left Naresh and landed a job with [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am Airways]].  As Neerja boards [[Pan Am 73]], it is revealed that the [[Abu Nidal]] organisation, a Libyan-sponsored Palestinian terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's [[Sahar International Airport]] and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had just enough time to escape, as the hijackers did not realise that the cockpit of a [[Boeing 747]] is located upstairs.  When an [[Indian American]] passenger reveals himself as an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft in front of the Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali ([[Shashi Bhushan]]), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.  The Pakistani negotiators inadvertently reveal the name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.  Around 17 hours later, the plane loses auxiliary power, and the lights go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]], India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.

Vee is then dared to get a tattoo chosen by Ian, who draws out a tattoo and refuses to show Vee. When Vee becomes impatient, he distracts her with [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s "[[C.R.E.A.M.]]" on the radio, one of her brother's favorite songs. While Vee is getting her tattoo, she briefly discusses her brother with Ian and reveals his death. She then raps along with the song until the finished tattoo is revealed to be a lighthouse. Ian's next dare is to ride his motorbike through the city blindfolded at 60&nbsp;mph, using Vee to steer his body; once completed, the two kiss. Vee and Ian soon become among ''Nerve''s top players.  Jealous at Vee's rise of popularity, Sydney accepts a dare to walk across a ladder suspended between two buildings. Though terrified of heights, Sydney participates in the dare but bails out when her phone drops, thereby losing the game. Ian takes Vee to Sydney's party and Vee catches her making out with J.P. After arguing with Sydney, Vee receives and completes the dare on which Sydney bailed. Vee's friend Tommy reveals that he was watching Ian's profile; Ian had accepted a dare to make Vee and Sydney fight. Vee realizes how dangerous ''Nerve'' is and reports the game to the police, but they do nothing. As punishment, all of the money is depleted from Vee and her mother's bank accounts. She is then punched in the face by elite player Ty as a dare.  Vee wakes up in a metal shipping container with "snitches get stitches" spray painted on the walls. An [[iMac G3]] in the container informs her that she broke the rules and is now a part of the game. Vee escapes the box and finds Ian, who confesses that he and Ty were players whose friend, Robbie, was killed in a dare. When they tried to alert the authorities, their families' jobs, bank accounts, and identities were confiscated, trapping them in the secret third category of the game: "prisoners". Vee is now a prisoner, too, and only the winner of the final round can regain their identity and their freedom.  Vee, Tommy, and Sydney recruit Tommy's [[hacker]] friends to alter the game's online code, but it is impossible to shut down ''Nerve'', as all the watchers act as a server to the game. After hanging from a crane for five seconds - the same dare that killed Robbie - Ian earns a spot in the finals in order to protect Vee. During the finals, which take place at [[Battery Weed]] on [[Staten Island]], Vee and Ian are each given a [[revolver]]: one must shoot the other to win. Ian offers to throw the competition and let Vee shoot him, but she refuses and Ty jumps from the audience to take Ian's place. Vee criticizes the watchers, whose identities are concealed behind masks, and tells them to show "nerve" at who they are and reveal themselves. She singles out a girl and urges her to take off her mask and reveal her name; though the girl looks uncertain, she does neither. The watchers then cast a vote regarding if Ty should kill Vee, with Ty egging them on. The majority vote is "yes", and Ty shoots Vee. She dies instantly and collapses in Ian's arms. Vee's mother, who has reached Tommy and is watching the events unfold on a TV, panics.  Tommy and his hackers modify ''Nerve''s source code to decrypt the watcher's code names and send them a message: "You are an accessory to murder". All watchers immediately log out of ''Nerve'', closing down the game's servers and effectively ending it once and for all. Ian aims his gun at Ty and Vee immediately sits up and tries to stop him, revealing that she is alive; she and Ian embrace. Vee tells Ian she is unharmed; she and Ty had staged her murder to scare the watchers into disbanding ''Nerve'' by loading Ty's gun with blanks and using fake blood for Vee. One of Tommy's hacker friends restores Vee's money and identity.  A few months later, Vee and Sydney have reconciled, Vee and Ian are a couple, and Vee is attending California Arts. Ian reveals that his real name is Sam, and they introduce themselves again in a moment of casual banter. The movie ends off with a kiss between Sam and Vee, with someone holding their phone and videotaping it.

Neruda (film)

The senator Pablo Neruda, former ambassador and well-known poet, speaks out forcefully against the repression. Warned that he is in danger, with his wife Delia he takes the road through the mountains to Argentina, but they are turned back at the frontier and have to go into hiding.  A keen young policeman, Óscar Peluchonneau, is appointed to lead the hunt for the fugitives. He reasons that to catch his man he must first get to know him, so he studies Neruda's life and poetry. Neruda meanwhile, wanting to mobilise resistance, makes sudden appearances and leaves volumes of his poetry with people. A game of cat and mouse ensues, with Peluchonneau and his police always a step behind. As the hunt gets too close, Neruda's friends arrange for some smugglers to take him over the frontier on horseback.  Delia has to stay behind and is questioned by Peluchonneau. She tells him that every story has a primary character, with the rest being secondary, and in this story the cop is secondary. This remark unsettles Peluchonneau, who plays the dedicated cop but has never been sure of his inner identity. She then destroys his confidence completely by saying that in this story Neruda with his poetry and political commitment is reality and will endure, but Peluchonneau is merely a fiction.  As Neruda's group climbs slowly through the wintry forests towards the frontier, Peluchonneau follows them but, unable to catch up, kills himself with his pistol. Hearing the shot, Neruda turns back and finds the corpse in the snow: Peluchonneau's insecure hold on reality has ended and he has melted back into fiction. Neruda flies to Paris, where he is welcomed by his friend [[Pablo Picasso]] and becomes a media sensation.

Never Back Down: No Surrender
  It's been two years since Case Walker has re-entered the world of professional mixed martial arts fighting, but had grown tired of it. He now competes in amateur bouts in an effort to teach his opponents how to utilize their skills. After such a match in Beaumont, Texas, Case runs into Brody James, an old friend who is also a MMA fighter. Brody has signed with PFC Combat, a promotion run by Hugo Vega, in which Brody has signed to fight the 7-foot beast Caesar Braga for the PFC Championship in Bangkok. Brody asks Case to help him train for the fight, knowing Case needs to find his way back as well as attempt to help Brody go on the straight and narrow. Case reluctantly accepts Brody's offer and goes to Thailand.  Case goes to the Top Fight Gym, where he already finds resistance from Brody's other trainer, Matty Ramos. Their difference in training methods make them rivals. To make matters worse, Case gets ridiculed for his training by Cobra O'Conor, a younger fighter whose arrogance gets the best of him. When Brody shows up, Cobra insists on taking Case on in a match of "old school vs. new school". Matty warns Cobra to take it easy, but the arrogant Cobra refuses to listen and faces Case. Case deflects Cobra's moves and uses elements from [[Goju Ryu]] to pound Cobra to a state of unconsciousness. Brody seems upset with Case with the pummeling of Cobra, but tells him he was kidding and that he agreed that Cobra had what was coming to him. Case soon finds himself becoming a mentor to two up-and-coming fighters, Taj and Creech. Case's pummeling of Cobra attracts the attention of Vega, who is revealed to have some sort of history with Case. PFC marketing director Myca Cruz begins to have a liking to Case and asks him on a date to get to know him, to which he agrees.   When Case has his date with Myca, Matty watches the two together and decides to use it against Case when it comes to Brody. Brody has been slowing down his training and Vega, in an effort to make the fight a success, recommends that Brody use steroids from his supplier to help him better himself. Matty tells Brody of Myca and Case, in which their date ends abruptly when Myca brings up Case's time in prison, making him feel very uncomfortable. When Brody offers to spar with Case, the session gets out of hand as Brody goes too far, hitting Case in the head, to which he retaliates in a way he never expected. Despite apologizing to Brody, their friendship seems to have ended. That is until Case notices Brody using steroids. After training one night, Case and Brody go out to eat. It is then when Brody realizes his mistakes and apologizes. He vows to Case he will do things the right way and even tells Case that Myca would be a good woman for him. Brody and Case work together to begin training for the fight along with Matty, who thanks to an intervention from Brody, agrees to work with Case in training Brody for the title fight. However, viral footage of Case beating up the racist policemen (from ''Never Back Down 2: The Beatdown'') has grabbed the attention of many, thus causing Vega to realize that Brody may not be the one worthy of the fight against Braga.  One day, Case arrives at the gym to see Brody working with Boris, a [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] specialist. Boris injures Brody's knee with a submission move, claiming he rolled the wrong way. However, Case becomes suspicious. When Vega arrives, he tells Case that the fight will happen and it will be Case against Braga in which Vega will pay him two million dollars. The next day, Case's suspicions were right as he breaks into Boris's locker to find a text message on his cell to Vega reading "It's done". Case confronts Boris, who admits to the deal. Beginning to train for the fight under the mentorship of Brody and the physical training from Matty, Taj confronts Case, accusing him of "selling out". Case knows that he is forced to fight, but must find a way to stop both Braga and Vega, who is set to make a lot of money off the fight and prove that he is responsible for Brody's injury.  At the night of the fight, [[Tony Jaa]] appears, mistaking Case for [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]], howling because he is a fan of the film [[Snow Dogs]]. Myca, who has become Case's girlfriend, tells Vega she quits. Case begins to think as he is wrapped up for the fight. However, he realizes how he can stop Vega and goes to Braga's locker room, confronting him. As Braga heads to the ring, Case stops him and asks him why if he is so tough it took two punches to knock out his wife. Braga, in total rage, begins to attack Case. The two go to blows outside of the ring, to the delight of the crowd and to the chagrin of Vega. When Braga gets the best of Case, Case resorts to using Kyokushin again, this time using a Nakadaka Ken (Extended Middle Knuckle Punch) that damages Braga's ribs. Case continues using traditional karate techniques and knocks Braga out with a Mawashi Kaiten Geri (Rolling Wheel Kick) to his head. Vega threatens to sue, but Case tells Vega that they have the proof of him causing Brody's injury and that suing could cost Vega millions of dollars. To make matters worse, Vega must pay back everyone who came to see the fight, to which he storms off in anger, knowing he has been defeated. Case, Myca, Brody, Matty, Taj, Creech, and Creech's new love interest, Jeeja (seen earlier training and beating up a fighter who beat Creech up badly in the ring) leave the ring arena knowing they have achieved victory.

The Nice Guys
 In 1977 [[Los Angeles]], a boy named Bobby witnesses the death of fading [[porn star]] Misty Mountains ([[Murielle Telio]]) in a car crash. Later that week, down-on-his-luck alcoholic private eye Holland March ([[Ryan Gosling]]) is approached by Mrs. Glenn ([[Lois Smith]]), Misty's aunt, who claims to have seen her niece alive after her supposed death. March is skeptical of her claim, but realizes that a missing girl named Amelia Kuttner ([[Margaret Qualley]]) is somehow involved and accepts the job. However, Amelia does not wish to be found and hires unethical enforcer Jackson Healy ([[Russell Crowe]]) to intimidate March into staying away from her.  Later that night, Healy is attacked at his home by two unnamed thugs credited as Blueface ([[Beau Knapp]])—so named after a [[dye pack]] in Healy's briefcase hits his face—and Older Guy ([[Keith David]]), who attempt to interrogate him about Amelia's whereabouts. After stunning the duo, Healy manages to ward them off with a hidden shotgun. He then teams up with a reluctant March to find Amelia before the thugs do. The two are assisted by Holly ([[Angourie Rice]]), March's young daughter, despite March's attempts to keep her out of the case for her own safety.  March and Healey investigate Amelia’s protestor group, and pay one of her friends, Chet ([[Jack Kilmer]]) to take them to Amelia’s boyfriend, Dean. They find out that Amelia and Dean, an amateur filmmaker, were working with Misty on an "experimental film"—equal parts pornography and [[investigative journalism]]—called ''How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?'' about the smog in Los Angeles. Dean, however, mysteriously died in a fire that burned the film. The two end up at a party to search for the film's financier, Sid Shattuck, a notorious pornography producer. After fumbling through the party, a drunken March ends up finding Shattuck dead, while unknowingly coming across Amelia.  Holly, after attempting to investigate on her own, is tricked into a car by Blue Face. Healy fights with Older Guy, while Blue Face tries to kill Amelia from inside his car, only to be stopped by Holly, who warns Amelia and then escapes with her. While chasing them down, Blue Face is seriously injured in a hit-and-run. As he lies dying in the middle of the road, he reveals to Healy that their boss has dispatched a hit man named John Boy to kill Amelia, March and his family to prevent further witnesses. Healy discreetly strangles Blue Face to death to protect March and Holly, and lies to Holly that he died of his injuries. After a brief investigation, the two are greeted by Amelia's mother, Judith Kuttner ([[Kim Basinger]]), a high-ranking official in the [[United States Department of Justice]], who claims her daughter is delusional and paranoid and points them towards the [[Las Vegas]] mob trying to expand into the Los Angeles pornography scene.  Healy reveals the notepaper with March's address given to him by Amelia is the same type of notepaper he found at the party, one of which leads to an airport hotel where Amelia was going to distribute the film. Upon arriving at the hotel, however, they witness the distributors there being slaughtered and hastily retreat, only to have Amelia jump from the building and land on their car. They take Amelia back to March's house, where she reveals that the people after her are working for a cabal of [[Detroit]] automakers. After uncovering evidence that they colluded to suppress the [[catalytic converter]] (which regulates exhaust emissions), Amelia created the film to expose their collusion.  Judith has her assistant, Tally ([[Yaya DaCosta]]), arrange for March and Healy to deliver a briefcase that supposedly contains $100,000. When March falls asleep while driving and accidentally crashes their car, the case flies open to reveal shredded magazines; the double-cross was a diversion to leave Amelia unprotected. Sent by Tally under the guise of being a family doctor, John Boy ([[Matt Bomer]]) attacks Holly before engaging in a shootout with March and Healy as soon as they return to the house. Hearing the sirens of approaching police cars, John Boy drives off while an impatient Amelia has fled the house, only to be killed by John Boy on the street when he inadvertently comes across her attempting to catch a ride.  March and Healy try to bring the matter to court, but are rejected, as they have no evidence, leading them again to search for the film. The two have Mrs. Glenn show them where she saw Misty alive. Inside they find a hidden projector—the nearsighted Mrs. Glenn having mistaken the footage of Misty for her niece—and deduce that there was a reprint of the film. They realize that Chet, a projectionist, is the projectionist of the presentation film for the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]]. At the auto show, Healy and March attempt to find Chet, only to be intercepted at gunpoint by Tally. Before she can kill them, Holly arrives while pretending to be room service and knocks Tally unconscious. The two split up to find Chet, and Healy finds him beaten and left in a dumpster by John Boy, and finds out that film has been spliced into the presentation film. March and Holly, meanwhile, are held at gunpoint by Older Guy and brought to the roof. After a brief struggle, both March and Older Guy fall off the roof, with Older Guy falling to his death while March falls into a pool. March and Healy engage John Boy in a shootout, which eventually encompasses thugs for Bergen Paulson, a car company executive, over the film. March recovers the film while Healy subdues John Boy. Healy spares his life at Holly's behest.  March and Healy take the film to the police, and although Judith is arrested, the Detroit car companies escape punishment. When she talks with March and Healy before her trial, Judith claims she did not want her daughter killed and justifies her involvement by insisting that "[[Charles Erwin Wilson#Secretary of Defense|what is good for Detroit is good for America]]." Healy and March decide to continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency "The Nice Guys".

In the opening scene, he skydives out of a plane and lands on the top of the new skyscraper. His son, who is his assistant, remains in the plane, refusing to jump.  Rebecca's 11th birthday is coming and she has always wanted a cat, but Tom has always refused as he hates cats. Not wanting to disappoint her, he rushes to get a last-minute present for his daughter's birthday, but as he is distracted, the [[GPS navigation device|GPS]] redirects him to a mysterious pet store called Purrkins Pet Shop, brimming with odd and exotic cats. The store's eccentric owner Felix Perkins ([[Christopher Walken]]) tells him he does not pick the cat, the cat picks him. The [[Cat|tomcat]] that picked him is called Mr. Fuzzypants. Perkins says he has used up seven of his nine lives. Tom takes the cat. Tom is on his way home for the party when he decides to see Ian Cox ([[Mark Consuelos]]), one of the top managers of the company in charge of the new building, and learns that another building in [[Chicago]] will be taller.

He is able to talk to him and knows what happened. He is told by Felix that he must reevaluate his priorities, connect with his family, and avoid past mistakes within one week or else be stuck as a cat forever. Lara and Rebecca take him home. Mr. Fuzzypants acts in an odd and stubborn way to try to convince his wife and daughter that he’s actually Tom. This only drives them mad and he slowly comes to see how much he has ignored his family. He also learns that Ian is trying to make the company public with the help of the [[board of directors]] to take power from Tom, even though David is trying to stop him. Ian has David fired from the company and plans to announce that the company will be sold at the party for the new tower opening.  Eventually Rebecca realizes that Mr. Fuzzypants is really her father. Meanwhile, Tom's body is in crisis at the hospital and Lara, David, and Rebecca all go there. Rebecca has the cat hidden in her backpack. In a moment alone, David tells Tom that he is sorry he failed to save the company and he takes Tom's ID badge. It is implied that David plans to commit suicide at the tower. At the hospital, Lara and Dr. Cole plan to disconnect Tom's respirator and let him die. Rebecca calls to the cat to come prove he's really Tom, but Tom remembers what Mr. Perkins said about love being sacrifice and decides to go after David instead, knowing that his human body will die and he will be trapped as a cat forever.  At the tower, David jumps off the building and the cat jumps after him pulling a cable. It is then revealed that David is wearing a [[BASE jumping]] parachute. He lands in the middle of the party, presents the articles of incorporation of the company, and announces that he now controls his father's 51% of the stock. He says the company will remain a family company and fires Ian.  Although the cat is not seen landing, Tom wakes up from his coma just in time to see David's announcement on the television. Meanwhile, Ian passes Mr. Perkins who tells him to hang up his cell phone. Ian ignores him, but is then hit by a car, and his consciousness transfers into a cat that Mr. Perkins takes back to his shop.  Tom and Rebecca return to Perkins where Tom asks if he has any dogs.

After being forced off the road, Tony is powerless to stop Ray and Turk from kidnapping his wife, Laura, and their daughter, India, and leaving him with Lou, who forces him to drive Ray's car to the end of a road where he is abandoned. Tony manages to evade Ray and Lou when they return looking for him and makes his way to a nearby farmhouse to call the police.  Detective Bobby Andes is assigned to the case and, with Tony, discovers the bodies of Laura and India near an abandoned shack, where they had been raped and murdered. Tony is wracked with guilt.

Now You See Me 2
 Eighteen months after outwitting the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the remaining members of the Four Horsemen—J. Daniel Atlas ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]), Merritt McKinney ([[Woody Harrelson]]) and Jack Wilder ([[Dave Franco]])—are in hiding in [[New York City]], awaiting further instructions from The Eye, the secret society of magicians they've been recruited into. Atlas, having grown tired of waiting for a mission, seeks out The Eye himself. His search leads him to an underground tunnel in which he hears a voice that tells him that his wait may be coming to an end. The Horsemen's handler, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes ([[Mark Ruffalo]]), ultimately assigns them a new mission, exposing corrupt businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb), whose new software secretly steals data on its users for Case's benefit. Lula May ([[Lizzy Caplan]]) is added to the team to replace former member Henley Reeves ([[Isla Fisher]]), who has left the Horsemen after breaking up with Atlas.  The Horsemen hijack the launch party for the new software, but the show is interrupted by a mysterious individual who reveals to the world that Wilder, believed to be dead, is actually alive, and that Rhodes is their mole, forcing him to escape. While escaping, the Horsemen enter their escape tube on a roof and emerge in [[Macau]], where they are captured by mercenaries and Chase McKinney (also played by Woody Harrelson), Merritt's twin brother. The Horsemen are then brought before Chase's employer, technology prodigy Walter Mabry ([[Daniel Radcliffe]]), Case's former business partner, who faked his own death after Case stole Walter's company. Mabry conscripts the Horsemen into stealing the data-mining device developed by Case to prevent him from using it. The chip allows the user to decrypt and access any electronic device around the world. The Horsemen agree to steal the device.  They get supplies at a famous magic shop in Macau, run by Li ([[Jay Chou]]) and Bu Bu ([[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]]), and secretly contact The Eye to arrange to hand over the device after they steal it. Meanwhile, Rhodes is branded a fugitive and forced to spring his rival Thaddeus Bradley ([[Morgan Freeman]]), whom Rhodes blames for the death of his father, out of jail for help.  The Horsemen infiltrate the facility and steal the chip, despite being interrogated and searched by security guard Allen Scott-Frank ([[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]]). Atlas is then confronted by Mabry, revealing that Atlas had been fooled into thinking that Mabry was The Eye. Rhodes intervenes and pretends to retrieve the device, but is captured by Mabry's henchmen and taken to a nearby yacht. There, he learns Mabry is acting on behalf of his father, Arthur Tressler             ([[Michael Caine]]), whom Rhodes exposed with the help of the Horsemen in the first film. Tressler places Rhodes in a replica of the same safe that his father died in and leaves him to drown, but Rhodes escapes and is rescued by the Horsemen. They find that the chip they had stolen appears to be a fake.  Rhodes and the Horsemen broadcast that they will be performing live in [[London]] at midnight on New Year's Eve. Mabry and Tressler, thinking that they have the computer chip, make haste to London, where the Horsemen are performing a series of tricks on the streets. At [[the Shard]], Mabry, Tressler and Chase discover that Rhodes is still alive and capture the five, taking them on his private plane. Mabry takes the card from them, and Rhodes and the other Horsemen are thrown out of the plane supposedly in flight. However, Tressler finds that the plane has never taken off, and instead is on a barge in the middle of the [[River Thames]], with their criminal activities being broadcast live to the world by the Horsemen in the process. Mabry, Tressler and Chase are arrested and Rhodes, now going by his real surname, "Shrike", entrusts the information they've gathered on the real criminals' activities to the FBI, who allows him a head start to escape.  Rhodes and the Horsemen are then taken to meet the leaders of the Eye in a secret library in [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Greenwich Observatory]]. They find that the members of the Eye include Li, Bu Bu, Allen Scott-Frank and Thaddeus Bradley. Bradley reveals that he was actually Lionel Shrike's partner, and he had been masquerading as his rival as part of their planned act: he had exposed Lionel's first act planning to be dumbfounded by his second act, only to abandon the Eye after Lionel's death. Before Bradley leaves, he asks Rhodes to be his successor in the Eye's leadership and requests that the Horsemen enter a curtain. The Horsemen, along with Rhodes, go behind the curtain, and find a door behind it. They enter the room and find a staircase; the camera zooms out to the stairs, forming an Eye.

Office Christmas Party
 In December 2016, Josh Parker ([[Jason Bateman]]), Chief Technical Officer of Zenotek's Chicago branch, meets with his lawyer, Ezra ([[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]), to finalize his divorce in time for the holidays. Zenotek meanwhile has failed to meet its quarterly quota, and interim CEO Carol Vanstone ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) threatens to lay off 40 percent of the staff, cut bonuses, and cancel the annual Christmas party. Her brother, branch manager Clay ([[T. J. Miller]]), is desperate to keep his staff. Carol harbors resentment toward Clay, whom she believed was her father's favorite, and threatens to shut down the branch. Josh and Clay, along with Josh's head of tech, Tracey Hughes ([[Olivia Munn]]), propose partnering with financial giant Walter Davis ([[Courtney B. Vance]]), whom they are having lunch with later that day, and Carol gives them the chance to win his business. Walter is pleased with the pitch, but concerned with another recent branch closure at Zenotek, and feels the company is more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to their Christmas party in hopes of showing him that their company is in good standing. Before leaving town, Carol offers Josh a position at her New York headquarters, confident her brother will fail.  Clay funds an exorbitant Christmas party, much to the chagrin of Mary ([[Kate McKinnon]]), the head of Human Resources. Joel ([[Sam Richardson (actor)|Sam Richardson]]) takes DJ duty, but the party struggles to pick up even with Tracey inviting [[Chicago Bulls]] player [[Jimmy Butler (basketball)|Jimmy Butler]] as a friend. Though initially reluctant, Walter is inadvertently doused with cocaine when it is accidentally fed into a snow machine and succumbs to his free-spirited nature. Throughout the party, various employees cut loose: Nate ([[Karan Soni]]) tries to impress two of his staff ([[Andrew Leeds (actor)|Andrew Leeds]] and [[Oliver Cooper]]) by hiring an escort named Savannah ([[Abbey Lee Kershaw|Abbey Lee]]) to pretend to be his girlfriend, though Nate is found out when she gives a handjob to a fellow employee; Clay's assistant and single-mom Allison ([[Vanessa Bayer]]) attempts to hook up with new hire Fred ([[Randall Park]]) but stops when he reveals he has a [[Ageplay|mother-child fetish]]; and customer service supervisor Jeremy ([[Rob Corddry]]) cuts loose on the dance floor with Mary, whom he previously despised. Josh and Tracey get stuck on the roof and nearly kiss before Jeremy interrupts them. Back on the dance floor, Clay wins over Walter's business, and Clay promises everyone they'll keep their jobs and receive their bonuses. The party gradually grows more and more chaotic as employees begin partaking in [[Orgy|orgies]], damaging company property, and doing drugs.  Carol's flight is cancelled due to weather, and she rushes back to the office when she hears about the party from her [[Uber (company)|Uber]] driver, who took people to the party. Though Carol is initially impressed with receiving Walter's business, Walter injures himself attempting to swing off a balcony after a conversation with Clay, and is later discovered to have been fired from his firm, nullifying any contract and thus no longer bringing in any new money to Zenotek. Carol decides then and there to shut down the branch. To add insult to injury, she reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay. Even though Josh says he said no, the surrounding employees angrily ignore and shun him. Tracey reveals that she was given the same offer but explicitly rejected it where Josh kept it open. Feeling betrayed about what he heard from Carol, Clay rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp, Trina ([[Jillian Bell]]), to party elsewhere, though Trina is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person. Josh, Tracey, Mary, and Carol race off to save Clay.  Many of the other employees learn about the termination Carol announced earlier. Believing that everyone is to lose their jobs, they throw out and destroy all the company equipment and burn everything in sight, forcing security guard Carla ([[Da'Vine Joy Randolph]]) to put down the unruly, now destructive and rebellious party. Clay ends up racing Trina's car towards an opening drawbridge, attempting to jump the gap, a feat he'd earlier mentioned to Josh. Josh drives Mary's minivan alongside him, and tries to convince Clay not to jump, but he is still angered and heartbroken from Carol offering Josh the job, as much as remembering her insults. Believing he's worthless, he still decides to jump, regardless of whether he makes it and lives or dies. After everyone, including Trina, fails to convince Clay to pull over, Josh threatens to jump the gap with him, and Clay reluctantly allows it. Not willing to die, Carol forcefully moves the steering wheel from Josh, causing the car to swerve into Clay's car, crashing both vehicles. Clay's car hits an internet hub, disconnecting the entire city.  Trina and Savannah are arrested for their crimes, while Clay is taken to the hospital. In the wake of the internet blackout, Tracey realizes how to run a new innovation she'd been working on for several years that combines internet WiFi with wired connections through the city's power grid, which had previously failed due to her inability to take the real-world interference of the existing internet signals into account. They race back to the destroyed office to set up her tech, and when it works, internet is restored to Chicago. This new innovation saves the jobs of the entire team, with Clay apologizing for how his father treated Carol. Walter, who is in the same hospital as Clay, agrees to join the team. Josh and Tracey kiss amidst the ruins of their office. Jeremy opens up to Mary, and Nate and Allison agree to go on a date. The whole group meets Carol and Clay as he's released from the hospital, and they all go out for breakfast, driving recklessly on the way.

One Piece Film: Gold
   The Straw Hat Pirates head to Gran Tesoro, a large entertainment city-ship ruled by Gild Tesoro. After entering an entertainment venue where Tesoro and his colleague Carina are performing, the Straw Hats defeat an enemy pirate crew and land on Gran Tesoro, where they are welcomed by a concierge named Baccarat. Baccarat offers to give them a VIP stay on Gran Tesoro due to their fame, and drives them to the city's most prestigious hotel. The Straw Hats then go to a casino to win money, and their luck allows them to win every game they play. Baccarat then takes them to the VIP lounge, where they have the chance to become millionaires. The Straw Hats are initially successful in this room as well, and Gild Tesoro then arrives to challenge them to a dice game. However, Baccarat takes away Luffy's luck with her Devil Fruit powers, causing him to lose. Tesoro demands the Straw Hats' money, but the Straw Hats resist him due to finding out about Baccarat's cheating. Tesoro and his executives, Baccarat, Tanaka, and Dice, retaliate with force, overwhelming the Straw Hats. Roronoa Zoro attacks Tesoro, but Tesoro reveals that he has the ability to manipulate gold, and encases Zoro's legs in gold due to Zoro's body being covered in gold dust. With Zoro as his prisoner, Tesoro gives the Straw Hats a chance to repay their debt by 12:00 the next night, threatening to execute Zoro otherwise.  The Straw Hats go outside and encounter Carina, whom Nami knew from the past. They eat at a diner with Carina, who reveals that Tesoro possesses 20% of the world's wealth, which he keeps in a suite area near the top of the hotel. She offers to help the Straw Hats break into the hotel and steal the money in order to repay their debt, and they accept. The next night, the Straw Hats don disguises and prepare to enter the hotel. Carina then lays out her plan: Team A, Luffy and Franky, will scale the hotel exterior and go to a room containing the Host Den Den Mushi. By disconnecting it from the Eizo Den Den Mushi, which act as security cameras in the hotel, Team B, the rest of them, can enter the hotel and reach the suite undetected. The two teams then split up, managing to successfully infiltrate the hotel and get past security. However, when Luffy infiltrates the Host Den Den Mushi room, he is spotted by security, and Tesoro and Tanaka come into the room. Tesoro overpowers Luffy and Franky, encasing Luffy's arms in gold, and Tanaka sends them into a large pit with his Devil Fruit powers. Tesoro deduces Team B's location, and sends security guards after them, forcing Team B to run back to where they came from.  Luffy and Franky fall into a giant gold cavern that has many golden objects inside it. They encounter several prisoners who have access to all this gold, but have no food, water, or way of escape. One of the prisoners, a legendary gambler and a member of the Revolutionary Army named Raise Max, tells the two that the only way to free Luffy's arms from their gold encasement is to enter a dangerous pipe system and travel to a room with a seawater pipeline. Luffy and Franky decide to go there, and Max and the prisoners come with them. They come to a vertical pipe that has a giant and fast fan spinning underneath them, and Luffy is quickly batted away by the fan when he jumps into it. However, after seeing Luffy's determination, Max jumps into the fan and uses all his strength to stop it, allowing them to get to the seawater pipeline. Meanwhile, Team B is forced to hide, but when they see a group of Celestial Dragons walking by, they steal the Dragons' clothes and resume their journey to the suite in their new disguises. However, when they open the door to the suite, they find themselves in the middle of an entertainment venue filled with a lot of people. Tesoro reveals that he had Carina lead them into this trap, and captures the Straw Hats. He then reveals that he knows Luffy's and Franky's location, and sends seawater flooding in the room, causing Luffy, Franky, and the prisoners to be submerged.  However, as Tesoro prepares to execute Zoro, seawater sprays out of Gran Tesoro's fountains instead of the usual liquid gold. The Straw Hats then reveal that it was actually they and Carina who tricked Tesoro, as their real plan had actually been to flood Gran Tesoro with seawater, which would wash all the gold dust off everyone and free them from Tesoro's control. Luffy and Franky then emerge from the fountains, and the other Straw Hats are freed from their gold bindings. Tesoro enters a rage and blows up the hotel, sending a deluge of gold on the Straw Hats and Carina. However, the Straw Hats manage to get to safety, but are confronted by Tesoro, who is inhabiting a giant gold golem, as well as his executives, who are now equipped with golden armor and weapons. Luffy attacks Tesoro, but is easily overpowered by Tesoro's golem. A Marine fleet then arrives to attack Gran Tesoro, but their commander Rob Lucci is intercepted by Sabo, and the two battle. Meanwhile, Luffy is caught by CP-0 officer Spandam and is nearly killed, but a young boy named Rikka intercepts Spandam's strike, allowing Luffy to free himself and defeat Spandam. Tesoro's executives attack the Straw Hats, but the Straw Hats eventually manage to counteract their abilities, with Sanji and Robin defeating Tanaka, Usopp defeating Baccarat, and Zoro defeating Dice. Tesoro attempts to kill Nami and Carina for revenge, but Luffy saves them and reenters the battle, in which he enters Gear Fourth and overpowers Tesoro, knocking his golem to the ground. Tesoro then liquefies his golem and sends it down on everyone in Gran Tesoro, causing them to sink in liquid gold. Tesoro stands on a mountain of gold and declares himself a god, and as Luffy charges at him in the air, he sends a massive golden tendril to finish him off. However, Luffy manages to break through the tendril and unleash a finishing blow on Tesoro, sending him flying to the Marine fleet, where he is arrested.  As the people of Gran Tesoro celebrate their liberation, a timer suddenly appears all across the city, and Carina says that once it reaches zero, the ship will explode. However, she states her intention to steer the ship away and prevent casualties, and as everyone evacuates, she and Nami embrace. The Straw Hats return to their ship, but when the timer reaches zero, nothing happens. They then see Carina standing atop Gran Tesoro, having taken control of it with her ruse. However, the Straw Hats have no hard feelings about being tricked as they are forced to flee from the attacking Marine fleet.

Operation Chromite (film)
 In 1950, just a few months after North Korean forces have overrun most of South Korea, an American-led [[United Nations Command|UN coalition]] is deployed to Korea to aid the struggling South Koreans. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] devises a secret plan to attack behind enemy lines at the port city of [[Incheon]]. The risky strategy is opposed by leaders of the other military branches, forcing MacArthur to devise a clandestine operation to gather essential information from within occupied Incheon by coordinating a weeklong South Korean intelligence operation known as "X-Ray".  The linchpin of this top-secret incursion, Captain Jang Hak-Soo of the [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korean navy]] Intelligence Unit (a former [[Korean People's Army|North Korean army]] officer who defected to South Korea after seeing his father executed in front of him by his fellow communist officers), and seven members of the X-Ray unit disguise themselves as a North Korean inspection unit and infiltrate the North Korean army command center in Incheon, coordinated by Soviet-trained Commander Lim Gye-Jin, a protégé of the North Korean leader, [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-Sung]]. Their prime objective is to determine the placement of North Korean defenses (such as mines and artillery) and the tactical characteristics of the Incheon harbor, notorious for swift currents and major tidal surges and secure a lighthouse crucial to the landing's success.  Immediately suspicious of Jang’s "inspection mission", Lim attempts to impede his comrade’s investigation and orders his staff to monitor the new arrivals closely. The U.S. command relays MacArthur’s orders to obtain navigation charts showing naval mine placements in the harbor and prepare a strategy to assist the coalition forces with landing an amphibious assault in a narrow two-hour window between tides. When contacts within the South Korean military intelligence unit known as KLO (Korean Liaison Office, predecessor to current day South Korean Headquarters of Intelligence Detachment, or HID) warn Jang that time is running out to successfully complete the mission, he pushes his group to extremes. Meanwhile in Tokyo, MacArthur prepares ''[[Operation Chromite]]'', an invasion force of 75,000 UN troops and over 200 warships to imminently depart for the Korean Peninsula.  <ref></ref>

Michael believes that Maria is becoming mentally unhinged and locks her in a room.  The shamans begin to crowd the house; the possessed Lucy kills the family dog with a knife and stabs a horrified Michael. Maria breaks out and heads up to Oliver's room where she sees shamans chanting over Lucy's body. Since they cannot remove the spirit from Lucy, they plan to sacrifice her. However, Michael stops them and Maria tells Oliver that he needs to leave. Oliver says he is scared, but Maria says she will go with him. Oliver’s spirit leaves Lucy’s body and enters Maria's. She charges the shaman with the knife telling him to take her instead. He obliges, fatally stabbing her. She falls and awakens in the room alone. Myrtu appears and takes Maria to the afterlife.

Our Kind of Traitor (film)
  As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, "the Prince" – the head of the [[Russian Mafia]] – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin.  Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in [[Morocco]] to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an [[eidetic memory]]. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to British [[MI6]] when he returns to London.  Perry turns the information over to Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and Aubrey Longrigg, a senior politician whom Hector knows is corrupt, although he has never been able to prove it. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of the corrupt, and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Aubrey Longrigg receiving £10 million plus an additional £20 million for every politician or banker he personally recruited to the cause. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption, until he and his family have been granted asylum in London.  Emilio, the Prince's consigliere, suspects the MacKendricks and has henchman Niki intimidate them by bringing them to his rough neighbourhood. While there, the blue-eyed assassin beats a woman and Perry attacks him in fury. Gail is touched by her husband's protectiveness of others and their relationship begins to heal. Hector reveals to the MacKendricks that he only has two men and that he has been funding the operation himself, and they plan to seize Dima and his family simultaneously after Dima has signed the accounts over to the bank. Gail successfully retrieves Dima's wife and children, and Dima kills Niki before Perry can find him and bring him to safety.  While at the airport with the family about to board a charter plane back to London, Billy calls Hector and informs him that Aubrey Longrigg has convinced the Home Office the family be denied asylum. With their plan thwarted, Hector must return to London alone. The MacKendricks refuse to leave Dima and the family until the asylum is granted and they are safe in London.  Given the MacKendricks' involvement, Hector sends everyone to a safehouse in the [[French Alps]]. While there, Dima's daughter blows their cover by calling one of Dima's bodyguards, Andrei, by whom she is pregnant. Andrei traces the location of the call and the blue-eyed assassin leads an attack on the safehouse, but it is fended off by Dima and the agents. Dima chases the blue-eyed assassin into the woods, but is ambushed and almost beaten to death before Perry arrives and kills the assassin.  Meanwhile, Hector has returned to London and attempted to convince the UK Treasury Office that the Prince's bank is a cover to launder billions of dirty Russian mafia money in London. He succeeds, but for asylum to be granted to Dima and his family, he must provide proof in the form of all the account numbers and names of the corrupt UK politicians and bankers involved in endorsing the bank—the detail that Dima still has in his head.  A deal is made that Dima must be sent to London first by helicopter, with his family to follow once the account information he has memorised has been verified. The attack at the safe house and his wife's insistence convinces Dima to go on ahead and Perry volunteers to accompany him.  The family and Gail are driven to another safe house while Dima, Perry and Hector's agent head to the helicopter rendezvous location. At the last minute, Dima insists Perry not come with him on the helicopter. As Perry watches the helicopter take off it explodes over the Alps, killing Dima and Hector's agent and devastating the MacKendricks and Hector. All is lost.  The mafia bank opens in London and begins trading at massive profit; Aubrey Longrigg is announced as the new Minister of State for Trade and Investment.  Dima's family receives asylum after all, arranged by Hector as compensation for Dima's murder while under his protection. Perry visits Hector at home and gives him a gift from Dima, a box containing the ornate pistol that the Prince had given Dima upon the signing of the accounts. After Perry leaves, Hector finds a tiny roll of paper addressed to him from Dima with the list of all the corrupt Britons' names and account numbers hidden in the pistol's chamber. With this information, Hector is able to expose the Prince's money laundering network and the role of Longrigg and the other politicians within it.

A posse of bounty hunters, led by Josiah, is formed and are in hot pursuit, “only being a half-day behind them".  The outlaws are now down to four after one of the men was shot dead after the robbery.  They are met on the path by a couple, who are the aunt and uncle of Charlie, and brought them supplies.  They find out that there is a bounty of 8000 dollars on their heads. They shoot the couple so they cannot turn them in for the reward money.  The posse comes upon the scene of the dead couple, and Josiah talks to the couples' granddaughter Lulu, who hid in the bushes when her grandparents were shot.  She tells them that they are headed East through White Sands, to make them more difficult to track.  The outlaws are down to three, when one passes out and they shoot him to put him out of his misery. They spot the Tildon farm, where Preacher George and Ada live with their teenage daughters, Charlotte and Florence, and make plan to descend on them at dark.  They burst in to the house, and start eating and drinking whiskey and intend to have relations with the women. Florence catches Henry's eye and he calls her to sit on his lap.  Ada and George plead with the men because she is only 15, but both are brutally subdued by Charlie and Little Joe. George says he is the preacher of the chapel on the property, but nobody attends now because the town was ravaged by consumption.  Henry orders Little Joe to keep watch outside and take Charlotte with him.  Henry wants a massage from Florence and they go into the bedroom. He is put off when she tries to perform oral sex on him, saying she is an "adventuress".  He says he wants to have relations with her, but wants it done the proper way.  Little Joe's advances are rebuffed when he tries to talk with Charlotte, who is disgusted with him.  Charlie sexually assaults Ada while her husband sleeps next to her on the floor.  Florence becomes enamored by Henry and plans to run away with him and get married, to the dismay of her family.  Florence pulls a gun on George, but Henry stops her from shooting him.  She shoots and kills Charlotte.  Henry asks George why Charlotte could not bear children.  He lies and says it was because of the fever, but then confesses that he got Charlotte pregnant when she was 11 when he was "sick with devil's seed" and that a botched abortion was the cause of Charlotte not being able to have kids.  George says he stopped a long time ago, but Henry knows he's lying and that he has continued to have relations with his daughters on a weekly basis.  Henry orders Little Joe to anally rape George, but calls him off, saying that he just wanted to scare him.  Florence comes back in and uses a shot gun to beat George to death so he can feel the pain instead of a quick death.  When asked why she killed Charlotte, she says it was because she enjoyed what went on with George.  Florence spares Ada and leaves a bag of gold coins and the group leaves.  Josiah gets to the farm and finds Ada sitting on the stairs of the chapel, apparently in a catatonic state. He steals the bag of coins, but Ada shoots him to death as he walks away.    The group makes it to Mexico and Florence shoots all three men. Charlie dies instantly, but Little Joe is still standing when Henry shoots him to keep him from shooting at Florence.  Florence apologizes to Henry, saying she really wanted to go with him, but the reward money was too good to pass up.  Henry shoots himself in the head and dies.  Florence chops their heads off with an ax and bags them to turn in for the bounty.  Back at the farm, Florence shoots Ada.

After driving awhile, they decide to drive north as The Tall Man hates the cold.   In a flashback to the hospital, however, Reggie seemingly passes away in bed while Mike & Jody are holding his hands, and the film ends. During the end-credits, Chunk appears through a portal along a desert road, missing a hand, and meets up with Rocky. Chunk flirts with her, asking Rocky if he has a chance. Rocky teases back saying that there are no other guys around, but Rocky then sees Reggie and the others pulling up in the Barricuda heading north, and they get in. Lots of giant spheres are then shown in the sky in the distance, indicating the war with The Tall Man is far from finished.

Six years later, Pete, now 11, spots a [[lumberjack]] crew chopping down trees near his home. Natalie, the daughter of the ethical site foreman Jack, spots and chases him.

 Mehak Deo ([[Radhika Apte]]) is a highly talented artist. An unfortunate traumatic event - being molested by a taxi driver, causes her to develop extreme agoraphobia, a condition in which the individual is paranoid about being in public places and dislikes socializing with large groups of unknown people. Mehak’s sister Anusha ([[Nivedita Bhattacharya]]), initially supportive, becomes exhausted with her eccentric behavior, especially when it starts impacting her own 5-year-old son.  Shaan (Satyadeep Mishra), a close friend, takes Mehak to an empty apartment, on the assumption that living alone for a while might benefit her. At the new apartment, Mehak befriends Nikki ([[Yashaswini Dayama]]), a college-going girl who lives in the neighbourhood. Her other neighbour Manu (Ankur Vikal) is working on anger management issues and is part of a community laughter club.  Manu is devastated because his girlfriend, Jiah Khurana (Amrit Bagchi), has left him. Jiah had earlier lived in Mehak’s new apartment and suddenly disappeared without a trace; without paying rent and without claiming her advance deposit back. A diary belonging to Jiah catches Mehek’s imagination and it is only a matter of time before she is convinced that a malevolent spirit is sharing her space. Soon Mehak begins making strong accusations against Manu, relating to Jiah's sudden departure and a series of strange events that occur around the apartment.  It is revealed that the visions Mehak experienced were actually of her own future, rather than that of Jiah. This is due to the fact that Jiah returns to the apartment suddenly, disproving the theory that she was murdered by Manu, something of which Mehak was convinced. Mehak realizes that she is capable of having glimpses of her future, as is indicated by one vision of her seeing 'smoke' coming out of a taxi - which is actually the pepper spray that she uses on the taxi driver. In the climactic scene, Mehaks vision once again coincides with reality, as a painting she created showing hands reaching out to her, mirrors the situation in which she is injured and goes out in the open for help, overcoming her condition.<ref name="Phobia: Main Story"/><ref name="Phobia Movie Review"></ref>

Shingo in the meantime experiences a tragedy when his [[ballerina]] older sister, Yui, is fatally injured during a performance.  Daiki and Shingo move to [[Tokyo]] after high school graduation and are scouted by a modeling agency, which introduces them to the [[Show business|showbiz]] world. They reunite with Sally and choose to live next door to her. As time goes on, it is apparent that Shingo, who adopts the [[stage name]] "Rengo Shiraki", is the more talented of the duo. The two friends begin to drift apart as Daiki accuses Shingo of distancing himself from his friends in favor of the life of a celebrity. Eventually, they separate and have no contact for three years, during which Daiki and Sally become a couple, until their high school reunion.

It is revealed that all previous events of the film are a [[film within a film]] (symbolized by the film switching from color to [[Black and white film|black and white]]), based on an [[autobiography]] the real Daiki, whose actual name is Dai Kawatori, wrote after the real Shingo's death.

Dai visits Shingo's apartment and tries to hang himself, but fails. Shingo's spirit appears and confirms what the tape shows, saying that Dai may not fully understand it.

Pink (2016 film)
  Three young and affluent boys, Raunak (Raashul  Tandon), Vishwajyoti (Tushar Pandey) and Rajveer Singh ([[Angad Bedi]]) rush to the nearest hospital because Rajveer is profusely bleeding from an injury to his head. They nervously refrain from filing a police complaint.   On the other side of the same town,  three young women&nbsp;— Minal  ([[Taapsee Pannu]]), Falak ([[Kirti Kulhari]]) and Andrea &nbsp;— hurriedly travel in a taxi to their apartment. They look disoriented, and it is implied that they have something to do with the incident. Minal and her friends are shaken but try to carry on with their normal life.   The story revolves around these three young women. They are independent and self-sufficient women living together in Faridabad.   Minal goes out for her usual morning run, where she is constantly observed by an old man who lives in her neighbourhood, a man called Deepak  ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]). He senses there is something wrong and introduces himself to these women as a reputable lawyer who is in retirement, and they enlist his help in the matter.  Eventually, as Deepak had predicted to the women, a series of threats arise from Rajveer’s friend Ankit  ([[Vijay Varma]]), who pushes for revenge. The threats result in Andrea being stalked and Falak losing her job. They are discouraged by a police officer from filing a complaint stating it would make their daily lives more miserable unless they relocate to another town or city. In reality, the local police are aware that the young men are "well connected" and are backed-up by Rajveer’s uncle Ranjit, a powerful influential politician from South Delhi.   Nevertheless, Minal files a complaint.  Immediately, the next day, Minal is kidnapped by Rajveer’s friends during her morning run. Deepak witnesses the incident but is unable to help in the heat of the moment even though he notes down the details and number plate of the car  Minal is threatened to stop filing complaints, blackmailed and is molested in the moving car and later dropped back home after all the commotion with a serious warning. A few days later, Minal is arrested by police from her apartment, based on a complaint from Rajveer labelling the women as prostitutes and charging Minal with attempted murder.   At this point, Deepak says enough is enough and visits Falak and Andrea at their apartment. Soon enough he helps them with the bail procedures and also in representing them in the court to plead their case.  In the courtroom, Rajveer’s lawyer, Prashant Mehra ([[Piyush Mishra]]), presents the following version of events:   Rajveer and his friends meet with Minal and her friends at a rock concert. The men invite the women for dinner at a hotel resort, where they have drinks. The women provoke the men, have intimate relations and thereafter demand money, all signs indicating that they are prostitutes. Rajveer refuses to pay and an enraged Minal hits him on the head with a bottle and flees.  Prashant’s argument focuses on the poor moral character of the women. He pushes the idea that the friendly manner of the women, the fact that they attended a rock concert and the fact that they had drinks with the men indicate that they were prostitutes. Prashant attacks the fact that Minal has family in Delhi but chooses to live alone, Falak is in a relationship with an older man, and Andrea has moved to the city from [[Northeast India]].  Contrary to this, Minal and her friends statement:  that the men tried to sexually assault them. Minal alleges that Rajveer tried to rape her, and she attacked him with the bottle in self-defence.    Deepak’s argument focuses on the issue of consent and a woman’s right to say no.   A series of interesting and chilling courtroom arguments ensues in the following days.   Towards the end of the trial, Rajveer becomes enraged and provoked by the reputable and respected lawyer Deepak, revealing the truth by stating that the women “got what they deserved”.   Deepak criticizes the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, move out of their home, want to be independent, drink and so on, but none of these applies to men.   In his closing remarks, Deepak mentions that his client said “no”. No means no and does not require further explanation. The women are acquitted while Rajveer, Ankit, and Dumpy are charged, with the duration of their sentences pending. Vishwajyoti is let off with a warning.

But the director is drawn to Laura, who, despite not being a spiritualist, has a face that photographs well. The film team conceives of a conventional script in which Laura plays a medium who channels the spirit of a widower's wife and the three become locked in a love triangle with the widower unsure if he is falling in love with his former wife or the medium.  Laura and Kate move in with Korben, who is generous and kind to them. However, he continues to hold private [[séances]] with Kate, much to Laura's displeasure.(She fears, rightly, that Korben's interest in the spirit world is sexual.)

Rumours that he once performed in porn abound; and someone writes that she is a Jew's whore on her mirror. When Korben and Kate arrive to reunite with Laura, Korben shows his producers and investors the film of him and Kate which shows nothing. The director walks off the film and blames the money Korben has wasted chasing ghosts as an excuse. Meanwhile, Kate falls ill and reveals that she hasn't been faking but really can see ghosts. She believes this is because she is dying. Kate has leukemia, which is a death sentence at the time.  Korben is jailed for his wasted investments and the trial strips him of his French citizenship.   Years later, Kate is dead; and Korben has been sent to a death camp in "the East." Laura runs into Eva, an actress she once knew, who helps her get a part in a film working with her former director.

In 2015, Conner releases his sophomore album, ''Connquest'', which receives terrible reviews due to Conner using hundreds of producers rather than Owen's beats. With sales surprisingly low, Conner's manager, Harry ([[Tim Meadows]]), suggests having Aquaspin, a manufacturer that makes home appliances, sponsor the tour. The company's appliances begin playing Conner's songs when in use, causing a nationwide power outage that generates a wave of backlash among Conner's fans.

Despite Conner's poor reputation, ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|The Tonight Show]]'' agrees to book him on an episode. [[Jimmy Fallon]] suddenly invites Conner to perform the Style Boyz' hit song "Donkey Roll" along with Owen, which is received well by the crowd despite Conner's reluctance.  As the tour progresses, Hunter begins to overshadow Conner, selling more records than him and dragging out his act before Conner's show. At a concert, Hunter announces that he will perform as long as possible, causing Conner to rush the stage. A brawl ensues when Hunter quietly admits that he orchestrated Conner's wardrobe malfunction. Conner demands that Harry let Hunter go and fires Harry after finding out that he has signed Hunter. ''Connquest'' is later knocked off the charts and Aquaspin decides to pull their sponsorship. The remainder of the tour is cancelled, and Owen decides to leave the team when Conner questions his loyalty. After his beloved pet turtle dies, Conner sinks into a depression and moves into his mother's house. He begins drinking heavily and starts selling crude horse drawings online.  Paula forces Conner to leave the house and takes him to a club featuring Owen. Owen's music and production are strong, though his singing is subpar. Conner and Owen reconcile and decide to finally make amends with Lawrence. Conner gives Lawrence his Poppy and apologizes, acknowledging Lawrence's contribution to his music. Conner and Owen discover that Lawrence owns a giant marijuana farm and a music studio in his farmhouse. As the three collaborate in Lawrence's studio, Conner receives news from Paula that a six-minute slot has opened for Conner to perform at the Poppy Music Awards (after [[Taylor Swift]] was arrested for murder), and with encouragement from his friends, he decides to reunite The Style Boyz.  At the Poppys, Hunter humiliates himself after arguing with [[Mariah Carey]] on stage and Harry quits as his manager after being insulted by him. Conner reconciles with Harry and later finds out that the six-minute slot has been shortened to three minutes, forcing him to perform either a Conner4Real song or a Style Boyz song. Conner decides to perform The Style Boyz's new song, "Incredible Thoughts" featuring [[Michael Bolton]]. The film ends with Conner reflecting on the lessons he has learned and the value of holding onto relationships after reaching stardom, and introduces a new baby turtle named Maximus II.

Praktan
  ''Praktan'' (former) is basically about Ujaan Mukherjee ([[Prosenjit]]) and Sudipa ([[Rituparna]]) who have gone through a marriage that did not work. But the director duo has preferred not to show a straightforward relationship tale of these two individuals, preferring instead to use the medium of a train journey to narrate the journey of their failing relationship. The film begins with various people shown boarding a first class A.C. compartment of [[Jnaneshwari Express]] from [[Lokmanya Tilak Terminus railway station|Lokmanya Tilak Terminus]], Kurla in Mumbai, the start of a long journey to Kolkata ([[Howrah]]). Sudipa finds herself sharing her coupe with Malini aka Molly ([[Aparajita Adhya]]) and her young daughter Putul. Others in the compartment include the newly wedded couple Ajay ([[Biswanath Basu]]) and his wife ([[Manali Dey]]), an elderly couple ([[Soumitra Chatterjee]]) and ([[Sabitri Chatterjee]]), who are off to Kolkata as their son’s family is departing to the U.S and a group of 4 musicians (popular musicians in real life – ([[Anupam Roy]]) along with ([[Anindya Chatterjee]]) and ([[Upal Sengupta]]) of the popular band 'Chandrabindo'o and ([[Surojit Chatterjee]]) who was part of another popular band, 'Bhoomi'). In their own ways, some of the passengers seem to be having something about their past on their minds. The newly married couple briefly talk to each other about their past relationships and get on with their fondness for each other. The elderly couple is sad to leave behind their children but know that they have to move on with their own lives. One of the musicians reminisces about his association with the band that he was part of and his co-founder. And Sudipa finds herself in a spot of bother as she realizes that Malini and Putul are none other than Ujaan’s present wife and daughter. Upset over the same, she clearly demonstrates that she has not completely forgiven Ujaan for whatever happened between them and seems to carry the burden of their memories. A common love for heritage and culture had seen the conservation architect from Mumbai, Sudipa fall in love with Ujaan, an explorer as he liked to call himself and someone who conducted walks of different nature all over Kolkata and nearby towns as a tourist guide. But, of course, life after marriage turned out to be unlike what they had expected leading to their eventual separation.  Over the course of the 30 odd hours of the train journey, we come across not just a way of knowing how all these passengers spend their time, but also get an insight into the failed marriage of Ujaan and Sudipa. Ujaan joins them at Nagpur after driving down by road to catch the train. He is surprised to find Sudipa in the same coupe as his family. A non-linear approach in a subtle manner is used to shift the focus on and off from the train journey to the relationship between the two individuals who started off being madly in love, only to see their marriage crumbling in front of their own eyes. They ensure that the focus is more or less only on these two individuals when their past is shown, there is a mention of Ujaan’s close friend and Sudipa’s parents, but they are never really shown. Even the rest of the family members of Ujaan are barely showcased in an attempt to take us through their relationship curve. Over the course of their story we also get to understand how and what went wrong in case of their marriage. Beginning with a sense of apprehension and even disgust in a way, it’s wonderful to see Sudipa gradually opening up to Malini and acknowledging how wrong she was in her assumption about her. There are lots of wonderful moments in the film, like the one where the old lady complains to the railway attendant about the AC and other aspects in horrible Bangla mixed Hindi as her husband humorously points out later. Also, the way Ujaan and Sudipa manage to just about have a soulful discussion about their past and of course the interaction between Malini and Sudipa right at the end. Apart from the “Antakshari” sequence, there is hardly any interaction between the people on the coach. But then, this is essentially the story of Ujaan and Sudipa and their failed relationship. It’s wonderful to see how well-etched Malini’s character is and she is the one who in a way helps bring closure in the lives of both Ujaan and Sudipa.

On the way to the Bingleys' later, Jane is attacked by a zombie and catches a fever. Darcy orders her confined in fear that she may have been bitten but she recovers.

Elizabeth meets a charming soldier named Wickham and arranges to meet him at another ball. She travels with him to a church that is filled with zombies who feed on pig brains instead of human brains, keeping their behaviour relatively normal.

Elizabeth learns that Darcy convinced the Bingleys to leave to keep Bingley away from Jane. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, having fallen in love with her, she expresses outrage at his actions and fights him.  Darcy later writes Elizabeth a letter to apologize. He reiterates that he separated Jane and Bingley for fear that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth – having overheard Mrs. Bennet drunkenly mention it. He also exposes Wickham's true nature, he and Wickham were childhood friends but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered his inheritance, then tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate; when that failed, Wickham tried to elope with Darcy's little sister, for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has taken Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is using the 'civilised' zombies to create a zombie army, which has overrun London based on Wickham's planning and will rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.  While fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, staying civilized by consuming pig brains. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham. As the two ride across the bridge, the army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again and this time, she agrees. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Wickham leads a horde of zombies toward the wedding celebration with the [[Four horsemen of the Apocalypse|Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse]] riding behind him.

SoLaMi Smile and Dressing Pafe reach Pripari first, and find the city size Pripara covered by black clouds and the Prisian idols acting strangely, saying they hate everything. But Dorothy discovers she can use the power of the likes stored in her Cyalume Charm to change the Prisians back to normal. SoLaMi Smile and Dressing Pafe head to where Falulu is and learn from Gaaruru the reason for the black clouds appearing. It transpires that when Falulu and Gaaruru returned to Pripari they came with Gloria Ookanda, who met her older sister Ploria when they landed on top of the Eppel Tower. At first the sisters excitedly greeted each other but then began arguing over something trivial. It is this argument that formed the clouds and spread the negative aura over Pripari, and the sisters are still fighting, continuing to create the clouds. Gaaruru explains that Falulu may be able to help them reach the two Ookanda sisters, but she has fallen into a coma with the other mini Falulu. Laala and her friends try to use their Cyalume Charms to wake up Falulu but they don't have enough likes. But when all seems hopeless, the other idols appear and use their charms to wake Falulu up. All the idols then perform a live in front of the Eppel Tower, causing the sisters to come to their senses and stop fighting, restoring Pripari and saving Pripara.

In order to help pay the expenses for medical school, he promises himself to the daughter of an affluent neighbor, receiving 400 gold coins as a dowry. This allows him to travel to [[Constantinople]] and attend the Imperial Medical Academy.  There, he befriends Emre, the son of a high-level Turkish official. Through his wealthy uncle, Mikael also meets Ana ([[Charlotte Le Bon]]), an Armenian woman raised in Paris, who is involved with an American reporter for the [[Associated Press]], Chris Myers ([[Christian Bale]]). In due course, Mikael falls in love with Ana just as international tensions begin to rise with the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Mikael temporarily manages to avoid conscription in the Ottoman army through a medical student exemption with the help of Emre. But when he tries to save his uncle from imprisonment during the roundups of April 24, 1915, he is detained and sent to a prison labor camp himself.  Mikael eventually escapes the camp, returning to his village only to find the Turks have violently turned on their Armenian fellow townspeople. His parents, and particularly his mother, persuade him to marry his betrothed and seek refuge in a remote mountain cabin where she soon becomes pregnant. A difficult pregnancy leads Mikael to bring his wife back to the care of his mother in the village. There he learns that Ana and Christopher are at a nearby Red Cross facility and he goes to seek their help for his family to escape the imminent Turkish threat.  Departing the mission with a group of orphans, they head back to Sirun to retrieve Mikael's family. Along the way, however, they encounter a site of a massacre, as it becomes clear all of Sirun's inhabitants, including Mikael's family, save his mother, have been killed by Turkish troops. Chris is captured by Ottoman troops and sent back to Constantinople, charged with being a spy and slated for execution by the authorities; with the help of Emre, and through the intercession of American Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|Henry Morgenthau]], Chris is released and allowed to depart for Malta. Once there, he boards the French cruiser [[French cruiser Guichen|''Guichen'']], as it prepares to set sail along the Ottoman coast. Emre's role in helping to save Chris is discovered and he is executed by a firing squad.  Escaping pursuit, Mikael, Ana, and the orphans join a large group of refugees determined to fight off the Ottoman army on mount [[Musa Dagh]]. As they fend off repeated assaults, Mikael's mother succumbs to her wounds and is buried on the mountain. The refugees hold on long enough to escape on the back side to the coast as the ''Guichen'' comes to their rescue. But as the launches return to the ship, a Turkish artillery barrage throws Ana and Yeva, the young daughter of Mikael's uncle, overboard. Mikael jumps in after them and is able to rescue Yeva, but Ana drowns.  In a voice over, Mikael recounts that he adopted Yeva and together they settled in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]]. During Yeva's wedding reception in 1942, with the Armenian orphans who have now grown up in attendance, Mikael presides over a toast, wishing good fortune to their families and the generations to come.  
Pulimurugan
 Murugan ([[Mohanlal]]) lives in Puliyoor, a small forest village that is vulnerable to man-eating tigers— called ''Varayan Puli'' (striped leopard) by the villagers—and frequent [[human–wildlife conflict]]s. When he was young, Murugan's mother died after his brother Manikuttan was born. Soon after, his father was killed by a tiger; in vengeance, Murugan traps and kills the tiger with the help of his uncle Balaraman.  Years later, Murugan is a lorry driver, has married Myna ([[Kamalini Mukherjee]]), and has a daughter, Chakki. He hunts and kills rogue tigers whenever they invade the village. Acknowledging his skills in hunting ''Varayan Puli'', the villagers call him ''Pulimurugan'' (Leopard-Murugan). Murugan is grateful to the villagers who cared for him after his parents' deaths, and is obsessively protective of Manikuttan, who is about to finish his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] graduation in [[Mangalore]].  One day, Kadutha, the village chief, meets a hooded stranger who asks the whereabouts of Murugan for a hunting assignment. Murugan has been away from Puliyoor for days and many people have been killed by tigers. According to Kadutha, Manikuttan's friends Benny and Shiva have arriving at Puliyoor, sent by Manikuttan to see Balaraman. Shiva's father Daddy Girija owns a pharmaceutical company that is developing a drug to treat cancer and they need ''ganja'' ([[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) from the forest. If the medical research succeeds, Manikuttan will be offered a job in the company, so Balaraman helps them. They make a contract with Ramaiya, an illegal ''ganja'' dealer in the forest; on their return to the village they encounter a tiger but are saved by Murugan, who kills it.  Meanwhile, Manikuttan returns home after his final examinations. The forest officials have found the dead tiger's carcass at Thookupara; its killing is a violation of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972|Indian Wildlife Protection Act]], a non-bailable offence. [[Forest range officer|Forest ranger]] R. K. is assigned to incvestigate; R.K. has a four-year-old grudge against Murugan. R.K. had once tried to molest Myna, only to be threatened by Murugan. Taking advantage on the present scenario, R.K. prepares to file a self-witness [[First Information Report|F. I. R.]] against Murugan, who is forced to hide. Meanwhile, [[Deputy superintendent|ACP]] Iyep Zachariah arrives at Puliyoor, apparently for Murugan.  The ''ganja'' is loaded into Murugan's lorry for transporting to Mangalore. Shiva and Benny hear that a confidant of Ramaiya is in police custody; seeing a possibility of leaking the information, they are forced to transport it overnight. Shiva offer Murugan sanctuary in [[Kasaragod]] under Daddy's protection and deceives him that the police are in pursuit to arrest him for the tiger killing. A team lead by Zachariya arrives at Murugan's home. Murugan with his family escape to Mangalore in the transport and manage to escape the police. He delivers the ''ganja'' and Manikuttan gets the job he was offered.  Murugan impresses Daddy and earns his trust by helping in his business activities. Meanwhile, more people are killed by tigers at Puliyoor. In an encounter with Zachariya, Murugan learns that Daddy is illegally producing [[hash oil]] and exporting it under cover of the pharmacy where Manikuttan is working. Manikuttan co-operates with police to capture Daddy. Shiva catches Manikuttan extracting evidence of their activities and tortures him. Murugan rescues Manikuttan; in the ensuing fight, Shiva is accidentally killed by Murugan. Police ambush Daddy but he escapes.  Murugan returns home; the hooded stranger is revealed to be Daddy, who is seeking revenge for his son's death. He assembles a group of henchmen and assassins, and ambushes Balaraman and villager Poongayi Sasi. Daddy and his gang take Balaraman and send Sasi back with severe injuries. Murugan decides to kill Daddy and a battle with the assassins ensues. Murugan kills them all and saves Balaraman. Daddy is killed by the tiger and Murugan kills it.

The Purge: Election Year
 A young Charlene (aka "Charlie") Roan and her family are tied up by a masked purger. He taunts them with his "purge playlist", and then tells them they will play a final purge game called "Mommy's Choice." He then proceeds to kill the rest of Charlie's family and leaves her as the only survivor. Eighteen years later, Roan is a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] campaigning for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]], promising to end the annual purge nights. Former police sergeant Leo Barnes is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of America's (NFFA) leader, Caleb Warrens and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat; in the guise of regaining the public's trust, they revoke immunity for government officials to kill her on Purge night.   Watching the [[United States presidential debates|presidential debate]] are deli owner Joe Dixon, his assistant Marcos, and [[Emergency Medical Technician|EMT]] Laney Rucker. A pair of teenage girls enters the store and shoplifts, only to be cornered by Joe. The girls mock Joe until Laney intervenes; recognizing her as a famous ex-Purger, they leave peacefully. Joe receives a phone call stating the cost of his purge insurance has increased beyond his affordability. Joe decides to guard his store himself, despite Marcos and Laney's pleas not to. At the same time, the country's so-called "Murder tourism" booms the economy due to tourists visiting the United States to participate in the annual Purge nights.  On the night of the purge, Joe guards his store and is joined by Marcos, and together they manage to repel an attack by the teenage girls. Laney and her partner Dawn patrol the city in an ambulance, providing medical care to the wounded. Roan decides to wait out the purge from her home rather than a secure location to secure the vote, and is accompanied by Barnes, Chief Couper, Eric, and additional security forces. However, a betrayal by Chief Couper and Eric allows a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger to kill the security detail and invade the house. Barnes escorts Roan to safety, but is wounded in the process. He detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Chief Couper.  Navigating the hostile streets of Washington D.C., Barnes and Roan attempt to seek shelter, but are ambushed by a gang of Purgers and taken captive. Before they can be executed, Joe and Marcos kill the gang, having seen the pair's plight from the store's rooftop. As they take shelter in the store, the teenage girls return with reinforcements. However, Laney runs over their leader and kills half the group. As the other Purgers threaten to break in, they leave for a safer hideout. The team is ambushed by Danzinger in a helicopter, and seeks refuge beneath an overpass wherein Barnes realizes they were tracked by the bullet lodged inside him, and manages to extract it. After a confrontation with a large number of [[Crips (gang)|Crips]], the team helps their leader's injured comrade. In return, the Crips plant the bullet in another area to divert the paramilitary team, which they later eliminate.  The team arrives at an underground antipurge hideout run by Dante Bishop. Barnes discovers that Bishop's group intends to assassinate the NFFA, in an effort to end the purge. A large group of paramilitary forces arrives at the hideout looking for Bishop. Barnes and Roan escape back to the streets and meet Joe, Marcos, and Laney, who had left the hideout earlier to return to Joe's store. They board an ambulance.  While fleeing the city, the ambulance is hit by Danzinger's team. Roan is pulled from the van by the soldiers before Barnes can assist. Barnes leads the group and Bishop's team to a fortified cathedral where the NFFA plans to sacrifice her. Before Roan can be killed by the NFFA, the group arrives and assassinates Warrens, causing a shootout that kills the entire congregation except Owens and another NFFA loyalist, Harmon James, who escape. Owens is caught by Bishop's group, but Roan manages to persuade them to spare him. The remaining paramilitary forces arrive, killing Bishop and his team. Danzinger and Barnes engage in a melee which ends with the former's death. As Roan and the team free the imprisoned purge victims, James emerges and kills a released prisoner. Joe shoots him, but is fatally wounded. Before dying, Joe asks Marcos to take care of his store.  Two months later, Roan wins the [[United States presidential election|election]] in a landslide, while Barnes is appointed the new Director of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. Marcos and Laney renovate Joe's store and continue to run it in his memory. A news report then states that NFFA supporters have staged violent uprisings across the country in response to election results.

However, Yuma sees Naoto with an unknown girl at a cafe one day. Yuma also starts to realize that Naoto resembles another one of the police sketches of the murderer.

Instead, she gets brutally raped by two American soldiers from the nearby army base. Tatsuya sees this but is too scared to fight off the soldiers. After the soldiers leave, Izumi makes Tatsuya promise to not tell anyone what had just happened.   Meanwhile, in Chiba, Aiko starts to fear for her life and eventually calls the police, but not before tipping off Tetsuya. Tetsuya runs away before the detectives arrive to test his fingerprints. The forensic tests reveal that he is not the murderer. Aiko becomes unstable again as she fears she has lost the one man who would ever love her forever. However, Tetsuya calls her one last time and Maki manages to convince him to come home. Although Aiko now is happily reunited with Aiko, Maki has to live in fear for the rest of her life that his daughter's life will forever be in danger because of Tetsuya's dark past.

The following morning, Tatsuya goes to meet him there and finds the word "rage" scratched onto the wall, although he does not know what it means. In the end, Shingo confesses that he actually saw the Americans ogle at Izumi and shadowed them as they followed her. However, he did nothing Gto warn her because he wanted to see her raped.

Raman Raghav 2.0
 In 2013 Assistant Commissioner of Police Raghavan Amrendra Singh Umbi, a drug addict, makes a visit to a Mumbai drug dealer. However, his plan to purchase drugs is foiled – the dealer and another man have been murdered. Investigating the murders the next day, he receives a hammer followed by an anonymous phone call.  In 2015 a man named Ramanna surrenders to the police and confesses of killing nine people. He is detained and beaten by the police, but manages to escape with the help of a group of nearby boys. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigate the house, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime.  Raghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika "Simi" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has coerced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting some kind of link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, on a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer.  On a later evening Raghavan picks up another woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by his drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house, but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her fall into a glass table kills her instantly.  Ankita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her. He then clears away incriminating evidence and arranges the scene to implicate Ramanna for the murder. He retrieves a tire iron similar to Ramanna's favored murder weapon and smashes Simi's head with it. During these preparations Ankita escapes.  The next day Ramanna surrenders to Raghavan and claims a deep connection with him: each man is the missing half of the other. Ramanna also reveals his role in the two 2013 murders that opened the film and initiated this connection. He confesses to one of the killings, but witnessed Raghavan kill the other man, and thus began his surveillance of the policeman. Ramanna offers to accept the charge for Simi's murder, but only if Raghavan will kill the eyewitness, Ankita. In the final scene Raghavan's descent into evil matches Ramanna's when he murders Ankita in her home.

Ratchet & Clank (film)
 Above planet Tenemule in the Solana Galaxy, Chairman Drek and his fellow Blarg stand poised aboard the Deplanetizer, a space station with the capability to destroy entire planets. The Deplanetizer fires on Tenemule, completely destroying it. A news report later states that three other planets have disappeared mysteriously along with Tenemule. On planet Veldin, a young spaceship mechanic named Ratchet learns that the peacekeeping Galactic Rangers are being dispatched to deal with the situation, and will be visiting Veldin in search of recruits. Ratchet attempts to join, only to be rejected moments later by their leader, Captain Qwark.  Later, Drek is overseeing production of warbots at his factory on the Blargian homeworld of Quartu alongside his lieutenant Victor Von Ion and his devious chief scientist Dr. Nefarious. A blackout hits the factory, causing the system to produce a defect, a small but intelligent robot. The defect learns of Drek's plans and attempts to escape to planet Kerwan to warn the Rangers. Victor damages the defect's ship as he takes off, forcing him to crash land on Veldin. Ratchet discovers the defect, takes him in, and names him Clank.  Ratchet and Clank fly to Kerwan, where they save the Rangers from an army of warbots led by Victor, who escapes. Under pressure from reporters, Qwark names Ratchet and Clank honorary Rangers, but grows jealous of their newfound fame. Ratchet joins Brax Lectrus and Cora Veralux in the field, while Clank is assigned to the Rangers' mission support with Elaris, whom Qwark routinely ignores. Studying the destroyed planets, they discover the Blarg have been extracting portions containing famous landmarks from each. After briefing and weapons training, the Rangers infiltrate the factory on Quartu. They discover the Blarg are planning to build a replacement planet, named New Quartu, from the other worlds' fragments, since Quartu has been polluted beyond surface habitation. Interrogating Drek's assistant Zed, they learn the next target is Cora's homeworld, Novalis. Qwark, meanwhile, encounters Drek, who offers to help boost his image in spite of Ratchet and Clank. Qwark accepts so long as Drek agrees never to hurt his Rangers.  As the Rangers assault the Deplanetizer, Drek forces Qwark to deactivate the Rangers' weapons. Seeing an opportunity, Victor boards the Rangers' flagship and attacks Clank, who subdues him by tripping the ship's sprinkler system and causing him to rust. Ratchet manages to board the station, but Drek captures him. Ratchet notices Qwark standing by and realizes his treachery, and the Rangers can only watch as Novalis is destroyed. Appalled at Drek going back on his word, Qwark goes to confront him, but Nefarious also appears and chides him for selling out the Rangers. Qwark is surprised at Nefarious' presence, having thought him killed during a prison breakout. After Qwark leaves, Nefarious turns Drek into a sheep and ejects him to New Quartu in an escape pod. With Drek gone, Nefarious takes control of the Deplanetizer for his own intentions.  Ratchet exiles himself back to Veldin out of guilt for the loss of Novalis, but Clank and the Rangers find him and convince him to return. They learn the Deplanetizer's next target is planet Umbris, which has a highly unstable core that would annihilate all other planets in the galaxy were it destroyed. Interrogating Zed again, they discover the intent is Nefarious'.  The Rangers attack the Deplanetizer once more. Ratchet and Clank are intercepted by Qwark, and a brief battle ensues. Ratchet pleads with Qwark to stop, causing Qwark to realize he has been used. Qwark repents and apologizes, and the three confront Nefarious at the Deplanetizer's controls. Nefarious reveals he was once a Ranger himself before he left due to Qwark's mistreatment, and plans to humiliate him and the Rangers by having the entire galaxy destroyed on their watch. Nefarious fires the Deplanetizer, but the Rangers are able to immobilize it and move it off target from Umbris. It instead hits New Quartu, destroying the composite planet and killing Drek, who has just landed. Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark barely escape through a teleporter as the station falls toward Umbris, while Nefarious falls into the chamber of the Deplanetizer's laser and seemingly disintegrates.  With Nefarious thwarted, the Rangers return to a hero's welcome on Kerwan, with a now-demoted Private Qwark trying to promote his apologetic autobiography about the crisis. Ratchet and Clank reunite on Veldin, with Ratchet promising to rejoin the Rangers if he is needed.  In a mid-credits scene, Nefarious emerges from the Deplanetizer's wreckage on Umbris, now in his familiar robotic form. After the credits, [[List of Ratchet & Clank characters#The Plumber|the Plumber]] reprimands the audience and tells them to go home.

Remo (film)
 Siva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''Avvai Shanmugi 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a Pune-based doctor Vishwanathan alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though distraught, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of "Remo" (short for "Regina Motwani", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.  Ensuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her, but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away. Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would "change himself" to a man as a "magic trick"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.  A few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.  The film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish |Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo Nee Styleki'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K.

Present day, John, whose wife has recently passed, purchases the same house, having no knowledge of the deaths that occurred there more than a century earlier.&nbsp; He is joined by his elder daughter, Izzy, and his two younger children, Victoria and Aiden.  One day, while playing [[hide-and-seek]], Victoria and Aiden come across a chest in the attic containing some pictures, an old camera, an old doll, and an old pocket watch.&nbsp; Victoria becomes attached to the doll, saying it reminds her of her mother, while Aiden becomes attached to the old camera.  John becomes concerned, but at the same time finds himself becoming attached to the pocket watch.&nbsp; His concern grows when Victoria faints, and grows further when he has a dream in which he brutally murders Aiden in his sleep.&nbsp; When he questions the realtor, however, she claims to know nothing about the house's history.&nbsp; Meanwhile, his elder daughter, Izzy, remains aloof, caring more about spending time with her boyfriend and smoking pot than being an active member of the family.  One day, in the attic, John sees a girl—the same girl for whom the family in 1891 was looking.&nbsp; John thinks it's just some girl who has wandered into their house, but she tells him to "burn them," referring to the contents of the chest, before disappearing.&nbsp; John takes the items that had been in the chest away from the kids and places them in a cardboard box at the end of his sidewalk, but the items reappear in the house.  One night, at 3:00 AM, the younger kids, now fully possessed, beat their father nearly to death.&nbsp; When Izzy comes home, she finds her father, on the cusp of death; he tells her to "burn them."&nbsp; Izzy goes to John's room, collects the items, takes them to the back yard, and burns them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is too late.&nbsp; The ghost of Madame Addison kills John. Izzy and the children (released from the power of Madame Addison by the burning of the box) go back into the house and call 911. The call is disconnected and the lights go out. Madame Addison reappears, and she kills Izzy, Victoria, and Aiden off screen.  The film ends with the house being sold to another family by Claire, who remarks that they are right on time, 3:00.

Resident Evil: The Final Chapter
  [[List of Resident Evil characters#James Marcus|Dr. James Marcus]], the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of [[Progeria|premature aging]]. Desperate to save her, Marcus discovered the T-virus. Unfortunately, the virus had the side effect of sudden and uncontrollable mutation; in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], a boy dies in a cable car ascending to [[Table Mountain]], then reanimates and kills the other passengers. Marcus tried to have the program shut down, despite protests from his colleague Dr. Alexander Isaacs ([[Iain Glen]]). When Marcus refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill him. The Red Queen is then created using childhood images of Marcus' daughter.  Some time after the events of [[Resident Evil: Retribution|the previous film]], Alice awakens in the now-ruined [[White House]] after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While she is searching for survivors, the Red Queen appears and tells Alice she must return to the Hive, over 400 miles west on [[I-64]] in Raccoon City, within 48 hours. The Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which can kill every organism infected by the T-virus (which may or may not include Alice), and is just waiting for the remaining few thousand humans to be wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen says that she will explain once Alice arrives at the Hive.  On her way to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs—learning the one she [[Resident Evil: Extinction|previously killed]] was just a clone—though she manages to escape his convoy. Alice later arrives in Raccoon City and is ambushed by a group of survivors, consisting of Doc, Abigail, Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Alice's friend [[Claire Redfield]], who survived the [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|attack on Arcadia]]. With Isaacs' convoy approaching, trailed by a horde of zombies, the group prepares for battle. They defeat the convoy, retrieve Isaacs' few human captives and burn the horde, though Cobalt is killed. With more undead on the way and no defenses left, Alice and crew head for the Hive entrance, located at the bottom of the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|crater from the nuclear bomb]] dropped on the city. Wesker, having taken control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian and a freed captive.  Inside the Hive, the Red Queen appears to Alice and explains her reason for betraying Umbrella. She reveals that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of Isaacs explaining to Umbrella's executives the plan to release the T-virus, cleansing the world of man-made catastrophes while saving the rich and powerful in cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive, and later rebuild the world in their image. The Red Queen program is in conflict, as she can never hurt an Umbrella employee but also must value remaining human life, which is why she enlists Alice's help in order to stop Isaacs. Before proceeding onwards, Alice is silently warned by the Red Queen that someone in her group is a spy for Umbrella.  Navigating the Hive, the group encounter several traps, resulting in the deaths of Abigail and Razor along with the remaining freed captive. Alice and Doc plant bombs throughout the Hive taken from the leftover equipment [[Resident Evil (film)|of the original team to investigate the Hive]]. Alice confronts the real (tech-upgraded) Isaacs, whereupon she is held at gunpoint by Doc—Umbrella's spy—while Claire is captured by Wesker. A cryogenic capsule opens, releasing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-leader and Marcus' daughter. Isaacs reveals to Alice that she is actually a clone of Alicia, before going on to explain his plan in eliminating the pair so that he can assume full control of Umbrella. Though Isaacs is the co-founder of Umbrella, Alicia points out that Wesker is merely an employee and proceeds to "fire" him, allowing the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but he finds his gun empty—as Alice had earlier deduced his treachery—and Claire executes him. After giving Wesker the [[deadman's switch]] to the bombs she planted, Alice and Claire pursue Isaacs while Alicia willingly stays behind to review her childhood memories with her father.  Upon catching up to Isaacs, Alice and Claire fight him as the trio are lifted back up to the Hive.  Isaacs overpowers Claire and attacks Alice in the Laser Corridor.  Alice manages to dodge the lasers before re-engaging Isaacs, eventually beating him when she secretly activates a grenade in his pocket.  She escapes to the surface with the antivirus, but Isaacs reboots and follows; he catches her just as she's about to release the antivirus.  Before he can kill Alice, however, Isaacs is confronted and instantly killed by his clone, which Alice encountered ''en route'' to Raccoon City; the clone is then devoured by the undead.  The distraction allows Alice to release the antivirus, killing all of the undead around her before she passes out.  Wesker simultaneously drops the deadman's switch, destroying the Hive along with the hibernating Umbrella elite; Alicia and Wesker are killed in the process.  Claire wakes Alice, who survived because the antivirus killed only the T-virus within her body, not the healthy cells.  The Red Queen gives Alice an upload of all of Alicia's memories, granting her a childhood.  Alice travels into [[Manhattan]], saying that the antivirus, carried only by the winds, will take years to reach all corners of the globe.  Until then, says Alice, her mission is not finished.

The Revival: Women and the Word
  The documentary tells the story of how poet Jade Foster recruited a group of five dynamic poets and musicians to become a part of a movement that builds community among queer women of color, upholds literary arts excellence, and occupies living rooms across the country. The film follows Foster, [[Be Steadwell]], [[Jonquille Rice]], [[T'ai Freedom Ford]] and [[Eli Turner]] on a road trip as part of the Revival tour, wherein these queer black poets perform their work in various cities across the country. The movie starts in Brooklyn, before the first performance of what is dubbed the Revival tour. Within the film it takes you on a journey of their personal narratives while interweaving black feminist thinkers. Foster delivers powerful poetry throughout the film that speaks of both her own identity and her community. Ford brings up her mother’s history of addiction within the film. Some of the black feminist thinkers include author Alexis Deveaux, tells of the period of time in the mid-1970s when she offered a space for poetry in her own Brooklyn living room. Her personal narrative tells of the struggle black queer women performing poetry had attempting to navigate their identity and create safe spaces. The film does not shy away from the police brutality happening within the US by including black feminist poet Nikki Finney who plays a huge role in connecting the historical oppression of black people in the past to the current oppression black bodies currently face within the US.  Additionally, the film brings up the harm done to black queer bodies and they present their stories as a way to challenge this oppression of black queer bodies. One of the most important aspects of this movie is how it presents the identity of these queer black women as one whole thing. Not three, separated by gender, race and sexuality. This is the very definition of [[intersectionality]]. They show the lives of these five women to provide context of the experience of black queer women poets, musicians, authors, thinkers, feminists, activists, educators, and performers across the country.<ref name=fb/><ref></ref> <ref></ref>  
Ride Along 2
  The film starts in [[Miami]] on the boat of crime lord Antonio Pope. His hacker A.J. is going through a list on the computer. Pope calls Port Commissioner Griffin on the phone and accuses him of stealing money from him. With one of his hitmen in the room, Pope has Griffin killed in his apartment, then orders his [[hitmen]] to find whoever left with his money.  Meanwhile in [[Atlanta]], James is with his partner Detective Mayfield as they go to infiltrate a vehicle meet to find an infamous drug dealer named Troy. Ben, fresh out the academy, is eager to get in on the action, but James has him staying on the radio. James gets close enough to Troy, but Troy pulls a gun on him. Ben sees this over the camera and sneaks out to help. He rides into the meet in a showy car with hydraulics and draws unwanted attention to himself. He threatens Troy by acting tough dancing only to drop his badge in front of the crook. Then within seconds a brief shootout occurs leading to a random plan "B" with Mayfield getting shot and Troy making his escape. James and Ben go after him, with Ben nearly getting himself run over, though James follows Troy long enough until Troy drives out of a parking garage and onto another car. James then captures Troy and removes a necklace he was wearing which was also a flash drive.  Mayfield is later hospitalized, and at the hospital, James reprimands Ben for his decision since he got Mayfield injured in the chaos causing him to take a leave of absence due to his injury. Lt. Brooks assigns James to go to Miami and see who Troy was working for. Ben wants to go so that he can prove himself ready for detective work, but nobody believes in him, especially after the mess he just caused.  At home, Ben begins to plan his wedding to Angela, but he clashes with the wedding planner Cori. He tries to assert himself, but gets knocked out by the ceiling fan. Later, as Angela tries to seduce Ben, he complains about not being able to go to Miami. Angela calls James and tries to get him to take Ben, not just for himself, but so she can have him out of her hair while the wedding is planned. James refuses, but then changes his mind when he thinks he can prove that Ben doesn't have what it takes to be a detective. He goes to their house and officially invites Ben to Miami. James and Ben drive down to Miami together.  Ben starts his detective work by trying to blend in with the locals as they search for A.J. but Ben gets punished by homicide detective Maya Cruz for using her computer without permission. Later, James and Ben find the hacker, who tells them about a safe in a club that contains something important, but first they have to meet with someone there. The guys go to the club for work, but A.J. gets Ben to enjoy himself with an impromptu bachelor party. However, the man they are supposed to meet is also Pope's hitman. A.J. causes a distraction and escapes while James engages in a brief shoot-out with the hitman. Afterward, the two are met by Maya at the crime scene. The safe turned out to be empty. Before the guys can leave, James realizes a bomb was planted under his car, which goes off and destroys his car.  Ben realizes he kept A.J.'s phone on him, so they find his girlfriend Tasha to get a lead on his whereabouts. Ben convinces Tasha to spill the beans when he shows her that he's been hooking up with other women and given them unique ringtones, while Tasha is left with the generic Apple ringtone. The guys locate A.J. once more and bring him in on the investigation. He reveals to the team that Pope is the real crook, despite him having a public image as an entrepreneur working alongside the new port commissioner Nunez. The team is at the home of Maya's friend/associate Alonso, whom Ben accidentally shoots after getting scared. Despite getting shot, Alonso backs up A.J.'s word that Pope is a crook.  James, Ben, and Maya go to a party hosted by Pope in his mansion. Maya distracts Pope by dancing with him while James and Ben gather info, and A.J. is their eyes and ears. While snooping around, Ben is attacked by Pope's pet alligator, Marcus, in the backyard. After narrowly escaping from the jaws of Pope's pet alligator, Ben reconnects with the team and they get their information, but Pope catches them and knows they're cops, though he lets them go. The team uses their information to locate a group of shipping trucks that may be carrying Pope's contraband. However, when they attempt to stop the trucks at the port, they discover that the trucks are empty. Hernandez scolds the team, as Pope shows up and acts angry for what the team did. Nunez then shows up and calls Hernandez over. Brooks is informed of the screw-up and orders James to be suspended and for Ben to be fired.  The team goes to a bar to think about what they did wrong. Maya then questions as to why Nunez would have shown up so fast at the port. A.J. mentions that Nunez's name was on a list of guys on Pope's payroll. James realizes that Pope knew he would have gotten caught, so he had a decoy in the trucks, and the real contraband items are being brought in somewhere else at the port. James, Maya, and A.J. go after Pope, but Maya handcuffs Ben to a pole after James says he wants Ben to stay so he can take care of Angela. However, Ben breaks free and goes to Alonso's house to get the cuffs off.  James, Maya, and A.J. are at the port in the morning to catch Pope. They have a shootout with Pope and his goons, when Ben arrives and moves a truck to knock over a container with flammable barrels, causing them to explode. Pope runs and takes A.J. hostage, then tries fleeing in a truck. James goes after him, but Ben knocks a container into Pope's path, causing him to crash. James runs to the truck and doesn't find Pope. Pope tries to shoot James, but Ben jumps in the way and takes the bullet. James shoots Pope a few times to bring him down, then sees that Ben was wearing a bulletproof vest. Pope rises and shoots again, but James uses Ben as a human shield, and Maya shoots Pope once more for good measure, killing him and ending the gun battle once and for all.  James and Ben are off the hook for taking down Pope and Nunez and being commended for their services. They drive home in a yellow [[Lamborghini]] that Maya got for them to drive back to Atlanta for the wedding, with James asking Maya to be his date. Ben and Angela are married and are ready to go off on a boat ride, but Ben wants James to make a speech. Reluctantly, James speaks and says that while Ben has gotten him into a lot of trouble since meeting him, he has also saved his life, has made Angela very happy, and has helped James grow into a better man and cop. He finally accepts Ben as his new family. Ben and Angela then go on their boat ride, but Ben gets distracted and is thrown out the boat when he rides over a bump. He is then dragged through the water by a rope as Angela tries to stop the boat, all while James laughs at this.

Risen (2016 film)
 After crushing a [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealot]] revolt led by [[Barabbas]], Clavius, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Military tribune|Tribune]], is sent by [[Pontius Pilate]] to expedite a crucifixion already in progress. Three days later he is appointed to investigate the rumors of a risen Jewish [[Messiah]]. Pilate orders him to locate the missing body of [[Jesus|Yeshua]], one of the crucified men. In doing so, Pilate seeks to quell an imminent uprising in [[Jerusalem]] before the Emperor arrives.<ref name="THR 1"></ref> Failing to secure Yeshua's body, Clavius, with the support of his loyal aide Lucius, attempts to locate and question the disciples of Yeshua and those involved in his crucifixion and burial for clues to his disappearance.  Numerous leads are dug up, and their accounts soon become increasingly miraculous and difficult to believe. Some of the followers, like a prostitute named Mary Magdalene and a man named Bartholomew, seemingly speak only in riddles and refuse to betray any others. Clavius' intense investigative methods soon begin to disturb both Romans and Hebrews alike, and Pilate, under pressure from many sides and fearful of Caesar's wrath, becomes increasingly distant and unsupportive. Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now little more than a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, on the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and ropes sealing the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier running away in fear, and that he had not seen anything like this before. Clavius, however, believes that the soldier was merely drunk. Other informants also fail to provide much useful information.  During a raid through a Jewish enclave, Clavius unexpectedly discovers a seemingly resurrected Yeshua with his apostles in a solitary abode. A stunned Clavius calls off the search; dispersing his troops without revealing to them his personal encounter with the risen Yeshua. That night, another Roman raid, led by Lucius and Pilate, attacks the building that Clavius had forbidden them from entering, and finds it empty, save a note from Clavius, who has decided to continue the investigation on his own. Having abandoned [[Roman polytheism]] and the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Clavius, at first distrustful of the group, soon joins Yeshua and his followers on a journey to determine the validity of his mortal rejuvenation, during which he receives counseling from and befriends both Yeshua and the apostle Peter.  Pilate deduces that Clavius has apparently betrayed him, and dispatches a contingent of Roman troops, led by a promoted Lucius, to pursue him and Yeshua. Clavius assists the disciples in evading the Roman search party, and, when caught personally by Lucius, Clavius disarms him, then convinces him to let them pass quietly. Consequently, Clavius witnesses Yeshua's miraculous healing of a leper, and then the [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension of Yeshua]] into Heaven; after which the Apostles split up to resume their journeys, and Clavius bids farewell to Peter. Later, communicating his travels to a stranger in a remote dwelling, Clavius acknowledges the vivifying wisdom which he observed through Yeshua, feeling he will never be the same.

Le Ride
 Keoghan is seeking advice from [[Kennett Bros|Jonathan and Simon Kennett]] about re-enacting Harry Watson's 1928 ride in the Tour de France on period bicycles.<ref name="NZ Herald"></ref> Jonathan Kennett's advice to Keoghan is:  <blockquote>I don't think that you know what you are letting yourself in for, and if you did, you wouldn't do it.</blockquote>  Keoghan proceeds regardless and talks Ben Cornell into being his riding partner. They procure racing bikes from the era, and Keoghan researches the original route and drives it. The day after the [[2013 Tour de France]] arrives in Paris, Keoghan and Cornell set off; not as planned early in the morning but late in the afternoon after Cornell's bike was temporarily lost by an airline. Sticking to the original schedule for every stage, day 1 finished in the middle of the night; one of many night time finishes.  Keoghan and Cornell's experiences are interlaced with historic footage, showing the drama of the day. The 1928 race was designed to eliminate as many riders as possible, and of the 164<ref></ref> riders who started (other sources show slightly different numbers<ref></ref><ref></ref>), only 41 finished the race. Historic footage is narrated in newsreader style by veteran New Zealand newsreader Hewitt Humphrey. French media coverage is conveyed, where the general expectation was for the Australasian team to be eliminated quickly, as they would not be able to keep up with the 10-person teams of European riders.  Keoghan and Cornell sometimes get joined by other riders. In the [[Pyrenees]], a local cycle enthusiast and historian mapped out a detailed schedule which saw them start at midnight so that they would get to their destination before nightfall. The three set off together and by 8am, they had already covered , equating to half that day's distance. Keoghan wonders why they started so early, not realising that the harder part of the ride was still to come. In the end, Keoghan and Cornell could not keep up with their 65-year old host, who also rode a period bicycle, and they were slower than expected, finishing the day after 23 hours of riding. Keoghan and Cornell had difficulty navigating and on occasions, inadvertently ended up on [[Autoroutes of France|A class roads]] where cycling is prohibited.  Keoghan and Cornell arrived back in Paris after 26 days, as per their schedule, outside the [[Parc des Princes]] that in 1928 was a velodrome. They reflected that there are parts of the ride that they cannot remember due to physical and mental exhaustion. Against the odds, three of the four Australasian riders reached Paris, defying all dire predictions. Keoghan repeatedly reflects that despite his and Cornell's exhaustion, their 2013 ride was much easier than what Watson encountered, with unsealed roads and many punctures per day.  
Rock Dog
 Teenage [[Tibetan Mastiff]] Bodi ([[Luke Wilson]]) is expected to be the next guard of the village of Snow Mountain, succeeding his father Khampa ([[J. K. Simmons]]), who years ago drove out a pack of [[gangster]] grey wolves, led by the villainous Linnux ([[Lewis Black]]). Khampa has some local sheep disguised as Mastiffs to give the illusion the village has multiple guards to keep the wolves at bay, but Bodi has trouble perfecting his father's signature move the Iron Paw, which projects a powerful blast that can only happen if Bodi "finds the fire." Khampa has forbidden music in the village as it distracted Bodi from his duties when he was younger.  After a disastrous training session, Bodi indirectly causes a nearby flying plane to drop a package. Among the items, Bodi becomes interested in a radio and listens to rock music, becoming entranced with British rock legend Angus Scattergood ([[Eddie Izzard]]). Bodi steals a traditional [[dramyin]] from a den of locked up instruments, adds additional strings to make it a conventional Western [[guitar]], and neglects his duties in favor of becoming a musician, putting him at odds with his father. After Khampa and some of the guard sheep accidentally cause Bodi to unleash a false alarm on the village while dressed as wolves (in an attempt to scare him straight), village elder Fleetwood Yak ([[Sam Elliott]]) convinces Khampa to let Bodi follow his dream. Bodi is given a bus ticket to a nearby city, but Khampa makes him promise to give up music if his trip doesn't work out. At the bus station, Bodi is discovered by two of Linnux's henchman, Riff ([[Kenan Thompson]]) and Skozz, and he orders them to kidnap Bodi, reasoning it is his chance to take over Snow Mountain.  Bodi arrives at the city, and heads to Rock and Roll Park as it is where Scattergood began his career. He attempts to join a band consisting of the down-to-earth fox Darma ([[Mae Whitman]]) and absent-minded goat drummer Germur ([[Jorge Garcia]]). However, Bodi is humiliated after losing a guitar contest to arrogant snow leopard Trey ([[Matt Dillon]]), amused by Bodi's naivety. Trey, discovering his idolization for Scattergood, manipulates Bodi into convincing Scattergood to give him some guitar lessons at his mansion, though he knows a little secret about Angus' security set-up. At Scattergood's mansion, he is revealed to be a white [[Persian cat]] who wears black sunglasses all the time and has a serious case of writer's block, with his only companion being his robot butler Ozzie. Angus' manager, Ian, gives him three days to create a new song.  When Bodi tries to meet Scattergood, he is put off by Bodi's fanboy attitude and tries to evade him. Eventually, Bodi and Scattergood get lost in a back alley and Bodi decides to play music at Rock and Roll Park to get money for Scattergood to return to his mansion. However, Riff and Skozz mistakenly kidnap Scattergood after they see Bodi at the park. After Riff and Skozz realize their error, Linnux angrily sends them to find Bodi again and they drop Scattergood off at his home. Scattergood believes his career is over since he has less than a day to write a new song, when he hears Bodi playing on his guitar and invites him into his home with the facade of a "guitar lesson", creating a new song called "Glorious". Bodi later realizes that he was used after hearing Scattergood take full credit for the song on a radio. Trey mocks Bodi and everyone in the park leaves. Soon after, Bodi is captured by Linnux's henchmen via tranquilizer darts, and under their effects he reveals the fake Mastiff guards when Linnux interrogates him. Linnux and his gang head to Snow Mountain while Bodi is put into a boxing match at Linnux's Fight Palace, but Bodi cleverly has his opponent break the cage surrounding them so he can escape.  Scattergood, guilt-tripped by Ozzie for exploiting Bodi, uses his old tour bus to find him. At Rock and Roll Park, Scattergood meets with Darma and Germur and discover Bodi's capture when they see his dart-covered guitar. Scattergood forgoes sending in his new song to rescue Bodi. Meeting Bodi outside of Linnux's hideout, Scattergood makes amends by giving his old acoustic guitar with his autograph as a sign of gratitude and takes him to Snow Mountain to stop Linnux and his henchmen. Linnux and his gang overpower Khampa and the whole village and attempt to devour the villagers, but Bodi appears. After a climactic chase, Bodi subdues the wolves by "finding the fire" by playing Scattergood's guitar and making the wolves, the villagers, and his friends levitate. Khampa banishes Linnux with his Iron Paw and accepts Bodi's ambition to play rock music.  At the city, Scattergood gives full credit of "Glorious" to Bodi. Bodi forms a band with Darma and Germur as they (including Scattergood, Fleetwood, and the sheep) sing and play "Glorious" to the city, the Snow Mountain villagers, Khampa, and most of the redeemed wolves (including Riff and Skozz) at Linnux's old Fight Palace. Outside, Trey tries to convince a bear bouncer that he's a part of the band, but is rejected. Scattergood recommends Bodi's band to Ian as Bodi shows the audience his blue energy wave.  
Robinson Crusoe (2016 film)
 All the [[Animals|animals]] inhabited a tiny isolated South Pacific Island. One of them, a [[Scarlet macaw|Scarlet Macaw]] named Mak and his friends, including an [[Echidna|echidna]] named Epi, a [[Chameleon|chameleon]] named Carmello, a [[Tapir]] named Rosie, a [[Kingfisher|kingfisher]] named Kiki, an old [[Goat|goat]] named Scrubby, and a [[Pangolin|pangolin]] named Pango all lived the perfect lives; blue skies, beautiful turquoise water, and lots of delicious food and crunchy insects. But every day is the same and Mak is really bored. Convinced there is more than just water over the horizon, he dreams of leaving his little paradise and exploring the new world. Meanwhile, an hunter english man named [[Robinson Crusoe]] and his [[Bloodhound|dog]] hunter, Aynsley have booked passage on a ship to the trip to the new world to seek riches and gold. During a very violent storm at night, the two are accidentally locked in the ship's hull along with a pair of embittered [[Cat|cats]], Mal and May, while the crew escapes with their lives; leaving the latter behind. During the storm, Mak, his friends and the rest of the animals of the island try to save Scrubby from falling to his death, which nearly goes bad, while trying to seek shelter in a cave on the high grounds from the storm.  Arriving on the island, in the next morning, Crusoe begins to look for gold and riches while the animals of island, unsure of what to make of the strangers, hide out on the beach. Mak, seeing his chance to get off the island, convinces the other animals of the island to hide while he keeps an eye on them. Unfortunately, the next day, he is attacked by Mal and May, that have survived the storm. Luckily, Aynsley he drives them away to drive them off and Crusoe takes Mak aboard the wreckage to recover from his wing injury from the attack. He renames the bird Tuesday (after their second day on the island) and Aynsley convinces him that he and Crusoe are friends.  Determined to take possession of the island and make Crusoe leave the island, Mal and May trick the animals of the island into believing Crusoe has murdered Mak. They have them attack Crusoe while they go after Mak and Aynsley in order to cover their tracks. In the ensuing chaos, Aynsley is pinned under a door as the remains of the ship begins to catch fire. Mak makes it out in time, but Aynsley dies in the explosion, which strands Mal and May on "Curse Island", a little island where all the evil animals exiled live.  After Crusoe mourns by Aynsley's death, Mak leads a grieving Crusoe to the others animals, having realized the cats' deception, in an attempt to cheer him up. Slowly but surely, the animals they realize that it is not bad and begin helping him adjust to life on the island by providing him with fruits for food and helping him build a tree house, a "pipeline" for the fresh water supply, and a watchtower in case of any passing ships. However, Kiki becomes increasingly annoyed by the others' willingness to adapt to Crusoe's lifestyle as the months go by. Yet, sometimes, Crusoe seems upset by the dwindling possibility of a rescue. One afternoon, Kiki, worked up, flies out near the remains of the ship; lamenting about their lives with Crusoe, until Mal and May, with multiple litters of youngsters and having survived with nothing to eat but bugs on the rock, manage to get back on the main island from the wooden plank remains of the ship and decide to put an end to Crusoe and his friends' lives and wreak havoc on their little piece of Eden.  Despite Mal and May's best efforts, the animals they manage to defeat them back momentarily. Realizing the cats won't stop harassing them, at night, Mak leads them to the watchtower and, with his friends' help, traps them inside while the animals of the island knock it down the cats into the sea. However, their victory is short lived when a fire set by May earlier endangers Crusoe and the evil animals, who was knocked unconscious in the previous fight. Mak manages to get him out, also to the evil animals who were stuck in a log on fire. they manage to get them out to the animals evil but Crusoe becomes caught in some rigging and is rendered unconscious again by a falling wooden plank.  Complicating matters is that the fire attracts the attention of a band of [[Pirate|pirates]] led by the Captain [[Long John Silver]], who drive off the "animals" trying to save Crusoe on the same night and "rescue" him the next morning. Crusoe manages to placate them with a fictionalized version of what happened at the expense of the captain forcing him into the crew and refusing to return him back home to [[England]] due to the fear of being hung from the gallows; despite considering Crusoe's story as nothing more than yarn. During his story-telling, Mak, who followed Crusoe onto the boat, tells the true story of what really happened to a pair of [[Mouse|mice]] named Rufus and Cecil.  A poorly planned escape attempt by Crusoe results in a hectic chase. Mak rescues him (by tricking the pirates with a perfect voice imitation of the Captain momentarily) and the mice and make their way back to the island while the cats, who snuck onto the ship on a jerry-rigged life raft made out from the remains of the watchtower, which Crusoe later uses to row back to the island, are adopted in by the pirates.  During the credits, stills of the animals and the evil animals that are now reformed' lives with Robinson Crusoe along with Rufus and Cecil are revealed as they repair the tree house while readjusting to their lives on the island and the cats adjusting to life with Long John Silver and his crew.

Rogue One
  Research scientist Galen Erso and his family are in hiding on the planet Lah'mu when [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] weapons developer [[Orson Krennic]] arrives to press him into completing the [[Death Star]], a [[space station]]-based [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire planets. Galen's wife, Lyra, is killed in the confrontation while their daughter, [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]], escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist [[Saw Gerrera]].  Thirteen years later, cargo pilot [[Bodhi Rook]] defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon [[Jedha]]. After learning about the Death Star from an agent at the trading outpost Ring of Kafrene, [[Rebel Alliance]] intelligence officer [[Cassian Andor]] frees Jyn from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]], who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him.  Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed Imperial [[Droid (robot)|droid]] [[K-2SO]] travel to Jedha, where the Empire is removing [[kyber crystal]]s from the holy city to power the Death Star while Gerrera and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against them. With the aid of blind spiritual warrior [[Chirrut Îmwe]] and his mercenary friend [[Baze Malbus]], Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who has been holding Rook captive. Gerrera shows her the message, in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial data bank on the planet [[Scarif]].  On the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot which destroys Jedha's capital. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains to die with the city. [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet [[Eadu]], where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen. Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in his daughter's arms, before she escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by [[Darth Vader]] to answer for the attack on Eadu. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but Vader instead orders him to ensure no further breaches occur.  Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet but fails to gain approval from the Alliance Council, who feel victory against the Empire is now impossible. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group lead a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the databank themselves. Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, which Rook dubs "Rogue One", a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO while the other Rebels attack the resident [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Imperial garrison]] as a diversion. The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploy in support. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Îmwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus dies in battle shortly afterwards. Rook is killed by a grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics, but they are ambushed by Krennic, who is eventually shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship. The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif, where Tarkin uses another low-power shot to destroy the compromised base, killing Krennic, Cassian, and Jyn.  The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], but many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's flagship. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and attempts to regain the schematics, but a hope for the Rebellion.  
Rock On 2
 The film starts off with '''Joseph “Joe” Mascarenhas''' ([[Arjun Rampal]]) being introduced to the audience. Joe is now a judge at a successful reality show and the working partner of Club Bar & Blues, where he often meets his other friend from the band Magik, '''Kedar Zaveri''' ([[Purab Kohli]]), better known as '''Killer Drummer''', or '''KD'''. As the story goes on, KD narrates how '''Aditya “Adi” Shroff''' ([[Farhan Akhtar]]), Magik's lead singer, left the city and its comforts due to a nightmare haunting him and a painful experience, and has been living for 5 years in a small village near Shillong, Meghalaya. According to KD, little do any of them know that a young music programmer, '''Jiah Sharma''', would bring them together.  '''Jiah''' ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) lives with her father, '''Pandit Vibhuti Sharma''' ([[Kumud Mishra]]), who was once a great Sarod player, and his referred to by Jiah affectionately as “Baba”. She finds, one day, that a young boy, '''Uday Brijkishore Mishra''' ([[Shashank Arora]]), has come over to Baba, and wants to learn music and the Sarod from him. However, since he is too scared to even listen to how perfectly Uday is playing the Sarod due to memories of his late son instantly being triggered off, Panditji leaves the room. Jiah convinces Uday to continue his struggles and assures him that his harsh days would come to an end. Uday also learns about Jiah’s singing talent, and plays a Sarod composition of the song Jiah recorded. This composition is recorded by Jiah in a CD which she asks Uday to give to the Club Bar & Blues studio, headed by Joe, little realizing that giving the CD would bring about a huge twist of fate and also reunite band members of Magik in the process.  Meanwhile, Adi is visited by Joe and KD on his birthday, along with Adi’s wife '''Sakshi''' ([[Prachi Desai]]) and Joe’s wife '''Debbie''' ([[Shahana Goswami]]). Adi also finds his son, Rob, who he has named after Magik’s only late member, '''Rob Nancy''' ([[Luke Kenny]]), sleeping in the car and wakes him up. Soon after, as they gather together, Joe and KD find Adi’s poetry in his diary, and ask him if he has created a tune, to which he agrees to play it. The next morning, however, a free talk between the trio swiftly develops into a past hunting argument, and it is soon revealed that Adi is tormented by the failure of his music label in Mumbai, which, along with the money invested, also took away a young aspiring artist’s life. KD blames Adi for trying to run away, while Adi ends up accusing Joe of going money-centric. However, the argument ceases soon, and Joe asks Adi to calm down as it is his birthday. They finally reconcile after an adventure. Sakshi asks Adi to return to Mumbai, but he refuses. The next day, Adi bids a goodbye to his friend, and KD promises to return with Adi’s bike and friends in 3 days. The film flashes back to Magik’s old days.  Adi returns to his old life and recalls how a young boy, '''Rahul Sharma''' ('''Priyanshu Painyuli'''), wanted to give him a CD, but Adi’s losses and rude behaviour towards him forced the young boy to commit suicide. He still hasn’t gotten over the nightmares, but soon also stands to lose his hard-gained self-help world in the village when his cooperative, his farm, and his school, all catch fire. Left with nothing, he travels to Cherrapunji , where Jiah meets him. Adi falls unconscious when Jiah tends to him. The next day, KD discovers him, egging him on to return to Mumbai and try moving on. Uday and Jiah are called by Joe to the studio, where Jiah meets Adi and later performs her song live in the studio.  Magik members find the song really good and suggest Jiah sing in an upcoming concert, but telling a lie to Baba on that pretext shames Jiah into recalling how Panditji criticized modern day music, calling it a destroyer of the soulfulness and purity of the art. She runs away from the concert. A scuffle between Joe and KD soon brings up truth to the surface, and Adi and his friends eventually take a shocking retreat when they come to know that Panditji is Jiah’s father, and that Rahul, the boy who committed suicide, is Jiah’s brother. Amidst a highly tense atmosphere, while Joe refuses to cooperate with Adi and KD in their thoughts of apologizing to Jiah, the story flashes back to 5 years ago when Rahul tried to attack Adi. The resulting fight attracted a threat from Rahul, following which Rahul committed suicide by the time Adi and KD heard his CD and decided to call him. Jiah learns of the truth and breaks off all contact with Magik and Uday, and recalls how Baba chided Rahul for ruining the art of Indian music despite his pleadings and valid excuses. Adi learns of some problem in the town in Meghalaya where he had been living, and this causes a rift between him and Sakshi, who is upset that he does not have time for her. Adi lands at the airport, where he encounters Jiah again, but they are unable to get over Rahul’s death. Finally, after some hard thinking, Jiah visits Adi in the village, and convinces him to stop brooding over Rahul’s suicide, stating that he was so dejected with life that he ended up messing with Adi’s life as well. Adi visits the camp but there is not much funding available, so Joe and KD come up with the idea of organizing a rock concert with some known bands to raise collective funds. However, as soon as '''Mahender''', the state welfare board chief, who had earlier gotten into an egoistic argument with Adi, comes to know of this, he orders an ambush on the concert venue, thus ruining everything.  That very day, Panditji gets a call from a Zee News reporter and is shocked to learn that Jiah is at the venue of attack. During an angry conversation, Jiah vents out to Baba that it was he who had killed Rahul by not providing him the motivation that he needed badly in life. Panditji breaks down, and drops the phone. Meanwhile, a contestant from Joe’s reality show, '''Mann Jyot''' ('''Dinesh Kumar'''), brings some equipment as a replacement of the broken setup. The concert becomes a success even as Adi gets Jiah to overcome her fears and apprehensions. The village recovers from its crisis as Mahender is forced to release funds, and Magik reunites eventually, while Uday is a new member and Jiah becomes a singing sensation.

Rules Don't Apply
  In 1964 [[Acapulco]], Frank Forbes, Levar Mathis, and Nadine Henly are anxiously pushing their employer, Howard Hughes, to phone in to a press conference.  In 1958 [[Los Angeles]], Frank picks up Marla Mabrey, a devout [[Baptists|Baptist]] beauty queen, alongside her strict mother Lucy. Marla is under contract with Hughes' [[RKO Pictures]], receiving $400 a week ($ today) and living in a beautiful home. Frank becomes Marla's main driver, chauffeuring her to the singing and dancing classes set up for Hughes' current retinue of 26 contract starlets.  Marla patiently waits for her screen test for ''Stella Starlight'', but delays frustrate Marla and her mother, compounded by the fact that they have yet to meet Hughes. Marla befriends fellow RKO starlet Mamie. Levar regularly reminds Frank that the starlets cannot have boyfriends, and the chauffeurs must avoid any friendships with the girls. Frank is also devoutly religious, though he and his fiancée Sarah have secretly had sex, which they believe makes them effectively married already. When Lucy decides that they should return to [[Virginia]], Marla opts to continue waiting for her screen test.  With her mother gone, Frank and Marla develop a deep connection. He lets her drive the car, and even tells her the full detail of his relationship with Sarah when Marla confides her virginity. Marla eventually shares that her worries over conforming to the Hollywood "rules" of being a great singer, dancer, or having a big bosom. Frank tells her that the rules do not apply to her. Marla finally meets Hughes in a private bungalow, where she turns down his offer of a drink and talks frankly about her aspirations to act. Nadine, Hughes' executive secretary, sets up Marla's screen test. Frank also meets Hughes for the first time, during which Hughes takes an immediate liking to him and brings Frank into his inner circle of staff.  Hughes becomes very reclusive, worried that the minority shareholders at [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA), who openly disagree with how he runs the company, will try to have him committed so that they can control the company. His right-hand-man [[Noah Dietrich]] upsets Hughes by suggesting he see a psychiatrist, and Hughes gets legal advice that he should get married so his "wife" can refuse to sign any commitment papers. Marla's screen test is a meaningless façade. Later, she sings Frank a song she wrote for him, leading to them sharing a passionate kiss. They quickly stop themselves; Marla tells him that she feels like an adulterer, but Frank says that he will break up with Sarah.  While Frank is gone, Marla is called to another late night meeting with Hughes. She is very upset about Frank and consumes alcohol for the first time. When Hughes finally joins her, a very drunk Marla tells him how special he is. She performs her song for Hughes, who becomes emotional and suddenly proposes marriage, resulting in them having sex. The next day, Frank is devastated when she reveals that she is engaged to someone (she doesn't say who) and rudely dismisses him.  Within days, Hughes marries [[Jean Peters]] to protect him from being committed, fires Noah and hires Robert Maheu to be the CEO of his companies. Maheu warns him that the TWA shareholders could force Hughes to physically appear in court on charges of mismanaging TWA.  Marla is upset with herself for believing Hughes' proposal and having sex with him. When she later informs Hughes that she is pregnant with his child, he reacts by suggesting she is lying and looking for money. She is again very dismissive and rude to Frank, then returns to Virginia.  Hughes takes his entourage out of the U.S., becoming more and more reclusive.  When the U.S. courts decide in favor of the minority TWA shareholders, with a judgement for $645 million, Hughes has to sell his most cherished asset, his father's original [[Hughes Tool Company]], to pay off the debt.  The story then jumps forward to 1964, with Frank, Levar, and Nadine waiting for Hughes to make his call to the U.S. press. It concerns a book written by Miskin, Mamie's ex-boyfriend, who claims to have interviewed Hughes in person and that Hughes has complete dementia, which could cost him the rest of his empire. Marla suddenly arrives with Matt, her and Hughes' five-year-old, with news that Mamie is ready to confirm in court that Miskin never met Hughes &ndash; so Hughes does not need to take the call.  When he learns that Matt is there, he finds the strength to make the phone call. Hughes talks in great detail about many current and past events &ndash; proving he is lucid &ndash; then confirms that he has never met Miskin.  Frank immediately quits his job, goes after Marla and Matt, and the three leave together to live as a family in Los Angeles.

Their marriage hits the rocks when Rustom discovers about his wife's affair with his friend Vikram Makhija ([[Arjan Bajwa]]). After returning early from his ship's deployment, Rustom discovers Vikram's love letters in Cynthia's cupboard. While trying to find her, Rustom sees them together. He returns home and waits for Cynthia to return and then confronts her with the love letters, but walks away before Cynthia can explain. Rustom then gets himself a pistol from the Naval Ship's Armory and makes a [[Long-distance calling|Trunk call]] to Defence HQ, New Delhi. Afterwards, he searches for Vikram, first in his office and then at his home. After Rustom enters Vikram's bedroom, the servant hears three gun shots and rushes to the room, to discover Vikram's body in a pool of blood and Rustom walking away with the pistol in his hand. Rustom immediately surrenders to the police and Inspector Vincent Lobo ([[Pavan Malhotra]]) starts the investigation.  Vikram's sister Priti Makhija ([[Esha Gupta]]) meets with public prosecutor, Lakshman Khangani ([[Sachin Khedekar]]) to get Rustom the toughest punishment possible. ''Truth'', a local newspaper, publishes the news adding some spice to it, which creates a stir in the city. On the one side the Navy supports its officer and asks the police to hand over his custody to them while on the other side the Parsi community offers help by hiring a good defense lawyer. Rustom refuses everybody's help and decides to fight the case on his own and prefers police custody. While the Editor in Chief of Truth, Erich Billimoria ([[Kumud Mishra]]), creates a sympathetic image for Rustom in public, Rustom's senior Naval officer Rear Admiral Prashant Kamat ([[Parmeet Sethi]]) sends two goons to his house to search for a set of documents, but they fail to find anything. Scared, Cynthia rushes to jail to inform Rustom, who hasn't talked to her ever since he is in custody. Rustom finally meets and listens to Cynthia's story, about how she was lonely and upset when Rustom went away to London for many months. With the connivance of Priti, Vikram took advantage of Cynthia's loneliness and she fell for him. However, on the day of Vikram's murder, Cynthia had already broken-up with him for the sake of her marriage after she found out he had deceived her. Vikram couldn't bear her spurning him and slapped her hard. She got injured and walked out of Vikram's house.  On Rustom's instructions, Cynthia blackmails Rear Admiral Prashant Kamat for Rs 5 crore in exchange for the vital documents he needed. In the court hearing, Rustom unexpectedly pleads not guilty in front of the Judge Patel ([[Anang Desai]]), which leads to a 9-member jury trial. At the culmination of the trial, Rustom is found not guilty by the jury since he shot Vikram in self-defence. Meanwhile, it is found that Vincent Lobo was in Delhi and he had met the office secretary of the Ministry of Defence to obtain the recording of the trunk call that Rustom had made. When back in Bombay, the trunk call is played, convincing almost everyone that Rustom is guilty, and the court proceedings end for the jury to decide on their opinion. In the police station on the night of the court proceeding, Rustom tells Vincent Lobo the truth: he was posted in London for several months inspecting an aircraft carrier that the Navy wants to purchase, but on inspection, it was found by Rustom that the carrier's hull was corroded, and it would have to be repaired and modified before the carrier could be transferred to India. Vikram was in charge of the aircraft carrier, and he attempted to bribe him in order to convince him to say that the carrier is seaworthy. When Rustom attempted to notify the defence secretary in London, the secretary also attempted to bribe him and get the carrier to India. Vikram attempted to persuade him and Rustom then slapped him showing his power of his uniform. The next day it is shown that Rustom is proved not guilty by the jury and he walks free. Then it is shown in the flashback that Vikram had dated Cynthia to show Rustom his power of money and take revenge on him, but not for her beauty. Lobo is told that Rustom did not reveal about the aircraft carrier as then everyone would think the navy to be corrupt and then not believe in them just because of few officers. Rustom and Cynthia walk out of the court with their heads held up high and then the film rolls into the credits. In the end it is shown that after Rustom's trial, the jury system is abolished in India. And also Defence Secretary K. G. Bakshi committed suicide by shooting himself on INS Vishal unexpectedly.

Sadako vs. Kayako
 A social worker visits the residence of an elderly woman, only to find her strangled by an electric cord. A nearby video player suddenly plays the footage of the infamous cursed videotape. As the social worker watches, [[Sadako Yamamura]] manifests behind her. The social worker is eventually killed with a knife slitting her throat.     The video player is later sold at a shop and eventually bought by university students Yuri Kurahashi and Natsumi Ueno, who want to use it to burn a copy of Natsumi's parents' wedding tape onto a DVD. When they find the cursed videotape inside the player, a curious Yuri plays it. Yuri is then distracted by her phone, so she ends up not watching the footage – only a horrified Natsumi does. Meanwhile, a part-time worker in the shop where the two students purchased the video player informs the owners of the shop that she had watched the cursed videotape. The part-timer worker walks upstairs and suddenly falls off the upper level to her death. The girls decide to return the video player to the shop, where they also learn about the recent deaths related to the cursed videotape.   Desperate, the girls go to Morishige, their professor and an author on [[urban legends]]. Obsessed with the idea of meeting Sadako, Morishige eagerly watches the cursed videotape, although the girls are less than thrilled, as Natsumi only has one day to live. Morishige takes the girls to an exorcist in the hopes that she can save Natsumi. However, Sadako possesses Natsumi and forces Morishige, the exorcist and her two assistants to kill themselves for interfering. In her dying breath, the exorcist tells the girls that a man with psychic powers, Keizo Tokiwa, is on his way to help them.   When a despondent Natsumi blames Yuri for her situation, Yuri watches the tape, hoping that this will pass the curse on to her and Natsumi will be spared. However, Keizo arrives, accompanied by a blind psychic girl, Tamao, who tells Yuri that she has just unnecessarily cursed herself. The only way to permanently expunge the curse is to pit Sadako against another vengeful spirit so both obliterate each other. As Yuri hears that Natsumi has uploaded the cursed tape onto the Internet, Natsumi tries to commit suicide to escape her imminent death. Whilst Yuri rushes to save Natsumi, Sadako appears before Natsumi and kills her via hanging. Keizo and Tamao target [[Kayako Saeki]] to be the rival spirit.   Meanwhile, high school student Suzuka Takagi starts having dreams of the haunted Saeki house after moving in nearby with her family. She later runs into Keizo and Tamao, who states that the house beckons to Suzuka. Keizo warns her not to enter or she will be killed. After Suzuka leaves, a group of bullies arrive and force a schoolboy to enter the Saeki house. However, Kayako and Toshio violently drag all of them to their demise, including the schoolboy. That night, Suzuka thinks she sees someone inside the Saeki house and goes inside herself. She sees Toshio and her screams prompted her parents to rush in, but Kayako and Toshio kill them both. Keizo saves Suzuka, although she is already cursed. Yuri and Suzuka team up for Keizo's plan, where they enter the Saeki house so that Suzuka can watch the cursed videotape inside and Yuri can see Kayako, thus becoming afflicted with both curses. Keizo hopes this will make Sadako and Kayako fight over the girls and obliterate each other in the process. As the plan unfolds, Toshio appears, but Sadako drags him inside the TV with her hair. Sadako crawls out of the TV whilst Kayako crawls downstairs, prompting them to brutally confront each other, which ultimately ends in a stalemate. Keizo orders Yuri and Suzuka to flee, upon realizing that his plan failed.   Keizo reveals his last resort: one of the girls has to lure both ghosts into the well so they can be sealed inside. Yuri chooses to sacrifice herself, jumping into the well as Sadako and Kayako rush towards her, resulting in a collision that instantly bisects Keizo and forms a contorting mass of flesh. The mass enters the well and possesses Yuri. Suzuka seals the well and seemingly imprisons the mass for good. This last resort does not work either: Yuri, who has Sadako's appearance, crawls out, emitting Kayako’s [[death rattle]]; both Sadako and Kayako's curses have combined, and become a single entity – Sadakaya. Sadakaya approaches a screaming Suzuka while Toshio appears behind Tamao. Their fates are left unknown.   In a [[post-credits scene]], Sadakaya is shown in the videotape footage, which is now set in Kayako's house instead of using the well as a backdrop. Now croaking and body contorting as she moves toward the screen, she enters through the doorway at the very back before teleporting to the front of the screen and shrieking.

The attacker also left behind  a [[mobile phone]] and money which Rana purchased groceries with, thinking Emad had left it for her. Emad increasingly blames Babak for hiding the truth about the former tenant, at one point calling his character Charley a degenerate in the midst of a performance, although this is not in Miller's script.  Finally, Emad turns to one of his students, whose father used to work in the [[Iranian Traffic Police|police]]. He is able to trace the truck to a man named Majid. Emad consults Majid's prospective father-in-law, who says the truck is shared. Gradually, it becomes apparent the older man was himself the intruder, though he denies attacking Rana, implying he simply startled her. Emad calls the old man's family to the apartment, and locks him in a small room to wait, intending to reveal his true character to them all. When he opens the room the old man appears to be having heart trouble and Emad calls Rana in a panic. When Rana learns what Emad intends, she says it will be over between them if he pursues his revenge.  When the family arrives they believe they have been called to a medical emergency, thanking Emad for saving his life. Just before they leave, Emad insists on settling his account with the old man in private, returning the money he had left after Rana's assault. Unseen by the family, Emad slaps the old man, who then collapses as he is leaving with his family, and they call an ambulance. Rana and Emad return to the theatre together.

Salt and Fire
 Three scientists (Dr. Laura Sommerfield, Dr. Fabio Cavani, and Dr. Arnold Meir) are sent to South America as part of a [[United Nations|U.N.]] investigation into an ecological disaster of [[Salar de Uyuni]]. In the past, two rivers had been diverted for irrigation, but the effort failed, and the result was an ever growing toxic salt flat.   Upon landing, all three are kidnapped by the man who had become CEO (played by [[Michael Shannon]]) of the large international consortium held responsible for the ecological disaster. He seems both tormented by the disaster and uncertain of its significance in the larger scheme of things—for the nearby [[supervolcano]], [[Uturunku]], has begun to show a ground-lift in the areas around it, which may or may not be signs of an eruption in our time (if such a thing were to happen, and depending on the degree of the eruption, it could be a worldwide cataclysmic event).  The two male scientists are given food that induces extreme digestive distress to keep them out of the way. Meanwhile, Laura is taken to the middle of the salt flat and stranded near a rocky outcropping with two nearly blind children named [[Huascar]] and [[Atahualpa]], the names of the last two pre-Columbian rulers of the [[Inca Empire|Incan Empire]], whose last independent acts were to go to war against each other. The three have been provided with enough food and water for a week, but it is uncertain whether or not they have been stranded for good.   Instead of trying to convince Dr. Sommerfield not to publish by argument, the CEO has staged the kidnapping and stranding of Sommerfield and the children with hope that it will drive home the emotional costs associated with the disaster, and that it would get her to publish a report that goes beyond statistics and figures. Later, the CEO reveals that the two children are his adoptive sons, and that their blindness is due to the disaster wrought by the CEO's own Consortium. Dr. Sommerfield is then given a first-class ticket to Rome, to visit the Santissima [[Trinità dei Monti]] convent (at the top of the [[Spanish Steps]]), which the CEO had always wanted to see, in order to view its cloister, which features an [[anamorphic]] fresco of Saint Francis of Paula praying under a tree. She urges the CEO to come with her instead of turning himself in, but he says he would be caught anyway.

A group of young, Swedish soldiers pass her on their way to a dance sees her and asks her to come along—it's the first time anyone who isn't Sami has treated her like a human being. This feeling is only intensified by the fact that prior to this, a couple of scientists from ''[[Statens institut för rasbiologi|the State Institute for Racial Biology]]'' in [[Uppsala]] came to the school to measure and photograph them naked.  Elle-Marja sneaks off to the dance, and for a couple of hours she gets to experience how it feels to have the respect and be treated with decency from others without question.

Inder goes home and carries a bottle of liquor and stands in front of a large cherry blossom tree in his backyard that has a date and name carved into it. It was his wife, which leads to a series of flashbacks from Inder's past.  Saraswati "Saru" Parthasaarthy ([[Mawra Hocane]]), a young librarian who everyone thinks is ugly, due to her traditional looks, keeps away any suitable husband. Her beautiful younger sister Kaveri wants to get married, but her father will not allow her to marry before Saru does. This leads into a conflict between the two sisters as Kaveri's suitor proposes an ultimatum, stating that he will only give her one-month to marry him otherwise he will move on, adding pressure on Saru to find a husband quickly. The Parthasaarthy family is a respectful, patriarchal household who lives in a building called the 'Society' where the elders, including Saru's father, monitor the activities that happen in the building while prohibiting any acts of vulgarity. One day, Saru's father, Jayram ([[Manish Choudhary]]) and Saru run into Inder, her neighbor and the son of a famous, wealthy lawyer, in the hallway with his girlfriend Ruby Malhotra ([[Shraddha Das]]), a renowned stylist. Jayram, who is very strict, is enraged to see the pair embracing each other shamelessly. As Saru hurries past them, Inder is starstruck by her simplicity and beauty.  At work, Saru harbors romantic feelings for Abhimanyu Shastry. He is wealthy, handsome and holds a high position in society. Knowing that Saru has a crush on him, Abhimanyu takes advantage of her and makes her do odd jobs for him. Saru, being the hopeless romantic she is by reading love poems that her father disapproves of, tries her very best to please him. Inder comes to the library several times asking her for books an ex-convict can read.  After multiple rejections, Saru decides to get a makeover so that she may find a husband; however, because of a long waiting list, she is told that she needs a recommendation to get the makeover as soon as possible. With her parents being out of town, she seeks the recommendation from Inder, as he is dating Ruby. While Saru is at his apartment at 4:00&nbsp;a.m., Ruby comes home and presumes that Inder is cheating on her and throws a glass bottle at Saru. However Inder stands in front of her, and the bottle smashes on his back, causing blood to flow. Although Inder urges her to return home, Saru, feeling responsible, passes the night  to tend to his wound. The building's security guard keeps a close eye on the pair even though they do nothing inappropriate. When Saru's parents return early from their trip, the elders inform her father that his daughter has spent the night with Inder. Jayram is sceptical at first, but when he sees his daughter and Inder in a compromising position, he immediately jumps to conclusions. Although Saru tries to explain the situation, Jayram disowns her and curses her by saying that she is now dead.  Saru tells her mother what really happened between Inder and herself, and her mother believes her, but since she is submissive to her husband, she cannot explain to him. This is what brings Inder and Saru together; he helps her find an apartment and also helps her get a makeover. With her new makeover, she grabs the attention of many suitors. Saru hopes that if she marries a respectable man, she may win her place back in her family. Inder falls in love with her in the process, but keeps quiet when Abhimanyu proposes to her after her transformation. However, Abhimanyu stands her up on the day of the marriage because his father does not want a daughter-in-law who has been disowned. Knowing she can never find a husband because she is disowned by her father, Saru is left heartbroken. Saru travels to her honeymoon suite and asks Inder to make love to her for consolation. At first, he refuses as he does not want her to regret anything that will happen between them, but he later agrees. The next morning however, he witnesses her embracing Abhimanyu and leaves.  Heartbroken, Inder spirals into depression, breaking off contact with Saru, as he assumes she has gotten back with Abhimanyu. When he learns however that Saru had actually left him, rejecting Abimanyu's request for a second chance, he tracks down her phone and finds her in a Buddhist monastery, where he professes his love to her. Saru passes out and Inder takes her to the hospital, where he discovers she has a brain tumor that is untreatable. He forcibly enters Saru's parents' house and demands that they stop pretending their daughter is dead by violently ripping the flower wreath from her picture. The next day he is arrested for charges pressed by Jayram. Saru gets discharged and goes to the library, where she discovers the secret messages Inder left for her in check-out slips, realizing that he has liked her from the beginning. The two unite and Saru asks him to marry her.  That night, Saru tells him that after her death, she desires to be buried under a tree. She also recognizes that her father's curse has come true and that he wanted her dead and she is actually dying. Inder says that God does not accept curses, however Saru says that God accepts the prayers of parents. On their wedding day, Saru's parents arrive, having realized their mistake, and Jayram, knowing that Inder really loves his daughter, accepts the marriage. Saru faints after the wedding; the hospital informs her family that she will die. Inder asks his father, with whom he has a strained relationship, to acquire for him the land under the tree for Saru's burial. Saru dies in his arms; Inder finds his father in the hospital, reconciling with him.  Now a successful lawyer, Inder stands at the tree that marks Saru's grave.

The two immediately become best friends, and as time passed, Marty develops an attraction for Sally, but such feelings remained [[unrequited love|unrequited]].  As Marty spend time with Sally, he learns that her adoptive parents are strict and suspects that she is being physically abused by them.

Marty receives a call from a comic book publisher, Renegade Komiks, and gets an opportunity to pitch a comic storyline from the eyepatch-wearing editor Toto. While the two are in a swing at the park near dusk, Marty yet attempts to reveal his feelings for Sally; Sally, however, reveals that she is in a relationship with Nick, whom Marty views as a [[wikt:dickhead|dickhead]] and literally a monster.  Marty presents his pitch to Renegade Komiks. Stuck with his initial comic concept, Marty presents a new story to Toto which is about an astronomer who dedicates his life to a girl abducted by aliens in a prison, which is inspired around his own experiences with Sally, her parents, and Nick. While initially averse to publishing a love story, Toto decides to give it a try; the comic was a success on release.  Nick invites Marty to a [[rave]] party.

This rejuvenated Marty's feelings for Sally and immediately goes to her house, but he overhears her parents physically beating her. Marty knocks on the door and sees her with a bruise on her mouth, which Sally explains that it was caused by an accident.

He and Sally go to her room to get her belongings and successfully escape her parents as they chase them upon leaving the house.

One day, Katie adopts Duke, a large [[mongrel]] from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided focus on Duke.

When Gidget, a white [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] who is (not so) secretly in love with Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.  Max and Duke are rescued by a white [[rabbit]] named Snowball, the leader of "The Flushed Pets"—a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty by allowing a one-fanged [[viperidae|viper]] to bite them, Snowball learns from the cats that Max and Duke are domesticated.

Meanwhile, Max and Duke raid a sausage factory for food. Then, Gidget and her team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidget's team flees.

Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. When they arrive at Fred's house, they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.  While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a [[Transit bus|city bus]] into the van on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max, unaware of his partnership with Snowball, but Gidget and her team save him. Upon seeing Gidget using her [[Chinese martial arts|kung-fu]] fighting skills, and Max starts to fall in love with her. The van gets stuck in [[scaffolding]] and the Flushed Pets escape. As soon as Max gets the keys to Duke's cage, the van plummets into the [[East River]] with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve the keys, allowing them to escape the sinking van.  The entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven [[taxicab|taxi]]. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a little girl named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball and the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet. The other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship.

The Undertaker is disappointed that his partner, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] was injured in the race and recruits Shaggy and Scooby to be his new partners under their names "Skinny Man" and "Dead Meat", to which they reluctantly agree to. However, since Undertaker's car was also destroyed in Inferno's attack, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] modifies Shaggy and Scooby's food truck so they and Undertaker can race that car instead and nicknames it "The Scoobinator".

After an action filled showdown, Inferno is defeated and unmasked to be Triple H. He and Stephanie used the costume to win the race.

Rose McNulty ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) has been a patient in the&nbsp;[[Sligo]] Regional Mental Hospital for 40 years since being accused of murdering her baby in 1942.

He grew up in the area and has returned to sell his parents' home. Rose is adamant that she did not kill her baby and tells her story to Stephen using the pages of a Bible on which she has written and drawn an account of her life before her incarceration.  Around 1940, Rose ([[Rooney Mara]]), an orphaned young woman, evacuates from Northern Ireland to live with her aunt in the Irish Republic, which is a neutral country. There, seemingly without any intent, she attracts the interest of many of the local men. She has a brief flirtation with Michael McNulty ([[Jack Reynor]]), a Protestant who sympathizes with the British war effort and soon leaves to join the RAF.

Seklusyon
 In 1947, Padre Ricardo ([[Neil Ryan Sese]]) arrives at a marketplace to investigate people whose ailments were miraculously healed by a child named Anghela Sta. Ana (Rhed Bustamante), who is assisted by a mysterious nun, Sister Cecilia (Phoebe Walker). Ricardo becomes suspicious of Anghela's powers; every time she heals someone, black liquid drips from her mouth.  Miguel ([[Ronnie Alonte]]), a deacon, arrives at a monastery and meets Sandoval ([[Lou Veloso]]), a former priest who has been excommunicated by the bishop. Sandoval tells him about the old ritual where deacons or aspiring priests are sent in a secluded area on the last seven days of their training, the purpose of which is to shield them from evil, for it is believed that the last seven days is when they are most vulnerable to the influence of the devil. While in seclusion, Miguel meets fellow deacons, Carlo, Fabián, and Marco.  While in a church, Padre Ricardo discovers a bloodied Anghela, her parents having been murdered. The bishop orders that Anghela and Cecilia be moved together to a secluded place - the same monastery where the deacons are undergoing their training - despite Ricardo's protests about his suspicions of Cecilia. However, the bishop allows Ricardo to continue his investigation.  Sandoval at first refuses to let Anghela and Sister Cecilia stay, as they will disrupt the deacons' training, but later begrudgingly agrees because he is told that their stay is under the order of the bishop. Anghela uses her powers to make their bread, which had gone moldy and spoiled, edible again, as well as turning the tap water into wine. The deacons - except Miguel - are impressed with her powers, seeing it as miraculous.   During the course of their stay, the deacons are plagued by recurring nightmares in the form of their sins: Marco's gluttonous nature was the cause of his siblings' death from starvation during the [[World War 2|war]]; Fabián's entry into the priesthood is a way to leave his physically abusive mother; and Miguel is taunted by his dead ex-lover, Erina, in the form of the Virgin Mary.  One night, Anghela goes into the kitchen to ask Sandoval for food and water, and later on talks to him about his excommunication. As Anghela convinces him that he was not at fault for his sins, Sandoval leaves the next morning, thanking the girl and handing the deacons under her charge.  In the course of his investigation, Padre Ricardo arrives at a convent to question the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] about Sister Cecilia. Despite her rudeness, the Mother Superior willingly gives him Cecilia's records, but warns him to stop investigating and to never return. The records state that Cecilia was raped by several men during the war and that part of her face was burned. She later became Anghela's teacher; it is implied that Anghela healed her wounds. He also discovers that Anghela was raised in an orphanage and was adopted. To Ricardo's surprise, one of the documents appeared to have the name "NgaHela" written on it, a rearrangement of Anghela's name which is said to be the name of the devil incarnate. The document explains that Anghela's healing and miraculous powers come not from God, but from the devil. With evidence of Anghela as a false prophet and Cecilia being one of her minions, Ricardo visits the bishop to warn him of Anghela's true nature, but at the same moment Sandoval bursts in the room and shoots the bishop dead. He informs the shocked Ricardo about Anghela's whereabouts and that she is waiting for him.   On their last few days of training, Anghela convinces the four deacons to redeem themselves from their sins by feeding their vices, sometimes using Sister Cecilia as a pawn for her schemes. The first to succumb was Marco, who gave in to his gluttonous nature. Next was Fabián, who is revealed to be abusive towards women due to the abuse he received from his mother. Carlo is revealed to be a pedophile and was the next to succumb to Anghela's power.   During a mass held by Anghela in the chapel, Miguel unsuccessfully tries to convince the other deacons that she is not to be trusted. He angrily calls Anghela a false prophet and runs into the woods, where he is followed by Anghela, Cecilia, and the three deacons. During the chase, Miguel trips and is knocked unconscious. The next scene shows a flashback of Miguel's relationship with Erina. It is revealed that Miguel left Erina with their unborn child to undergo the priesthood. Feeling betrayed and heartbroken by his decision to leave her, Erina hangs and kills herself after giving birth to their child. During this time, Anghela sees Miguel and heals his head wound. As Miguel wakes up, he realizes that Anghela is his daughter. Back at the chapel, Anghela continues her ritual and has the four deacons drink from a cup filled with black liquid. Miguel drinks from the cup, but is still doubtful.  Padre Ricardo finally confronts Anghela, and tries to exorcise her, only to be burned to death by her supernatural powers. Miguel witnesses what happened, seizes Anghela, takes her to the chapel, and barricades the door. There Anghela reveals herself as NgaHela, a demon whose malevolent plot is to take over the church; those whom she heals end up worshipping her.  As Sister Cecilia and the three deacons try to break down the barricade, Miguel grabs a knife and stabs Anghela several times. Black liquid drips out from her mouth as she slowly dies. Miguel then escapes, never to be seen again. The movie ends with Fabián, Carlo, and Marco, ordained by the new bishop into the priesthood, still unaware that they were not blessed by God, but by the devil.

However, Sethupathi had no intention of shooting either of the boys and realises that someone had unlocked his gun, which he had thought was locked.

Sethupathi and his senior official appear before an enquiry to prove his innocence. However, one of the members of the enquiry panel is an ally of Vaathiyar and she tries to influence the panel against Sethupathi, but her double-game is soon exposed and Sethupathi is cleared of all charges. Sethupathi's troubles are still not over; Vaathiyar burns Kanagavel alive and starts targeting Sethupathi and his family. Sethupathi overcomes all the hurdles put by Vaathiyar and his henchmen. Vaathiyar then decides to silence Sethupathi once and for all by sending his henchmen to kill Sethupathi's wife ([[Remya Nambeesan]]) and his two children, but Sethupathi's son, who is aware of police work, drives away the henchmen with the help of his father. Infuriated with the failed attempt, Vaathiyar instructs his men to kill the school boy injured by Sethupathi and put the blame on him. However, Sethupathi, aware of Vaathiyar's plan, guards the hospital where the boy is admitted and saves him from Vaathiyar's henchmen.  With Sethupathi returning to work, Vaathiyar's henchmen accept defeat and warn Vaathiyar to leave Madurai for good, but he does not take heed.

The Shallows (film)
 Shortly after the death of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach in [[Mexico]], the same beach her mother visited while she was pregnant with Nancy. Carlos, a friendly local resident, gives Nancy a ride and drops her off at the beach. Nancy joins two other locals and the three surf for several hours. Taking a break from surfing, Nancy video-chats with her sister Chloe. When she talks to her father in an emotional and strained conversation, it is revealed that her mother's death caused Nancy to consider dropping out of medical school.  While surfing one last time for the day, Nancy notices the carcass of a large [[humpback whale]] nearby. As she rides the last wave back to the beach, a large [[great white shark]] knocks her off her surfboard and bites her leg. Nancy climbs onto the whale carcass, but the shark rams it from underneath, forcing her to swim to an isolated rock. She uses her surfboard strap to slow the bleeding from her leg. Later she uses her jewelry to put rudimentary stitches in place to hold her torn flesh together. Nancy is left alone when the unaware locals leave the beach, and she spends the night on the rock with a wounded [[Gull|seagull]], which was also injured by the shark, and names him Steven Seagull. The next morning, a drunk local man on the beach steals Nancy's belongings. While wading out into the shallow water to steal Nancy's surfboard, however, he is killed by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water before Nancy can warn them away, and are also killed by the shark.  One of the local surfers was wearing a [[GoPro]] camera on his helmet. When he was attacked by the shark, his helmet had come off and floated to the surface. Nancy later sees the helmet floating in the water. After some struggle, she is able to retrieve it and notices in the footage of the attack, the shark has a large hook stuck in its mouth after a possible encounter with fishermen. Nancy uses the GoPro to leave messages for her sister and father as well as information about the shark attack and her location.  With high tide approaching, Nancy realizes the rock will be submerged soon. After sending Steven Seagull toward shore on a piece of the surfboard, and timing the shark's circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby [[buoy]], narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of [[jellyfish]], which sting both the shark and her. Nancy finds a [[flare gun]] on the buoy. She shoots one flare to draw the attention of a faraway cargo ship, but the ship has already turned away and does not see her. She then fires another flare at the shark, setting the oil from the whale carcass alight and angering it, but otherwise having no effect. The shark then ferociously attacks the buoy and rips out the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy straps herself to the last remaining chain and as it is ripped from the buoy, she is pulled down to the ocean floor, pursued by the shark. At the last moment, Nancy pulls out of the dive, and the shark impales itself on some [[rebar]] from the buoy's anchor.  Later, a boy named Miguel at the beach finds the action camera and informs his father, Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy floating close to shore and revives her. Nancy briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As she looks around the beach, she sees that Steven Seagull has made it to the shore. One year later, a healed Nancy (now a doctor) and her sister Chloe go surfing in [[Galveston, Texas]], as their father tells Nancy that her mother would have been proud.

Shin Godzilla
  When the [[Japan Coast Guard]] investigates an abandoned yacht in [[Tokyo Bay]], their boat is destroyed and the [[Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line]] is flooded. After seeing a [[viral video]] of the incident, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Rando Yaguchi theorizes that it was caused by a living creature. His theory is confirmed when news reports show a massive tail emerging from the ocean. The Prime Minister assures the public that the creature is unable to come onto land due to its weight, but it moves inland via rivers and makes landfall. It moves through a coastal city, leaving a path of destruction and numerous casualties. It evolves into a red-skinned form that can stand upright on its hind legs and returns to the sea.  The government officials focus on military strategy and civilian safety, while Yaguchi is put in charge of a task force to research the creature. Due to high radiation readings, the group theorizes that it is energized by nuclear fission. The U.S. sends a special envoy, Kayoko Anne Patterson, who reveals that a disgraced, vehemently anti-nuclear [[zoology]] professor, Goro Maki, had been studying mutations caused by radioactive contamination and theorized the appearance of the creature, but he is disbelieved by both American and Japanese scientific circles. The U.S. then prevented him from making his conclusions public. The abandoned yacht discovered in Tokyo Bay was Maki's, and he left his research notes, jumbled into a code, in it before disappearing.  The creature, named [[Godzilla]] after Maki's research, reappears, now twice its original size, and makes landfall near [[Kamakura]] en route for [[Tokyo]]. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] mobilize, but their attacks have no effect and they are forced to withdraw when Godzilla breaks through their defenses into the city. The U.S. intervenes with a massively-destructive air strike plan, prompting the evacuation of civilians and government personnel. U.S. [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] wound Godzilla with [[Massive Ordnance Penetrator|MOP]] bunker-buster bombs. Godzilla recovers quickly and responds with highly destructive atomic rays fired from its mouth and dorsal fins, which hit and destroy the helicopter carrying the top government officials, all the B-2s, as well as devastating and irradiating large swaths of Tokyo. Depleting its energy, Godzilla enters a dormant state and becomes immobile.  Yaguchi's team discovers that Godzilla's fins and blood work as a cooling system and theorize that they could use a coagulating agent to freeze it. After analyzing tissue samples, they find that Godzilla is an ever-evolving creature, able to [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|reproduce asexually]]. The [[United Nations]], aware of this, informs Japan that thermonuclear weapons will be used against Godzilla should the Japanese fail to subdue him on their own in a few days. Evacuations are ordered in multiple prefectures in preparation for the nuclear attack. Unwilling to see nuclear weapons detonated in Japan again, Patterson uses her political connections to buy time for Yaguchi's team, who the interim government has little faith in. Yaguchi's team has a breakthrough when Goro Maki's encoded research is deciphered, adjust their plan, and procure the means to conduct their deep freeze plan with international support.  Mere hours before the planned nuclear attack, Japan enacts the deep freeze plan. Godzilla is provoked into expending its atomic breath and energy against American drones. The team then detonates explosives in nearby buildings and in trains sent towards Godzilla's feet, knocking the monster down and giving tankers full of coagulant an opportunity to inject it into Godzilla's mouth. Though many are killed in the process, Godzilla is frozen solid. In the aftermath, it is discovered that the Godzilla fallout has a very short [[half-life]] and that Tokyo can soon be reconstructed. The international community agrees to cancel the nuclear attack but has the new Japanese government agree that, in the event of Godzilla's reawakening, an immediate thermonuclear strike will be executed. Godzilla's tail shows humanoid Godzilla-like creatures frozen in the process of emerging.

Shelley (film)
  The film opens with a young Romanian woman, Elena, being driven to the home of her new employers, Danish couple Louise and Kasper. Louise and Kasper are a wealthy couple living in near-isolation in a lakehouse in the forest. Kasper explains that Elena was hired for some extra help because Louise has been weakened by recent surgery. The couple lives without electricity and lives off the food they grow, as well as eggs from the chicken coop they keep, and the only communication with the outside world is through a simple landline phone. Although Elena hears a few unusual noises at the house, she otherwise fits in easily.  Elena is put off at first by the eccentric and withdrawn Louise, who seems to be afraid of electricity and talks to herself, but the two quickly bond as Elena falls into routine at the house. Elena reveals that she has a five-year-old son living with her parents, and she is saving money to buy the two of them an apartment of their own, though she estimates that she would need to save for years before achieving the goal. Louise in turn confides that, though she and Kasper want a child, she cannot carry one to term. Later, as their friendship deepens, Louise reveals that she had frozen some of her eggs, and she asks if Elena would carry a child for her and Kasper. In return, Louise and Kasper would buy an apartment for Elena after she gave birth. After some thought, Elena agrees, much to the chagrin of her parents. Meanwhile, Louise is visited by Leo, a friend of the family and psychic guru who tries to expel bad energy from Louise's body to help her heal.  Though Elena feels somewhat unusual after the insemination, the doctor assures her that everything is fine. Elena proceeds as normal for a few months, though she grows uncomfortable with a number of bizarre events: the chickens in the coop all become frightened of her, she begins to hear more strange sounds, and she suffers from several hallucinations. She also begins to have nightmares, one involving a dead baby and the other of a blood-drenched Louise talking to her about "Shelley." Others react strangely as well: the son of family friends punches Elena's stomach without warning, and Leo, invited to try to help Elena, senses bad energy coming from her stomach and learns that Elena believes the baby is killing her. Leo is disturbed and seems aware that something is amiss. As the pregnancy advances, Elena begins to deteriorate rapidly, losing weight, becoming frequently exhausted, waking with blood around her mouth, scratching herself, and adopting unusual eating habits. All of this is ignored by the doctor, who insists that it is normal behavior when pregnant; she also reveals that the baby is a girl, right before the ultrasound machine mysteriously shuts down. Elena insists that something is wrong.   Elena's condition further worsens as she nears the due date. She is frequently exhausted and exhibits strange behavior, such as reacting with pain when Louise bathes her. After this incident, she begins to violently attack her stomach, screaming that she wants the baby out of her, upsetting Louise. Louise later finds her out of the house and wandering down the road in the middle of the night, and later, sitting in the chicken coop, having attacked and apparently tried to eat the chickens. A weakened Elena demands to go home, but Louise insists to Kasper that if she leaves, her parents would take her and the baby forever. They reluctantly keep Elena, though Louise keeps a closer eye on her. One afternoon, Elena steals one of Louise's knitting needles when Louise leaves to get her water, and Louise returns to find that Elena has used it to try to give herself an abortion.  Elena dies from internal bleeding as a result of the attempt, but the baby is unharmed. Louise and Kasper take her home, naming her Shelley. Louise bonds instantly with Shelley and dotes on her, but Kasper admits to a friend that he does not feel a bond with the girl. Shelley demonstrates similar bizarre behavior: like Elena, she scares the chickens and reacts with pain when water is poured on her. When Leo visits the house, he becomes shaken and disturbed at the sight of Shelley, sensing something evil, and leaves immediately, shocking Louise. Kasper reacts to Shelley oddly as well: he insists that she is making strange clicking noises that Louise doesn't hear, dislikes being around her, and becomes unresponsive and shell-shocked, later cutting open his leg while chopping wood. He also has a nightmare involving Elena. He is disturbed to find that Shelley is unusually calm and unresponsive, even when he is about to punch her. He also suffers from telekinetic infrasound and blames it on Shelley. Louise believes none of this and is upset by Kasper's behavior.  One night, Louise has a strange dream and wakes to find Shelley gone. She finds her in the car with Kasper, who revs the engine and continues to be unresponsive. Furious, she kills Kasper with the car door and takes Shelley back inside. Shaken, Louise sits on the bed with her as an unidentified man in black stands in the room with her. The film ends with Louise and Shelley alone, with no explanation for the events of the film.

Silence (2016 film)
 [[File:El Greco - The Veil of St Veronica - WGA10461.jpg|thumb|Rodrigues is fascinated by the face of Christ and visualizes it in the form of this portrait by [[El Greco]].]]  The film begins with a prologue of the young Portuguese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit priest]] [[Cristóvão Ferreira]] witnessing the mortal torture of Japanese converts he has been trying to bring to the Christian faith. The priest appears to be helpless in the presence of Japanese authorities conducting the torture to try to assist his converts in any way.  A few years later, at [[St. Paul's College, Macau]], an Italian Jesuit priest, [[Alessandro Valignano]], receives news that Ferreira renounced his faith ([[apostasy]]) in Japan after being tortured. In disbelief, Ferreira's Portuguese pupils, Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe, set off to find him. Kichijiro, an alcoholic fisherman who fled Japan to save himself, agrees to guide them.   Arriving in Japan at the village of Tomogi, the priests are dismayed to find local Christian populations driven underground. Both priests are then shocked when a samurai searching for suspected Christians, whom the villagers refer to as the "Inquisitor", straps some of the villagers to wooden crosses by the ocean shore, where the tide eventually drowns them. The bodies are then cremated on a funeral pyre which the priests understand is done to prevent a Christian burial.  Garupe leaves for Hirado Island, believing that their presence forces the shogunate to terrorize the village. Rodrigues goes to Gotō Island, the last place Ferreira lived, and finds it destroyed. Wandering around Gotō, he struggles over whether it is self-centered to refuse to recant when doing so will end others' suffering. He eventually reunites with Kichijiro, who betrays him into the hands of the samurai. An old samurai, who had earlier accompanied the "Inquisitor" to Tomogi, tells Rodrigues that other captured Christians will suffer unless he renounces his faith.  Rodrigues is taken to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic doctrine is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him in charge of the proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.  After some time, Rodrigues is eventually taken to meet an older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and states that after 15 years in the country and a year in the temple, he believes Christianity is futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that they have already apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand to relent. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.  Years later, after Ferreira has died, Kichijiro asks Rodrigues to absolve him again, but Rodrigues refuses, saying he is no longer a priest. Kichijiro later is caught with a pouch he claims to have won while gambling containing a religious amulet which he disclaims as being his own. He is taken away and never heard from again. Many years later, Rodrigues dies. He is placed in a large round wooden casket, and his body is cremated. In his hand is the tiny crudely-made crucifix that was given to him when he first came to Japan.  
Sing (2016 American film)
 In a world of [[anthropomorphic]] animals, [[koala]] Buster Moon owns a theater, having been interested in show business since his father took him to his first music show as a child. Following financial problems brought up by the bank representative Judith, he tells his wealthy friend Eddie that he will host a singing competition with a prize of $1,000. But Buster's assistant, Miss Crawly, accidentally appends two extra zeroes, and the promotional fliers showing $100,000 are blown out of Buster's office into the city streets.  Animals from all around the city gather for auditions. Those selected include: housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; [[street musician]] mouse Mike; mobster's son gorilla Johnny; and punk-rock porcupine Ash. Shy teenage elephant Meena fails her audition out of [[stage fright]], while Ash's boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest. Rosita is paired with another contestant, an exuberant pig named Gunter, for a dance routine. Although Buster discovers the flyers show a prize of $100,000 (money he does not have), he remains optimistic. Buster convinces Eddie to arrange a visit with Eddie's grandmother, former opera singer and theater actress Nana Noodleman, to persuade her to sponsor the prize money. She is hesitant to contribute, but agrees to see a private screening of the show.  Encouraged by her grandfather, Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance, but becomes his [[stage hand]] instead. When one of the acts quits, and another is injured, Meena is added as an act. The performers' individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals: Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, after having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray. After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend and evicting them from her apartment, Ash is devastated and breaks down while singing her assigned song, [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s "[[Call Me Maybe]]." Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of a [[getaway car]] in a heist and making the practices. When he tries to do both, he does not show up for the planned pickup in time, and his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright, and Mike, certain that the prize money is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse, and then swindles a group of bears in a card game at a nightclub.  The day of the screening, the bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who in turn, points to Buster. The bears open the chest containing the prize money, but it is nowhere near $100,000. The glass tank full of [[Bioluminescence|luminescent]] squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks under all their weight, flooding the theater, which then comes crashing down. With the lot repossessed by Judith, Buster, who had been living in his theater's office desk, takes up residence at Eddie's place (his parents' pool house). Although the contestants (besides Mike, who saw Buster as a fraud) visit him and try to cheer him up, Buster is too despondent to listen to them. He tries to start over by opening a [[car wash]], using the same bucket that his father had used to earn money for Buster's theater.  When Meena goes to the theater's rubble lot and sings [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]," Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money. They perform on a makeshift stage on the lot in front of Rosita and Meena's family members. As Rosita and Gunter perform [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[Shake It Off]]," more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news. Johnny's rendition of [[Elton John]]'s "[[I'm Still Standing]]" impresses his father, who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him. Despite an interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song "Set It All Free." Mike returns to the show and sings [[Frank Sinatra]]'s "[[My Way]]." Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing]]," which literally brings down the house. The show becomes a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. Nana buys the lot and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.  
Sing Street
 In south inner-city Dublin in 1985, Robert Lawlor is struggling with his architecture practice and his marriage, and drinks and smokes to excess. At a family meeting, he announces that in order to save money he is taking his youngest son Conor out of his expensive fee-paying school and moving him to a Christian Brothers school, [[Synge Street CBS]], which Robert asserts is of equally high repute. Conor's elder brother Brendan ribs him about the change as well as about the state of the family unit.  Conor appears in school on the first day in his new uniform, but without the regulation black shoes. The school principal Br. Baxter, takes him to task for this despite Conor’s pleas of being unable to afford new black shoes, eventually forcing him to complete the day shoeless. The shoe problem is resolved by painting the shoes black using paint from the art room. An encounter with the school bully, Barry introduces Conor to Darren, an ally and budding entrepreneur. When Conor tells the beautiful aspiring model, Raphina, in order to impress her, that he needs a model for a music video his band is making, Darren agrees to manage the band and introduces him to multi-instrumentalist Eamon.

Conor refuses and as he walks away Baxter grabs him forcing him into the bathroom and forcibly removing the make up by pushing his face into a sink. Raphina gives Conor his nickname "Cosmo", which she says is more in keeping with his new band's image and the band continues to write and record new songs. After spending the day filming a music video for a new song, Conor and Raphina kiss and exchange confidences. Conor also manages to stand up to Barry by pointing out the insignificance of his life as well as his own, which greatly upsets Barry.

Later, she reveals that she was set to leave for London with her boyfriend that day, but he abandoned her. Deeply hurt by her lack of disclosure and becoming even more offended by her nonchalance, Conor breaks up with Raphina. Because of the break-up, along with his family's problems, Conor finds difficulty in writing or playing music, but Brendan urges Conor to carry on so that at least he can escape his small-town doldrums and make a better future for himself. An opportunity arises for the band to play live at an end of year party at school. Conor manages to strike a friendship with Barry, offering him the chance to be the band's roadie and escape the physically and emotionally abusive relationship he has with his alcoholic father, which he accepts.  Conor prepares a new song, "Brown Shoes", mocking Baxter, which the band perform as an encore while distributing homemade masks of Baxter’s face. Raphina arrives before the band finishes their song and reconciles with Conor, and both of them leave the party and the school in uproar. After secretly saying his goodbyes to his family later that night, Conor and Raphina persuade Brendan to drive them to Dalkey so they can escape in the motor cruiser and head to London. Brendan agrees and drives them to the harbour, where Brendan and Conor exchange an emotional embrace. Conor and Raphina sail out to sea, following the ferry across the rough [[Irish Sea]] to a new life in London. Brendan watches them disappear into the distance and cheers, overjoyed that his younger brother has left to go on to greater things.

Shōya finds himself alone, relegated to the role of a tormented outcast. After being thrown in a pond by his classmates, he finds Shōko's notebook.  Now in high school, Shōya remains a social reject, having grown to accept his past as punishment. Full of guilt and anxiety, he blocks out the faces of those around him, unable to look them in the eye. Despite his isolation, Tomohiro Nagatsuka, another loner, befriends him and quickly comes to considers him his "big friend".

When she leaves in the middle of the night, Shōya follows and tells her that he is genuinely remorseful for the way he treated Shōko.  Shōko soon gives Shōya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing it out, Shōya does not understand her. Worried that the misunderstanding upset her, Shōya invites her to go to an amusement park with him and his group of classmates. There, Naoka finally voices her feelings of hatred in secret to Shōko. In class, desperate to remain blameless for Shōko's bullying, Miki Kawai, another former classmate, exposes Shōya's past to the remaining students who were still oblivious to it, while downplaying her own involvement. The group has a heated confrontation about each member's level of responsibility which ends with Shōya callously calling out every one of them for who they really are.  To cheer Shōko up after her grandmother's death, Shōya takes her to the countryside, where he begins to understand how much she blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Desperate to reassure and change her mindset, Shōya contrives to regularly meet with the sisters.  During the fireworks festival, Shōko goes home under the guise of finishing some schoolwork. Shōya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. When he arrives, he finds Shōko standing on the balcony, on the verge of throwing herself to her death. Shōya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up, but he falls over the side into the river and slips into a coma.  One night, Shōko dreams of receiving a farewell visit from Shōya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge where they fed the koi and collapses in tears. Shōya, awakening from his coma in a state of panic, stumbles to the bridge himself and finds her there, huddled in despair. He formally apologizes to her for the way he treated her, and for the many things he did which may have caused her to hate herself. He asks her to stop blaming herself, and also admits that, while he once considered giving up himself and ending his own life, he has since decided against it. Shōya then asks her to help him continue to live.  When Shōya goes to the school festival with Shōko, he finds out how much his friends from elementary school still care for him and all of them are reconciled. Afterwards, Shōya requests them that the group should go to the school festival together.

When Yung's daughter Samantha ([[Fan Bingbing]]) gets into trouble with Wong's crime syndicate, Bennie must track down an American conman, Connor Watts ([[Johnny Knoxville]]), who gambles his way through Chinese casinos after being banned in America and he witnesses the murder of a woman named Esther Yee in Wong's Macau casino. However, before Bennie can find him, Connor is kidnapped by a Russian kingpin to answer for leaving his daughter pregnant.  After intercepting several Russians, Bennie rescues Connor. Bennie races against the clock to bring Connor back from Russia to Hong Kong. But after Connor steals Bennie's passport and burns it, the unlikely pair are forced to travel on foot to Inner [[Mongolia]]. While on journey, Connor reveals that he has a phone that Esther gave to him before she died at his side. Bennie learns that the person who is able to unlock this phone is none other than the "Matador." Days later, they try to cross to China, but are captured by police and are saved by a Siberian woman and her gang. They cross a river until they go to a village under a festival, with Willie pursuing them.  Connor sees Wong on the news and recognizes him as Esther's murderer.

Connor parts ways with Bennie, giving him evidence that could lead to Wong's arrest. Reaching Hong Kong, unfortunately, the plan doesn't go well when the phone denies access to Wong's thumbprint, meaning that Wong is not Matador at all. Bennie is detained but he later escapes with Connor's help and follows a clue to the whereabouts of Samantha.  Bennie's co-worker Leslie informs him that their police captain, Tang ([[Michael Wong (actor)|Michael Wong]]), is now working with Wong.

When a boat hits the cargo ship, the compartment starts to flood and Yung locks Samantha up just as the water enters the room. The fight ensues with the Chinese when the Russian gangsters show up — revealing that Connor is no longer their enemy.

 One week before his wedding day, Jonah and his groomsmen hit the town for his stag party, hosted by his irresponsible brother Mac. Attempting to be more original, Mac takes them to Garden City instead of a typical party location hoping for a wild night, and instead they wind up at a lackluster strip club. Visibly disappointed at his efforts, Mac attracts the attentions of a stranger who tells him about an underground moving club that promises to surpass all expectations.    Reluctantly, Jonah agrees to go, but the long drive to 50n/40w through a dark forest unnerves the group, as does the club when they finally arrive. The patrons and dancers almost convince the group to leave until the club owner, Mr. Nyx, comes out to personally welcome and see to their entertainment. Upon hearing that Jonah wants a non-cheating experience, Nyx takes him into another room and tells him to go to the window at the end while his groomsmen pay. He asks from each of the 3 men their favorite memories of their mothers. At the window, Jonah sees a nude young woman on the other side of the glass who begins singing. Jonah suddenly relives all the sexual encounters he's ever had at once. Meanwhile, at the main bar, one of the groomsmen, Elliot, has a custom drink with a leech in it and suddenly experiences the memory of murdering someone, after which both Mac and Rand realize they all have matching marks on the back of their necks.   After leaving the window, Jonah hears the girl ask him not to leave and sees that the door to the room is padlocked from the outside. Fearing that the girl is a sex slave, Jonah gets Rand, tells the others to get to the car, and the two break the lock and let her out. While attempting to sneak out of the club, the 3 get waylaid by guards and hide in a bathroom. Once there, the girl uses Jonah's swiss army knife to open a shackle around her ankle, and then brutally kills the guard that followed them, revealing claws and a long tail. Jonah and Rand run for the car and the 4 drive away, only for the girl to suddenly land on the roof and cause them to crash.    While the girl grabs Elliot and drags him off, Nyx and his posse arrive and kidnap Rand as Jonah and Mac escape. Back at the club, Nyx questions Rand, asking why they released "the Lilith", before allowing the brother of the murdered guard to torture him. Out in the woods, Jonah and Mac desperately try to find Elliot while arguing over who's to blame for the way the night has gone. Jonah realizes that the girl had sniffed him after being released, and had gone after Elliot because he has been wearing his jacket. The 2 attempt to cover their scent, managing to escape and find their way to a diner patroned by a pair of cops. They desperately try to describe the past few hours and the cops cuff them, Mac noticing in alarm that they have the same mark on the backs of their necks, realizing that they work for Nyx. The girl arrives at the diner and starts to sing, entrancing the cop with Jonah who quickly puts in his headphones and turns on his ipod to drown her out, watching as she murders both cops. Chasing him through the diner, the girl reveals a demonic face, announcing "I like you" before grabbing Jonah and flying away.   Back at the club, Nyx orders one of his minions, who appears to be some sort of [[Gorgon]], to take a very injured Rand's memories of being tortured, hunt down Jonah, and give them to him. The minion does this by taking a medusa-like leech from her head and inserting into then removing it from the mark on the back of his neck, revealing what had happened earlier when paying for Jonah's session and what had happened with Elliot, implying that part of Nyx's business is selling people memories.  Back with Jonah, he and the girl land in a quarry, and after a few attempts to escape, she rapes him while singing, again creating a fantasy of him having sex with his fiance, Eva. When he comes back to himself, Jonah runs from the now sleeping girl and makes it back to his hotel room where the minion is waiting for him. She forces him to eat the leech and Jonah relives Rand's torture and the memory of Nyx speaking directly to him and offering a trade; the girl for Rand. All he has to do is go to a church and the girl will follow him. Jonah agrees and follows the minion to the church.   Once there, a few things become clearer. The girl, Lily, is actually a demon from hell (a [[succubus]] to be exact) that was summoned years ago, imprisoned by Nyx, and forced to become a sex slave. Lily had become infatuated with Jonah because he was kind and helped her escape. Succubi mate for life and Lily wants him to stay with her, killing anyone who gets in her way. The church is the location where she was originally summoned and Nyx needs Jonah to lure her into a rune circle and reattach the shackle around her ankle, as he is the only person she won't kill.    Lily arrives and hesitantly steps into the circle. Jonah tells Lily he made a mistake when he released her, not knowing what she was. To Nyx's anger, Jonah makes a new deal with Lily; he won't put the shackle on if she will let Jonah go. Lily agrees, and proceeds to slaughter Nyx and his henchmen, while Jonah grabs a seriously injured Rand. Mac arrives and sacrifices himself saving his brother from a vengeful Nyx. Lily kisses Jonah goodbye, and watches while Jonah and Rand leave.    A year later, Jonah and Eva are married. They make love on their anniversary. Jonah goes to get a glass of water afterwards and sees Eva asleep on the couch, realizing that he had made love to Lily and not Eva. Jonah attempts to get Lily to leave and almost succeeds, until Eva notices Lily and starts to scream, whereupon Lily starts to attack her. Jonah begs her to stop and says he will go with her.

Snowden (film)
 In 2013, [[Edward Snowden]] arranges a clandestine meeting in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Documentary film|documentarian]] [[Laura Poitras]] and [[journalist]] [[Glenn Greenwald]]. They discuss releasing the classified information in the former’s possession regarding illegal [[mass surveillance]] conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).  In 2004, Snowden is undergoing basic training, having enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] with intentions of matriculating to the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]]. He eventually fractures his [[tibia]], and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge and that he may serve his country in other ways.  Snowden applies for a position at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. Initially his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Corbin O'Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to "The Hill" where he is educated and tested on [[cyberwarfare]]. He learns about the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], which circumvents the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]. Snowden and his peers are each tasked with building a covert communications network in their hometown, deleting it, and then rebuilding it in eight hours or less, with five hours being the average time taken. Snowden impresses O'Brian when he completes the exercise in 38 minutes.  Meanwhile, Snowden meets Lindsay Mills via a dating website. The two bond, despite sharply contrasting political ideologies. Snowden acquires his first post abroad working with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva]] in 2007, taking Mills with him. He meets Gabriel Sol, who has ample experience in electronic surveillance. Snowden begins questioning the ethical implications of their assignment. After his superior decides to set up their target on a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] charge in order to leverage information from him, Snowden resigns from the CIA.  Snowden later takes a position with the NSA in [[Japan]], initially under the pretense of building a program that would allow the government to back up all critical data from the [[Middle East]] in an emergency, a program which he names "Epic Shelter". Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting [[malware]] in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in [[Maryland]].  Three months later, Snowden has left his post with the NSA and returned to Maryland where he and Mills resume their relationship and he takes a position consulting for the CIA. During a hunting trip, O'Brian reveals an operation in [[Oahu]] that revolves around counterattacking [[China|Chinese]] hackers. After Snowden is diagnosed with [[epilepsy]], Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in [[Hawaii]] may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in "[[Hawaii Cryptologic Center|The Tunnel]]", an underground [[World War II]] bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]] operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in [[Pakistan]].  Snowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a [[Secure Digital|microSD]] card into his office by way of a [[Rubik's Cube]], and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.  With the help of journalist [[Ewen MacAskill]], the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for [[Latin America]] by way of [[Russia]]. However, the U.S. government revokes his passport, forcing him to remain in [[Moscow]] indefinitely. He is eventually granted [[right of asylum|asylum]] for three years, with Mills joining him at a later date. Snowden continues his [[activism]].

Spark (2016 film)
 Thirteen years ago, the evil primate General Zhong overthrew his noble brother to seize the throne of the planet Bana, using a [[spacetime]] anomaly known as a "slick", which has the ability to create black holes; slicks were made by a wild creature known as a space [[kraken]]. The black hole created from the slick partially destroyed Bana, and swallowed up many subjects. Among the few survivors were a baby monkey named Spark, a warrior fox named Vix, and a pig mechanic named Chunk.  In the present, Spark, Vix, Chunk and Spark's forgetful nanny bot, Bananny, secretly live on a shard used as a garbage dump, with Vix and Chunk leading insurgency missions against Zhong, although they constantly forbid Spark from coming along. One day, Spark intercepts an e-mail sent to Vix about a new mission, and decides to take the mission himself without her knowing. The e-mail leads to the Queen of Bana, whom Zhong still permits to live in the palace. After Spark infiltrates the palace and meets the Queen, she hands him a kraken-finder, which Zhong wants to use to find and recapture the space kraken in order to destroy another planet. Spark decides to use it to find the kraken himself; he tames the creature and brings it back to the garbage shard. But he then finds his home raided by Zhong's forces, who then capture both him and the kraken. Zhong forces the kraken to make a new slick into which he hurls Spark, Vix, Chunk and the entire garbage shard.  The trio discover that the slick is actually a wormhole that leads to a desert planet. Vix and Chunk get upset at Spark for causing Zhong to obtain the kraken, and then split up. Spark finds survivors of the first slick, living in the King's old flagship battle cruiser. The Captain of the flagship reveals that Spark is in fact the son of the King and Queen, who entrusted Vix and Chunk to hide and protect him. He also reveals that the King had actually died in an accident some years ago, but Spark has a vision of the King when he visits a memorial to him, and finds a special weapon made for the royal family. Spark then learns from the deceased King that his friends have been captured by giant mutated roaches. Spark, with the help of his father's spirit and his roach friend, Floyd, defeats the mutated roaches and rescues Vix and Chunk. Spark rallies Vix, Chunk, the Captain and his survivors to mount an attack on Zhong, and Chunk figures out a way to use technology to make a slick of their own. In the meantime, Zhong uses the space kraken to intimidate the rest of the galaxy.  The flagship and survivors return to Bana through their own slick, and ultimately defeat Zhong's forces after a prolonged battle. Spark personally rescues the queen from Zhong's own flagship, which gets critically damaged during the battle. Spark decides to rescue his "Uncle" Zhong as well, but the annoyed Queen then punches Zhong into the slick after he "begs" for forgiveness.  The film ends with Spark's friends and allies celebrating him becoming the new Prince of Bana.  
Special Correspondents
 News radio journalist Frank Bonneville ([[Eric Bana]]) enters a murder scene posing as a cop. After getting the details of the crime, he is removed from the premises and, immediately after, reports the story live on the radio. When he returns to the station, Frank is applauded by colleagues on getting the story before any other press, but his boss Geoffrey Mallard ([[Kevin Pollak]]) warns that if he breaks the law one more time, he'll be fired.  That night, [[everyman]] Ian Finch ([[Ricky Gervais]]), who is also Frank's sound technician, takes his wife Eleanor ([[Vera Farmiga]]) to the station's annual ball, but has to leave for a stake-out with co-worker Claire Maddox ([[Kelly Macdonald]]). Eleanor then meets Frank, who sleeps with her, unaware she is married to Finch. The following day, Mallard puts Frank on a story about an uprising in [[Ecuador]], and assigns Finch to accompany him. However, Finch tells Frank he can't go as Eleanor has left him. He also says he's written a letter, begging her not to end their marriage.  Finch later changes his mind about Ecuador, and he and Frank pack for their trip. At the airport, the two realize Finch has accidentally thrown their passports and plane tickets in a garbage truck. Frank and Finch return to the city and hide out at a café owned by Spanish couple Brigida and Domingo ([[America Ferrera]] and [[Raúl Castillo]]), located across the street from the radio station. With Brigida and Domingo's help, Frank and Finch fake their war reports in the couple's spare room.  After Finch and Frank decide they need to cover a bigger story, they invent a man named Emilio Santiago Alvarez, whom they claim is elusive and closely linked to the war. This report alerts the U.S. government, who now believe that Frank and Finch are targets for Alvarez's men. Meanwhile, Frank and Finch watch as other media outlets report on Alvarez, including their TV rival John Baker ([[Benjamin Bratt]]). Mallard calls Frank, asking for the two men to go to the U.S. embassy in Quito, where they will then be flown home. Panicking that they'll be found out, Frank and Finch destroy their SIM cards so they cannot be traced.  The next morning, Frank fails to check in with Mallard, worrying the station. The media begins reporting about Finch and Frank's disappearance. Claire visits Eleanor to offer her sympathy, but Eleanor seems more interested in getting her story out. Frank and Finch stage a hostage situation, and send out a message to the President, asking for a ransom or they will be executed. Later, Frank and Finch watch as Eleanor appears on TV. This prompts Frank to find out about her identity as Finch's wife. She then performs a song, "Dollar for a Hero", appealing for their safe return.  Eleanor subsequently becomes a national sensation and sets up a charity for Finch and Frank. Mallard asks Claire to get to know Eleanor, who is using her husband's plight so she can start a singing career. Finch accepts Eleanor's selfishness in the situation and says he's no longer upset that she left him. On Finch's birthday, he admits he can't keep up the charade any longer. Finch and Frank stop off at his [[apartment]] to take some of the donated money, but Eleanor catches them. The three decide to split the cash so they can all get what they want. Frank and Finch drive cross-country and sail illegally to Ecuador. They hitch a ride to Quito from a local, but first stop off at a rundown bar. There, they are held at gunpoint and taken to a small village, where they are locked up. Thinking they're going to die, Frank admits to Finch that he slept with Eleanor.  The next morning, the captors demand ransom from Eleanor but she refuses and tells them to kill Frank and Finch. When a captor returns, planning for them to fight to the death, Frank steals his gun and Finch ends up shooting him. They escape by stealing a car, make it to the U.S. embassy, and are flown home on a private jet. On returning home, they are greeted by the Secretary of State, press, friends and family. Frank makes a speech, and Finch bypasses Eleanor to greet Domingo and Brigida. Eleanor then speaks to press about her upcoming album, while Finch takes off his wedding ring. He approaches Claire, whom he realizes likes him for who he is. The pair happily walk off towards [[New York City|the city]] together.

Spectral
 [[DARPA]] researcher Dr. Mark Clyne flies out to [[Moldova]], the current deployment location of the US Military in the ongoing Moldovan War, to be consulted on one of his creations, a line of [[hyperspectral imaging]] goggles that have been issued to troops there. After arriving at a US Military Air Base on the outskirts of [[Chișinău]], he meets with General Orland and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Fran Madison. They show him footage captured by the troops' goggles of a mysterious, translucent, humanoid apparition that kills almost instantaneously. Knowing it is not interference, Orland wants Clyne's expert opinion before forwarding the findings and footage to his superiors. Conversely, Madison believes the sightings to be members of the insurgency wearing an advanced form of [[active camouflage]] and has orders from her superiors to retrieve a sample.  To get a clearer shot of the anomalies and identify them, both Clyne and Madison accompany a team of [[Delta Force]] operators into the field to find Utah team that went missing the day before. To capture a better image of the apparitions, Clyne mounts a larger, more powerful version of the hyperspectral camera on top of one of the [[armored personnel carrier]]s. Upon arriving at the location, they discover members of the Utah team dead along with the insurgents. They are ambushed by the apparitions, who, being impervious to small arms fire and explosives, inflict heavy casualties before the soldiers retreat. When landmines render their vehicles inoperable, the group takes cover in an abandoned factory where they find two children barricaded inside. The apparitions attempt to follow them but are stopped by a barrier of iron shavings.  The children share that their father scattered the shavings to protect his children before he was killed. The survivors make contact with the air base and set up a rendezvous. Clyne modifies the hyperspectral camera into a large searchlight, which enables the group to see the apparitions without the need for goggles. Clyne points out the numerous crates of iron shavings lying around the factory that the unit uses to turn their grenades into [[Improvised Explosive Device|IEDs]] laced with iron shavings to give them a fighting chance.  Fortified with these new weapons, the group sets out for the rendezvous point about a half-mile away from the factory.  After exiting the factory, the apparitions chase the group who use the iron explosives to slow them down. Reinforcements and a helicopter evac join them at the rendezvous point, a large abandoned plaza. However, they are ambushed by the apparitions and are barely able to escape as the figures proceed to destroy the tanks and kill the soldiers sent as backup. Once safely in the air, they receive word from Orland that the apparitions have overrun the Air Base so they are redirected to a civilian bunker controlled by the allied [[Military of Moldova|Moldovan military]]. Thinking over what he learned from the young girl Delta found, Clyne deduces the apparitions are likely man-made and are made of [[Bose-Einstein condensate]], which explains their ability to move through walls, freeze people to death, and the inability to pass through iron shavings and ceramic materials (hence their inability to enter tanks). Working overnight with Orland and surviving military engineers, he constructs several makeshift pulse weapons capable of breaking down the condensate. The next morning, the remaining American soldiers head to the Masarov power plant in the center of the city, as Clyne believes it is the only facility capable of generating the power needed to create the condensate.  While the soldiers mount an offensive distraction on the roof of the plant, Clyne and Madison descend down to a recently abandoned laboratory inside. They deduce that scientists, working in weapons research for the former regime, were scanning humans on a molecular level and using advanced [[3D printing]] to replicate them in condensate form. The human test subjects' brains and [[central nervous system]]s were then removed and hooked up to a central machine which keeps the condensate copies (or "apparitions") alive. With the battle above threatening to release the remaining condensates, Clyne finally finishes activation of the failsafe system, which deactivates the condensate apparitions. Believing that whatever level of consciousness remaining is in pain, he unplugs the human remains from the machine, finally giving them peace.  With the apparitions gone, the US and Allied Moldovan military continue their work of taking control of the city from the insurgents. A [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] extraction team is to be sent back to the plant with the [[Delta Force]] operators to take the machinery apart and potentially use it for their own purposes. Saying goodbye to Madison and General Orland, Clyne boards an aircraft to be taken back home to Virginia.

From now on, Young-hee, Jung-min, and the others must only use Japanese since speaking any other languages is punishable. In the brothel, the girls are each given only a tiny room with a bed and an endless flow of soldiers coming for 10 minutes each. The servicemen mistreat them and beat them. Many have [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] tendencies. 'Comfort women' are trying to cope with their situation, while some lose their sanity while others try to stay sane.

Speed Racer: Race to the Future
 To prevent car accident fatalities, Pops Racer and his company develop an orb that can send a vehicle and its occupants 15-seconds back in time. Fearing for his son's safety during a race in poor conditions, and without Speed's knowledge, Pops installs the object in the [[Mach 5]] before it can be properly tested. Just as the race begins, a bolt of lightning strikes the car sending Speed, Trixie, Sparky, Spritle and Chim-Chim fifty years into the future.  Now in 2062, the group is immediately arrested and brought to a sorting facility where the Mach-5 is seized. A robot parole officer explains that in an effort to keep humans safe, all labor is now handled by machines designed by Leland Industries, a company that formerly competed with Pops Motors in automotive sports. After tricking the robot into telling them the location of the Mach 5, the group comes across Sparky's son, who operates the recycling plant. He reveals that their future selves were imprisoned 10 years ago for starting the Road Rebels, a resistance group that's against a society run by robots due to a fear of eventual human enslavement. Claiming it would be futile to try to defeat Leland, Speed instead suggests they travel back in time to prevent the company from ever gaining that level of control. Sparky's son notes that the only way to afford an energy source powerful enough to fuel that level of time travel would be to win the Super Dome 1000, an exceedingly difficult racing event for robots. To prepare, the crew uses the plant's scrap vehicles to upgrade the Mach 5 to the Mach 5 Ultra. Speed, under the disguise as a robot named Speed Demon, and the group arrive at the arena where they're greeted by John Leland Jr., the owner of Leland Industries. Impressed by the Mach 5 Ultra and Speed Demon's design, he offers to buy them from Trixie should they finish the race.  The Road Rebels launch an attack on the streets just as the event begins. Trixie, Spritle and Chim-Chim assist in the offensive and get picked up by one of their members, Sparky's future wife Jennifer. Seeing Jennifer's glee at being able to see a version of her missing husband, Trixie is convinced to expose Leland's goals. Against Speed's orders, she and the rest of the group, including Sparky's son and Racer X, concoct a plan to disable Leland Industries' security and delete any of their ulterior motives, while Jennifer, Spritle and Chim-Chim stay on lookout. However, Leland Jr. catches on to the ruse when Trixie walks into his office and has the three detained by his robots. Outside, the parole robot from earlier catches up on Jennifer, Spritle and Chim-Chim, sounding the alarm to Leland's police robots who capture them.  As the third segment of the race begins, one of the competitors slams Speed into a pillar revealing his identity to the world and disqualifying him from the prize money. As Leland realizes the plot to go back in time and prevent his company's rise, the crowd cheers Speed on, convincing him to keep racing. Confused as to Speed's new motive, Leland reveals that he isn't actually a human, but an android built by the company's late founder. Fearing Speed may encourage a major rebellion, Leland then changes the prime directive of all robots from protecting humans to enslaving them.  Trixie, Racer X, Sparky's son, Jennifer, Spritle, Chim-Chim, and the now captured Sparky, quickly escape from the containment bay and plan another assault on Leland Industries. Trixie calls Speed and tells him to join the attack, but he refuses. 100 miles from the finish, he makes his move to take first place, but in the struggle drives the Mach 5 Ultra off the track, plummeting into a pool. A 92-year-old Pops Racer rushes out from the sidelines to his son's rescue, activating the time orb and sending the Mach 5 Ultra back in the past and in the race. While talking to his father, Speed realizes that he can't just go back to the past and hope to prevent this future. Activating the Mach 5 Ultra's new hover functionality, he flies out of the stadium to rally nearby humans into confronting Leland. Leland then gets into his own jet to engage Speed. With the office empty, Sparky and his son try to shutdown the invasion plan while Trixie, Racer X and Jennifer mount a ground assault against the robots.  Speed eventually gets the upper hand in his dogfight with Leland by pretending to have lost flying functionality. As the android goes in to kill Speed, the Mach 5 Ultra suddenly flies causing Leland to crash. Just as that happens, Sparky successfully disables the robot army. They rush outside to tell everyone the good news and to install the power cell needed to take them back to the past. Sparky finishes up on the Mach 5 Ultra and the group begin to head home. Just as they do, Leland reactivates and chases them to the time warp portal. The group narrowly evades his attack and pass through as Leland crashes into the closing gate and explodes.  Back in their time, Sparky makes plans to go on his first date with Jennifer as Speed apologizes to his father for being so reckless. Elsewhere, a shadowy figure steals the time orb.  
Split (2016 American film)
 Casey Cooke is an emotionally withdrawn teenager, having been [[Child sexual abuse|molested]] as a child by her uncle John, who became her legal guardian after her father's death. While hanging out with her classmates, Claire and Marcia, the three are kidnapped by Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Kevin has been evaluated by psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher, who discovered that he formed multiple personalities as a means to cope with the abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother. While Kevin appears otherwise stable, Dr. Fletcher has identified 23 distinct personalities within Kevin; in his mind, these personalities sit in chairs in a room, waiting for their turn "in the light" (controlling Kevin's body) as directed by "Barry", the dominant personality. She has also found that Kevin's physiology changes when a new personality comes into the light. Recently, "Barry" has refused to allow "Dennis" or "Patricia" their turns, in part due to Dennis' tendencies towards bothering underage girls and Patricia's undesirable traits, and also because both appear to worship "The Beast", a yet-unseen 24th personality. Regardless of which personality is controlling Kevin, Dr. Fletcher can call forth Kevin's own personality by speaking his full name to him.  Kevin takes the girls to his underground quarters and secures them in a cell. They recognize his dissociative disorder, and Claire attempts to use this against Kevin to escape but is caught by "Dennis" and segregated from the others. Over several days, Kevin leaves them locked up while he goes off to work and attends appointments with Dr. Fletcher. During these meetings, Dr. Fletcher recognizes that "Dennis" has seemingly taken over the dominant personality from "Barry", though he tries to act as "Barry" to fool her. She recalls an incident that "Barry" told her about a month before, where two teenage girls had walked up to him, taken his hands and placed them on their breasts, which may have triggered "Dennis" to take over. Dr. Fletcher suspects that Kevin, as "Dennis", is responsible for the three missing teenagers.  During this time, Marcia also attempts to escape but is caught by "Patricia" and segregated. Casey befriends "Hedwig", a young boy personality of Kevin's; it is later revealed that "Hedwig" has complete control over "the light", and has provided "Dennis" and "Patricia" with control. She gets "Hedwig" to let her out of her cell to see his bedroom, believing that there may be a means of escape through "Hedwig's" window but finds that it is only a drawing of a window. She takes the walkie-talkie from "Hedwig", and uses it to call for help, but the person at the other end of the walkie doesn't believe her, thinking that someone is playing a joke. Before she can convince the person that she is serious, "Patricia" takes over Kevin's body and subdues Casey.  Dr. Fletcher shows up at Kevin's home, where he reveals that "The Beast" is real and that he has met him. Suspicious of "Dennis", Dr. Fletcher feigns needing the bathroom to look around his home, where she finds Claire in her cell, but before she can do anything, "Dennis" catches her, sprays her face with a sedative in an aerosol can, and secures her in a separate room. He then leaves. While out, "The Beast" personality takes over for the first time, giving Kevin super-human abilities, while Claire and Marcia attempt to escape from their cells. Dr. Fletcher regains consciousness long enough to write out Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before "The Beast" returns and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that "The Beast" has already attacked and eaten Marcia and watches in horror as he does the same to Claire.  Casey finds Dr. Fletcher's body and her note on the piece of paper. "The Beast" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he hasn't been in control of his body for two years, Kevin instructs Casey to kill him with his shotgun. Following this statement, all 24 personalities begin warring for control of "the light", but shortly thereafter "The Beast" personality takes hold again. Casey escapes from his quarters into an underground tunnel and shoots him twice, but the shells have little effect. She locks herself in a small caged area. "The Beast" finds her and is about to pull the bars open to attack her but sees faded scars across her body, a sign of her past emotional turmoil and self-harm. Having previously declared his plans to rid the world of the "untouched", those whose hearts are impure because they have never suffered in their lives, he considers Casey to be "pure" and spares her, disappearing from the tunnels.  Sometime later, Casey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. Casey is asked by a police officer if she is ready to return home with her uncle. She hesitates to answer. In another hideout, "Dennis", "Patricia", and "Hedwig" exert collective control over Kevin's body and admire the power of "The Beast" and their plans to change the world.  In a diner, several patrons watch the news as a reporter states that Kevin's personalities have earned him the nickname "The Horde". A female patron notes the similarity between Kevin and a wheelchair-using criminal who was incarcerated 15 years earlier. As she tries to remember the nickname he was given, the [[David Dunn (character)|man sitting next to her]] tells her that it was "Mr. Glass".

Split Costs
 The story begins in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in the dead of winter, where Emma ([[Mela Hudson]]) picks up a young woman named Judy (Tori Hall), for a ride share to Western Massachusetts so that Judy can surprise her girlfriend Helen (Lauren Kirby), and Emma can hopefully score some money from her mother Brenda (Jane Harte). The two women begin their journey listening to mix tapes, and forcing small talk. Emma hits a pothole on the highway and the glove compartment opens to reveal a gun. Judy becomes extremely uncomfortable and confronts Emma about the weapon. Emma tells Judy that she has to protect herself due to the fact that she lives in her car, and the two get into an argument. The argument dwindles down as the car's check engine light comes on and forces them to stop for a while.  They sit down at a [[Panera Bread]], and Emma tries to call her mother, but there is no answer. As they finish their meals and head back to the car, Judy offers to look under the hood to see what is causing it to overheat. She explains that the car needs oil and coolant, and offers to chip in for this as payment for the ride. As Judy walks off, Emma tries her mother again, but there is still no answer.  As they continue driving towards their destinations, now with heat in the car, they celebrate and Emma expresses her gratitude. Their relationship improves and they become closer to each other. But as Emma arrives in front of Helen's apartment, and says goodbye to her new friend, she is overwhelmed with the feeling of loneliness once again.  Judy quietly sneaks through the door and sits down at the dining room table as she listens to her girlfriend sing in the shower. Without warning, another voice can be heard. Judy suddenly realizes that Helen is being unfaithful and Judy decides to exact her revenge on an oversize [[Teddy Bear]], hacking its head off with a kitchen knife. She arranges the bear's head, along with an upside down box of baked goods she brought as a gift, on the table and leaves.  Emma arrives at her mother's motel where she takes a swig of an alcoholic beverage, and smokes a cigarette before trying the door. When her mother doesn't answer after a moment of knocking, Emma decides to crawl through the window. Once inside, she finds her mother's cellphone on the nightstand, and then proceeds to rummage through her belongings in hopes of finding money. But an unexpected twist awaits her in the bathroom. As she turns the corner, her mother lies on the floor, a victim of a heroine overdose. Emma crumbles and falls to the floor, sobbing and trying to convince herself that her mother is just unconscious. After a moment of screaming for her mother to wake up, she leaves the motel room. Back in her car, she makes a phone call and sirens can be heard in the distance. Afterwards, Emma joins Judy at a cafe and they console each other.  Moments later they sit by a bridge and discuss throwing Emma's gun into the creek below. She steps up to the railing and throws the gun in the water. Emma rejoins Judy in the car and they decide to drive down south and get "umbrella drinks".  
Star Trek Beyond
  Three years into its mission, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] arrives at ''Yorktown'', a massive space station, for resupply and [[shore leave]] for her crew. Struggling to find meaning in their endless exploration, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] has applied for a promotion to vice admiral; he recommends [[Spock]] as his replacement. Meanwhile, [[Hikaru Sulu]] reunites with his family, [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]] works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]] amicably end their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his counterpart from the original timeline, has died.  The ''Enterprise'' is sent on a rescue mission after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. Its occupant, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula. As the ''Enterprise'' exits an asteroid field within the nebula, a massive swarm of small ships ambushes and quickly overwhelms the starship, destroying its [[warp drive|warp engines]] in a matter of seconds. The swarm's leader, Krall, and his crew board the crippled ''Enterprise'', capture and remove many crew members from the ship, and unsuccessfully search for a relic, the Abronath, that Kirk had recently obtained. Scotty manages to restore enough power for the ship to attempt to flee, but Krall orders his swarm to destroy the ''Enterprise'', and they smash the ship in half. Kirk orders the crew to abandon ship, leaving the remains of the ''Enterprise'' to crash on Altamid.  On the planet, Krall captures Sulu, Uhura and other survivors. Kirk and [[Pavel Chekov]], accompanied by Kalara, locate the ''Enterprise''s saucer section. Realising that Kalara knew they would be attacked, they trick her into revealing herself as Krall's spy. To escape Krall's soldiers, Kirk and Chekov use the ship's thrusters to flip the saucer over, and Kalara is killed in the maneuver. Elsewhere on the planet, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] and a wounded Spock search for other survivors. Spock explains to McCoy that the tension he witnessed between him and Uhura at ''Yorktown'' was due to his intention to leave [[Starfleet]] to help the Vulcan survivors, and continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment, rescues Scott and takes him to her makeshift home, the grounded [[USS Franklin (NX-326)|USS ''Franklin'']], an early Starfleet vessel reported missing over a century earlier. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock. Threatening to kill the crew, Krall coerces Ensign Syl to hand over the Abronath that she had concealed for Kirk, then uses it on her to demonstrate an ancient [[biological agent|bioweapon]] that can disintegrate any humanoid. With the device complete, Krall intends to kill ''Yorktown''s inhabitants, then use the base to attack the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]]. Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches into space with the bioweapon, leading his drones to ''Yorktown''.  As the ''Enterprise'' survivors power up the ''Franklin'' and launch her in pursuit of Krall, they deduce that such a massive swarm must coordinate its attacks via radio signals, specifically on the VHF frequency. Scott transports Spock and McCoy into one of the swarm ships to seize control of it. Matching the swarm's frequency, they jam and disorient the swarm by broadcasting the 1994 song "[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]" by the [[Beastie Boys]], destroying almost the entire fleet. Krall and his three surviving ships, one of which contains Spock and McCoy, are chased by the ''Franklin'' through ''Yorktown''. The chase ends at the station's headquarters,  where the ''Franklin''s sudden appearance causes the three ships to smash into it . As Krall flees into the starbase, Uhura and Kirk discover from the ''Franklin''s logs that he is actually Balthazar Edison, former captain of the ''Franklin''. A pre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]]. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the three survivors used the extinct natives's technology to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, and re-purposed the ancient race's dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking the Federation had abandoned them, Edison planned to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into ''Yorktown''s ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can activate, Kirk ejects it and Edison into space, where the weapon consumes Edison. Using the alien ship they commandeered, Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space.  In the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the files of Captain Edison and the USS ''Franklin'' crew. Kirk decides to keep his position as the ''Enterprise''s captain; Spock chooses to remain in Starfleet, and begins to renew his relationship with Uhura. On Kirk's recommendation, Jaylah is accepted into [[Starfleet Academy]]. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, they watch the construction of their new ship, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise''-A]]—and when the ship is completed, they resume their mission.

Carter finds out from the girl what happened in the cemetery and that she has a picture of Sade's face. Sade, in the downstairs of the house, starts going through Carter's possessions and finds a picture of Carter in military uniform with his wife and son. He tries to convince Carter he is also ex-military and he understands why Carter is protecting Bird. Carter lets him know he is aware that Bird has a picture of him and that is why he is after her.  Meanwhile, a sheriff's deputy happens upon the abandoned cars at the cemetery. In the house, a resting Carter is dreaming about a tragedy that happened to his son. He wakes up and sends Bird to get a bottle of alcohol. She returns with the drink and his son's teddy bear, which he angrily tells her to put back.

He tries to bargain with Carter for the deputy's life as well as his own for Bird. When Carter refuses, Sade starts to torture the deputy. He eventually shoots him and rolls him out where Carter can see him.  After a period of silence, Carter tells Bird to hide and starts down the stairs.

Night descends and Carter's wife Mara arrives. Sade bargains again for Bird implying he'll rape Mara if Carter doesn't comply. Fearing he will trade for his wife, Bird pleads with Carter not to. Instead he gives her the gun instructing her to shoot down the stairs if Sade heads up. He heads down the stairs, telling Sade "if he wants her, go get her." Sade goes on a rant before shooting Carter in the leg. When Sade yells to Bird that he will kill Carter, she quickly heads down the stairs in order go save him. Before Sade has the chance to kill any of them, the lights in the house flicker, giving Carter the chance to rush the assassin, stabbing Sade multiple times, though is shot in the ensuring struggle.

Finding Sade against the wall, severally bleeding, he tells her to shoot him after she aims the gun at Sade and pulls the trigger, but the gun only clicks; with Sade realizing the round was a dud the whole time. Sade aims his gun at Bird, who looks on at the man, unafraid, telling him herself to pull the trigger, though he only responds with the fact that he is not a monster before dying without shooting. With it finally over, Bird heads over to Carter who is still alive.

Storks (film)
  For generations, the storks of Stork Mountain delivered babies to families around the world, until one stork named Jasper attempted to keep an infant girl for himself. Jasper accidentally destroyed the infant’s address beacon and went into exile. Unable to deliver the orphaned girl, the storks adopted her under the name Tulip. CEO stork Hunter discontinued baby delivery in favor of package delivery with Cornerstore.com.  Eighteen years later, Tulip, now a young adult, tries to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, which backfire and cause the company to lose stocks. Hunter declares her to be a severe burden and liability due to this incompetence (the charts even justify this, as every time she tries to help, their profits go way down, and when they ''do'' make progress, it is when she's absent). Hunter assigns top delivery stork Junior to fire Tulip so he may be promoted to boss. Junior cannot bring himself to do so and instead transfers Tulip to the mail room.  Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner, who lives with his workaholic parents Henry and Sarah, is feeling lonely and wants a younger sibling. He sends a letter to Cornerstore and it reaches Tulip, who enters the defunct baby factory and inserts the letter into the baby-making machine, causing it to create a pink-haired infant girl. Junior injures his wing trying to shut down the machine. Afraid Hunter will fire him, Junior agrees to accompany Tulip and secretly deliver the baby to her family using a makeshift flying craft that Tulip invented. They eventually crash, escape a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] that fall in love with the baby, and reach civilization, during which Junior and Tulip bond with the baby and name her Diamond Destiny. In the meantime, Henry and Sarah open up to Nate’s desire for a younger sibling and spend time with their son by building a landing platform for the storks.  Junior and Tulip encounter Jasper, who had followed them from Stork Mountain. Jasper has nearly repaired Tulip’s delivery beacon, but is missing one piece, which had been in Tulip’s possession for years. Junior confesses to Tulip that he was supposed to fire her, and a saddened Tulip leaves with Jasper to meet her family while Junior continues alone to deliver Diamond Destiny. Cornerstore’s pigeon employee Toady learns about Diamond Destiny and informs Hunter, who reroutes her address beacon and leads Junior into a trap. Hunter fires Junior and has Diamond Destiny taken away to live with penguins until she is an adult in order to silence the incident and prevent more plummeting stocks.  Tulip reunites with Junior and they return to Stork Mountain during the highly anticipated Storkcon event to save Diamond Destiny from the penguins. When they are cornered in the baby factory by Hunter and the other stork employees, Junior sends millions of archived letters from families into the baby-making machine, causing it to rapidly produce babies and distract the storks. Hunter seizes control of a giant crane and tries to destroy the factory, only to have Diamond Destiny and abused birds help make the Cornerstore building collapse off Stork Mountain, causing Hunter, who is entangled in the building cables and trapped inside the crane, to fall to his death.  In the aftermath, Junior rallies the storks to deliver all the babies to their families. Junior, Tulip, and Jasper deliver Diamond Destiny to the Gardners, Tulip finally meets her family, and Junior and Tulip continue working as co-bosses at Stork Mountain.

They are placed under command of Colonel [[Rick Flag]] to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nano bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape.  One of Waller's intended recruits is Flag's girlfriend [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Dr. June Moone]], an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the "Enchantress". Enchantress quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her. She besieges [[Midway City (DC Comics)|Midway City]] by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], a Japanese swordswoman.  Harley's homicidal lover [[Joker (character)|Joker]] finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nano bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harley's bomb. On approach, the squad's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang inaccurately convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check; Slipknot attempts to escape and Flag kills him via his nano bomb, while the squad is attacked by Enchantress' minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe room, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' siege.  The squad escorts Waller to a rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harley's bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allows her to climb aboard the helicopter. Waller's men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad.

Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of [[Navy SEAL]]s, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.  The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress' heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress' weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress' heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges.

Sully (film)
 On January 15, 2009, [[US Airways]] pilots [[Pilot in command|Captain]] [[Chesley Sullenberger|Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger]] and [[First officer (aeronautics)|First Officer]] Jeff Skiles board [[US Airways Flight 1549]] from [[LaGuardia Airport]] to [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport]]. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the [[Airbus A320]] [[Bird strike|strikes a flock of birds]], disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports ([[Teterboro Airport]] being the closest), Sully [[Water landing|ditches]] the aircraft on the [[Hudson River]]. The crew and passengers evacuate without casualty. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him haunted, and experiencing a dream in which the plane crashes into a building.  Sully learns that preliminary data from [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]] suggest that the port engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.  Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been [[pilot error]], which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run [[Emergency procedure|emergency checks]] before deciding to divert the plane.  Both simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.

Summer's Desire (film)
   
The Suit (2016 film)
 In 1950s [[Sophiatown]], South Africa, a man forces his wife to treat her lover's suit as if it were a person, with tragic consequences.  The film opens with a prologue in which [[Spokes Mashiyane]]'s "Come Back" plays from an old radio in a bedroom. In a montage of shots, a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes shoes, brushes trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket and finally adjusts a tie.  Philemon, a middle-class lawyer awakens his sleeping wife Matilda, whom he calls Tilly, in their bedroom, with breakfast in bed. He is dressed in a suit and carries a [[fedora]]. The married couple lives in [[Sophiatown]], a township of [[Johannesburg]], in the early 1950s, shortly before the [[apartheid]] regime [[Apartheid|forcibly removed]] non-whites from the area to make way for white resettlement under the [[Group Areas Act]] and the [[Natives Resettlement Act, 1954]]. She kisses him and adjusts his tie as he tells her that he better go or he will be late for work. She kisses him again for longer, then he leaves the house. Matilda climbs out of bed and walks to the bedroom window, watching Philemon walk away, then she turns back and gazes at the empty, lonely house.  Philemon walks down a busy street as a caption appears on screen saying: [[Sophiatown]], [[Johannesburg]], 1955. At a bus-stop, under a sign that reads: [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953|Native Bus Stop]], Philemon meets his old friend Mr. Maphikela who appears to be anxious because he drops his briefcase as Philemon attempts to shake his hand. Their bus arrives and the two men board. On the bus, Mr. Maphikela reluctantly informs Philemon that Matilda has been visited by a young man every morning for the last three months. Devastated, Philemon tells Maphikela that he has to go and he hurries off the bus as Maphikela tells him to keep steady. As Philemon alights from the bus, another passenger boards the bus. The white bus conductor yells at the passenger in colloquial [[Afrikaans]]: "Nie-blankes, upstairs!", which means: "Non-whites, upstairs!" because public amenities, like buses, were [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953|segregated]] under [[apartheid]]. As the bus pulls off, Maphikela watches Philemon marching past other pedestrians.  In a montage of shots, Matilda pours two glasses of [[Whisky|whiskey]], flirts and dances with a shirtless young man as [[Spokes Mashiyane]]'s "Zoo Lake Jive" plays from a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. In the same montage, Philemon marches through the streets of [[Sophiatown]], loosening his tie aggressively and bumping into other pedestrians. The montage ends as Matilda kisses the young man and Philemon reaches the front door of his house. He opens the door, shuts it behind him, puts his briefcase down on the floor, then inhales deeply, gathering himself. Philemon walks deliberately to the bedroom where he discovers Matilda asleep in the arms of her lover.  Philemon's face fills with rage. He notices the lover's suit hanging on the cupboard door. Philemon controls his anger and ambles to the cupboard, searching through it. He pretends as if he has not noticed the lovers in bed, and tells Matilda that he was nearly at work when he realised that he had left his [[Pass laws|pass]] at home so he returned to fetch it. While saying so, Philemon drapes the lover's suit over his arm. Matilda and her lover wake with a start. The lover rushes to the window, completely naked, then leaps out of it, fleeing down the street. Philemon treads purposefully to the window, watching the man running away, then locks it. Philemon tells Matilda that he must phone his boss to let him know that he will not come in to work today as his wife is unwell. While Philemon phones his boss, Matilda dresses quickly in her nightgown and waits anxiously on the bed.  Philemon returns and regards the suit. He tells Matilda that he notices that they have a visitor. Philemon commands Matilda to treat the suit with the same hospitality that she would show to a guest: it will share meals with them, it will share their bedroom, it will go for walks with them, etc. If she refuses, he says that he will kill her.  For the first time in his life, Philemon goes to a [[shebeen]] (an illegal speakeasy). While [[Spokes Mashiyane]]'s "Kwela Zulu" plays, the shebeen queen removes alcohol (the sale of which was prohibited to blacks) from below a trap-door in a side-room then brings a bottle to Philemon as he smokes. Philemon stays at the [[shebeen]] all day, leaving Matilda alone with her thoughts and fears. When Philemon returns, he finds that Matilda has cleaned and spruced up their dingy home. She even wears a beautiful new dress and has prepared dinner. Unmoved, Philemon scolds his wife: where is their visitor? Matilda retrieves the suit and prepares a plate of food for it. Philemon instructs her how she should place the suit at the table so that it becomes indeed the third person. Matilda is petrified and scurries about as he barks orders. While Philemon eats, Matilda edges towards the window and opens it to get some air. But Philemon walks up and locks it from behind her then orders her to return to the table while he finishes his meal. This is how it should be from now on, Philemon tells her. They wash their plates and cutlery at the kitchen sink in silence, the suit hanging on the wall beside Matilda. Later, in the sitting room, Matilda irons the suit as Philemon smokes ominously behind her.  On a Sunday, Philemon and Matilda walk to church. Matilda is deeply humiliated as she has to carry the suit slung over her shoulder. On the way, the couple walks past a wall on which a slogan has been painted: Ons Dak Nie, Ons Phola Hier, which is [[Tsotsitaal]] for We Won't Leave, We Are Staying Here.<ref>http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/destruction-sophiatown</ref> Philemon and Matilda enter the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street (which is incidentally the same street in which the writer Can Themba lived at Number 111). Above the altar is a conspicuous statue of a [[Race and appearance of Jesus|black Jesus]]. Philemon and Matilda are seated at a pew with the suit over the seat between them. Matilda's church friend arrives late with her husband and asks Matilda if they can sit beside her. Matilda looks to Philemon for permission but he glares at her. Matilda tells her church friend that someone else is seated there so her church friend tells her not to worry, that they will find seats elsewhere. After the service, Matilda's best friend Sane asks Matilda whether she will join her at choir practice from which she has been absent for a while. Matilda again looks to Philemon for permission and he says that he does not see why she should not go. Sane's husband Vuzi asks Philemon whether the suit that is slung over Matilda's shoulder is a new suit and compliments him by saying it looks stylish. Philemon scowls at Matilda as they leave the church.  Back home, Philemon reads in the sitting room. When Matilda attempts to sit beside him, he tells her to go put the fellow to rest, referring to the suit which she is carrying. Later, Philemon finds Matilda lying on the bed sobbing as she caresses the suit. He tosses some money at her and tells her to prepare a dinner for her friends because she should not mope around all day. But he reminds her to take the suit with her, which he sarcastically refers to as their visitor.  Matilda sings "[[Amazing Grace]]" with a choir of wives at the cultural club of the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican Mission]]. The suit hangs conspicuously on a hat stand beside them. The song continues over a montage of shots. Matilda goes to buy provisions for her dinner party. On her way home, carrying the suit, she walks past a political rally where the speaker calls the crowd to resist the forced removals by insisting that they will not move. The speaker shouts the popular [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] rallying cry: [[Amandla (power)|Amandla]]! (The power!) and the crowd replies with the traditional: “[[Amandla (power)|Nghawethu]]!" (Is ours!).  As a turkey cooks in the oven, Matilda dances with the suit to [[Spokes Mashiyane]]'s "Zoo Lake Jive". Knocks sound from the front door. Philemon yells from the sitting room that Matilda must get the door but she does not hear him above the music. Philemon continues to yell, but Matilda still does not hear him. Finally, Philemon storms into the room and Matilda bumps into him with a fright as the music stops suddenly. Matilda rushes to the front door and opens to see Sane, Vuzi and two other friends.  Matilda serves her friends turkey at the dinner table. Philemon demands that she fetches their guest of honour. Matilda begs him to let it go just this once but he raises his voice. Deeply humiliated, Matilda serves the suit a meal in front of her friends. Eventually, Vuzi asks what is going on. Philemon tells Vuzi to ask Matilda, as she "knows the fellow best". Matilda brushes it off by saying that it is just a silly game that she and her husband play at meal-times. The guests chuckle, but as Matilda continues to serve the suit a meal, the dinner continues with the proverbial awkward silence as Matilda's friends watch her with bewildered amusement. After the uncomfortable dinner, the friends decide to go to a local [[shebeen]] to dance. Matilda is about to follow them out of the house when Philemon steps in front of her and commands her to put the suit to bed. Philemon leaves with the friends, leaving Matilda standing alone in the doorway. As she presses the suit to her breast, we see her from behind in the empty entrance-way.  While Philemon dances with the friends at the smoky [[shebeen]] to the tune of [[Spokes Mashiyane]]'s "Phatha Phatha", we return to the prologue in which a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes shoes, brushes trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket. Finally, we realise that the person now fully dressed in the suit is in fact Matilda, though we do not see her face, and the tie is attached to the rafters of the bedroom. Back at the [[shebeen]], Philemon is seated, contemplating his punishment of Matilda, as the music and sounds fade to a muffle. Gradually, [[Billie Holiday]]'s "[[Strange Fruit]]" fades in as Philemon scratches his brow and the song continues to play as Philemon staggers home in the early hours of the morning. "[[Strange Fruit]]" was popular in [[Sophiatown]] at the time due to the gradual entrenchment of [[apartheid]] laws. Matilda steps up onto a crate, then kicks it out from underneath her and she hangs herself. Philemon enters the bedroom and falls to his knees below Matilda's hanging feet as he shouts her name repeatedly. "[[Strange Fruit]]" continues to play over the end credits of the film.

Suntan (2016 film)
 Kostis, the new general practitioner, arrives on a resort island and greets the mayor.  The mayor explains that, outside of the summer months, the population is around 800 and life is quiet.  Kostis settles in amid Christmas celebrations, meeting several people, among them Takis, a villager who crudely assures him that the island will be overflowing with hedonistic, young women during the summer.  After summer comes along, Kostis treats a young tourist named Anna, who has injured her leg.  Her friends – Alin, Mila, Jason, and Morten – insist on accompanying her into the examination room and behave obnoxiously.  Kostis humors them and asks Anna several questions while filling out paperwork.  After answering, Anna playfully turns the questions on Kostis, who admits that he is twice her age, 21.  Before leaving, Anna suggests Kostis come with them to the beach.  Kostis leaves for the beach after he is done at work.  Overweight and balding, Kostis stands out at the nude beach even more for having arrived fully dressed.  After taking off some of his clothing, he makes a pretense toward asking Anna and her friends if they have a lighter.  Recognizing him, they invite him to join them.  Kostis watches as they frolic nude on the beach, later joining them in the water.  When he swims over to Anna and asks how her leg is, she demonstrates by diving underwater and spreading her legs in front of him while upside down.  Kostis, infatuated with Anna, begins hanging out at the beach after work and supplying her friends with free beer.  On one occasion, he turns away an elderly woman who has complained of back pain so he can leave for the beach as soon as his office closes.  At the beach, Anna invites him to join a pool party.  Though initially reluctant, Kostis chances upon Orestis, a former medical school colleague who is vacationing on the beach with his family.  Overhearing Kostis' invitation, he encourages Kostis to go, as the parties have a reputation for hedonistic abandon; Kostis agrees.  Once there, the host urges everyone to kiss whomever is near them.  The partiers make out with each other, in both heterosexual and homosexual couplings, though Kostis is only interested in Anna.  After they make out, she turns to make out with others, and Kostis becomes jealous.  Anna chastises him, and he wanders away from the party, dejected.  Orestis, who has also attended the party, consoles him, saying that such parties are not for middle-aged men such as them.  As Kostis spends more time ingratiating himself into Anna's company, the villagers complain about his behavior, such as turning away the elderly woman.  Eventually, Anna invites him to the beach with her alone, and the two have sex.  Ashamed at orgasming too quickly, Kostis apologizes.  Anna brushes it aside and says he will have much time over the summer to make it up to her.  However, Anna is nowhere to be found for the next few days.  Kostis spends the bulk of his time searches the beaches and bars for her, becoming increasingly frustrated and drunken.  Finding Kostis at a bar, Takis encourages him to carouse with him.  They pick up a female tourist, who eventually grows frustrated with Takis' sexually aggressive behavior.  Kostis stands up for her, annoying Takis, and she performs oral sex on Kostis.  When Anna finally reappears, she happily jumps into his arms.  Angry, Kostis berates her for leaving the island without telling him.  When she becomes offended, he apologizes and professes his love for her, but she only becomes more adamant that she does not want to see him again.  Crushed, Kostis begins stalking her, watching covertly as she has sex.  When Kostis forcefully attempts to dance with her at a club, the bouncer throws him out.  As his life falls apart, Kostis comes in hours late to the clinic during an emergency.  The mayor, frustrated with Kostis' behavior, fires him.  Kostis sullenly becomes drunk, assaults one of Anna's friends, and kidnaps her.  After drugging her and dragging her unconscious body back to the clinic, he takes off her shorts but doesn't go through with raping her. After checking her pulse, he begins crying and treats a wound on her leg.

Deprived of his rival, dying of an inevitable (but not debhilitating) ailiment, and possessed of a pill that can cure all wounds except his own sickness, Yen Shisan takes up the life of a gravedigger, trying to live a good life in the time he has left to him, while the evil kung fu group Divine Might decides to defeat the Supreme Sword Manor themselves and become the supreme force in the [[Wu-lin|wulin]] (the world of Kung Fu), as, berift of Shao-Feng, there is nobody there who can stand against them.    Meanwhile, a drunken lout ([[Lin Gengxin]]), arrives at a brothel, drinks until he is out of money, and is coerced into working as a servant for the brothel-keepers. Refusing to give a name, he is nicknamed Ah-Chi ("Useless Chi").  He intercedes when the lowest-status of the prostitutes, Hsiao Li ([[Jiang Mengjie]]), is being stiffed by her patrons and bonds with her, but leaves the brothel after he hears that the Big Boss wants to promote him to a bouncer, instead being taken in and working with poor, but happy, nightsoil collectors.  Hsaio Li, meanwhile, runs away from the abuse in the brothel with her earnings, back to her home: the very villagers who have taken Ah-Chi in.  The Big Boss sends enforcers to retrieve Hsiao Li and Ah-Chi, but they are defeated by Yen Shisan (carrying around his gravestone) and run back to the Big Boss, one of them announcing that Yen Shisan is going to fight a duel with Shao-Feng. The villagers plead with Yen Shisan to train them in Kung Fu or help them against Big Boss, and eventually swayed, he kills Big Boss (who reveals he is the representative of Divine Might in the town and threatens consequences before being killed) and most of his men, and teaches Ah-Chi his "13 Strikes" unique kung fu technique.  Meanwhile,  Chiu-Ti and her warriors find Ah-Chi in the village, unmask him as Shao-Feng, and coerce him into agreeing to marry her for the third time. He moves into a hut with her and reveals why he left her the previous two times -- the first because, sickened by the senseless slaughter and death his family inflicted on anyone who might be considered a rival, he had resolved to leave the wulin himself and live a simple life; the second, after he rode off with her on the eve of a marriage with a man she did not love, after it became clear that she did not understand and would never be content with the simple life he so desired.  This time, she promises that she will live the simple life with him he desires, but after he shows that this life involves stepping into dirt, she decides to take revenge instead, leaving her husband alone.  Yen Shisan, meanwhile, is told that Ah-Chi is, in fact, Shao-Feng, his rival, and resolves to take him on, even though, having taught Shao-Feng his techniques, he believes he cannot win.  Shao-Feng returns to the village to sleep, where Hsiao Li attempts to seduce him (not for the first time), but before the seduction can be completed, Chiu-Ti arrives and attacks.  Yen Shisan spirits Shao-Feng away to save his life, but this proves disastrous for the village, which is burned to the ground and nearly all its inhabitants slaughered by Chiu-Ti's warriors.  Shao-Feng arrives with Yen Shisan at the burned-out village, and is able to save only one person--Hsiao Li, who is barely alive, but returned to health with Yen Shisan's magic pill.    Yen Shisan and Shao-Feng talk of the impending attack of Chiu-Ti's warriors and Divine Might on his home, and Shao-Feng's unwillingness to fight -- and Yen Shisan convinces Shao-Feng that with his great skill and two kung fu techniques, he can defeat all the forces arrayed against Supreme Sword Manor without killing.  Supreme Sword Manor is attacked, and its forces slaughtered and driven back by the combined power of Chiu-Ti's warriors, now working with Divine Might's masked fighters, until Yen Shisan arrives just in time to prevent an honor-saving suicide, and Shao-Feng defeats the combined attackers easily, unmasking Divine Might's warriors as the branded rejects from Supreme Sword Manor, and in the ensuing conflict, Chiu-Ti accidentally stabs her chief servant (and rejected lover) fatally, and faced with one final rejection; he stabs her in the back, resulting in her dying in Shao-Feng's arms in one final marriage.  Shao-Feng, now dressed in the black and white robes of a wandering swordsman, fights his duel of destiny with his friend and rival Yen Shisan; both swordman fight their upmost, and Yen Shisan is finally disarmed and killed, dying, as he wished, with honor on a sword he respected.  Shao-Feng swaps swords with the dead Yen Shisan at his gravesite, and in the penultimate scene, goes to his life as a wandering swordman with his burn-scarred companion, Hsiao Li.  "Where are we going," she asks.  "We'll right wrongs and fight for justice," he answers.  "Will you kill people?" she asks.  "I will save them," he says, and the final scene consists of vines falling in a forest to reveal the face of the Buddha.

Swiss Army Man
 Hank, a man marooned on an island, is on the verge of hanging himself, but sees a corpse wash up on the beach. He tries to resuscitate it, but the corpse bemuses him with its incessant flatulence. As the tide begins to wash the corpse away, Hank watches as its farts propel itself around on the water. Hank immediately mounts the corpse and rides it across the ocean like a jet ski, landing on a mainland shore but far from civilization. That night, the two of them hide in a cave from a rainstorm, and after the runoff pours into the corpse's mouth, Hank realizes the next morning that the corpse has yet another power in which it can be used like a well for a seemingly infinite source of drinkable water. The corpse also begins a slow transition into speaking and acquires a grasp on the English language, adopting the name Manny. Hank and Manny continue their quest, using Manny's erections (fueled by a swimsuit magazine they find) as a compass. Manny has forgotten everything about his former life, and Hank tries to teach him various concepts about life, but Manny's childlike and shameless interpretations of these concepts conflict with what Hank considers socially acceptable behavior.  Over the course of their journey, Hank teaches Manny the joys of eating out, going to movies, and partying, using crudely-constructed props and sets made from plants and garbage they find. Using these, Hank leads Manny to believe that Manny is in love with a woman named Sarah, who rides the bus alone every day. Manny falls in love with Sarah, and it is this love that motivates him to try to find civilization with Hank. In reality, Hank is very much in love with Sarah, having seen her riding the bus every day but never talking to her due to his own shyness. He has a photo of her that he took secretly while on the bus set as the wallpaper on his phone and follows her on social media. As he looks through photos, it is revealed that Sarah is happily married and has a child.  Hank impersonates Sarah to help Manny learn how to talk to women, but they end up connecting and kiss. They have a falling out after Hank reveals that Manny never knew Sarah during his life. Feeling betrayed over Hank's hypocrisy and self-restraint, Manny states he wishes to be fully dead again. At this time, Hank experiences strange mental flashes of surreal images recalling his journey and suggests that one of Manny's powers is to affect his mind. Despite the tension between them, when Hank is attacked by a bear, Manny moves under his own power for the first time, crawling after his injured friend and igniting one of his farts from their campfire to scare the bear away. Hank loses consciousness and wakes up to Manny carrying him to Sarah's house, despite Hank's protests.  While Sarah is in the house, Manny talks to Sarah's daughter, Crissie. Expecting her to be impressed, he demonstrates several of his powers, inadvertently frightening her with his compass-erection, which Hank quickly slaps down. Sarah is alerted by her daughter's crying and calls the police at the sight of Hank and Manny's once-again inanimate corpse. Hank is soon patched up, but the cops discover the photos of Sarah on his phone and become suspicious. Hank's father also appears, mistaking Manny's corpse for Hank when asked by the paramedics to confirm his identity. After being interviewed by the local television news and deliriously professing on air his gratitude for Manny and his magical powers, Hank runs away with Manny's body. Hank's pursuers discover the structures he built which in actuality seem to be quite close to Sarah's house, as if he had been there some time instead of journeying through the forest. The police, Sarah, her husband, her daughter, a reporter, a camera man, and Hank's father all follow him to the beach. Cornered, Hank lets out a long fart as he is taken away by the police. Shortly after, to everyone's shock, horror, and in Crissie and Hank's father's case, amusement, Manny begins violently farting until he floats back into the ocean and skims quickly away, propelled by his own flatulence, he and Hank sharing one last smile.

Lu is devastated to discover the next morning that Nico has left without saying goodbye. She finds herself compelled to find him.  She drives to [[New York City]], where Nico's mother Margo lives, and finds her at her apartment.  After informing Lu that she has not seen Nico in two years, Margo tells Lu to leave.  With nowhere else to go, Tallulah steals from guests at a nearby hotel, only for an eccentric and intoxicated mother, Carolyn, to mistake Lu as housekeeping staff.  To Lu's confusion, Carolyn lets her child wander around naked and play with dangerous objects and admits that she is not invested in being a mother.  She leaves her toddler, Maddy, in Tallulah's care, while she goes on a date with a man who is not her husband.  Tallulah bonds with the young Maddy, bathing her and playing games before a devastated Carolyn arrives back at the hotel, distraught that the man did not want her.  After Carolyn drunkenly passes out, Tallulah impulsively takes Maddy back to her van to spend the night.  Carolyn panics the next morning when she discovers Maddy is missing and calls the police.  When Lu returns to the hotel with Maddy, she flees upon seeing the police and goes to Margo's apartment.  After Lu claims that the child is Nico's and that she is Margo's granddaughter, "Maggie," Margo reluctantly agrees to let them stay for one night.  Unknown to Lu, Margo is struggling with her own marital problems after her ex-husband Stephen has left her for a man, Andreas, and is pressing Margo to finalize their divorce.  While Lu and Maddy stay with Margo, the three of them bond; Tallulah reveals her fears of forming relationships and Margo admits to having trouble letting go.  However, Lu becomes increasingly aware that the authorities are looking for her and Maddy.  Meanwhile, a distressed Carolyn is questioned by a social worker who notes that Carolyn has only expressed concern for herself so far instead of her missing child.  Frustrated with their questioning, Carolyn leaves the hotel to distract herself and discovers that her husband has cancelled all her credit cards.  During a lunch with Stephen and Andreas, Margo defends Tallulah when Stephen begins to aggressively question Tallulah's relationships with Nico and Maddy.  She confronts Stephen about their marriage and the deceit involved. She points out that when all their friends supported Stephen, Margo had been left alone to reconcile the changes in her life and losing the family she loved.  On their way back to Margo's apartment, Tallulah and Carolyn notice one another as the latter goes by in a cab.  Just before Carolyn catches up to them, Lu narrowly escapes with Maddy and Margo via the subway.  When Margo demands to know why Lu ran, an argument ensues and Lu runs off with a feverish Maddy to a pier that Nico had once told Tallulah was his favorite place.  Lu imagines diving into the water and swimming away, just as Nico finds her, having finally returned to his mother in New York City.  Taking Maddy to the hospital, Nico devises a plan to allow Lu to escape.  At Margo's apartment, Carolyn and the police arrive after a tip from Stephen and Andreas, who recognized Lu from a newspaper article reporting on Maddy's abduction.  Carolyn admits to Margo that she did not want to be a mother and feels no maternal instinct, despite loving her daughter; Margo comforts her.  At a subway station, Lu calls Margo to apologize for involving her and the police trace the call.  Lu tries to make herself get on the subway in order to flee, but instead she returns to Maddy and Nico at the hospital.  The police, Carolyn, and Margo arrive at the hospital, where an emotional Tallulah accuses Carolyn of not wanting Maddy.  After a tearful Carolyn tells her that she does want her child, Tallulah reluctantly hands Maddy back to her and is arrested by the police.  As the police take Tallulah away, Margo promises to help her however she can.  When the detective asks if Lu has a habit of taking toddlers into protective custody, Lu says nothing and smiles ruefully.  Some time later, Margo wanders through the park before lying in the grass, recalling her conversation with Tallulah about letting go.  She starts floating away happily, but when she sees Tallulah and Nico below her, she reaches out and grabs a tree branch to hold on.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows
 Two years after their battle with [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] and Eric Sacks,  the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], and [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], still live beneath the sewers of [[New York City]], having allowed Vern Fenwick to take the credit for Shredder's defeat. At [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], [[April O'Neil]] discovers and informs the turtles that scientist [[Baxter Stockman]] is working for Shredder and plans to bust him out of prison. As Shredder is transferred between prisons alongside criminals [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] by [[corrections officer]] [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], the [[Foot Clan]] attack the convoy transporting them. Despite the turtles' interference, Shredder escapes when Stockman uses a [[teleportation]] device. Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport, winds up in [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|another dimension]], and meets the alien warlord [[Krang]], who reveals his plans to invade [[Earth]]. He gives Shredder a purple mutagenic compound in exchange for his promise to find three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago which will open a portal to his dimension when united, knowing that Shredder and Stockman have the first piece. Casey tells [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[Chief of police|chief]] Rebecca Vincent what happened to Shredder but is met with disbelief, and decides to go out on his own.  Shredder returns to NY, recruits Bebop and Rocksteady, who also escaped, and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them into powerful animal mutants—a humanoid warthog and rhinoceros. April witnesses their transformation and is able to steal the remaining mutagen vial. Pursued by the Foot, she is rescued by Casey, who uses hockey gear, but the vial is taken into police custody. April then introduces Casey to the turtles, and Raphael and Michelangelo make fun of and pull pranks on him. In the lair, Donatello deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the turtles into humans, enabling them to live normal lives above ground, but Leonardo refuses and insists on keeping it a secret from the others. However, Michelangelo overhears their conversation and tells Raphael, which enrages Raphael and leads to a fierce argument between the brothers. Leonardo benches Raphael and takes Michelangelo off the mission. In the Natural History Museum, Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady find the second piece and steal it before Leonardo and Donatello arrive. Still furious, Raphael recruits Michelangelo, April, Casey, and Vern to break into the NYPD headquarters and retrieve the mutagen. Vern distracts the police while April and Casey retrieve the mutagen, but the Foot arrive ahead of them. In the ensuing battle, the turtles' existence is revealed to the police, who react with fear and hatred, and April and Casey are arrested while helping the brothers escape with the mutagen. Vincent also sees on TCRI's cameras that April stole the mutagen, but Stockman had edited the tape so  only April is seen.  The turtles track Bebop and Rocksteady as they recover the final piece of the device in the rainforests of [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]], and board Rocksteady and Bebop's jet in midair. In the resulting battle, the jet is critically damaged after Rocksteady fires a tank-mounted machine gun in the cargo hold, and crashes into a river. As the Turtles fight Bebop in the river for control of the piece, Rocksteady emerges in the tank and helps Bebop escape with the piece. The turtles return to NY as Shredder and Stockman complete the device and open a portal to Krang's dimension through which his modular war machine, the [[Technodrome]], begins to emerge. Shredder betrays Stockman and his men take him to their headquarters in [[Tokyo]]. When entering the Technodrome, Krang likewise betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him with his collection of other defeated foes.  Seeing no way to reach the Technodrome as the police pursue them, the turtles debate over taking the mutagen to become human and fight openly. While Leonardo agrees, Raphael shatters the vial, realizing they must accept who they are. Upon April's request, Vern recovers the security footage from a hidden TCRI camera disguised as a clock that proves Stockman and Shredder's collaboration and secures April and Casey's release. April arranges a meeting between the turtles and Vincent, and convinces her that they are not enemies and were the ones who defeated Shredder in the first place. With the help of the police, the turtles are able to jump from the [[Chrysler Building]] and confront Krang aboard the still-assembling Technodrome. Although Krang is able to overpower all four turtles easily, they defeat him when Donatello short circuits Krang's robotics body. April, Casey and Vern raid the Foot Clan facility, defeat Bebop, Rocksteady and Shredder's lieutenant [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]] and take control of the device. The turtles are able to hurl the ship's beacon back through the portal, taking Krang and the rest of the Technodrome with it, as April, Casey, and Vern shut the portal down. As he disappears, Krang vows to return stronger for revenge.  A week later, Bebop and Rocksteady are back in custody, while Stockman remains at large. At night, the turtles are honored by Vincent and the NYPD along with April, Casey, and Vern, and given golden keys to the city. Vincent offers to introduce the turtles to the public, allowing them to lead normal lives, but the turtles opt to keep their existence a secret while still helping as they always have. On top of the [[Statue of Liberty]], the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles celebrate their victory over the vanquished Krang.

The man claims he inherited a building with studio apartments from a distant relative, so he became the landlord of the building, renting the apartments out to tenants. The Landlord's penthouse apartment is equipped with screens that allow the Landlord to see inside each apartment, which all have hidden cameras. His tenants include divorcee Mr. Wang Ming-kai and his fourth-grade daughter; Ms. Chen Min-hui, an office worker who uses her body for financial gain and advantages in the workplace; Mr. Chang Kuo-sheng, a physical education teacher who enjoys peeping on his neighbors and is infatuated with Ms. Chen; Bo-yan, a geeky college student obsessed with the idea of having superpowers; and a gay couple, Kuo Li and Ling Hu. The Landlord also claims that a mysterious woman named Ying-ru lives in the apartment directly under his penthouse; however, the police interrogator states that there is no record of anyone named Ying-ru having lived there.   The Landlord spies on his tenants closely, and figures out everyone's routine. However, he finds that Ying-ru has no discernible routine. He lets himself into Ying-ru's apartment to investigate while she is out, but Ying-ru returns unexpectedly, with a man. The Landlord hides, and watches as Ying-ru drugs the man with poisoned tea, then ties him up in the bathtub. However, the Landlord does not alert the authorities, and over the course of several days, Ying-ru tortures the man to death. A few days later, Ying-ru drags a bound woman back to her apartment in a suitcase, and also tortures her to death in her bathtub. The Landlord confronts Ying-ru, who says that she cannot accept a life without change or possibility. Therefore, she is determined to avoid a mundane life, and will shatter whatever boundaries are in her way. The Landlord takes her words to heart, and decides to shatter his tenants' routine lives.  The Landlord tricks Bo-yan into thinking he has teleportation powers, manipulates Kuo Li and Ling Hu into believing the other is being unfaithful, allows Mr. Chang to break into Ms. Chen's room and have sex with her, and adds an aphrodisiac to Mr. Wang's [[mosquito coil]] to give him lustful feelings towards his daughter. The Landlord's antics eventually result in the deaths of Mr. Wang and Ling Hu.   The police interrogator points out places where the Landlord's story does not match the facts. Ms. Chen is actually married to Mr. Wang; Kuo Li and Ling Hu are uncle and nephew, not lovers; Mr. Chang is a gay university professor and thus could not be infatuated with Ms. Chen; and Bo-yan is a model student and is not obsessed with superpowers.   The Landlord's interrogation is then interrupted by a police officer, who has found the Landlord's true identity. The Landlord used to be a police officer named Chang Chia-chun, and had participated in an investigation against Huang Si-lang, a man who had abducted and tortured schoolgirls to death—including Chang's daughter Chang Ying-ru. Huang had avoided serious punishment by claiming insanity. Chang had volunteered to go undercover in the asylum where Huang was being kept, in order to extract a confession, but Chang's superior officer died unexpectedly, which meant no one knew Chang was undercover in the asylum. Chang underwent forced treatments and tortures, which broke his mind. In the asylum, Huang gave Chang the keys to the building where he had killed the schoolgirls, including Chang's daughter, and then committed suicide. After Chang was released, he left the police force, went to the building, and began accepting tenants there. He also imagined his daughter Ying-ru as one of the tenants, and himself as Ying-ru, he tracked down the people who had forcibly treated him in the asylum, and tortured them to death one by one.

Terra Formars (film)
 In the 21st century, overpopulation has become such a problem that scientists begin preparing for the colonization of Mars. Their first steps in the [[terraforming of Mars]] involve seeding the planet with moss in order to absorb the sunlight and create a hospitable atmosphere as well as increase the surface temperature. They also introduce cockroaches in order to spread the moss.  500 years later, in the year 2599, a manned mission is sent to the red planet to clear out the cockroach colony in preparation for the human [[colonization of Mars]]. The crew is an international team of misfits and criminals who are given the opportunity to take part in the mission to gain forgiveness for their crimes.  They enter the new atmosphere aboard the BUGS 2 and find the terraforming to have been successful. They release a roach bomb but when they walk onto the surface they do not find any dead roaches among the moss. Eventually they come upon human-sized anthropomorphic cockroaches wielding clubs that quickly kill two of the humans with their superior speed and physical strength. They determine that these creatures are the result of the accelerated evolution of the original small roaches sent by humans to aid in the terraforming efforts 500 years earlier.  In order to combat the creatures the team is given a range of specially concocted DNA infusions individually designed to give each member of the team special powers. God Lee is eager to accept the infusion, believing that his powers will also give him added bargaining power when he returns to Earth. He walks on the surface of Mars and injects the DNA when he encounters a giant cockroach, transforming into a miidera beetle ([[Pheropsophus jessoensis]]) with the power to emit fire. The cockroach survives the fire blast and kills God Lee.  A giant cockroach climbs on top of the spacecraft breaks through its transparent shell, killing two members of the team as it falls. Captain Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a bullet ant ([[Paraponera clavata]]) with the power to lift one hundred times his own weight and kills the giant cockroach.  Dozens of giant cockroaches swarm into the spacecraft as an expedition team prepares to venture out to grab parts from the BUGS 1, the vessel from the previous mission 10 years earlier, to get the current vessel BUGS 2 into shape to return to Earth. Tezuka injects the DNA and transforms into a [[Steninae|Steninae MacLeay]] then sits on the back of the Mars rover and blows a jet of fire out to propel it across the terrain and kill giant cockroaches at the same time. The captain and Ichiro remain behind to battle the swarm of giant cockroaches. Ichiro injects the DNA and transforms into a sleeping chironomid ([[Polypedilum vanderplanki]]) then removes the oxygen from the vessel to cause the cockroaches to die of asphyxiation.  The expedition team encounters a wave of giant cockroaches but they push through it. A second larger wave approaches and the team fears that Tezuka will not be able to survive this one so Osako volunteers to go out to help him. She injects the DNA and transforms into a black weevil [[Pachyrhynchus infernalis]], an insect strong enough to survive being stepped on by an elephant. Mary joins her, injecting the DNA to become a rainbow stag beetle [[Phalacrognathus muelleri]] with optical camouflage capabilities. They protect Tezuka as he propels the rover through the second wave. The three are thrown from the vehicle and killed by the giant cockroaches as the rover rolls over and enters into autopilot mode to continue its journey.  The remaining members discover and enter the BUGS 1. They find that it was already attempting to send something back to Earth. Outside two more members of the team are shot by giant cockroaches wielding large firearms. It is revealed that Ko Honda, the person who sent the team on this mission, is in communication with the giant cockroaches, who appear to have human intelligence. Keisuke Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a deadly [[Asian giant hornet]] while Jim Muto injects the DNA and transforms into a [[desert locust]] with flying and powerful kicking and jumping abilities. Zhang Ming-Ming injects the DNA and transforms into an [[orchid mantis]], a carnivorous insect. They then discover giant pyramids on the surface of Mars.  Asuka Moriki appears alive aboard the BUGS 2 and transformed into an [[emerald cockroach wasp]], capable of entering the bodies of giant cockroaches and manipulating them. She revives Ichiro with water and they launch the BUGS 2 back toward Earth with a giant cockroach egg on board. The egg hatches and the giant cockroaches inside resist Asuka's manipulation and kill her.  Surprised at the new evolutionary advantage of the giant cockroaches, Ko Honda commands the BUGS 2 to fall back to the surface of Mars. The cockroaches aboard the BUGS 2 call for the assistance of the cockroaches on the surface, who sprout wings and ascend into the sky to soften the landing of the BUGS 2.  Back on the surface they face the remaining members of the human expedition team, all of whom inject another dose of DNA to transform and do battle with the hordes of cockroaches. Over the course of the battle they discover that taking a second dose will create an enhanced transformation with increased powers. Jim injects a third time, causing irreversible transformation. Shokichi attempts to defend him and is injured.  Nanao appears, transformed into a [[silk moth]], and spreads her dust over the cockroach horde. A cockroach fires a weapon at her, causing an explosion that destroys the cockroach horde as well as Nanao. Jim and Shokichi escape the explosion and fly away, only to fall back to the surface where Jim dies in his permanent insect form. Shokichi boards the BUGS 2 again and confronts Ichiro, who saves him from a cockroach attack then suggests that they return to Earth quickly on a two-person spacecraft. As they blast off the cockroaches decide against flying after them.  Back on Earth, Sakakibara fears what the reaction will be when Earth learns of their actions. Ko Honda admits that it would be their downfall and suggests preventing the vessel from returning to Earth and then disappearing from Japanese society. She attempts to shoot him but he stops the bullet and tosses a spider at her which releases a toxic purple spray and kills her.  The film ends with Ichiro and Shokichi in the small vessel discussing their plans for the future. Shokichi plans to build graveyards for Nanao and every member. Besides, he decides to return to Mars.  
Terrifier
  The film opens as a [[Television host|television hostess]] named Monica is interviewing a woman whom she identifies as the sole survivor of the "Miles County Massacre", an event during which the interviewee was brutally mutilated and placed in a coma. Monica asks about the attack, identifying the attacker as Art the Clown, and the interviewee says that she saw Art die. As she speaks, a person (revealed to be Art himself) destroys the television set through which he is witnessing the televised interview. Art dresses himself in clown makeup and assembles a bag of crude weapons with which to begin a night of massacre.   Following the interview, Monica is talking to her significant other on the phone. Monica speaks [[Derogatory|derogatorily]] about the woman she just interviewed and beams at the possibility of being skyrocketed to fame as a result of the interview. She gets a call from someone named Tom, but the caller is inaudible on the other end. Monica sees clothes rustling on a rack and checks for the source of the disturbance, whereupon she is attacked by the mutilated interviewee, who gouges out her eyes and laughs, leaving Monica to die in her own blood.  Two young women, Tara and Dawn, are walking down a sidewalk to their car after an evening of partying. Both having drunk excessively, Tara and Dawn opt to get food to help them achieve sobriety before attempting to drive home. As they are discussing their plans, they spot Art the Clown with his bag of weapons. Dawn pretends to flirt with him, against Tara’s admonitions. While the two look away, Art vanishes.  When Tara and Dawn make it to a pizza restaurant, Tara shuffles through photos, but her phone dies. Dawn receives a text from a guy who wants her to meet him at his apartment, but she assures Tara she won’t indulge him. Seconds later, Art enters the pizzeria and begins making faces at Tara. Tara is spooked by him, but Dawn accosts him and asks to take [[selfies]] with him, which he allows. The owner of the pizzeria asks if Art would like any food, but the clown remains silent, even as Dawn informs him that their selfie has amassed eight likes on social media. Art takes a coin off a table and buys a toy ring for Tara from a vending machine. He places it on her finger and leaves before the pizzeria owner brings the two young ladies their pizza. The pizzeria owner proceeds to expel Art from the building for smearing his feces and urine all over the bathroom.  Tara and Dawn find the tire to their car has been slashed, and they call Tara’s sister, who agrees to pick them up. Tara suggests that the clown may have slashed their tires. An employee at the pizzeria finally finishes cleaning the urine and feces from the bathroom and discovers his manager’s severed head; the eyes and nose have been removed and replaced with candle stubs. Art has crafted the manager’s head into a [[jack-o-lantern]]. The employee flees but discovers that he is locked inside. He reaches for a phone, but Art chops his hand in half using a meat cleaver before stabbing him in the cheek. He proceeds to stab the man in the face numerous times and leaves his mutilated corpse on the floor.   Tara and Dawn continue to argue about whether the clown was dangerous, and Tara says she has to urinate. A friendly exterminator named Mike who’s working in a nearby building lets Tara inside to use the urinal and reveals that the building is infested with rats. Disgusted but resolute, Tara urinates. Meanwhile, Dawn toys with her costume in the car and hears over the radio that the two men working at the pizzeria were murdered and that police are searching for a man who fits the description of the clown she and Tara met earlier. As she realizes this, Art enters her car, and she screams.   Mike begins the decontamination process for the building. Tara, attempting to leave the building, wanders into the basement and encounters a woman who is holding her baby. The woman introduces Tara to her daughter Emily and mistakes Tara for the “new tenant” of the building, a tenant for whom she and her “daughter” (who is revealed to be a plastic doll and not actually a living infant) have apparently been waiting. Tara realizes that the woman is unhinged and makes an excuse to depart the woman’s company.   Tara climbs a set of steps and spots Art, then flees as he pursues her. She hides among the cars in the building’s parking lot, but Art finds her and stabs her in the leg as she tries to escape. She strikes him in the face and attempts to flee, but he catches her and begins to strangle her and try to gouge her eyes. She grabs a scalpel, presumably dropped by Art during the attack, and stabs him with it before finally escaping. She grabs a sharp slab of metal to defend herself as Art begins looking for her. She distracts him by throwing a tiny metal turning that makes a sound far away from her. Meanwhile, Tara’s sister Vicky hears the news about the clown on the radio as she is driving to pick up Tara and Dawn.   Tara reenters the building from the parking lot, where Art is still looking for her, and looks for another exit to the building. Limping, she climbs a set of dingy stairs and finds a phone, though it is disconnected. She spots Mike and tries to get his attention, but Art grabs her before she can get his attention and sedates her. Tara awakens in a basement, where she has been tied to a chair and restrained from speaking or moving her legs with duct tape. Art retrieves a [[hacksaw]] from his bag of weapons and threatens Tara with it before pulling back a curtain to reveal Dawn, suspended upside-down from the ceiling. Art saws Dawn in half as Tara screams in protest. As Art finishes killing Dawn, Tara manages to break her restraints and stab Art in the back, allowing her to escape. She hides and grabs a wooden post as a weapon to use, and Art begins to stalk the grounds for her. She sneaks up on him and beats him with the post until he reveals a gun and shoots her in the leg. Tara tries to crawl away, and he shoots her twice more, then leaves to find more bullets.   The woman from earlier whispers to her “daughter” Emily that she will keep her safe as she hears Tara’s screaming in the distance. Meanwhile, Vicky arrives and texts Dawn, asking for their location. Art impersonates Dawn via text and tells Vicky to come around the back, then proceeds to take a selfie with Dawn’s mutilated corpse. Art returns to Tara and shoots her in the head several more times, in view of the crazy woman.   Vicky complies with the text she received and goes around the back of the building in search of Dawn and Tara. Meanwhile, the crazy woman finds Mike the exterminator to try to warn him, but he doesn’t believe her and leaves. Realizing that she left “Emily” downstairs, the woman runs off in search of her. Mike tries calling his friend, but Art finds him and knocks him unconscious with a hammer.   While Vicky searches for Dawn and Tara, the woman searches for Emily and finds Art rocking the doll. She tries to reason with him for her “child” and embraces him in a motherly hug; he does not harm her. Mike’s friend Will arrives but is unable to reach Mike. Victoria calls Dawn and is similarly unsuccessful but hears Dawn’s phone ring and follows the noise, where she finds Dawn’s mutilated corpse and flees from the room. Vicky hears a scream and enters a basement area to search for Tara, but she instead finds the crazy woman, who has been [[scalped]] and had her chest flayed. Art, wearing the woman’s scalp and chest skin, springs to life and pursues Vicky as she tries desperately to escape. Vicky hides in a metal wardrobe, and Art spots her but leaves when he hears Will the exterminator a few rooms over. Art attacks, stabs in the head, and decapitates Will after he finds the Emily doll. Vicky spots Art as he rides a tricycle around what appears to be the building’s only potential exit and tries to secretively make her escape, but Art restrains her by wrapping plastic across her face to suffocate her. She spots a nail and stabs him in the foot with it, then runs.   Mike reawakens and hears Vicky scream as she finds Tara’s corpse with a sign that reads, “Circus”. Art finds Vicky and strikes her with a crude whip. Mike surprises Art and knocks him unconscious, then takes Vicky to safety and calls the police on a nearby phone to alert them of the situation before trying to escape with Vicky. Art beats the man with a gasoline tank and crushes his head, then begins to strangle Vicky, who manages to stab him in the eye and finally escape the building and hide in a nearby shed after nearly being recaptured. The police arrive as Art drives a truck through the shed and collides with Vicky. The police catch Art as he begins eating Vicky’s face. When he faces the police, Art shoots himself in the head. The officers discover that Vicky is still alive. All of the corpses are brought into a coroner’s office, including Art’s. As the doctor unzips the bag, the lights begin to flicker madly, and Art awakens and chokes the coroner to death. A year later, it is revealed that Vicky ultimately survived her ordeal and is preparing for an interview. As she turns around, it is revealed that she is the disfigured woman from the beginning of the film.  
Tharai Thappattai

Samipulavan was once a great singer and [[thavil]] expert who stopped performing singing and playing thavil because of the indecent content in the folk dances by the younger generation in recent years. He also has stopped talking with his son because of the same reason.Sooravalli ([[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]]) is Sannasi's cousin who loves Sannasi very much and expresses her love often for which Sannasi doesn't responds.Both Sooravalli and Sannasi are in the same group of dancers who go to places for performing.  An innocently dressed Karuppaiah ([[R. K. Suresh]]) often interrupts the male performers in the group wherever they go, to know where the next dance programme would happen.

Theri (film)
 Vijay Kumar ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is an honest and sincere [[Superintendent of police (India)|DCP]] of [[Chennai]]. He takes up a case involving the rape and subsequent death of an [[information technology|IT]] employee Raji. He finds out that the rapist is Ashwin, the son of Labour Minister Vanamaamalai ([[J. Mahendran]]). Vijay kills Ashwin and reveals himself as the murderer to Vanamaamalai, who swears to take revenge on him for killing his son. Meanwhile, Vijay falls in love with a medical student Mithra ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]) and both eventually get married and lead a happy life. But, Vijay's happiness is short-lived as Vanamaamalai, his younger brother Ratnam ([[Azhagam Perumal]]) and their henchmen barge into his house one night and kill Mithra and Vijay's mother ([[Raadhika]]). They even brutally assault Vijay and attempt to drown Vijay's baby daughter Niveditha [[also known as|aka]] Nivi in the bathtub. The dying Mithra manages to rescue Nivi and asks Vijay to take care of her, but not before making him promise that he will quit the police and be a peaceful and loving father to Nivi, following which she dies in Vijay's arms. Vijay fakes his death, changes his name to Joseph Kuruvilla, maintains a low profile and moves to [[Kerala]] with Nivi and his constable friend Rajendran ([[Rajendran]]) to protect Nivi from Vanamaamalai and his gang.  Five years later, Vijay is leading a happy life in Kerala with Nivi (Baby Nainika), who is now in [[kindergarten]], and is running a bakery with Rajendran. As per Mithra's dying wish, he gave up violence and raises Nivi to be non-violent. He meets Annie ([[Amy Jackson]]), Nivi's class teacher, and both become good friends. Annie soon finds out about that Joseph is none other than the "late" Vijay Kumar, but Vijay warns her not to tell Nivi about it. One day, while Nivi is going on an excursion, the brakes of the school bus in which Nivi is travelling fails and the bus plunges into the [[Kerala backwaters|backwater]]. Vijay, with the help of Annie, Rajendran and the local people, manages to rescue Nivi and the other children. He finds out that Vanamaamalai, who has found out that he and Nivi are still alive, is responsible for the bus plunging into the backwater in order to kill Nivi. Enraged, he decides to abandon his non-violent principles and destroy Vanamaamalai and his gang once and for all.  Vijay, posing himself as the "ghost" of Vijay Kumar, starts eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen one-by-one. He first kills an inspector Karikalan ([[Stun Siva]]), who is one of Vanamaamalai's henchmen and was present at the night when Mithra was killed. The police are baffled at the murder as it was done within the police station, and refuse to believe that Vijay committed the murder, since they think that he is dead. The "mysterious deaths" continue, with Vijay pushing Ratnam to his death from a high-storey building being constructed by him. Vanamaamalai is accused of killing Ratnam since both had fallen out, forcing him to go into hiding. Finally, Vijay allows himself to be captured by Vanamaamalai's henchmen in order to enter his hideout. After eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen, Vijay kills him. The police soon arrive at Vanamaamalai's hideout, only to see his dead body hanging from the ceiling, and with nobody else around, his murder also gets sensationalised in the media as a mysterious murder. It is soon revealed that the [[Chennai Metropolitan Police|Chennai]] [[Police commissioner#India|commissioner of police]] Sibi Chakravarthi ([[Prabhu Ganesan]]) is aware that Vijay is alive and secretly re-employs him in the police to reduce crime in Chennai in his "ghost" form, taking advantage of the fear the negative elements of the society have for Vijay, while publicly denying that he is still alive.  A few years later, Vijay, an older Nivi (Divya Saasha), Annie and Rajendran have moved to [[Ladakh]], with Vijay having changed his name to Dharmeshwar. But he continues to work secretly for the CBI, eliminating crime in his "ghost" form.  
Their Finest
 The film is set in [[London]] in 1940. Catrin Cole is summoned to an interview at the Ministry of Information, where she is taken on to write scripts for short information films. Her husband Ellis Cole is a [[war artist]], unable to secure an exhibition and exempted from [[conscription]] due to a [[Spanish Civil War]] leg wound. He is initially accepting of her job, but when she becomes the only wage earner he begins to feel threatened and plans to send her back home to Wales, on the pretence of keeping her safe from the [[London Blitz]].  After a clash with the actor Ambrose Hilliard when he asks for a change to one of her scripts, Catrin's superiors send her to research a news story about twin sisters Lily and Rose sailing their father's boat to take part in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]. She discovers that they had actually been mistakenly reported as reaching Dunkirk. In reality, their boat had had engine trouble just off [[Southend-on-Sea]] shortly after setting off. They had to be towed back into port by a tug that had taken part in the evacuation, although they had taken onboard soldiers from the overcrowded tug. At risk of losing her Ministry job and being sent back to Wales, Catrin lies to her superiors and they agree to make the film as "The Nancy Starling," with Catrin, Tom Buckley, and Raymond Parfitt as the scriptwriters. They begin to write a scenario and, when their superiors discover the deception, convince them to continue the film as fiction rather than a documentary.   Hilliard's [[Theatrical agent|agent]], Sammy, offers him the comedic part of drunken "Uncle Frank." He refuses out of pride, but, after Sammy's death in an air raid, Hilliard is reluctantly won over by Sammy's sister Sophie, who has taken over his [[theatrical agency]]. Hilliard, initially put off by her businesslike approach, is won over as his public image improves.   Initial location photography in [[Devon]] begins, but rapid rewrites prove necessary when an American character is added on the orders of [[Anthony Eden]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], to give the film more appeal in the [[US]]. The Secretary also orders that the character must be played by Carl Lundbeck, a handsome Norwegian-American pilot from an [[Eagle Squadron]], who proved photogenic in [[silent film]] but unable to act in [[talkies]]. The film is saved by judicious editing, as well as by Catrin convincing Hilliard to give Lundbeck acting lessons in return for improvements to Hilliard's part.  Catrin and Buckley develop a combative friendship and affection during the location filming, but delays cause her to miss the opening of her husband's art exhibition. Just before leaving to see the exhibition's final day, Catrin reveals to Phyl that she is in fact Ellis's long-term lover and not his wife, having taken his name for the sake of propriety. She had run away with him; the ring she’s wearing she had purchased herself from [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]]. When visiting London, she surprises Ellis having sex with another woman and breaks up with him, going back to Devon.   She finds Buckley has found out about the nature of Catrin's marriage. He proposes to her, but she refuses and they argue. Soon after arriving in London to shoot for studio scenes  Catrin changes her mind and writes a mock film script of how she now wishes the conversation leading to his proposal had ended, making it clear to Tom that she loves him. She also writes the film's ending for Buckley, who had had a creative block since their argument. He discovers both these pieces of writing and they kiss. A stage hand approaches the couple and asks Catrin to come and answer a query from Hilliard about rewriting his character. Buckley goes to answer it instead of Catrin, but as he turns to look back at Catrin, he is suddenly killed by a falling lighting rig. Several other actors are injured, one of these is Hilliard, who is visited in hospital by his agent Sophie. A love interest between these two also develops and she  suggests he should come and stay with her to convalesce .   In the meantime, filming is delayed and a more US-audience-friendly ending is requested by the war ministry to replace the more restrained and subtle original British one. In addition the penultimate sequence of freeing the boat's propellor has still not yet been filmed. With Hilliard still recovering and Lundbeck now back with his squadron, there seems to be no actor left to play that role. The producers fear the movie will have to be scrapped, but Catrin successfully suggests that one of the twins, Rose, fix the boat's fouled propeller, instead of a male character. She later learns that this scene has made the twin sisters Lily and Rose  who inspired the story, to take up war work.  After Buckley's death  Catrin withdraws from the world of film in shock and grief,. She does not attend its [[premiere]]. A visit from Hilliard to her squalid digs convinces her to return. He is motivated  in part to write him fulfilling future roles such as an idea he has for an ex [[cat burglar]] turned [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|air-raid warden]], having accepted that he can no longer play [[matinee idol]] parts.   Catrin attends a public screening of  "The Nancy Starling"  and enjoys watching the visibly moved audience reactions . She sees that a distant shot of her and happily Buckley together has been added to the ending as a tribute. She heads back to the scriptwriters office, sits down at Buckley's old desk, and starts working on her next film using his old typewriter.

They're Watching
 The crew of a popular home-improvement TV show heads to a remote village in [[Moldova]] to film a follow-up segment about an American homeowner, Becky, who's been transforming a rundown house into an artist's haven. The crew, consisting of Greg, Alex, and newcomer Sarah, meet up with their producer Kate and a Moldovian businessman named Vladimir. While getting some footage of the town, Greg and Sarah sneak into a funeral and attempt to record it, only to be exposed when Kate calls them. A police officer manages to calm the furious crowd before ordering them to leave.  The crew continue filming over the next few days, only to repeatedly find themselves at the receiving end of hostility and suspicion from the locals, including an old woman who sneaks into Sarah's hotel room to chant a prayer at her. Greg and Alex later show Sarah a video of Greg and Vladimir walking into the barn to find Kate having sex with Becky's boyfriend Goran six months ago when the house was purchased. Despite telling Kate the camera was off at the time, they planned on showing it to their boss should Kate try to fire them. Vladimir tells the crew a story about how the village had once been struck by a plague, and they accused a woman who lived alone outside of town of being a witch before burning her at the stake. Becky shows the crew a mural on the wall of her cellar that depicts the story. A dog that Alex was playing with suddenly becomes aggressive and bites him in the arm, only to be gunned down by the police officer shortly after.    After Alex's wound was treated, the crew go to a bar and attempt to make peace with the locals. Everything goes well until a drunk Sarah instigates a fight by shouting "witch". The next day, they rush to finish filming at Becky's home so they can leave Moldova as soon as possible. However, they discover their car has been vandalized and rendered unusable, forcing them to spend the night with Becky and wait for Goran to arrive the next morning. Vladimir offers to walk to town and bring back a taxi. Kate blames Sarah for the vehicle's destruction due her actions the previous night, causing Sarah to reveal that the affair was recorded.  A few hours later, Becky and Sarah discover Vladimir's dead body crucified onto an outdoor furnace, and the crew barricade themselves inside the house. Later that night, Greg tells Sarah his story about his time in Afghanistan (something he was uncomfortable to talk about earlier in the film). While filming at an all-girl school, Taliban local police entered the school and executed a child while forcing Greg to film it. As Greg breaks down in tears, Sarah comforts him and the two then have sex. Later they wake up to find Kate gone. The remaining survivors hear a noise and go out to investigate, only to find Kate nailed to the roof of the barn with her intestines hanging out. Sarah spots Becky's Goran's car in the barn and realizes Becky has been lying about Goran being out. She and Alex later find out Becky knew of Goran's affair with Kate when they spotted her in the video, watching them through the window. They believe Becky killed them as an act of vengeance including Vladimir because he witnessed the encounter and realize Greg could be next because he recorded it. Before they could warn him, the villagers begin breaking into the house, forcing everyone to flee into the basement. There, Sarah uncovers a mural that depicts the production crew's entire stay in Moldova, including their deaths, as well as a demonic Becky surrounded by fire.  Becky reveals herself as a real witch (implied to be the same witch as in Vladimir's story) who brought the crew to Moldova to witness her vengeance on the villagers, and she drinks from a large vat of blood that has the decomposed body of her boyfriend floating in it. She disintegrates Greg, prompting Sarah and Alex to escape into the woods. They run into an angry mob of villagers, and Sarah is murdered by the police officer with an axe to the head. Becky appears and uses her powers to brutally and bloodily kill all of the villagers while a terrified Alex records everything. After everyone is dead, Becky orders Alex to share the footage of her rampage with the world before disappearing. The film ends as a blood-soaked and traumatized Alex wonders how he will explain everything to his boss.  
The Thinning
 In the year 2039, Earth's resources are nearly depleted by overpopulation, and global warming leaves less land for the world population to live. So the [[United Nations]] declares that all nations must cut their population by 5% each year. While some countries remove their elderly, others enforce a [[one-child policy]]. The United States implements a policy known as 10-241 or the "Thinning", a standardized test taken from first grade to twelfth grade. Those who pass continue to the next grade, while those who fail are executed.  The story is set in [[Austin, Texas]] where Laina Michaels ([[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]]) helps Simon (Miles Elliot) study for the Thinning. When he is unable to understand the content, Laina reluctantly sells Simon a small contact lens that will solve the questions on the test for him, and uses the money earned to pay for treatments for her sick mother. On their way to the Thinning exam, Simon is nudged and his contact falls out. The guards usher him into the building, and without the lens, he fails his exam and is ultimately executed. Before the test, Laina meets up with her friend Kellan ([[Calum Worthy]]) whose father is a teacher at their high school.  Blake Redding ([[Logan Paul]]) is the son of the [[Texas governor]] Dean Redding ([[Matthew Glave]]). Although he lives the high life, he is dating a wild girl named Ellie ([[Lia Marie Johnson]]). Blake sneaks out of his house to hang out with Ellie one last time before the Thinning and they sneak off to a hilltop pool. While they are kissing in the car, one of Governor Redding's agents discovers them, and Blake is taken home to be lectured by his father.  Ellie fails the exam the following day, and Blake calls his father in an attempt to free Ellie, but he refuses. Blake causes a diversion and screams at Ellie to run, but she is blocked by students in the hallway and is recaptured. Ellie is executed in the Thinning.  One year later, Laina's mother has died and she is helping her younger sister Corrine (Dimitra Leontidou) study for her first Thinning test. Blake has become cold and distant towards his father since Ellie's death. He makes a video explaining that he will purposefully fail his Thinning exam in order to punish his father for what happened to Ellie and to try to get his father to stop supporting the Thinning. Blake drops his tape in the mail, but his father's agents remove it and have it delivered to him personally. The agents are ordered by Dean Redding to pass Blake regardless of his score. Because Blake and Laina finish the test at the same time, the agents switch Blake's and Laina's scores. Laina fails as a result, and Blake passes. Another student, Sarah Foster ([[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]]), had sex with her teacher the day before the test as motivation for him to alter the test. However, her teacher betrays her and ensures she fails so to hide what he did. Sarah fails the test and is led away with Laina and the other students to be Thinned.  The students that pass go to the Recreation Room, having a party while the "failing" students are being Thinned. Ms. Birch, Laina's teacher, then watches Sarah's teacher lure another girl into having sex with him. Ms. Birch leaves the room and sees Laina in the hall, walking with other students towards a room where they will be executed. Ms. Birch tries to convince a guard that Laina is too smart to fail the test, but the guard is told by his superior, Mason King, that Laina failed the test and must be executed. As Laina is being led away, Ms. Birch presses a key card into Laina's hand so she can unlock the doors and escape.  Blake causes a power outage in the school, allowing Laina to escape using Ms. Birch's key card while the school goes under lockdown. News about the events spreads that parents have no information about what has happened to their students. Because of this, Dean Redding has to reassure to the parents that their students are safe.  After using a key card given to her by her teacher, Laina meets up with Blake and they explore through the vents to avoid the guards.  Meanwhile, all of the teachers are taken to a holding room to be investigated. Ms. Birch flirts with Sarah's teacher and steals his key card. She shows Mason King her key card and is allowed to leave, while Sarah's teacher is kept behind and beaten when he cannot reveal Laina's whereabouts to King.  Blake, disguised as a guard, leaves Laina to go to the Thinning while Laina goes to the server room to check the scores. To her horror, she finds out that test procedures are rigged and have resulted in the wrongful deaths of many students with passing scores, including Ellie, who failed with an 88%. Blake passed with a 15%, and Laina failed with a 98%. Laina sends this information to Keller. Mason King and the DPC track Laina down to the server room using security cameras, apprehend her, and return her to the Thinning, where she finds Blake, who tried and failed to free the students in the Thinning room and is tied up in the corner. The teacher that had sex with Sarah is also executed for giving Laina his keycard.  After photos of the Thinning results are leaked to the media by Kellan, Governor Redding has no choice but to review the results and execute all those who actually failed, including Blake. He also has to free all the students who passed. Laina is greatly upset by this, and after sharing a kiss with Blake, Blake is taken by guards to be Thinned while Laina is dragged outside. Blake and the other failing students are executed. After the school finally lifts the lockdown, Laina is reunited with Corrine outside the school.  Blake and the other supposedly executed students, including Sarah, are shown in a large elevator deep underground, where they see many people working for the company that makes the tablets for the test. As Blake slowly wakes up from the drug that actually put him and the others to sleep instead of killing them, he sees a girl taking off a white mask. The girl is revealed to be Ellie.

Completely beside himself, he stammers and blushes uncontrollably and is unable to help her as the whistle blows and he hastily leaves the platform. Whilst purposely goading him about her beautiful paintwork, Annie and Clarabel give Thomas the idea be similarly painted so he can enter the competition. Thomas abandons them at Maron station and heads to the Steamworks. At the Steamworks, Thomas suggests to Sir Topham Hatt that he have an engine enter the Best Decorated Engine competition. Meanwhile, at the Dieselworks, Diesel devises a trick that involves disguising Den, Dart, and Paxton as trucks, so as to trick Sir Topham Hatt into entering him into the competition ("I'm Full of Surprises").  Back at Maron, Thomas sees Emily and James, who tell him that Sir Topham Hatt has chosen them to painted. He also learns that Ashima took Annie and Clarabel and has been running his branch line in his absence, much to Thomas' anger but Annie and Clarabel soon scold him for abandon them. Thomas finally reveals to Ashima his insecurities about not being good enough to be entered into the competition and she consoles him ("You Can Only Be You"), saying that she finds him perfect just the way he is and that he should just be himself. She suggests he partake in the Shunting competition.  At Knapford Junction, Diesel's trick goes awry when Thomas tries to practice shunting with them. His buffer beam gets damaged in the crash, and his repairs mean he will not be able to go the competition. However, upon learning that Gordon left without his safety valve being properly installed while he was being streamlined, Thomas rushes to the mainland to deliver it to him, despite not being fully repaired.  At The Great Railway Show, Henry loses the strength competition, James and Emily lose the Best Decorated Engine award and, due to not waiting to have his safety valve installed, Gordon's boiler explodes and he loses the race ("The Shooting Star Is Coming Through"). With Percy's insistence, Thomas takes his place in the shunting competition, but sacrifices his win to Ashima in order to save her from crashing into a derailed flatbed. However, the judges decide to award Thomas the win alongside Ashima for good sportsmanship. Sir Topham Hatt and the other Sodor engines are very proud of Thomas.  With The Great Railway Show over, everyone is helping Thomas to try and find Ashima so that he can say goodbye when Sir Topham signals for his engines to return to Sodor. Extremely forlorn, Thomas thinks he has missed his chance until he hears her singing as she fills up with coal. Elated, he invites Ashima to come back to Sodor with him, allowing them to spend some more time together before catching her rail ferry back to India from there ("Be Who You Are, And Go Far"). Meanwhile, Diesel, stuck in a crate, calls for help as sails away on a ship leaving Sodor.

After several hours, she finally appears, accompanied by several of her client's board members and on the way to a meeting. Winfried puts on sunglasses and fake teeth as a playful disguise, and approaches her from the side while hiding behind a newspaper.

In the evening, Winfried accompanies Ines to the reception at the US Embassy, where they meet Henneberg, a German oil company CEO with whom Ines wishes to secure a consulting contract.

After several days, Ines and Winfried are struggling to get along.  Ines is consumed by work-related stress and oversleeps a planned rendezvous with clients, blaming her father for not waking her up. Winfried, feeling alienated and unwanted, leaves in a taxi for the airport. Ines continues with her work as normal, and several days later arranges to meet two female friends at a bar. While Ines and her friends are chatting, a man approaches and introduces himself as "Toni Erdmann". The man is clearly Winfried, disguised in a wig and with false teeth, but Ines does not let on. Ines' two friends politely engage "Erdmann" in conversation, and he explains that he is a "life coach" and consultant visiting Bucharest to attend the funeral of his friend's turtle.  Ines is increasingly frustrated and unfulfilled in her work and personal life, but continues to encounter "Erdmann" sporadically at parties or outside her office. At first Ines is angry with her father, and accuses him of trying to "ruin" her. However, as time goes on she comes to see the worth of her father's interventions in her life, and plays along with the "Erdmann" ruse. "Erdmann" accompanies her on a night out with her work friends, and eventually even comes to a business meeting with her. In turn, "Erdmann" takes Ines to a Romanian family's Easter party, where he forces her into a reluctant and comical, yet powerful, performance of [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[The Greatest Love of All#Whitney Houston version (1986)|Greatest Love of All]]".  After her performance, Ines promptly rushes off.  Back at her flat, Ines is preparing to host a business team-building brunch to celebrate her birthday. She struggles to zip up her tight dress, realizes her shoes don't match, and attempts to change clothes. The doorbell rings. Instead of redressing, or changing her outfit, she opens the door wearing only her underpants. The first guest is her friend Steph, who offers to help her get dressed. Ines refuses, and when the next guest arrives she spontaneously removes her underpants and answers the door naked, telling her guests that her birthday brunch is a "naked party". Each of them reacts differently, with some leaving in disgust while others self-consciously strip off. As the party becomes increasingly awkward, Winfried arrives dressed in a full-body Bulgarian [[kukeri]] costume. The costume frightens Ines' colleagues, but when Winfried leaves the party Ines follows him. Outside in a public park, father and daughter hug and share a moment of intimacy—despite Winfried's impractical and incongruous costume.  Months later, Ines returns to Germany for her grandmother's funeral. She explains that she has quit her job in Bucharest and will shortly begin a new job in [[Singapore]]. While having a chat with Winfried in the garden, Ines grabs the fake teeth from her father's shirt pocket and puts them on.

Enraged, Gristle Jr.’s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef who was in charge of the Trollstice preparation.  20 years later, (at the age of 20) Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the fears and warnings of the gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. A Zen troll named Creek arrives and tells Branch to start being happy instead of being grumpy; Branch refuses. At the party, Branch's fears come true, when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Guy Diamond, Biggie with Mr. Dinkles, Fuzzbert, Smidge, Satin with Chenille, D.J. Suki, Cooper, and Creek (which Poppy tried to rescue). Chef, then takes the kidnapped Trolls back to Bergen Town.  Alone inside the bunker, Branch looks at a bunch of homemade party invitations, indicating that he appreciates Poppy’s offers of friendship and internally would like to have fun with the rest of the trolls. Meanwhile, Poppy goes on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture to Bergen Town, including Branch. But later on, when Poppy gets into trouble, she is saved by Branch, who thinks she will not make it if she goes alone.    Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness Creek apparently get eaten by Gristle Jr. (who is now king), but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive.  While setting Bridget up for the date, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got killed while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef. Branch's guilt and shame over his grandmother's death caused his color to turn from blue to gray.  After Poppy comforts him with a hug, Branch decides to help Bridget and the trolls, though he still refuses to sing. Bridget, disguised under the name of 'Lady Glitter Sparkles' gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a roller rink and arcade restaurant and Gristle Jr. asks her to be his "plus one" at Trollstice. Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle.  Having helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef and are shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll village and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy becomes sad after she had been betrayed by her friend, loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray.  Branch sings “True Colors” for the princess to cheer her up, and also confesses his affection for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors, returns Branch's feelings, and they both end up restoring all the trolls' colors including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy wishes to return the favor, and with Branch and her friends, shows the Bergens that Bridget was Lady Glitter Sparkles and that they too, can find happiness within themselves.  Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart that is sent rolling out of Bergen Town. Chef is set on fire with Creek, who was still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town and renewing the life of the troll tree. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a hug.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Chef and Creek's cart stops rolling. Chef prepares to eat Creek herself, but they soon find out they are on top of a monster, who opens his mouth and eats them.  
Triple 9
 In [[Atlanta, Georgia]], criminals Michael Atwood ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]), Russell Welch ([[Norman Reedus]]), and his brother Gabe ([[Aaron Paul]]), along with two corrupt cops, Marcus Belmont ([[Anthony Mackie]]) and Franco Rodriguez ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]), rob a bank to retrieve a [[safe deposit box]]. The box contains information that could overturn the recent conviction of a [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish-Russian Mafia]] boss. When Michael brings the safe deposit box to the boss' wife, Irina ([[Kate Winslet]]), she withholds their reward money and gives Michael and his crew another mission, which involves breaking into a government office and stealing more data on her husband. To convince them to take the job, the mafia tortures and then dumps a mortally wounded Russell off in front of the crew, forcing Michael to mercy-kill Russell in front of them, traumatizing Gabe.  The group decides to go forward with the job. As they think of ways they can pull it off, Marcus and Franco suggest a Triple 9 scenario, which involves an officer down call that sends all of the police to the location of the incident, with Marcus nominating his new partner, Chris Allen ([[Casey Affleck]]). Marcus tries to befriend Chris as they go out on calls together. During one call, Chris attempts to question a local gang member, Luis Pinto ([[Luis Da Silva]]), about a gang-related homicide, only for Luis to attack Chris before being detained for his actions. Chris's uncle, Jeffrey Allen ([[Woody Harrelson]]), is a Sgt. Detective in the police force working on the bank robbery case. Jeffrey gets a lead and discovers that Gabe is one of the people involved in the bank robbery. Gabe, still grieving over his brother, tries to stop the heist from happening by following Chris and Marcus around and telling Chris, but is stopped both by Michael and Jeffrey.  On the day of the heist, Marcus takes Chris to an abandoned housing project to meet an informant with information on their homicide case. As they walk around the building, Marcus slips away, and Luis comes in and tries to find Chris. Chris bumps into Gabe who tries to warn him that he is going to die. Luis then charges in and tries to shoot Chris but hits Gabe. As Luis runs away, Chris confronts a critically wounded Gabe. Before Gabe can say anything, Marcus comes in, triggering a shootout between the two. Gabe is killed, and Marcus is shot in the head. Fearing Marcus is dead, Chris makes the Triple 9 call. Thinking his nephew is the officer down, Jeffrey rushes to the scene. Meanwhile, Michael and Franco break into the government office and steal the information with little police disruption. Luis flees the projects and is later shot dead by SWAT after barricading himself in a nearby home.  In the aftermath, Marcus survives but is in critical condition. Michael meets with Irina and her henchmen for the exchange. He has a gift for his son to give to him upon their reunion. Irina gives him the money but does not bring Michael's son as she had promised to earlier. Michael and Irina were earlier revealed to have a family relationship: the mother of Michael's son is Irina's sister; nonetheless, Irina refers to Michael as a "monkey." After being beaten by her henchmen, Michael walks back to his car and triggers a bomb that was wired into his gift, killing Irina and her thugs. As he drives away, Michael is pulled over by Franco, who kills him and steals the money. After investigating Luis's belongings at the morgue, Chris finds a note in Luis's wallet, which contained the location where Marcus took him the day of the shooting. Chris later finds out that Marcus met Luis the day of the shooting, letting him know where to kill Chris. Angered, Chris visits an unconscious Marcus to try to get answers but is interrupted by Franco, who invites Chris back to the station to get his account of the shooting. As the two head to the car, Chris receives a call from Jeffrey, who tells him that Franco has been cleaning house and that he might be next. Chris, clutching his holstered weapon, stops and tells Franco that he’ll meet him at the station. Franco, realizing Chris has been tipped of his involvement, agrees to meet Chris there. As the two head out to their respective cars, Jeffrey is seen inside Franco's car, and they both shoot each other when Franco takes a seat in his car. Franco is killed, and Jeffrey is shot in the abdomen. As Chris makes a Triple 9 call, Jeffrey calmly pulls a joint and smokes it. Jeffrey's fate is left unknown.

True Memoirs of an International Assassin
  Sam Larson ([[Kevin James]]) is a lonely accountant who plans to publish a fictional novel, ''Memoirs of an International Assassin'', which is about an assassin who goes about murdering people for money, but is having trouble with his ending, especially the signature line his main character says at the end of the book. While playing pool with his good friend Amos ([[Ron Rifkin]]), Amos tells Larson about a mysterious assassin, known as the Ghost, who supposedly died in a helicopter crash, but some say he jumped before the helicopter crashed. Inspired, Larson finishes his novel with that ending, despite Amos's objections.  His novel finished, Larson has trouble finding someone to publish his novel, but just as he is about to give up, he gets a call from a virtual publisher, Kylie Applebaum ([[Kelen Coleman]]), who wants to publish his book. Larson agrees, but a couple of days later, he finds his book's title changed to a nonfictional memoir called ''True Memoirs of an International Assassin''. He confronts Applebaum about this, and she reveals that she changed it to get more copies sold. He finds himself ostracized from Amos, who feels that Larson betrayed him by revealing information that he didn't want revealed, and tells Larson to stop writing other peoples' stories and start living his own.  After Amos confronts him, Larson tells Applebaum that he cannot be this person anymore, but Applebaum reveals that she got Larson an interview with [[Katie Couric]]. Larson initially isn't sure, but decides to do it after Applebaum mentions that she has ten other authors who want this opportunity. At the interview, Couric reads a passage that indicates that Larson was addicted to death (which is why he became an assassin). At this, Larson becomes uncomfortable, and promptly flees the scene, and returns home. Soon after, however, he gets kidnapped and sedated.  When Larson wakes up, he is greeted by El Toro ([[Andy García]]), a terrorist who wants to start a revolution by murdering the President of Venezuela, Miguel Cueto ([[Kim Coates]]),  (thus revealing Larson is in Venezuela), and El Toro wants Larson to do it himself, since he believes him to be the Ghost. El Toro warns Larson that if he wasn't the Ghost, he would kill him slowly, thus prompting Larson to lie about him being the Ghost. Larson then asks El Toro to get him a reconnaissance in Caracas, and El Toro tells his second-in-command, Juan (Maurice Compte), to take him there. At the reconnaissance, Juan reveals that he suspects Larson not to be the Ghost, and threatens to kill him. Larson then escapes while he is distracted.  Larson then tells the nearest police about the situation, and asks to take him to the Embassy. However, there the police reveal their true intentions, being the henchmen of the gangster Anton Masovich ([[Andrew Howard]]), and demands money. Larson then tries to call Applebaum, but believing that he is just playing with her, Applebaum hangs up. Before the police can kill him, Larson is saved by a DEA agent, Rosa Bolivar ([[Zulay Henao]]).  After they escape, Bolivar asks Larson to talk with Masovich to clear up the situation. There, Masovich asks Larson to kill El Toro, as he would be affected should the president be killed. Larson pretends to agree after seeing Masovich's violent behavior. Meanwhile, CIA agents William Cobb ([[Rob Riggle]]) and Michael Cleveland (Leonard Earl Howze) meet with the president and General Ruiz ([[Yul Vazquez]]) in regards to Larson, and they agree to meet with him.  Larson and Bolivar then talk about the situation at a restaurant, but before they can do anything, Juan, who caught up with Larson, captures and takes him hostage. Juan and Larson then talk about the situation regarding the President. However, Larson tries to get Juan to steal a truck, but in the process, he gets captured by General Ruiz. General Ruiz then talks about the situations and how they are unnecessary, and asks Larson to kill Masovich, as he has too much power, else Larson will be tried and executed for his involvement with killing the president, prompting Larson to agree. Cobb and Cleveland, who noticed this, decides to kill him indirectly, by filling in Masovich, who goes into a violent rage when he hears that Larson betrayed him.  Larson meets Bolivar and fills her in with the situation. Bolivar then reveals that she always wanted to kill Masovich, as the DEA had written her off thanks to him. She then comes up with the plan that will humiliate both Masovich and the president, but Larson initially refuses, stating he just wants to go home. They are then promptly attacked by Masovich's minions, and they escape, but not before Sam gets shot in the shoulder. After they find a safe place, Bolivar changes her mind about the plan, but Larson is ready to do it. Larson then finds that Bolivar is worried about him, and Bolivar reveals she lost 5 partners in 2 years (though she claims that she was messing with him).  Larson and Bolivar then return to El Toro's hiding place, and they get an army to infiltrate the inauguration ball of the president, which will be when they murder the president. When they reach there, Ruiz reminds Larson to kill Masovich, not the president, and Juan, disguised as a waiter under El Toro's orders, reminds him of El Toro's orders. Masovich then spots Larson, and attempts to kill him, but Bolivar distracts him through dancing, while Larson meets with the president. After they dance, Bolivar and Masovich fight upstairs, while Larson forces the president to reveal his plan to kill Masovich. However, the president finds out about the plan, but reveals he is depressed and hates his life. Larson tries to tell him to make a difference despite this, which will make him happy, but the president decides it is too late for him, and promptly kills himself. Meanwhile, the fight between Bolivar and Masovich reaches the president's office, and ends with Masovich getting killed by Bolivar.  Larson and Bolivar then get arrested by General Ruiz, but instead of going to jail, they are sent back to El Toro's hideout, and Juan apologizes to Larson for not believing him. Bolivar is then hired for the revolution by El Toro, and El Toro brings Larson by himself. However, once alone, El Toro, knowing Larson knows too much, prepares to kill him, but is interrupted by Cobb and Cleveland, who is asked to take him home. Larson is happy to go home, but is worried about Bolivar. At the airport, Larson escapes and tries to save Bolivar, who is held captive by El Toro for information. Just as Juan is about to kill her, Larson appears armed.  Larson convinces Juan to take his side, and they fight El Toro and attempt to free Bolivar. However, they are defeated, and El Toro takes Bolivar captive. Juan convinces Larson not to give up, and Larson follows them into the helicopter. After a brief struggle, Larson finally kills El Toro, who remarks that he always knew Larson was the Ghost. Larson and Bolivar then jump out of the helicopter and lands in the water. They are then cornered by General Ruiz, who plans to take over the country, but first he needs to kill Larson and Bolivar. General Ruiz is then killed by Amos, who is revealed to be the real Ghost, and promptly disappears.  Six months later, Juan is now the president of Venezuela, with Bolivar watching his speech in regards to his experiences. Cobb and Cleveland, who are watching the speech as well, remarks that he will be hard to take down, and that they hate the Ghost. Larson has become a bestselling author, having released his new book. At an interview with Katie Couric, Couric asks him whether the book was real, and Larson denies this, saying it is a work of fiction.

However, she has no evidence to prove it. Yeon-hong then breaks into Min-jin and Mi-ok's secret hideout and finds money hidden away in a bag. When Mi-ok shows up, Yeon-hong captures her and forces her to tell the truth about Min-jin's murder.   Mi-ok finally reveals that she and Min-jin became best friends after discovering they both shared the same taste in music. Min-jin then starts to suspect their teacher is having an affair. They then give the teacher a car air freshener with a hidden camera inside, which records the teacher having wild sex in her car with her secret lover. Min-jin and Mi-ok then uses the recordings to blackmail their teacher for exam papers. Since Mi-ok's family is poor, Min-jin then blackmails the teacher for money. One night, the two girls are out playing in the rain when a car runs over Min-jun while Mi-ok is hiding in the bushes. While the driver exits the car to take a photo of Min-jun's dead body, Mi-ok sneaks into the car and runs over the killer as well. She then carries Min-jin's body away and buries it in the woods after taking the contract killer's phone with her. Mi-ok is sure her teacher arranged for her and Min-jun to be killed. Yeon-hong takes the phone and is shown hatching a plan to kill the person who sent the contract killer to murder her daughter.  Later that day over dinner, Yeon-hong tells her husband that although No Jae-son most likely had nothing to do with their daughter's death, he must use the sympathy vote to win the election. Later that night, while her husband is celebrating his victory, Yeon-hong calls up the person who hired the contract killer and forces them to come to the scene of the crime or else she will leak the sex video onto the net. The person then shows up and it is not the teacher, but Jong-chan. Through flashbacks, we see that the man the teacher was having an affair with is none other than Jong-chan. After Min-jin blackmailed her teacher, the teacher told Jong-chan she is being blackmailed by two of her own students but does not tell him it is his own daughter and her best friend. Jong-chan unwittingly hired the contract killer to murder his own daughter. Yeon-hong ties her husband up and beats him in anger. She then uploads his sex video onto the internet as he watches helplessly.

Udta Punjab
  The film opens with three Pakistani youth across the Punjab Pakistan border throwing packets of drugs across to India, for it to be picked up later.  Tejinder "Tommy" Singh ([[Shahid Kapoor]]), also known as "Gabru" among his fans, is a young Punjabi musician who lives a luxurious lifestyle assisted by his successful music career. Together with an ostentatious crew that is led by Tayaji ([[Satish Kaushik]]) and cousin Jassi ([[Suhail Nayyar]]), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of cocaine. Tommy is popular for his adrenaline-pumping songs, with lyrics that often glorify violence and drug-addiction. However, his addiction soon costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans,  who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to commit murder.  Realizing that his songs have adversely and negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, Tommy engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.  Working on the farm is a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] migrant worker named Kumari Pinky ([[Alia Bhatt]]), frequently called ''Bauria''. Bauria's dreams of playing national level hockey for the country were shattered, so she came to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to work as a labourer. Bauria works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug peddling. One night, while walking around the farm, she finds a suspicious packet, one actually thrown from across the border. She soon realizes that it is some kind of drug, and resolves to sell it. Her search for a potential buyer lands her in great trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the heroin. She is chased and eventually captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep Bauria at their farm house where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs and prostituted to several men - including police officers from the local police force. Some weeks later, Bauria manages to escape from the house.  In the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]) is a junior policeman attached to the town's station, who knows about the smuggling of drugs his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli (Prabhjyot Singh), overdoses on Chaand (a locally-made drug) and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. She educates Sartaj about the drug problem and partly accuses him for his brother's state. Together, they decide to find the root cause of the problem. Balli is admitted in Preet's drug rehabilitation centre against his will.  Appearing before his audience in a concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead his/her life, his fans try to admonish him, and start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd. Making a run out of the concert to save himself from the crowd's angst, Tommy goes and hides inside a dilapidated structure. There he meets Bauria and together they start sharing their stories. However, the next day, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang which had kept her imprisoned. Tommy learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus he created at the concert. He sets out to find Bauria after realising his true feelings for her. He finds that she is kept in a farmhouse and goes there.  Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh,  who has flourished with the support of [[Member of parliament|MP]] Maninder Brar. Sartaj and Preet go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission, to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj soon develops feelings for her and asks her out, which she reciprocates. However,the same night,while returning home, Preet sees a manic Balli, who was being treated against his wish at her rehab center trying to escape. On trying to stop him,  she gets stabbed accidentally by Balli. The policemen who come to investigate her homicide, including Sartaj's senior officer Jhujar Singh ([[Manav Vij]]), also come across the report made by Sartaj and Preet. Since he is Sartaj's mentor and close friend, Jhujar decides to protect Balli by sending Balli underground for a while and creating a scene of murder for gain. But he gets infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket, and calls Sartaj at the site.  In the presence of the local drug mafia in their farmhouse  (where Bhuria is kept confined), a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar,who is also a key member in the drug racket, about the report. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy, who is on the run from the police and has been searching for Bauria, enters the enclosure. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Sartaj grabs Jhujar's service pistol and shoots the whole gang except Tommy. He then rushes inside the house to free his brother Balli, who is being held captive. He frees Balli, while Tommy goes upstairs and helps Bauria escape from her captors. Finally, as Tommy and Bauria run off, Balli kneels down and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.  In a later scene it is seen that the government has issued an inquiry into the activities of Maninder Brar and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. And in a scene in Goa,amidst his crew members enjoying at the beachside,  Tommy calls Kumari/Bauria from his crew member's phone to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters "Mary Jane".  
Under the Shadow
 Amidst the terrors of war-torn post-revolutionary [[Tehran]] in the 1980s, former medical student Shideh is barred from resuming her studies because of her involvement with student leftist groups. Upon returning home, she gets rid of most of her old medical textbooks, but keeps [[Arthur Guyton#Textbook of medical physiology|a book of medical physiology]] given to her by her deceased mother. The war intensifying, Shideh elects to stay in the city with her daughter Dorsa despite the protests of her husband Iraj, a doctor who is called by the military and assigned to an area of heavy fighting. Iraj wants Shideh to stay with his parents in a safer part of the country, but Shideh refuses. Dorsa is upset to see her father go, and Iraj promises her that her favorite doll, Kimia, will protect her.   A new boy moves in with the neighboring Ebrahimi family, who are his cousins; his parents were killed in an attack. During a shelling, he whispers something into Dorsa's ear and hands her a charm to ward off evil spirits. Dorsa tells Shideh that the boy told her about the legend of the [[Jinn|Djinn]], and that the charm would protect her, though Shideh throws it away. Shideh visits Mrs. Ebrahimi, who informs her that the boy has been mute ever since the death of his parents. Dorsa develops a fever and has a slew of nightmares, and Shideh is also haunted by bad dreams.  During another shelling, a missile strikes their building, and an upstairs neighbor dies of a heart attack. Kimia goes missing in the commotion, and Dorsa insists that someone took her. Her behavior also becomes disturbed and erratic; she insists there is a strange presence in the house, and repeatedly tries to get into the upper floor, believing that Kimia is there. The daughter of the deceased neighbor visits Shideh and claims that her father was unaffected by the missile impact but she found him looking terrified, as if he had seen a ghost.  The neighbors gradually begin to leave to escape the fighting. Mrs. Ebrahimi warns Shideh that djinns may possess humans, and they will steal a beloved personal item of their victims. The Ebrahimis leave too, until Dorsa and Shideh are the only two inhabitants left in the building. Shideh's nightmares get worse, and her own items start to go missing. Her nightmares escalate to visions involving a floating [[chador]] that moves like a ghost. Dorsa admits to seeing the same apparitions, but claims that the ghostly woman in the chador wants to help her find Kimia. Shideh finally wants to leave to go to her husband's parents, but Dorsa refuses to leave until Kimia is found. Shideh receives a call seemingly from Iraj, but the caller begins to berate her for being a poor mother, as the djinn did. Shideh finds a mutilated Kimia, which upsets Dorsa. Shideh repairs Kimia with tape, but when they are about to leave, another air raid siren goes off.  Shideh promises Dorsa that they will escape, but while going down to the shelter, she hears Dorsa's screams. She panics, believing that the Dorsa she left with is another apparition, and returns home to find Dorsa. She sees what appears to be Dorsa under their bed, but when trying to rescue her, she discovers with horror that it is an apparition. Escaping to the shelter, she finds the real Dorsa. The two are attacked by the chador apparition, which separates the two before Shideh manages to find Dorsa. She urges Dorsa back up the stairs but is trapped when the floor begins to suck her down. Dorsa rescues Shideh and the two escape to the car, and Shideh drives them to Iraj's parents. However, it is revealed that Kimia's detached head was left behind and Shideh's medical textbook is still in the djinn's possession, implying they may still be harassed.

Both species are searching for [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]]: the vampires seeking justice for the deaths of [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]] and [[Marcus Corvinus/version 2|Marcus]], and the Lycans, led by Marius, intending to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids.  Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, says she wants Selene to be granted clemency so that she can train the Eastern Coven's neophyte [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealers]]. To that end, Semira enlists Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council. Thomas succeeds and Selene arrives at the Eastern Coven with David. Semira has her ally and lover Varga poison Selene, then slaughter the Death Dealers and blame Selene for it. Once Selene is under arrest, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to gain Selene's power. Thomas and David try to rescue Selene, but they're attacked by Semira and Varga. They kill Thomas, but not before he's able to hold them off long enough for David and Selene to escape.  The pair seeks refuge with the Nordic Coven. They are pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. Selene and David arrive at Var Dohr, the stronghold of the Nordic Coven. Their Elder Vidar reveals that David was the son of the High Elder [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]], making him the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven.

Marius sounds the retreat for his troops and Selene, wishing to pass on to the sacred world, slides herself under the now-broken ice of the lake.  Upon Alexia's return to the Eastern Coven's castle, she informs Semira of the events at the Nordic Coven. Semira kills her, revealing she knew of Alexia's treachery, and wanted Alexia to lead the Lycans to the Nordic Coven for her own ends. David returns to the Eastern Coven and presents himself as its rightful heir. Semira is arrested by none other than Varga, whose ultimate loyalty is to the rightful leadership of the coven. She is subsequently imprisoned in the dungeons.  The coven comes under attack by Marius and his forces. The Lycans blow holes in the castle's walls, letting in sunlight, killing some vampires. David continues fighting, only to find himself face to face with Marius. Selene suddenly reappears, in a Nordic appearance and coat over her normal Death Dealer uniform. It is revealed that the Nordic Coven revived her through their passing to sacred world ritual and in doing so new abilities like enhanced speed are enabled. She swiftly begins dispatching the Lycans, as the rest of the Nordic Coven, led by Lena, join the fight.  While Selene is making her way through the castle, the guards in the dungeons are killed by Semira, who then escapes from her cell. Selene and David find Marius, but David is waylaid by Semira. As Marius and Selene's fight continues, a drop of Marius's blood lands on Selene's lips. She is suddenly flooded by a series of blood memories in which Marius finds [[Michael Corvin|Michael]]. She sees Marius capturing Michael and slitting his throat in order to collect his blood and consume it. Believing that Michael is dead, she bites her own wrist, using her own blood memories of the time she has spent with Michael, Eve, and David. Although Marius has transformed, Selene rips out his spine, killing him instantly. Semira drank Selene's blood that she collected earlier and gained immunity to sunlight, but David manages to kill her while she was distracted with glee from the sunlight falling on her. He shows Marius's severed head to the Lycans, and forcefully tells them to retreat.  In the aftermath, Selene, David, and Lena are chosen as the new Elders. It is revealed that after being resurrected at the Nordic Coven, Selene was reunited with Eve, who has been following her mother through their telepathic link.  
A United Kingdom
 The film is based on the true story of the heir to the throne of [[Bechuanaland]], [[Seretse Khama]] of the [[Bamangwato]] people, who studies law in London immediately after [[World War II]]. There he meets a white woman, [[Ruth Williams Khama|Ruth Williams]], whom he eventually marries, despite the protests of both their families and opposition from the [[British government]], which is concerned about relations with [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] and the stability of the entire region of southern Africa. The National Party government in South Africa fears that the marriage of a black king to a white woman in neighboring Bechuanaland will inspire unrest, and pressures the British government to end the marriage.  Khama's uncle, the Regent, demands that he end his marriage to Ruth, and marry a Bamangwato princess, a demand that Khama rejects. The British administrators use the dispute between the King and the Regent to argue that the marriage of Seretse and Ruth is "causing" unrest in Bechuanaland. Seretse discovers that the British have allowed a US mining corporation to prospect for precious stones, and is eager to make sure that, if anything is found, the exploitation of the country's resources should solely be done by the people of Bechuanaland.  Seretse wants his people to support him as king and manages to win their backing, while the British government decides to exile him from his own country. Meanwhile, Ruth has their baby in Bechuanaland and becomes accepted by the local people by "walking the road with them". When the British want to proclaim an administrator to the Bechuana people instead of their king, the tribe refuses to convene a meeting to do so. The prime minister, Clement Attlee, tells the backbencher Tony Benn, that Britain needs gold from South Africa and he is willing to pay any price such as attempting to destroy the Khamas' marriage to stay in the good graces of South Africa. During this time, diamonds are found and Seretse makes sure that the British government publicly declares that the [[Bechuana|Bechuana people]] have the sole right to exploit these resources.  [[Churchill]] promises, if he were elected in the 1951 general election, to lift the exile on Seretse, however, after his victory he turns the five-year ban into a lifelong one. In London, powerful people start supporting his claim, and he also receives support from the US government. Meanwhile, [[apartheid]] develops in South Africa and begins to overshadow Bechuanaland as well. Eventually, with the help of pressure from local people, he is allowed to return to Bechuanaland and negotiates its [[Botswana#Independence|independence]] from the British. Seretse shows his uncle a leaked British government document showing he is qualified to be king, and that only opposition from South Africa is motivating the actions of the British government.  Post-ending text reveals that Seretse oversees the creation of present-day [[Republic of Botswana|Botswana]], and that [[Ian Khama|his son]] subsequently becomes the country's fourth elected [[President of Botswana|president]] in 2008.  It is revealed that Ruth and Seretse are buried side by side on a hilltop overlooking [[Serowe]] village, where they had lived for the remainder of their lives.

Ramanathan, who has little luck with love, yearns for one college student who seems to be the ex-girlfriend of Lenin Vijay. One night, the four friends get very drunk and accidentally annoy some of the caste fanatics.

USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage
 In 1945, the [[Portland-class cruiser|''Portland''-class heavy cruiser]] , commanded by [[Charles B. McVay III|Captain Charles McVay]] ([[Nicolas Cage]]), delivers parts of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] that would later be [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|used to bomb Hiroshima]] during the ending of World War II. While patrolling in the [[Philippine Sea]], on July 30 in 1945, the ship is torpedoed and sunk by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-58 (1943)|I-58]]'', taking 300 crewmen with it to the bottom of the Philippine Sea, while the rest climb out of the ship and are left stranded at sea for five days without food and water in shark-infested waters.  With no hope for five days, most of the remaining crew-members are eaten by sharks or die of [[salt water poisoning]] by drinking seawater (which also caused some of those injured to die from infectious wounds). Others swim off from their groups after hallucinating of a non-existent island, never to be seen again. On the 5th day, the surviving crew are rescued by an airplane pilot who spots them by chance and calls for a rescue. Only 316 survive the disaster. Looking for a scapegoat for their own gross negligence, the [[US Navy]] court-martials and convicts Captain McVay for "hazarding his ship by failing to [[zigzag]]", despite overwhelming evidence supporting McVay (such as even having the former captain of the IJN's ''I-58'' submarine to testify for the trial, which proved McVay to be not at fault). It ends with Captain McVay finally committing suicide years after the tragedy after being harassed and tormented with phone calls and mail from angry and grief-stricken relatives of the deceased crew-members, as well as the media (mostly in the form of newspapers, which placed the blame on him for the ship's sinking).  In the movie's postscript they show President Clinton exonerating Captain McVay of all charges on October 30, 2000.  In a [[subplot]], two childhood friends, ''Indianapolis'' diver Brian Smithwick and a crew member known as D'Antonio (Mike), fall in love with the same woman without the other knowing. D'Antonio purchases an engagement ring before the trip to Tinian to propose to the girl who tells D'Antonio before the trip that she is expecting their first child. During a brawl involving two of the crewmen, D'Antonio loses the ring and one of the crew members, Deuce, steals it. After the ship is destroyed, Smithwick and D'Antonio spend the next few days in the sea with the rest of the crew where D'Antonio succumbs to massive leg injuries received in a shark attack. Smithwick is given the engagement ring by Deuce. Smithwick proposes to D'Antonio's fiancée Clara to help her raise her child and she accepts his proposal.  While the credits roll, two Navy sailors recount the sharks in the waters and real rescue footage is shown along with many still shots of lost sailors.

Although Jarnail claims innocence, he is still arrested, and Aman's family breaks ties with him. Jarnail believes that Aman's brother is responsible for his arrest, but Aman doesn't believe him. Aman came to the jail today to tell him that her marriage is fixed, and she will be married tomorrow, on Vaisakhi. Tarsem then tells Jarnail that they can escape the jail, but Jarnail, who knows that Tarsem has tried escaping multiple times, doesn't believe him.<br />  Later, Tarsem tells his story. Prior to his arrest, Tarsem sold toys on his bike, and his only joy was his son. While he wanted his son to go to school, he wasn't worried about his son's grades, only that his son was happy. One day, while walking his son back from school, a police officer almost runs over Tarsem's son on his scooter. Tarsem, angry at the officer, slaps him. He is arrested for attacking an officer. While his original time in prison was supposed to be for a few months, his multiple attempts at escaping(including pole-vaulting over the walls, have failed, and have caused him to increase his jail time. Tarsem tells Jarnail that his only reason for escaping is so he can see his son again. Jarnail asks Tarsem how he plans to escape. Tarsem explains that he dug a tunnel in the jail's garden, and that he has a copy of each cell block's keys. <br /> That night, Jarnail and Tarsem escape through the tunnel, and steal two guys' shirts and car. Jarnail drops Tarsem off at his house, and Jarnail goes to Aman's house. Aman and Jarnail elope. Tarsem goes to see his grandparents, but they are all unhappy to see him, as he tells that he escaped, when he had only one month left. Tarsem then sees son, but when his son unwilling to come with him, Tarsem is hurt. He then stays outside the house, hoping his son will forgive him. <br /> The next morning, Jalaur is preparing the jail for a [[Vaisakhi]] Celebration, and the Jail Minister is coming. He also asks for the constables to bring Jarnail and Tarsem to his office, but they are nowhere to be found. <br />  Jarnail and Aman make a stop, where Jarnail wants to call Jalaur, as he doesn't want Jalaur's job to suffer for his and Tarsem's escape. Jalaur answers, in a good mood, although surprised that Jarnail is calling him. Jalaur tells Jarnail that he has a surprise for him: On Vaisakhi day, those who were arrested for minor crimes are to be released, which includes Jarnail and Tarsem. Jarnail tells Jalaur that they escaped through a tunnel last night. Jalaur then tells Jarnail to find Tarsem and get back to the jail via the tunnel as soon as possible, or they will all be in trouble. Jalaur then tells the constables to keep Jarnail and Tarsem's escape a secret, and find Tarsem's tunnel. They do, but fill it with sand before telling Jalaur, who is now more upset.<br />  Jarnail and Aman go back and find Tarsem, and show him today's newspaper. He shows it to his son, where it shows that Tarsem and Jarnail are to be officially released. Tarsem then leaves, saying he'll be back once his name is cleared. <br />  Tarsem and Jarnail first stop at Baljit house. At first, Jarnail talks to Baljit, as he wants Baljit to hide Aman from her family until his name is cleared. However, Aman calls Jarnail back when Baljit is not looking, as Aman is engaged to Baljit. The three then head back to the prison, while avoiding Aman's brother. <br />  Meanwhile, Tarsem's brother-in-law, Bheem, sees in the newspaper about Tarsem's release, and goes to the prison to greet him. However, after finding out that Tarsem escaped, Jalaur has Bheem take one of his constables to Tarsem's favorite places, so that they can find Tarsem. <br />  As Tarsem and Jarnail are driving back to the prison, they are chased by a police officer, along with the people that they stole the car from. Fortunately, Bheem and the constable are nearby and stall the constable.<br />  Meanwhile, Jalaur must stall a pair of news-reporters(one who is the niece of the Jail Minister), who want to interview Tarsem and Jarnail. After trying to get them to eat sweets and snacks, as well as give them a tour of the place, Jalaur decides to scare them by giving them two other prisoners to interview, who are also named Tarsem and Jarnail, but have only been recently been put in prison for 1st-degree murder.<br />   As Tarsem and Jarnail are getting close, they are soon stopped by Baljit, Baljit's father, and some thughs. He tells him that he is here for Aman, as they are getting married today, and reveals that he wanted to marry Aman before. After Jarnail's first marriage proposal broke, Baljit sent his own proposal, which broke after Aman agreed to marrying Jarnail. Baljit angry, decided to hide drugs in Jarnail's milk cans, and told the police officer to check the cans when Jarnail came by. Baljit won't allow Jarnail to pass unless he leaves Aman. Jarnail, with help from Tarsem then fights Baljit and his thugs. After knocking them out, they continue on their way. <br />  At the prison, the Jail Minister, MLA Satpal Mander, and his assistant has arrived, making Jalaur even more nervous. Jalaur and the constables then try and stall the Minister, hoping Tarsem and Jarnail hurry and arrive. <br />  Once outside the prison walls, Tarsem goes to the tunnel entrance, only to find that it's been filled with sand. Knowing it would take too long to dig out the sand, the two then try multiple ways to get over the walls, all which fail. As Jarnail suggests pole-vaulting over, Tarsem starts giving up hope. Jarnail convinces him that he will do it, that he must do it, for his son's sake. <br />  At the same time, The Jail Minister is making a speech, and then asks Jalaur to come up and say a few words before bringing out Tarsem and Jarnail. Jalaur, feeling hopeless, decides to come clean. However, before he can admit the pair's escape, Tarsem and Jarnail jump and land in front of everyone.<br />  Tarsem and Jarnail's release is officially signed. As the Jail Minister is leaving, his assistant says that it seemed like they broke in by the way they appeared. However, the Jail Minister ignores this. Tarsem meets with his family, and he and his son reconcile. Jarnail meets with Aman's family, having learned of Baljit's trickery and once again fix the alliance between Jarnail and Aman.

Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran
 Murugan ([[Vishnu Vishal|Vishnu]]) is the right-hand man of the local [[Member of Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] Jacket Janakiraman ([[Robo Shankar]]). During a mass-marriage function organised by Jacket, 8 grooms and 1 bride out of the 25 couples to be married go missing due to the efforts of Jacket's arch-enemy, another MLA Maurdhamuthu ([[Aadukalam Naren]]). Murugan manages to get 7 grooms and 1 bride back, but 1 groom is still missing. To save Jacket's reputation, he asks his best friend Sakkarai ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]) to pretend to marry the bride, Pushpa (Reshma Pasupuleti), the local dancer and [[item girl]] who is known to everyone in the village, despite his upcoming marriage to Hamsavali. Unfortunately for Sakkarai, the photo showing him tying the knot with Pushpa is published in the newspaper and goes viral on social media, forcing Hamsavali to break her engagement with Sakkarai unless he divorces Pushpa. Sakkarai asks Pushpa to sign the divorce notice, but she refuses to sign unless Jacket tells her to do so. To add to Sakkarai's woes, Pushpa even moves in with him.  Meanwhile, Murugan falls in love with Archana ([[Nikki Galrani]]), the daughter of the local tea shop owner whose main ambition is to become a police officer. Archana's father finds out about Murugan's close association with Jacket and asks him to give 10,00,000 to Jacket so that his daughter could become a [[sub-inspector]] and also asks him not to tell Archana as she wants to get the SI job in an honest way. Later that day, Jacket goes to hospital to visit a minister Shanmugasundaram (Vittal), who is on his deathbed. Before dying, Shanmugasundaram tells him about 500,00,00,000 that he acquired illegally, but wants him to use it for good purposes. This is heard by Jacket's brother-in-law Bhootham ([[Ravi Mariya]]), who also wants the money, but for his own benefit. He chases Jacket on his way home to find out the location where the money is kept, but Jacket meets with an accident during the chase and loses his memory, beginning to act like a 10-year old.  Archana eventually gets the SI job, but soon finds out that she got the job on merit. Thinking that Murugan had cheated her father, she immediately orders him to give back her father's money, failing which he would be thrown into prison. Murugan and Sakkarai find out that Jacket has lost his memory, but manage to get him discharged from the hospital. They train him to tell Archana that he has received the money from Murugan and to tell Pushpa to sign the divorce notice so that both their problems would be solved. But their plan backfires completely as Jacket tells Pushpa what he was supposed to tell Archana, making Pushpa realise that Jacket has lost his memory and refuses to sign the divorce notice again. Jacket also inadvertently gets caught in the middle of a protest against Marudhamuthu and is eventually kidnapped by Bhootham and his men. Murugan is caught at the scene of the kidnapping and is arrested by Archana.  At Bhootam's hideout, Jacket irritates him and his men with his childish behaviour. In a fit of rage, Bhootham kicks Jacket, making him unconscious. But Jacket regains his memory after gaining consciousness, much to Bhootham's happiness. Bhootham asks him to tell where the money is, but instead Jacket starts telling all the events leading up to the event where he met Shanmugasundaram in the hospital, and keeps repeating the story from the beginning if he is interrupted, much to his irritation. At this juncture, Murugan and Archana, who have both found out that Bhootham has kidnapped Jacket, arrive. Murugan manages to stop Jacket's repetition, getting him to tell in front of Archana that he indeed received money from Murugan, but since the [[Director General of police (India)|DGP]] Sathasivam (Venkat), to whom he was supposed to pay the bribe, refused to accept the bribe, he gave the money to a contractor. Jacket also tells that he has managed to convince Pushpa to sign the divorce notice. He then reveals the location of the money to Bhootham, which is stored in an abandoned mansion. Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai, Jacket, Bhootham and even Marudhamuthu, who has also found out about the money, go to the mansion. A fight ensues between Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai and Jacket on one side and Bhootham and Marudhamuthu on the other side over the money, which ends with the former successfully getting the money.  In the end, with all problems solved, Murugan and Archana enter into a romantic relationship, while Sakkarai is to get married to Hamsavali during another mass-marriage function organised by Jacket. But before Sakkarai can tie the [[mangalasutra|thali]] around Hamasavali's neck, the priest asks him if he is Pushpa's husband to which he accidentally says yes, causing Hamsavali to stop the wedding again.

Kath just can't end texting with Var even if she doesn't really know him yet, thanks to Vince's effective [[pick-up lines]] and sweet words. Var tells her that he would be calling her "Cheer", short for [[cheerleader]] for according to him, Kath cheers him up. While reading their exchange of text messages, James admits that he also felt in love and tells Vince to continue the "Var" gimmick until such time that Kath asks him to meet her personally. That's the only time when James comes into the scene as he would be the one to meet her face to face. Vince is again sad but he had no choice other than to nod to James' plan.  Later on, Vince finds himself enjoying having Kath as his textmate even if he knows that Kath would not end up with him due to James. He shares his sentiments anonymously in his famous blog Da Vinci Quotes through six-letter sentences and phrases. Time came when James finally told him to ask Kath to meet up with him already.

Wagah (film)
 The movie begins with the news announcement of the decapitation of two [[Border Security Force|BSF]] jawans by the [[Pakistan Army]] and a third jawan Vasu ([[Vikram Prabhu]]) missing. The scene then shifts to a Pakistan Army base where a wounded Vasu is held prisoner. He narrates the events leading to his imprisonment.  Vasu, who is from a small town in [[Tamil Nadu]], joined the BSF after his graduation to avoid working in his father's ([[Raj Kapoor (Tamil film director)|Raj Kapoor]]) provision store and was posted at the India-Pakistan border in [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. One day, he encountered a young [[Kashmiri Muslim]] girl Khanum ([[Ranya Rao]]) and immediately got attracted to her. After some days, Khanum reciprocated Vasu's feelings, but sadly walked away when Vasu asked her to marry him. The next morning, two jawans were decapitated by the Pakistan Army (which was reported at the beginning of the film), forcing all Pakistanis in Kashmir to return to Pakistan due to rising anti-Pakistan sentiment. Vasu, who was tasked with the responsibility to ensure that all Pakistanis returned safely, was shocked when he found out that Khanum is a Pakistani from [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistan-occupied Kashmir]], who had come to India to visit her grandfather. Later, the bus in which Khanum was travelling was burnt by protestors just a few kilometres from the border, however Khanum managed to survive. Vasu took her to her home in PoK safely via an unguarded border crossing, but was soon caught by the Pakistan Army for infiltrating into their country and imprisoned.  In the present day, Vasu finds out that along with him, twenty-three other BSF jawans are held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. One day, he is made to fight one of the imprisoned BSF jawans ([[Ajay Rathnam]]). He manages to defeat the jawan, but is then taken to a nearby cliff by the Pakistan Army to be shot. However, a sympathetic Pakistan Army officer, whose daughter's illness was successfully treated by Indian doctors, secretly allows him to escape. Vasu goes to Khanum's village, where he witnesses Khanum's family being killed by a cruel anti-Indian Pakistan Army commander Razzaq Ali Khan (Shaji Chaudhary), who feels that Khanum is a traitor for loving the Indian Vasu. Vasu rescues Khanum and both of them leave for the Indian border, with Razzaq and the Pakistan Army in pursuit. He manages to subdue the armymen as well as Razzaq, but chooses not to kill Razzaq.

The movie ends with Vasu revealing the presence of the twenty-three jawans in Pakistan and ensuring their freedom, for which he is honoured by the [[President of India|President]] as well as the [[Prime Minister of India]].  
Volhynia (film)
 The movie tells the story of young Polish girl, Zosia Głowacka, from [[Volhynia | Volhynia's]] village settled by [[Ukrainians]], [[Poles]] and [[Jews]].<ref></ref>  The story begins shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 with marriage of Zosia's sister to a Ukrainian. During the wedding, Zosia's father decides she would marry an older village administrator, Maciej Skiba, despite her being deeply in love with a local, young Ukrainian boy, Petro. There is also resentment shown by local Ukrainian population towards Polish officials, as they favor the Polish minority in [[Volhynia]]. In talks between the participants of the wedding, it is revealed that some Ukrainians carry out terrorist attacks against Polish authorities and Ukrainian collaborators, and how it is met with severe actions from the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish government]], including closing [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches and humiliation of Ukrainian population. It is also shown that some parts of Ukrainian and Polish population are trying to reconcile with each other.  When the war begins, Maciej is conscripted to the [[Polish Army]] to fight against the Germans in the [[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]]. When the campaign is lost, Maciej and other survivors try to return to their homes. On their way back, all members of the group, except Maciej, are captured by local Ukrainians, tortured and killed. Maciej manages to get to the village only by disguising himself as a Ukrainian. The village is in [[Kresy|the eastern part of the Poland]]  [[Soviet invasion of Poland|occupied by the Soviet Union]], and the communist rule is established in the village. The local Ukrainian and Jewish population cooperate with the Soviet authorities, replacing pre-war Polish authorities as governors of the village.  In the meantime, Zosia gets pregnant, most likely with Petro, but wants Maciej to believe that the child is his. As part of a [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)#Mass deportations to the East|massive deportation carried by the Soviets against the Poles in 1939–1941]], Maciej, Zosia, and Maciej's children from his first marriage are about to be sent to [[Siberia]] or [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] as forced labor. Zosia and the children are rescued in last moment, just as the train is about to depart, by Petro who bribes the guard with vodka. When they come back to Petro's home, Zosia gets contractions. While she is giving birth to her child, the guard arrives and kills Petro. Zosia then takes care of Maciej's home and children during his absence. The children are sent to a school organized by the Soviets where all children learn to inform against their parents and give up on their religion.  The plot then switches to 1941, when the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] is conquering Volhynia during [[Operation Barbarossa]]. In the new situation, the same Ukrainians who welcomed the Soviets two years before, now greet the Germans with vodka and bread. The Germans begin to kill local Jews and organize [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police|local police units]] from Ukrainian collaborators, who actively participate in the [[Holocaust]] of the Jews. However, people like Zosia and some Ukrainians still try to help the Jews by hiding them in safe places.  In the meantime, Maciej comes back home managing to escape from deportation. The family is trying to organize their life in a changed reality, as Poles face increased hostility from their Ukrainian neighbours, growing to a level even higher than at the beginning of the war. There is an increasing number of murders of Poles by Ukrainians. In this situation, Maciej sets out to the local market despite Zosia's protests, who is afraid for his safety. And she is proven right, as the other Polish neighbours arrive some days later with Maciej's head cut off by the Ukrainians.  Zosia is trying to live on taking care of the children, however, one day, when she is defending herself against an attempted rape by a Ukrainian policeman, the presence of the Jews hidden by her is revealed. The Jews (an old couple and a young unrelated boy) escape and find shelter for the winter in the home of a local Ukrainian, who agrees to help after the Jew promises him a large amount of money. When the Jew's wife dies and winter goes by, the Ukrainian demands the payment and when he sees that the Jew cannot pay him, he kills him in the forest. The young Jew is rescued by the Ukrainian's son, a friend of his.  The plot finally goes to the summer of 1943 when news of killings of Poles by Ukrainians spread among the Poles in the village. At the time, a young Polish man, seriously injured, arrives at Zosia's home. When he recovers, he settles there as it makes Zosia feel safer. He contacts a local [[Home Army]] unit, which by orders of the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish government in the United Kingdom]] does not protect Polish population from Ukrainian attacks, but are prepared to fight against Germans in the future. When Zosia's man is asked to be a guide for members of the Home Army on the way to meeting with the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA), Zosia desperately trIes to discourage him from going. However, she fails. When the two members of the Home Army arrive at the meeting, as agreed without weapons, they are surrounded by the UPA soldiers, captured, and then dismembered by horses. The men from the UPA then hunt for the rest of the group and only the friend of Zosia escapes and hides in a church, which is full of Poles. During a sermon, the Ukrainians enter the church, killing everyone in the way, but Zosia's friend runs to the church's tower and somehow survives the attack.  In the meantime, local Ukrainian population including the former Ukrainian policemen, who run away to forest and joined the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and other local Ukrainians are gathering together calling to eradicate the lands from Poles. There are two sermons from the Ukrainian Orthodox priests shown: one who preaches about loving thy neighbour, and the second, who calls to kill all Poles to finally achieve 'pure' Ukrainian lands and consecrates the pitchforks, hammers and knives used by Ukrainians to murder their Polish neighbours.   Soon, the first survivors of the [[pogrom]]s arrive to the village telling the story of Ukrainian neighbours killing Poles and everybody who does not want to participate in killings. The local Ukrainian village administrator arrives at Zosia's home to ensure her that she and her children should stay at home, as they would not be harmed by their Ukrainian neighbours. Also, other Polish people are ensured about their safety. However, these are only deception tactics, to allow Ukrainians to kill as many Poles as possible.  Finally, the killings in the village begin at night. Zosia escapes with her child, but as she is running away, she sees Poles being tortured, including pregnant women being stabbed in womb, human bowels and eyes being taken out alive, people getting crucified alive on their doors and so on. Zosia’s stepson is murdered during the massacre. Her stepdaughter, however, is rescued by a Ukrainian peasant. On her way to escape from certain death, Zosia arrives with her child to Petro's previous house, where she is rescued from the death at the hands of Ukrainian mob, by Petro's mother.  As Zosia is running away with her child from place to place, she encounters the corpses of mutilated Polish infants, women and elderly in every village. In one place she runs into a unit of the German Army, which saves her from certain death, just moments before Ukrainians are about to kill her and her child. The Germans are astonished at first as to why she is walking alongside them, but when they find more and more stacks of murdered Poles on their way, they feel sorry for her and escort her to the place where her sister, Helena, lives. She is welcomed there, as Vasyl, Helena's Ukrainian husband, is friendly to Poles. Zosia hides in their shed with her son. As the majority of village's population is already involved in killings, Vasyl's brother tries to convince him to join nationalists and to kill his Polish wife. This way he could save himself and the children. As they wrangle, Vasyl kills the brother with an axe.  The night after, the whole family is attacked by Poles who seek revenge on Ukrainians. They condemn Helena for living with a Ukrainian, slaughter her newborn in front of her eyes, then kill Vasyl and behead her. Zosia observes everything from the shed, terrified. She escapes again, now afraid of both Ukrainians and Poles. She hides in the woods with her son.

Daniel goes outside to call in Beverly’s death from his patrol car, but is confronted by a robed cultist who wounds him. He manages to return to the hospital as cultists surround the building. Daniel and Mitchell rush into James’ room when they hear him screaming. They find Beverly’s corpse has transformed into a tentacled creature as Daniel and Mitchell rescue James and lock Beverly in the room. In the lobby, Vincent and Simon enter and hold the group at gunpoint, demanding to get to James. James takes Maggie hostage to protect himself and stabs Powell, who falls to the floor. The Beverly-Creature emerges from Beverly's room and takes Mitchell, its tentacles penetrating his body. Vincent and Simon kill the Beverly-Creature and regroup with the others in the lobby, setting Mitchell's body on fire. Vincent and Simon accompany Daniel to retrieve a shotgun from a patrol car, while Allison ventures into the basement to collect medical supplies for delivering Maggie’s baby.

Powell’s voice speaks to Daniel, who finally attacks his wife's mutated remains with an axe. Daniel is transported to a morgue room with a glowing triangle on the wall. Powell’s voice tells Daniel that he found the ability to conquer life and death. Powell promises that Daniel can have his child back if he is willing to die first.  Maggie appears and stabs Daniel. Powell appears skinless and partly mutated in front of the triangle as Maggie kneels before him. Powell recites an incantation before the triangle as a now frightened Maggie's torso explodes, birthing the Sarah-Creature. Vincent and Simon arrive and battle it. The Sarah-Creature overcomes Vincent, but he covers it in [[isopropyl alcohol]], allowing Simon to set them both on fire with a flare. Powell tells Daniel he can be with Allison if he stops resisting and "lets go". Daniel refuses and tackles him, leading both men to tumble into the void. Meanwhile, the Sarah-Creature pursues Simon, who escapes and is teleported back to the hospital to reunite safely with Kim. Daniel and Allison are shown holding hands in another world beneath a black pyramid.

War Dogs (2016 film)
 In 2005, [[David Packouz]] lives in Miami, Florida, working as a massage therapist and living with his girlfriend Iz. Desiring an additional source of income, David spends his life savings on high-quality Egyptian cotton sheets, planning to sell them to Miami retirement homes, but this venture fails to produce results. At a funeral for a friend, David runs into his high school best friend [[Efraim Diveroli]], who had moved to Los Angeles some years prior to work with his uncle selling guns. Efraim has left his uncle and formed his own company, AEY, which fills orders for arms placed by the US government due to the ongoing [[War in Iraq]]. David's life takes another turn when his girlfriend informs him that she is pregnant. Efraim offers him a job at AEY, and even though David and Iz both vehemently oppose the war, David eventually agrees, telling his girlfriend that he has begun selling his cotton sheets to the US government through Efraim's contacts.  Efraim explains to David that all orders placed for military equipment are posted on a public website, where anyone can place bids on filling the orders, and their job is to find the small orders that larger contractors do not bother with and place bids on them, with these smaller orders still being worth millions of dollars. A local small business owner, Ralph Slutzky, assists the business with funding, under the false belief that AEY only sells arms to help protect Israel. Eventually, David and Efraim land a contract to provide several thousand [[Beretta]] pistols to the Iraqi Police  in [[Baghdad]], a deal that would put them on the map. Unfortunately, an Italian embargo blocks the shipment to Iraq, so Efraim attempts to route the shipment through [[Jordan]], but the shipment gets held up there as well. With Iz discovering David's true business by overhearing a conversation between him and Efraim, leaving her upset, David and Efraim have to fly to Jordan to free up their cargo or risk being blacklisted by the US Government for failing to deliver.  In Jordan, Efraim manages to use bribes to free up the Beretta shipment, but are still not allowed to fly the cargo to Baghdad without a permit that will take several weeks to acquire. The guns are loaded up into a truck and the two are provided with a driver who offers to drive the guns to Iraq, as no permit is required for driving guns across the border. The three drive through the night, at one point bribing border patrol with two cartons of cigarettes, and at another point being attacked by insurgents while trying to get gas, but eventually arrive at the military base. Captain Santos, the man receiving the shipment, is impressed by the lengths the two went through to get the guns to him, and the two are paid.  After this, AEY continues to secure larger deals and make more money, even moving into a larger office and hiring more employees, and David's daughter Ella is born. Efraim, however, continues to grow more unstable and untrustworthy, as the company is suddenly given a chance to land their biggest deal yet. Known as "The Afghan Deal", the US Government wishes to arm the Afghan military for the long-term, and post a massive order worth $300 million, which includes 100 million rounds of [[7.62×39mm|AK-47 ammunition]] and would have netted the war dogs a $100 million profit. Filling this order proves to be near-impossible for such a relatively small company, particularly in that there is a global shortage on AK-47 ammunition, but the two end up lucking into an encounter with legendary US arms dealer Henry Girard. Girard has access to the massive weapon storages that were created in Albania but never used, and must now be disposed of in accordance with NATO treaties, which includes well over a hundred million rounds of AK-47 ammunition. Girard can not directly deal with the US Government anymore, due to being on a watchlist, and wants to make the deal through AEY. Efraim agrees, although David expresses discomfort working with a man who is on a terrorist watchlist.  The two go to Albania to confirm that the ammunition works, then place the winning bid on the contract &ndash; though Efraim is upset to learn that their bid was the lowest by $53 million, reducing their profit margin. Meanwhile, Iz grows frustrated with David's continuing string of lies about his work, and leaves to live with her mother. While in Albania to prepare the shipment, David discovers that virtually all of the rounds are Chinese-made and illegal under a US embargo against Chinese arms. Efraim comes up with the idea of re-packaging the rounds in generic packaging, pretending that they are concerned about the weight of the shipments (though it inadvertently does save $3 million in shipping costs). While the rounds are repackaged and shipped, Efraim learns that Henry charged them a 400% markup (10 cents on 2.5 cents) on the rounds, and wants to cut him out of the deal. David protests that they are all making great money, but Efraim destroys the only copy of his partnership contract with David and proceeds with his plan to cut Henry out.  Henry retaliates by having David kidnapped from his hotel room, beaten, and held at gunpoint before leaving him alive, though David is left wondering if his now missing Albanian driver, Bashkim, has been killed.  David learns that Efraim has not paid the small ($100,000) cost to Enver, the Albanian who is handling the repackaging.  David returns to Miami, where he tells Efraim that he is quitting AEY and demands immediate payout of the $4 million (offers to settle for $1.6) owed for his work-to-date, but Efraim refuses and laughs about the partnership contract being gone. David returns to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to move back in with him by telling her the truth about his AEY work. Weeks later, Efraim and Ralph Slutzky meet with David.  Efraim offers a severance package of just $200,000, which David responds to by threatening to blackmail him with the evidence he has of the falsified documentation the two created to look like a respectable company so they could secure the Afghan deal. Shortly after this, David and Efraim are both arrested by the FBI.  Enver, not paid for the repackaging contract and understanding the Chinese embargo, had reported AEY to the Pentagon. The FBI had arrested Ralph, who then wore a wire during the meeting with David and Efraim, giving the FBI enough to arrest them. Efraim is sentenced to four years in prison for numerous crimes related to conspiracy and fraud on the Afghan deal, and David gets seven months house arrest in exchange for co-operating with the investigation.  Months later, David meets with Henry, who apologizes for the kidnapping and assault in Albania, claiming he had bad information. He also thanks David for not mentioning his name in his confession to the FBI. David begins to ask questions about the events of the deal, including the fate of Bashkim. In response, Henry pulls out a briefcase full of money, a part of his own cut from the Afghan deal, and offers it to David in exchange for dropping the subject. The movie ends before David decides.  
War on Everyone
 Terry Monroe and Bob Bolaño, two corrupt cops, return to the Albuquerque police force after being suspended for assaulting a racist coworker.  Bolaño and Monroe regularly rob and extort criminals, accept bribes, and take drugs.  While surveilling small time thieves, the two come to believe Jimmy Harris, a local criminal, is planning a heist.  They contact one of Harris' former associates, Reggie, and coerce him into revealing information by threatening to falsely arrest him.  Reggie and his friend, Irishman Pádraic Power, identify Clifford Reynard, a getaway driver, and tell them Harris' girlfriend, Jackie Hollis, used to dance at a strip club owned by Russell Birdwell.  Birdwell, though suspicious, reveals Hollis' address.  After bursting into Harris' house and knocking him out, they extort several expensive possessions.  Meanwhile, Birdwell tells his boss, James Mangan, a knighted British businessman who is in charge of the heist,  the cops have been asking about Hollis.  Mangan tells Birdwell to intimidate both Hollis and the cops.  Monroe returns to Hollis and gives her a replacement television.  After flirting with each other, they have sex and begin seeing each other.  While staking out Reynard's house to extort him, too, they hear a scream.  In the house, they find that Reynard's wife has murdered him, though she is too hysterical to explain why.  Irritated, the cops attempt to quiet her while they consider their next step.  Reynard's teenage son flees, but they are unable to catch him.  After a nightmare, Monroe becomes concerned and searches the city for the missing boy.  As he does this, Birdwell scares Bolaño's wife by smashing the window of her shop as she talks to Hollis.  With Reynard dead, Reggie takes his place in the heist, though he misleads Bolaño and Monroe into believing it will be taking place elsewhere.  When the cops finally catch on to him, they discover Harris and his cohorts dead.  Not knowing Mangan's involvement, they assume Reggie is responsible.  Before going after Reggie, they learn about Birdwell's harassment and beat him so badly that he loses an eye.  Knowing they have numerous enemies and believing themselves untouchable anyway, they do not bother asking who sent him. Reggie's friend Power, when offered a bribe, tells them Reggie fled to Iceland.  Though they know nothing more than that, they leave for Iceland, reasoning that an African American man will stick out.  To Bolaño's amazement, the plan works, and they spontaneously find him in a crowd.  Under pressure, Reggie reveals Mangan's involvement and agrees to split his take from the heist with them.  Back in Albuquerque, Lieutenant Stanton says Birdwell has filed charges against them.  Monroe and Bolaño assure him that their investigation is nearing completion and will involve Birdwell.  As Monroe and Bolaño search for Mangan, they chance upon Reynard's child, who is living homeless on the streets.  Monroe insists on becoming the boy's foster parent over the protests of Bolaño, who, as a parent, believes Monroe unprepared for the responsibility.  Hollis, who has temporarily moved in with Monroe after Birdwell's attack, also voices her skepticism, but the three eventually come to care for each other.  Although Mangan's thugs kidnap and beat Monroe, he laughs off their attempt to intimidate him, saying he has already been raped.  Not wanting to kill a cop, they release him.  However, after Monroe and Bolaño harass Mangan during a business meeting, Lieutenant Stanton finally fires them.  Mangan beheads Power and contacts the cops, hoping to entrap them with an offer of sharing the money.  Reynard's son, however, tells Monroe that his mother killed Reynard because she found out he was part of a child pornography ring run by Mangan.  Enraged, Monroe enlists Bolaño to help kill Mangan, having lost interest in the money.  In the resulting shootout, Bolaño is apparently killed but reveals he was wearing a bulletproof vest.  The two shoot Birdwell as he begs for his life. Then they kill Mangan as he attempts to bribe them.  Monroe, Hollis, Reynard's son, Bolaño and his family, Reggie and Reggie's transgender girlfriend all party together on the beach in Iceland afterward.  
Wait Till Helen Comes (film)
 Set in 1982, Molly is a teenaged girl living in Baltimore with her widowed mother, Jean, and younger brother, Michael. When Jean marries Dave, a writer and widower, the new family moves to an isolated rural church, converted into a house, outside the small town of Holwell. On the way, they stop at a psychiatric hospital to pick up Dave’s preadolescent daughter, Heather, who has lived there for three years, suffering the trauma of seeing her mother die in a house fire.  While exploring, Heather is attracted by a blue butterfly, following it deeper into the woods. Later, when exploring the graveyard adjoining the churchyard &ndash; cared for by kindly old Mr. Simmons &ndash; they find a memorial plaque (not a grave) for a six-year-old girl with the initials H.E.H., the same initials as Heather. Molly and Michael follow up with Mrs. Williams, the local librarian, who finds records and photos explaining that the plaque commemorates Helen Harper, who died with her parents in a fire in 1886, none of whom’s remains were found.  Heather makes friends with the ghost of Helen. Helen leads her to the ruins of her former house beside a river, and the two play there regularly. Besides Heather, Molly is the only one who can see Helen &ndash; a gift that Molly shares with her dead father, who had been considered mentally unstable for his visions. When Molly tries to tell the rest of the family about Helen, they think she's crazy. Only Mr. Simmons believes her, as his departed wife shared the same gift when she was alive. He also warns Molly to be careful, as a number of young girls have gone missing over the years after befriending Helen’s ghost (a girl is seen walking into the river during the opening credits).  Molly, trying to foster a relationship with Heather, keeps an eye on her to make sure Heather stays safe. When Heather runs away to Helen's house, Molly’s father appears to her in a dream to warn her. Molly wakes and runs after Heather to make sure nothing happens. When she gets there, she sees a vision of how Helen accidentally closed a difficult to unlock trap door when her parents were in the basement. She inadvertently knocks a candle over but stays too long in the ensuing fire as she attempts to open the trap door. The fire kills her parents, and a burning Helen ran into the river, where she drowned. Heather tries to join Helen in the river and starts to drown. Molly runs in to save her, bringing the unconscious Heather to shore and resuscitating her. Heather reveals that she accidentally killed her mother when trying to cook for her, starting a house fire. She believes that she and Helen, whose story is similar, truly understand each other.  Molly finds the trap door to the basement in the ruins and, with Heather's help, gets it open. Inside, they find the corpses of Helen's parents, whose spirits had been trapped. The blue butterfly, the nickname that Helen's parents called her by, lands on the corpses. Michael arrives in time to join Molly and Heather as they all watch the spirits of Helen's parents, finally freed, depart to the heavens with Helen.  
Wakefield (film)
 The story is told from the point of view of Howard Wakefield, through narration that reveals his evolving emotional state. A successful attorney in New York City, he is unhappy in his marriage of 15 years to Diana, a beautiful art curator and former dancer. They used to use flirtation with other people to add excitement to their sex life, but she soon begins to resent it. One night, Howard returns home late from his commute by train and is distracted by a raccoon he sees entering his garage, which is detached from the house. He chases the raccoon into the garage's attic, where he realizes he has a perfect view into his home, where his wife and two daughters, Taylor and Giselle, are eating dinner. He ignores calls from his wife and is amused at her clear annoyance, but is insulted when she angrily throws his plate of dinner away instead of saving it for him. To avoid a fight, he decides to wait a bit to go into the house, but he ends up falling asleep.  The next morning, Howard realizes Diana will never believe his story of spending the night in the garage and will insist he was having an affair, so he plans to wait for her to leave for work before going in. Instead, he is shocked when, after finding his car still in the garage, she calls the police to report him [[missing people|missing]]. Howard feels bad when he sees Diana cry, but before he can go inside, his overbearing mother-in-law, Babs, shows up to comfort her. Babs appears to be saying that Howard has run off while Diana apparently defends him, showing her there is no evidence he has taken any money. Diana then leaves for work and Howard finally goes inside and showers, planning to just deal with the fallout of his absence, before he starts resenting the idea that his wife would still go to work after his disappearance. It then dawns on him that his disappearance is probably a relief to her, and that she probably thinks that she married the wrong man. He cleans up any evidence that he was inside the house, grabs some food from the pantry and returns to the garage.  Howard is overjoyed with abandoning all his responsibilities and amused that people would surely suspect his wife's involvement in his disappearance, just as he is amused at seeing her tackle the chores that used to be his responsibility. He feels unshackled and free as he spends his time doing puzzles, reading and observing his family and their neighbors. He also happily realizes that he is seeing more of his daughters' lives than he did before. For the first few days, he continues to sneak food and amenities from his house. He soon realizes that he no longer cares about having clients and being freshly showered and shaved, and vows not to take anything from his old life or spend the money he has in his wallet. He begins foraging each night through the trash and showers in the backyard bathroom built by his neighbor, Dr. Sondervan, who runs a small home for mentally disabled youth.  As months go by and he grows a beard and long hair, Howard is free to walk about town during the day, where people dismiss him as homeless. The only people who discover his presence are Herbert and Emily, two of Dr. Sondervan's residents, who follow him back to the attic one day. He reflects on the beginning of his relationship with Diana, whom he met when she was dating his best friend Dirk Morrison, an extremely competitive [[Wall Street]] trader. Through manipulation and dishonesty, Howard managed to take Diana away from Dirk, and as he thinks back, Howard wonders if he ever truly loved her. Nevertheless, he realizes that by simply disappearing, he has the upper hand in controlling her love life. If he had just divorced her, she would be free to date other men, but while he is missing under mysterious circumstances, she can't easily move on to another man.  As summer turns into fall, Howard no longer basks in his freedom but instead feels like he has become a prisoner of his choices. He has an epiphany and realizes that the old Howard had been a selfish, jealous and resentful husband and father, who made himself out to be a victim. While he feels happy to be free from himself, he also feels that his family is happier without him. He also realizes that he has never loved Diana more and one day, he walks out onto the sidewalk, but Diana doesn't recognize him.  Diana appears to be developing a romantic relationship, and Howard is stunned when he sees it is with Dirk Morrison. Howard surmises that Dirk would have probably told Diana the lies he had said that broke them up years ago. He decides to give Diana an honest chance this time to pick with whom she wants to be. After getting himself cleaned up and buying a new suit, Howard works up the courage to walk back into his house. As he sees his wife and daughters decorating the Christmas tree, he envisions them being overjoyed at his return, and also envisions a second scenario in which they respond with horror. He pauses, and then comes in through the front door and announces, "I'm home."

At that time, Rahul and Karan were prosecuted by Ranveer in the court. However, Ranveer lost the case as the old man had died in a fire explosion in his house and was the only witness for that case.  Now, it is clear that Rahul was not involved in any of the murders. Eventually, the police consider Rajni to be the suspect. Rahul now decides to flee [[India]], but is not allowed to leave because his sugar level drastically increases. In no time, the police get to know that Rajni has gone missing and learn that Mac, Rajni's boyfriend who is also an employee in Rahul's company, is involved in the murders.  As ACP Deshmukh comes to know that Rahul is to be hospitalized, he goes in search of Mac to save Rahul from being killed. Inspector Deshmukh runs behind that ambulance and learns that Rahul is missing. Mac takes Rahul to the same place where the police officer, Ramesh Sarniak, and Karan Parekh had been killed. Rahul finds himself tied and gets shocked when he sees Sia there. Sia reveals to Rahul that she is the one who killed the officer Sarnaik and Karan. It is further revealed by Sia that the old man who helped Rajni didn't die in an explosion but was murdered by Rahul, Karan, and the officer Sarnaik. Sia further reveals that the old man who was killed was Sia's father. Sia then attempts to kill Rahul by increasing his sugar level. During the process, Rahul reveals to Sia that it was of no use to kill them as the real killer is still alive. Rahul tells her that Ranveer was bribed by Rahul and Karan to save them and also planned the murder.  Thus, Rahul dies and, heartbroken, Sia leaves from there. Soon, ACP Deshmukh comes to know that Sia is the killer. Sia takes Ranveer to the same place where the murders were committed and reveals to him the truth and also tells him to admit his crime. Knowing this, Ranveer refuses to do so but is being tricked by Sia as she had called the police and the whole statement was recorded and traced during her call.  This leads to a fight between them in which Inspector Deshmukh arrives and fights with Ranveer. During the fight, Sia takes a gun and shoots at Ranveer, killing him.  In the end, it is shown that Deshmukh forgives Sia for her crime and also leaves his job.  
The Wailing (film)
 A Japanese man has recently arrived at a little village in the mountains of [[South Korea]], living in a secluded house. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death.  Police officer Jong-goo, who is investigating the case, meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (“no name” in [[Korean language|Korean]]), who tells him about the Japanese stranger, and later disappears. A local hunter tells Jong-goo that he saw the near-naked stranger eating a deer, with glowing red eyes. Jong-goo is unsettled, as he has had dreams about this stranger, which the hunter had described to him. He enlists the help of another police officer, and a Japanese-speaking deacon to serve as an interpreter, and they investigate the stranger's house while he is away. The other police officer finds pictures of the infected and murdered residents and their belongings. He is too shocked to say anything to the others. The stranger's house guard dog attacks the deacon and Jong-goo. The stranger arrives and pacifies the dog, and the other three leave.  The police officer tells Jong-goo of what he saw, and hands over a shoe which belongs to Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin. Soon,  Hyo-jin becomes sick and displays similar symptoms as the other infected villagers. Jong-goo makes his way to the stranger’s house with the deacon in anger, but finds that the pictures and evidence have been burned. Infuriated, he destroys the stranger's worship room and kills the dog when it attacks him, ordering the stranger to leave the village.  Distraught about Hyo-jin's condition, Jong-goo's mother-in-law seeks help from a [[shaman]], Il-gwang. As Il-gwang performs a ritual to exorcise the demon, the stranger performs a ritual in his house simultaneously. Jong-goo finds his daughter in pain and interrupts the ritual, taking her to a hospital instead. The following day, he gathers his friends to hunt down the stranger, believing that the stranger is responsible for the disease and murders. Jong-goo and his friends go after the stranger, and are attacked by another infected villager. After a chase they eventually end up hitting the stranger with their vehicle. They dispose of his body as Moo-myeong watches from the hills. When Jong-goo returns home, he finds that Hyo-jin's condition has seemingly improved. Il-gwang suspects they killed the wrong person; he later encounters Moo-myeong, and starts vomiting blood. He calls Jong-goo, telling him that Moo-myeong is the real demon.  Jong-goo finds Moo-myeong near his house. She requests Jong-goo to believe her, telling him she had set a trap for the demon, but the trap will not work if Jong-goo goes back to his house. Il-gwang calls Jong-goo and tells him not to believe Moo-myeong, while she in turn tells him Il-gwang is actually in league with the real demon. Confused and hesitant, Jong-goo eventually leaves to save his family, but Moo-myeong grabs him, her skin turning a ghostly white as he notices that she is wearing the personal items of some of the victims. He pulls himself away, and as he crosses his home's threshold, the floral trap withers.  The deacon encounters the still-alive Japanese stranger in a cave. After being photographed by the stranger, the deacon witnesses the stranger evolving into a demon. Back at his house, Jong-goo arrives to find that Hyo-jin has murdered their family. He calls out to her, but she stabs him and falls into a stupor. Il-gwang arrives at Jong-goo's house and takes photographs of the family. While returning to his car, he unintentionally drops a box filled with photos of the other victims.  As Jong-goo lies dying in his home, he sees visions of happier times with his daughter and assures her he will protect her.  
The Wake of Dick Johnson
 Shortly after his death, Dick Johnson returns from the afterlife to rant about drinking, women, and the evils of mankind responsible for the eternal torment his new existence. According to Johnson, death is an alternate universe where the evils of terrestrial life throughout all history abrade the walls of space-time, leaving behind trillions of minuscule punctures and abrasions in the same way sound is recorded on a vinyl record. In death, Johnson is tormented by the ethereal visage of his long deceased uncle Willy, who habitually tortured and raped Johnson in his youth. Johnson describes this astral plane as one where only the most heinous evils throughout all time are collected and merge as one; for Johnson it is a tailored version of hell where he and his uncle Willy are inescapably intertwined for all eternity.<ref></ref>  
The Warriors Gate
   Jack Bronson ([[Uriah Shelton]]) is a teenager who spends his free time playing warrior video games and working at a Chinese curios and antiques shop. His mother is trying to sell the house they live in before it goes into foreclosure. When Jack goes to a biking park, Travis ([[Dakota Daulby]]), a neighbourhood bully and his friends chase after him and he hides inside his bosses shop and helps out.   A family heirloom, The Warriors Gate, from Mr Cheng’s cousin in Beijing arrives at the shop and he gives it to Jack as a gift.   Jack goes to sleep with the thing in his room and wakes up with a sword at his neck. A warrior, Zhao ([[Mark Chao]]) tells him that the ‘Black Knight’ has to look after the most precious thing in the kingdom; the Princess. Jack gets to know Princess Su Lin and she stays with him overnight.  The next morning, barbarians from the game realm come to kill the Princess but she fights them off, destroying the house in the process. The barbarians take the Princess back into the other realm through the Warriors Gate but when Jack goes in after her he arrives somewhere else. The Warrior who sent the Princess to stay with Jack is there and there is an army of barbarians trying to kill them. The Wizard stops time and the army is frozen.  The Wizard tells Jack that Zhao was one of six children raised from both to protect the Emperor and that the only person who could defeat them was Arun the Cruel, King of the barbarians. Arun poisoned the warriors and killed the Emperor and the only people left alive were Su Lin and Zhao. The wizard searched through his seeing stone to find the greatest Warrior to protect the Princess and found The Black Knight; Jack's in game avatar; a ferocious and clever Warrior.  Jack and Zhao  find out that Arun the Cruel will marry the Princess, become Emperor and then have her killed; so their mission is to save her.   While on their way through the "Unknown Kingdom" Jack tries the get Zhao to dance and have fun. In the forest, Jack gets held captive by beautiful Witch triplets that intend to eat him but  Zhao saves him. At night Zhao starts to teach Jack how to fight. They get to a lake and Zhao says the trek around it will take days because he cannot swim. Jack agrees to teach him if Zhao continues teaching him how to fight like a Warrior.  When they arrive at Arun's kingdom they get captured; their way of getting into the kingdom and past all the guards and knights. They get free by working together to kill the guard when he gives them their food. Jack saves Su Lin but just as they're about to kiss Zhao barges in and interrupts them. On their way out they get recaptured and put back in their cell, Jack tells Zhao that he’s too young to die, having never even kissed a girl. Zhao reveals that neither has he. A butterfly appears and Zhao has a conversation with it.Jack asks if the butterfly understood him and Zhao replies that he hopes so.    During the wedding when Arun the Cruel lifts up her veil and goes to kiss Su Lin he sees that her face is of that of an insectoid monster with a long tongue and huge eyes.  The Wizard uses his magic to distract everyone and frees Jack and Zhao just before hanging. The Wizard pours magic powder on Jacks shoes and tells him to jump. Jack saves the princess and all the barbarians try to kill them. The wizard gives Jack bags of magic powder to throw at them. One of the bags makes one of the barbarians a huge monster, however; too large for Jack and a formidable foe for Zhao. Eventually, Jack and Su Lin catapult themselves faraway and Zhao and the Wizard get away as well.    Jack wakes up in a forest alone and after a search finds Sun Lin tied up. Arun's guards attack Jack but he fights them off. Arun and Jack fight until Jack kills Arun and saves the Princess.   Su Lin is crowned Empress and sometime afterwards they kiss and she tells Jack that she never thought he was worthless; not even when they first met. The Empress's guards see her lipstick on Jacks face and try to kill him for touching her; but he gets home through the Warriors Gate; smashing it to pieces and rendering it useless to get back.   When he goes to school the next day Jack finally defeats his bully, Travis. At home, Jack tries to put the Warriors Gate back together but fails so he creates a video game called ‘The Warriors Gate’ and sells it for $25,000 so that he and his mom get to keep their house.  Days later Jack is at the mall for some ice-cream and bumps into Su Lin. She had the Wizard make her another box/gate and made a new law that everyone gets holidays; even the Empress.  Back in Empress's Kingdom, we see Zhao teaching all the knights to dance. Su Lin also dances a modern dance while standing on the balcony of her Forbidden City- like palace.  
Warcraft (film)
  Draenor, the homeworld of the [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Orcs|orcs]], is being torn apart by a mysterious force known as fel magic. Gul'dan, a powerful orc warlock, unites the orc clans and forms the Horde, and creates a portal to the world of [[Warcraft#Azeroth|Azeroth]]. The orcs begin to use fel magic to drain the life out of captive [[draenei]] in order to sustain the portal. Once it is operational, Gul'dan leads a small warband to capture prisoners on Azeroth and sacrifice them to bring the rest of the Horde through the portal. Durotan, the chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, his pregnant mate Draka, and his friend Orgrim Doomhammer join this initial warband. While crossing through the portal, Draka goes into labor. When the orcs arrive on Azeroth, Gul'dan assists Draka with giving birth, but while the baby is born alive, it is in neonatal distress, struggling to breathe, and is near death. Gul'dan then drains the life out of a nearby deer to revive and infuse fel magic into the baby, which Durotan later names Go'el.  The orcs raid several settlements throughout Azeroth. Anduin Lothar, the military commander of the human forces in the Stormwind Kingdom, looks over some of the men that were killed, and finds a trespassing mage named Khadgar, who explains that he was investigating the dead bodies because they contained traces of fel magic. Khadgar persuades Stormwind's king, Llane Wrynn, to consult Medivh, the renowned Guardian of Tirisfal, and Llane sends Anduin and Khadgar to Medivh's stronghold, Karazhan, to inform him of the fel magic's presence on Azeroth. In the Karazhan library, a ghostly shadow leads Khadgar to a mysterious book, which he takes.  Anduin, Khadgar, and Medivh join a scouting team following traces of fel magic but are ambushed by orcs. Medivh uses a spell to kill the fel-corrupted orcs, leaving the Horde's warchief, Blackhand, to flee along with Durotan and Orgrim. Khadgar restrains a half-orc slave, Garona, and the soldiers take her prisoner. King Llane frees Garona in exchange for loyalty to Stormwind, and she leads the humans to spy on the orc camp, where they learn of Gul'dan's plan to bring the Horde to Azeroth. Meanwhile, Durotan realizes that the fel magic is responsible for the destruction of Draenor, and if Gul'dan is not thwarted, Azeroth will suffer the same fate. Despite Orgrim's objections, Durotan invites Llane to a secret meeting so that the Frostwolf Clan and the humans can unite to defeat Gul'dan. While studying the book that he took from Karazhan, Khadgar learns that Gul'dan could not have opened the portal on his own; he had help from someone on Azeroth. He is confronted by Medivh, who burns Khadgar's research when Khadgar offers to help him with his work.  The Frostwolf Clan meets with the humans to negotiate an alliance, but the group is ambushed by Blackhand. As the humans retreat, Medivh forms a magical barrier to protect them, but Lothar's son Callan is separated from the rest of the group and killed by Blackhand. Medivh is severely weakened, and Garona and Khadgar take him back to Karazhan to recover. After noticing Medivh's eyes shine green, showing that he is infected by fel magic, Khadgar returns to his former home, Dalaran, to seek help from the Kirin Tor, the authority of human and high elven mages. The Kirin Tor facilitate a meeting with Alodi, revealed to be the shadow who led Khadgar to the book; she confirms that Medivh has indeed been corrupted by fel magic and turned into a demon. At the orc camp, Blackhand purges the Frostwolf Clan. Orgrim helps Draka to escape, and she sends Go'el down a river in a basket, but is then found and killed by another orc. Durotan challenges Gul'dan to Mak'gora, a traditional orcish duel to the death for leadership of a clan – in this case, all of the orcs. During the fight, Gul'dan violates the honorable combat rules by draining the life out of Durotan with his magic, killing him and earning the disapproval of the orcs watching, and he empowers Blackhand with the same magic. Medivh, now in a half-demonic state, starts to open the portal to Draenor, and Gul'dan begins sacrificing the captured human villagers to allow the rest of the Horde to enter Azeroth.  Llane leads the human army in an assault on the orc camp, while Anduin and Khadgar fight Medivh and destroy the demon that had begun to manifest on the outside. Medivh is left mortally wounded, and uses the last of his strength to close the portal to Draenor and instead open a portal to Stormwind, allowing Llane to evacuate most of the freed prisoners. When Medivh eventually dies, the portal closes, leaving Llane, Garona and a small number of human soldiers to fight the orcs. Llane secretly orders Garona to kill him, bringing her honor among the orcs and putting her in a position of power to bring peace between the two races. Garona reluctantly does so and is welcomed into the Horde by Gul'dan. As the orcs celebrate, Lothar arrives to retrieve King Llane's body and discovers Garona's knife still in Llane's neck, realizing that it was she who had killed their king. Blackhand challenges Lothar to Mak'gora, and Lothar quickly disposes of him. Against Gul'dan's demands, the orcs, bound by tradition, allow Lothar to depart with Llane's body. At Llane's funeral in Stormwind, the leaders of the other human nations, along with the [[Races and factions of Warcraft#High elves|high elves]] and [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Dwarves|dwarves]], proclaim an alliance against the orcs and rally behind Lothar as the leader of the Alliance forces. Elsewhere, Orgrim takes one of Durotan's tusks to one day give to Go'el, and the basket containing Go'el is found by a human.  
Wazir (film)
 [[Anti-Terrorism Squad (India)|Anti-Terrorism Squad]] (ATS) officer Daanish Ali ([[Farhan Akhtar]]) lives with his wife Ruhana ([[Aditi Rao Hydari]]) and little daughter Noorie. One day, while Daanish is driving with his wife and daughter, he spots the terrorist Farooq Rameez and chases him. Noorie is killed in the ensuing shootout while Rameez escapes. Ruhana is shattered and blames Daanish for Noorie's death. Daanish later kills Rameez during a police operation, angering his seniors, who wanted Rameez alive to find out which politician he was going to meet.  A grief-stricken Daanish is about to kill himself at Noorie's grave when a mysterious van appears, driving off when Daanish yells at it. Daanish finds a wallet lying where the van was, goes to return it, and meets its owner, a handicapped chess master named Pandit Omkar Nath Dhar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), who turns out to have been Noorie's chess teacher. Pandit starts teaching Daanish chess and tells him about Nina, Pandit's daughter who also died. Nina had been teaching chess to Ruhi ([[Mazel Vyas]]), the daughter of a government minister, Yazaad Qureshi ([[Manav Kaul]]), and had fallen down the stairs at Qureshi's house and died. Pandit is convinced that her death was not an accident. Intrigued, Daanish tries to meet Qureshi, but police officers at the minister's office threaten him with arrest. Daanish later meets Ruhi at her school to ask her about Nina, but Ruhi is taken away by Qureshi who threatens her for talking to Daanish. Pandit is later brutally attacked by Wazir ([[Neil Nitin Mukesh]]), an assassin sent by Qureshi, who warns Pandit and Daanish to stop chasing Qureshi.  Pandit leaves for [[Kashmir]], where Qureshi is headed. Wazir calls Daanish and threatens to kill Pandit. Daanish frantically chases Pandit's van but Wazir blows it up, killing Pandit. Determined to exact revenge and discover who Wazir is, Daanish makes a plan with the [[Superintendent of police (India)|Superintendent of Police]] (SP) Vijay Mallik ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]). During Qureshi's speech, SP detonates explosives, causing a panic, and holds back the police to give Daanish time to act. Qureshi escapes in the confusion and goes to where he and his daughter are staying, but Daanish breaks in and asks him about Wazir. Qureshi claims he does not know anybody called Wazir. Crying, Ruhi reveals to Daanish that Qureshi is not her father – he is actually one of the militants who massacred her entire village and posed as her father when Indian Army troops arrived. Ruhi had told Nina this, so Qureshi killed Nina. Daanish realises that Rameez and the other terrorists had come to meet Qureshi, and kills him.  A few days later, while watching Ruhana's play – based on chess and dedicated to Pandit – Daanish realises that Pandit was in fact the play's "weak pawn" who befriended a "strong rook" (Daanish) who would kill a "wicked king" (Qureshi). Shocked, Daanish finds Pandit's housekeeper, who says that she did not actually see Wazir on the night he attacked Pandit. She gives Daanish a USB pen-drive which Pandit had told her to give to Daanish if he came looking for Wazir. The pen-drive contains a video of Pandit, who explains that Wazir never existed – he was just a persona created by Pandit, who knew that, due to his handicap, he was powerless against Qureshi. Pandit intentionally dropped his wallet near Noorie's grave so Daanish could find it and befriend him. His knife wounds from Wazir's attack were self-inflicted, and he had used voice recordings to pose as Wazir on the phone. Pandit had sacrificed himself to ensure that Daanish would kill Qureshi and get revenge for both of them. Shaken by the revelation, Daanish and Ruhana reunite.

Weeds on Fire
 1984 is a year where many changes take place, such as the signing of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] as well as the opening of [[New Town Plaza]] and the first dragon boat race on [[Shing Mun River]].  Tse Chi-lung "Lung" ([[:zh:林耀聲|Lam Yiu-sing]]), a resident of [[Wo Che Estate]], and his neighbour and long-time friend Fan Chun-wai "Wai" (Tony Wu) enter Kei Kok College, a lowest-tier secondary school whose students' discipline is notorious in [[Sha Tin District]]. Kei Kok's principal, Lu Kwong-fai ([[Liu Kai-chi]]), receives fundings from the [[Sha Tin District Council|District Board]] with the support of District Officer [[Donald Tsang|Mr Tsang]] ([[:zh:潘燦良|Poon Chan-leung]]) to establish the territory's first Chinese teenage baseball team, which he believes can turn bad students good. Acting also as the coach, Lu recruits Lung, Wai and eight of their fellow schoolmates, who all live under uneasy conditions, to the baseball team named the Shatin Martins. He enforces strict discipline so as to remind the members to work and behave as a team, especially after their first humiliating defeat to a junior team.  Lung often looks up to Wai, who is smarter and physically stronger than him. Wai has started a romantic relationship with his schoolmate Tsz-ching ([[:zh:談善言|Hedwig Tam]]) whereas Lung does not even dare to speak to Ling (Sadie Wang) whom he has a crush on. After Wai is chosen as the [[pitcher]] of the Shatin Martins, he takes pride in himself and belittles his teammates. In the first match of the Little League, Wai starts a fight with the rival team, prompting Lu to publicly replace him with Lung. Feeling betrayed by his friend, an ashamed, Wai withdraws from baseball and school, rejoins gang activities and abandons his now-pregnant girlfriend. Lung is at first angry with Lu for alienating Wai, but later reconciles with him. With the departure of the most outstanding member, the Shatin Martins work closer and train harder together, finally winning the tickets to the final of the league.  Right before the final match, Lung experiences several shocks in his life. First, his family is torn apart by his mother's extramarital affairs. Second, although he has summoned the courage to speak to Ling, she has a boyfriend already. Third, he finds out Wai is involved in illegal acts in order to attempt to provide subsidy for Tsz-ching's abortion since she is now on her own after splitting with her family. But she refuses to give up her baby. Lu reminds him to stay focused as the half-a-step he takes at the pitcher's mound will decide the fate of the team.  At the final, the Shatin Martins have a hard match against the Japan-based Buffaloes, being far behind in four [[inning]]s. Wai cannot keep his promise to show up to support them, as he is performing a dangerous mission. Worried about Wai, Lung fails to concentrate on playing and is hit in the face by the ball struck by the [[Batting (baseball)|batter]]. As he falls onto the ground, he realises he must stand up by himself to prove himself capable to Wai. The Shatin Martins manages to come up from behind and eventually wins by 13-12, becoming the first Hong Kong team to win the championship.  Although Wai is seriously injured, he survives and is taken care of at hospital. Lung learns how to adapt to changes, looking to his father and Tsz-ching as examples. Lu remains unmarried and dedicates himself to education and baseball. In recognition of the historic title, the [[Hong Kong Government|government]] names a bridge over Shing Mun River after the team.  On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Shatin Martins, Lung visits the [[Umbrella Square|Admiralty Occupy Site]] during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|Umbrella Movement]] and recalls the spirit of not giving up hopes despite of failures.

After talking to her family and realizing that she cannot go through another decade of uncertainty, Michal decides to go through with renting the hall and to continue to prepare for her marriage as planned without her original fiancé, leaving it up to God to decide on a groom.  Michal goes on a series of increasingly unsuccessful dates: first with a man (Udi Persi) who has taken a vow not to look at anyone who is not his wife, next with a deaf man (Jonathan Rozen) who becomes angered that she only agreed to see him after falling into despair, and he senses she is flirting with his sign language interpreter. Michal later makes the pilgrimage to the grave of [[Rebbe Nachman of Breslov]] where she is overcome with grief and cries aloud that she cannot feel God. The grave of Rabbi Nachman where she has been praying is separated between men and women, and a man on the other side of the barrier overhears Michal and asks her if she is alright. The man reveals himself outside the grave to be Yoss (Oz Zehavi), an Israeli pop star who Michal is a fan of. During their conversation Michal reveals that she is planning to get married on the last day of [[Hanukkah]] but has yet to find a groom and invites Yoss to her wedding.  On her return from her trip Yoss surprises Michal by dropping by her apartment unannounced, and again asks her to marry him, but Michal rejects him, believing that he is not serious. As the date of her wedding approaches and no groom presents himself she begins to panic after more bad dates and tries to reconnect with Yoss, even proposing to him, but he kindly rejects her.  The night before her wedding Michal is filled with conflicting emotions as her mother (Irit Sheleg) doubts her completely, yet her sister and friends begin to have faith. The wedding party travels to the wedding hall where the guests wait in discomfort for something to happen. Shimi finally appears and asks Michal to marry him. Initially believing that she is hallucinating and later that Shimi is only acting out of pity, Michal agrees to marry Shimi after he reminds her of the first time they met; not at the taste test for her wedding, but at his mother's house.

Derrick is waiting for a ride home from his friend Malcolm, and the thief is fleeing the Butcher's two thugs, Tiny and Streets; distracted, the two men unknowingly exchange bags.  After the thief is struck by a car and killed, Derrick leaves with Malcolm.  Before dropping off Derrick, Malcolm says he must take stop to take care of some business.  It turns out to be a shady meeting in an alley, frightening Derrick, who believes it to be a drug deal.  He is relieved but still frustrated when it turns out to be black market meat.  At his parents' house, Derrick's father first tells him he is proud that his son has attended Oxford, but he threatens to throw out Derrick unless he gets a job over the weekend.  Derrick finds employment with a fast food chicken restaurant, annoying his friends, who say he smells like a dead rat.  Derrick, Malcolm, and their friend Tyler later leave for a house party, where they hope to meet up with Derrick's friend Martina.  However, they are denied entry by the hosts, obnoxious rivals who disliked them in high school.  Though the others take it in stride, Derrick becomes flustered and angry, tired of being ridiculed by his peers.  After Derrick cools off, Malcolm and Tyler help him unpack.  There, they discover the money amid his other belongings.  Confused, Derrick says they should look for the owner or bring it to the police, but Malcolm and Tyler convince him they should spend it.  As Derrick's parents have gone to visit family over the weekend, the boys attempt to come up a way to spend all the money in just three days.  They first go on a wild shopping spree, buying designer clothes and dining in an upscale restaurant.  When Malcolm's car is too small to hold all their purchases, they rent a new car.  Thinking back to how angry he was to be denied entry to the earlier party, Derrick suggests they host their own party – one so extravagant and unforgettable that nobody will ever disrespect them again.  The others readily agree, recruiting Malcolm's excitable cousin to quickly spread the word.  They rent a large venue, sparing no expense, and are especially pleased when they have the opportunity to deny entry to the rivals who had previously done the same to them.  Disgusted by Derrick's behavior, Martina leaves his party, telling him that he has become everything he used to hate.  Tiny and Streets, having discovered the bags were switched, reluctantly pay a homeless man in Derrick's neighborhood to point them toward youths who have been ostentatiously spending money.  They crash Derrick's party and introduce him to the Butcher, who gives the boys one day to return his money.  Crushed, they realise they have already spent half.  They go to a casino, hoping to quickly double their money.  Although initially successful, they lose a high-stakes game of blackjack and a followup bet to the winner, who takes their rental car as a prize.  At Derrick's house, Tyler panics and runs, just as Tiny and Streets break in.  The thugs briefly chase the boys, catch them, and take them to the Butcher, who plans to harvest and sell their organs on the black market.  Before he can kill Derrick, the Butcher's accountant interrupts him.  Overhearing the Butcher's financial difficulties, Derrick says he can save the Butcher from paying hefty banking fees.  The Butcher lets them go after Derrick comes through, though they realise they must still clean Derrick's parents' house, which was ransacked by the thugs.  Before they can, the police arrest them for selling rat meat at the fast food restaurant.  After hearing their long story, the police let them go.  As Derrick makes up with Martina, a representative from the rental car company hands them a mysterious bag left in the rental car.  They are overjoyed to find it is full of money.

Weerawarna
  
Welcome to Germany (2016 film)
 The Hartmanns are the former teacher Angelika; her husband Richard, a chief physician; their daughter Sofie, 31, now a psychology student; her brother Philipp, a successful business lawyer who's living in divorce and his 12-year-old son Basti. Richard has problems with aging; He refuses to retire, and undergoes face-lifting with his friend, the cosmetic surgeon Dr. Sascha Heinrich. Angelika is criticized by her husband for her starry-eyed idealism. In a container accommodation for refugees Angelika one day donates used clothes and meets her former colleague Heike Broscher, who gives German courses. Since there are no more staff needed in the accommodation, Angelika decides to adopt a refugee. She discusses it with her family during a meal. Richard and Philipp initially refuse it categorically while Angelika is receiving support from Sofie. Angelika already has an appointment with Bernd Bader, the head of the accommodation. So Richard goes with them and they finally decide on the stand-alone Nigerian Diallo, after previously being presented to several families. Richard is annoyed at work; He repeatedly snubs the ambitious and handsome young doctor Tarek Berger, which one day leads to an indicatory dispute within earshot of other employees. Richard grabs his heart with a distorted face after each of his tantrums. Tarek, in turn, runs a weekly jogging group of refugees, in which Diallo also participates. Richard and Tarek know each other from a birthday party Sofie, when the nine-year-old Tarek destroyed a valuable vase. Diallo, who does handicraft activities in the garden and in the house, has a very good relationship with Angelika. He can not understand many things about the Germans. For example, that Sofie has neither a husband nor children. When Basti shoots a hip-hop video with his friends at school, Diallo acts as a full-time supervisor. The shooting of the video almost gets Basti expelled, but Philipp is able to prevent that. Since Basti also has bad grades, Philipp suggests to the teacher that Basti could accomplish his transfer with a good presentation. Otherwise, Philipp has no time for his son, as he has to constantly fly to Shanghai, where he leads an important project. Once again rushing to his flight, he defies control at the airport and ends up in psychiatry. There, a burnout syndrome is diagnosed. Basti gives a presentation on refugee issues at school, including Diallo, who tells how his village was destroyed by [[Boko Haram]] and how he lost his family.  In the meantime, the exalted Heike has organized a salutation for Diallo in the Villa of Hartmanns, for which she has invited members of an Africa group and a circus; a zebra is also present. The neighbor brings the police because of noise disturbance, who also noticed that the somewhat out of joint party for the asylum seeker Diallo was held. Sophie is followed by her devotee Kurt, who sees an Islamist in Diallo and with a few friends in front of the House of Hartmanns organized a "picket" with torches and "security" calls. There is a fight between the two. Sofie has Kurt taken away by the police, who was called by the neighbor, as an intruder. Diallo wants to bring together the two singles Sofie and Tarek, but they tell him that they want to find a partner themselves, as is customary in Germany. The two eventually meet by chance and fall in love with each other. In a discotheque they come across Richard, who "wants to enjoy life" and is introduced to women by Sascha. Richard has since moved out after differences with Angelika at home. Diallo meets him on a bank by the river and tells him to go home to Angelika, who belongs to him. Richard corrects him that at the most she belongs with him. Diallo's asylum application is rejected. Bernd Bader appeals for him, so that it comes to a court hearing. Basti pleads with his father on the phone in Shanghai to come and defend Diallo. Philipp refuses this initially, but then leaves his assistant to lead the contract negotiations and comes straight to court when the judge wants to read the verdict.  With his rhetoric, he still fights for Diallo and proposes to watch the video of Basti's presentation on the smartphone. But this had already happened, as Basti had this idea, and the judge wanted to announce Diallos asylum recognition anyway. When Richard returns to Angelika, while Tarek introduces himself to her, outside there is a demonstration of right-wing extremists again. Meanwhile, Richard suffers a heart attack and Tarek provides [[First Aid]]. Diallo is now being monitored by anti-terrorist personnel using a drone camera. They misjudge the situation and send a task force to storm the house. When the commanders see that Diallo is helpful and not threatening, the action is canceled. Diallo's verdict finally turns out to be positive and he is celebrating a party with the Hartmanns, Heike and Tarek.

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (film)
 In 2003 New York City, dissatisfied with the state of her career covering low-profile stories, television journalist Kim Baker ([[Tina Fey]]) agrees to take a short assignment as a [[war correspondent]] in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], to the disappointment of her boyfriend Chris ([[Josh Charles]]), who also spends a lot of time traveling. Assigned low-budget living quarters with other international journalists, she begins friendships with noted BBC correspondent Tanya Vanderpoel ([[Margot Robbie]]) and lecherous Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie ([[Martin Freeman]]). After a period of adjustment aided by her Afghan "[[fixer (journalism)|fixer]]" Fahim Ahmadzai ([[Christopher Abbott]]), she begins taking well to the assignment, eliciting frank remarks on camera from soldiers questioning the value of their assignment there, and putting herself in harm's way to capture combat incidents on video. American Marine commander General (previously Colonel) Hollanek ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) takes a dim view of her as an inexperienced nuisance.  Despite the danger, Kim stays in Afghanistan for months, then years beyond her original assignment. She catches Chris unprepared with a middle-of-the-night video call, and finds him with another woman, ending their relationship. Against her better judgment, she begins a sexual relationship with Iain, which over time also develops into a more personal one. Although her status as a woman presents challenges in an Afghan Islamic society which places restrictive roles on women, she also uses it to her advantage, gaining access to women in a village who explain that they've been sabotaging the US-built [[Water well|well]] because they welcome the daily walk to the river away from the men, and recklessly, carrying a camera under a [[burqa]] to record a religious demonstration. She also walks a tightrope, taking advantage of the thinly-veiled sexual interest of Afghan Attorney General Ali Massoud Sadiq ([[Alfred Molina]]) to use him as a source. Fahim – who treated [[opium]] addicts before the war – cautions her, pointing out that danger can be like a drug.  Despite their mutual friendliness, Kim remains in competition with other journalists for stories and for resources from their employers back home. After three years in Afghanistan, Kim flies to New York to argue for more support from her network's new boss, only to discover that Tanya is slated to take over from her. Meanwhile, Iain is kidnapped for ransom while traveling cross-country to cover a developing story that Iain had earlier offered to bring Kim in on. Kim returns "home" to Afghanistan, where she blackmails her "special friend", Ali, for information about Iain's whereabouts, and impresses upon Hollanek the political value to him of rescuing Iain. The mission – accompanied by Kim's cameraman – is a success, both militarily and journalistically. However, shortly after Iain's rescue Kim becomes disillusioned with both her tentative relationship and her station. She then bids farewell to her colleagues and to Fahim, and returns to the U.S. to stay.  After returning, she looks up a Marine ([[Evan Jonigkeit]]) who was transferred, apparently because of his on-camera comments to her, and subsequently lost both of his legs to an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. She tries to apologize for the consequences of her actions, but he refuses to let her take the blame. She moves on to an on-camera desk job, where she later finds herself interviewing Iain, who is going to be in New York soon as part of a tour for his new book, and who invites her to meet him for coffee.

Whisky Galore! (2016 film)
 In 1943, on the small remote island of Todday (pronounced "toddy"), 100 miles to the west of Scotland in the Hebrides, World War II largely passes by the small population that barely notices the effects of rationing until Mr Bain, the barman at the only pub, announces "There is no more whisky. [clap of thunder] The island is dry." It is too much for one elderly man who dies after downing the last whisky in his glass; at his funeral, with there being no whisky, his friends can only bid him farewell with a cup of tea.  Next day the supply ship captain brings no whisky and says the islanders' quotas are cancelled. The islanders are dejected. Only Mrs Campbell is unmoved by the whisky drought - a fierce and domineering Bible-basher who strictly controls and constantly berates her adult son George (the schoolmaster), regularly locking him in his room with only a Bible and bread and cheese. She disapproves of his courtship of Catriona, daughter of widower Joseph Macroon who is the postmaster. The supply ship's captain unloads a case of ammunition which Captain Cyril Waggett, who leads the handful of men forming the island's Home Guard, says is the wrong sort for his soldiers' rifles. Waggett is obliged to hold onto the case, which he has stored in the island post office (which encompasses the telephone exchange and shop). Mr Brown, a mainlander, ostensibly a tweed salesman, also arrives on the supply ship; he encounters local distrust (asking for directions to the public phone box, he is told he'll surely come to it if he turns left, or right).   Macroon's other daughter, Peggy, operates the telephone exchange. She is delighted when her boyfriend Sergeant Donald Odd returns on the supply ship, on leave from the War, having recently fought with the army in Africa and fought in the [[Battle of El Alamein]]. Macroon, however, sadly realises that when his daughters marry soon, they will leave his house and the island, leaving him alone.  The islanders endure two weeks of whisky "drought" during which "morale is very very low". During a stormy night, the freighter S.S. ''Cabinet Minister'' runs aground on the rocks of Skerry Dhu near Todday and starts to sink. Biffer and Sammy row out to investigate and learn from its departing crew, commanded by Captain Buncher, that the cargo consists of various items bound for the United States but all the two islanders focus on is its 50,000 cases of whisky ("12 bottles in each case!" Biffer notes before thanking God). They house the stricken ship's crew in Ma McPhee's Boarding House (the crew later leaves for the mainland) then the islanders prepare to row out to fetch ashore the whisky. But as the church clock starts to toll midnight, the church minister, Macalister, loudly reminds them that the Sabbath has begun. As no work is allowed on the holy Sabbath, everyone despondently goes home.  During the day, a number of islanders stand on the harbour and nearby cliffs looking out at the sinking ship. Waggett is concerned to uphold the law and prevent thievery, so he orders Sergeant Odd, his next in command, to keep watch on the ship from ashore. Macroon tells Odd that there can be no wedding between Odd and Peggy without a [[rèiteach]] (betrothal ceremony) beforehand, and a reiteach requires whisky - no whisky, no reiteach, no wedding. Three of the Home Guard recruits try to sneak up on Odd to incapacitate him; Odd colludes with them and is left tied up and gagged, obviously unable to stop anyone from boarding the ship. Macroon learns from an overheard telephone call that the cargo includes a valuable red leather document case.  As soon as midnight starts tolling (Monday) and once Odd is incapacitated, many of the island's men, accompanied by Peggy, make haste to board the Cabinet Minister. This includes George who, locked in his bedroom by his mother, sneaks out of his bedroom window and jumps down. They bring ashore many but not all the crates of whisky before they have to abandon the ship when it sinks. Macroon sneaks ashore the document case that he found, hidden inside a whisky case. They load the crates onto Biffer and Sammy's lorry, pausing only at Macalister's behest as they praise God for his bounty. They take the crates to a cave at Seal Bay, stash the crates there and take away many bottles for immediate or imminent consumption.  The adult population live it up in the pub as the stolen whisky flows freely, and there is dancing and music. Mr Bain is annoyed that he cannot charge his customers (Sammy assures him he will be robbing them again soon enough), and later Bain informs Waggett that there are 200 cases of looted whisky on the island. On Bain's further information, Waggett goes to Seal Bay and sees the stashed crates for himself.  The documents in the red case comprise love letters written by the Duke of Windsor to his wife (known as Wallis Simpson before they married in 1936). The Duke is considered an embarrassment to the Establishment due to his undisguised admiration for Hitler and Nazism. Macroon, who has realised who or what Mr Brown is, contacts him and gives him the document case on condition that Brown's official report to the government will give a glowing report on the inept Waggett, in the hope that he will not be replaced by someone "more efficient."  At the reiteach, a quaich containing whisky is passed along for everyone to drink, and speeches are made to honour the forthcoming weddings of Odd and Peggy and of Catriona and George. As the whisky flows, Macalister announces (with Constable McPhee beside him) that he will conduct the marriage ceremonies on the solstice. Wild celebrations ensue, with much downing of whisky. George imbibes heavily, and Catriona hopes the alcohol will give him the courage necessary to insist on the wedding to his mother. It does, and George gives his mother an ultimatum - either accept Catriona or "emigrate to Glasgow"; she is appalled that he is drunk on "Satan's drink" but when she tries to chastise him he plays the [[bagpipe]]s at her.  Waggett rings Peggy at the telephone exchange and asks her to ensure that the case of ordnance is put aboard the next supply ship. Later, knowing that Peggy reports useful news she overhears while connecting phone calls, Waggett gets her to put through his call to his superior officer Woolsey, pretending he will travel to Obaig to meet him to discuss the said ordnance. However, Waggett actually goes to Nobast to fetch Farquharson, a Customs & Excise officer. Farquharson has had run-ins with Macroon before, and his men search his house, with Constable McPhee checking the upper floor. But the Macroons have been warned by a grateful Mr Brown and by a local named Roddy, and Farquharson finds nothing. The whisky has been poured into ingenious hiding places such as the cold water tank (and islanders are busy hiding it in walls, gutters etc), and the ordnance has been secretly removed from the case and replaced by bottles of whisky. Waggett sees the ordnance case and sharply reminds Peggy to at once put it out for the imminent supply ship and Constable McPhee says he will see to it. Farquharson tells Waggett go by car while he sails the customs boat to Seal Bay - he and McPhee will seize the whisky crates and the remaining whisky. Macroon, his daughters, George, Biffer and Sammy realise the destination when Mr Bain admits that he had told Waggett to look at Seal Bay. Macroon's daughters delay Waggett by boxing in his parked car while Angus cycles around telling everyone to rush to Seal Bay. The men, including Macroon, George, Biffer and Sammy, hurry to Seal Bay along the beach in the latter's lorry, which the islanders load with the whisky crates. Farquharson and Waggett find only an empty cave. On the return journey the lorry runs out of fuel and they empty two bottles of whisky into the fuel tank, which enables them to once again put distance between themselves and the pursuing Farquharson. But they leave behind the two used bottles, which Farquharson and Waggett find, proving to Farquharson that Waggett's story is true. Angus stops their car on the road, and points his Home Guard rifle at them, declaring that the Nazis may have invaded and, countering Waggett's indignation, that someone may be impersonating Waggett. He demands the password, but they do not know it. Farquharson mentions whisky in conversation with Waggett. Angus says "whisky" is the correct password and stands aside. Farquharson soon has the whisky-laden lorry in sight but the narrow road is obstructed by a number of islanders on bicycles (those who moved the whisky from Seal Bay, and led by Peggy and Odd) who decline to make way, and the lorry escapes.  At Waggett's house, his wife Dolly pours tea for Farquharson, Waggett and McPhee. Farquharson phones a report to his superiors. He then informs Waggett, with some relish, that he has been ordered to take Waggett to Obaig for interrogation, because he sent a case there which contained bottles of whisky identified as coming from the S.S. ''Cabinet Minister''. From his personal share of the looted whisky McPhee pours two drams for Waggett and his wife to bid farewell to each other with.

Mr Bain is denied a dance by a woman in return for his informing about the whisky but, forgiven by all, joins in a country dance later. Catriona and Peggy have a moment with their father, assuring him that they love him and that it is him that makes the day.

After seeing the drugs that Blue deals, Leah tells him he could easily be making $60 compared to the $20 he's been selling them for. She invites him to a party thrown by the magazine she's interning for and Blue is indeed able to mark up his prices to the mostly white crowd.  Emboldened by his success Blue visits his supplier Lloyd (Adrian Martinez) and asks him to give him a kilo of cocaine (another possible meaning for the title "White Girl").

He is immediately arrested by an undercover cop as it turns out he's been set up. Leah picks up the kilo and quietly leaves with it.  Leah goes to visit Blue in jail where he tells her that due to his priors he will be getting 20 years in jail.

Leah promises George that she will get him the rest of the money but he tells her to forget about it. He takes her to dinner where he explains that the legal system is unequal and white boys who commit violent crimes are more likely to get off for their crimes than non-violent offenders like Blue.

The Whole Truth (2016 film)
 Defense attorney Richard Ramsay works on a tough case to defend 17-year-old Mike Lassiter, who is suspected of murdering his wealthy lawyer father Boone Lassiter. Ramsay is a very good friend of the Lassiter family, having worked with Boone for many years, and is trying hard to save Mike from being sentenced for murder. Despite this, Mike shows cold hostility to Ramsay, and remains mostly quiet during the trial, which makes Ramsay's job as defense attorney harder. Ramsay enlists the help of a young lawyer Janelle as his assistant, who is determined to find out the truth about what happened.    The witnesses are called to testify details of the case; the first witness, a flight attendant, states that Mike and Boone had a serious argument in-flight when Boone insisted that Mike study law at Stanford. The police officer who first responded to the call testifies that at the scene of the crime, Mike muttered that he did it, and only his fingerprints were found on the knife used to kill Boone. As Mike refuses to talk to Ramsay, he is unable to present his defense.   The Lassiters' neighbors are called next, who testify that Mike was very close to Boone in childhood, and became a law prodigy in high school to follow his father's footsteps. However, Boone recently became extremely violent to his wife Loretta, which caused Mike's relationship with his father to deteriorate. Loretta now testifies that Boone did indeed verbally and physically abuse her many times, with the most recent time on the day of his death. After Boone assaulted her, she went into bathroom to have a shower. When she came out, she saw Boone was already dead and Mike was standing near his corpse. Ramsey presents a health report as evidence, which proves her injuries.   Mike suddenly tells Ramsey that he is now ready to present his testimony. Ramsey is hesitant because he is unsure what Mike wants to say, but Mike threatens to dismiss Ramsey from acting as his defense attorney. Mike affirms in court that his father did frequently assault his mother, but that was not the reason he killed him. Mike reveals that Boone had molested him many times throughout his teenage years, and he wanted to go to a further university to escape from his father. He also states that Boone was angry over this decision and raped him on the flight, and was attempting to do so again before he left for college. This caused him to fight back at his father and lead to him stabbing Boone with a knife. The prosecutor requests the flight attendant to be recalled, who insists that she did not notice Mike being sexually assaulted by his father. However, Janelle (with suggestions from Mike) reveals that the flight attendant had an extramarital affair with the pilot, and lied in court to avoid being discovered. This information was enough to discredit her testimony and win support from the jury.  After reconsidering Mike's testimony and his mother's reactions, Janelle confronts Loretta outside the courtroom. She deduced that Loretta killed Boone after being assaulted, and Mike was merely trying to take the blame himself to protect his mother. Loretta angrily denies this accusation. Janelle presents this information to Ramsey, but he acts indifferently, stating that all that matters is that this gives him a chance to save Mike. Despite being disgusted by Ramsey's lack of morality, Janelle chooses to remain in court to assist Ramsey in the case.  The jury announce their decision: Mike Lassiter is found not guilty of murder. Ramsey congratulates Mike, but Mike asks to speak with him in private. Mike approaches Ramsey outside of court and reveals that he saw Ramsey's watch at the scene of the crime and angrily accuses Ramsey as the one who murdered his father.  Ramsey recalls the true events that happened. Loretta was secretly having an affair with Ramsey, and Boone became suspicious of his wife's infidelity. To protect her from further abuse, Ramsey conspired with Loretta to kill Boone and disguise it as self defense. On that day, Ramsey was the one who murdered Boone, but before he and Loretta could tamper with the crime scene, Mike returned home. Ramsey hastily escaped from the Lassiter house, and Mike subsequently planned the series of events to protect his mother.

An aspiring [[Poetry|poet]] with a fixation on [[Paris, France]], Rosie collects her poems in a book which she self-publishes.  The book gets the attention of the organizers of a poetry festival in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]].  Though Gloria is adamantly opposed to Rosie going to Iran, she eventually relents after seeing Rosie's determination.  Her grandparents pack a black [[chador]] for Rosie to wear in Iran, though Rosie soon finds many festival guests are confused by her appearance as Rosie is not a devout [[Islam|Muslim]] and women in Iran are not required by law to wear chadors.  Among the poets, Rosie meets at the festival are festival cultural ambassador Mehrnaz, Chinese poet Di Di, and [[Germany|German]] poet Dietmar.  At a competition early in the festival, Rosie performs one of her poems by singing it, but is scored poorly by the judges as she was unaware that a woman singing in public is considered provocative in Iran.  Mehrnaz remains supportive, later on bringing Rosie to the tomb of famous Shiraz poet [[Hafez]] for inspiration.  In contrast, Dietmar is relentlessly disdainful of Rosie's poetic style and hangup for Paris.  However, Dietmar's satirical poem about wealthy Europeans feeding expensive food to their dogs at the dinner table is badly received, not realizing until after his performance the local audience found the premise of dogs eating at the table alongside humans to be deeply offensive.  Rosie calms a panicked Dietmar with the idea of a [[Poetry Slam|slam]], wherein both poets improvise a poem together.  Their improvisation goes over well with their audience, and Dietmar reconciles with Rosie.  A traditional consultation with the poems of Hafez leads Mehmaz to assign Rosie the task of translating one of Di Di's poems to English for her to perform at the end of the festival.  As Rosie talks to Di Di, she learns that Di Di is a political exile who was in the [[United Kingdom]] at the time of the [[Beijing massacre]] and has refused to return to China.

Early in the festival, Rosie reveals that her father Mehran was Iranian; she claims he abandoned her family when she was seven.  As her visit in Iran goes on, she discovers more about her father from his friends and family. Rosie learns that Mehran came from a prominent family in Shiraz and originally trained in the [[United States]] to be a fighter pilot in the Iranian Air Force back when the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] still ruled.  When the [[Iranian Revolution]] occurred, Mehran's ties to the Shah led to him being forced out of the Air Force; he became a teacher of poetry and literature instead.  However, the government reinstated him when they needed pilots for the [[Iran–Iraq War]].  As the war dragged on, Mehran grew so disillusioned that he [[Desertion|deserted]] the Air Force, fleeing to [[Turkey]], where he Caroline on a beach.  The couple married and settled in [[Canada]].  Despite the risks involved, Mehran decided to return to Iran to see his dying mother, only to be arrested upon arrival and for his passport revoked.  His departure deeply upset Caroline, which caused her to drive carelessly and resulted in a fatal car accident.  When Mehran was finally released, he asked for Rosie to be sent to live with him in Iran.  Grief-stricken from the loss of Caroline, Rosie's grandparents refused, moving to Vancouver and cutting off all contact with Mehran, and lying to Rosie that her father abandoned her.

By the time Rosie reaches the hospital Mehran has already checked out, but she is given her father's home address by one of his friends who is a doctor at the hospital.  Rosie meets her relatives from her father's side, who welcome her into the family and show her all the letters that Mehran wrote to her but her grandparents returned.  When Rosie learns that her father is responsible for inviting her to Iran and is waiting for her at the festival, Rosie's relatives replace chador with a head scarf and a more casual outfit and rush to the presentation.

The Windmill Massacre
 After fleeing Australia, Jennifer takes a job as a nanny in the Netherlands.  Her employer eventually discovers her true identity and that she is a fugitive.  Looking for a way to quickly leave Amsterdam, she attempts to bluff her way onto a tour bus.  Abe, the driver, allows her to board without a ticket, joking that "there's always room for another sinner".  The other tourists include the British businessman Douglas and his son, Curt; Jackson, a British soldier who accidentally killed a prostitute prior to boarding; Ruby, a French photographer sent to take pictures of windmills; Takashi, a university student who speaks only Japanese; and Nicholas, a troubled British physician.  Takashi recognizes Ruby as a promotional model who starred in a popular Japanese advertising campaign.  Responding to him in Japanese, Ruby downplays her fame and asks him not to cause a scene.  Jennifer drops a pill bottle, and Nicholas hands it back to her after examining the label.  After seeing her dead father standing in the road, Jennifer claims the bus has struck a man.  The other passengers become annoyed when she insists on checking, and the situation only worsens when Abe can not restart the bus.  Abe suggests they wait for help to arrive, but Jackson and Jennifer leave to investigate a nearby windmill.  After having flashbacks of killing the prostitute, Jackson is suddenly maimed by a scythe-wielding demon.  Jennifer flees as the demon kills Jackson.  The other tourists do not believe her, and Nicholas points out that the bottle she dropped earlier was for an antipsychotic.  Jennifer angrily denies being crazy.  The others attempt to calm her but do not believing her story about a demon.  As they argue, the bus wobbled precariously.  The panicked passengers quickly disembark, and Jennifer accidentally causes Curt to injure his hand.  Douglas announces that his son is a [[hemophilia|hemophiliac]] and accuses Jennifer of causing all their problems.  Abe leads them to an abandoned cabin and leaves to seek help from the miller at windmill, over Jennifer's objections.  Takashi wanders off alone and, after seeing a ghostly apparition of his beloved grandmother, expresses remorse for abandoning her.  He is apparently killed by the demon.  After returning, Abe finds an ancient document that says a local Devil-worshipping miller became an avenging demon after he was burned alive.  Each of the tourists find personal items in the cabin that remind them of dark secrets, and they experience nightmares or flashbacks.  Jennifer is revealed to have unintentionally caused her younger brother's death while killing their abusive father.  After treating Curt, Nicholas wanders outside, where he denounces a silent, ghostly patient for ruining his career because he was drunk while operating on her, causing her death.  Takashi returns to the others, witnessing the demon as it kills Nicholas.  The others at first blame Jennifer for Nicholas' death, but Takashi says, through Ruby's translation, that the demon spared him because of his remorse.  As the others come to believe Jennifer, they admit their sins: Ruby says she hired a yakuza to disfigure a rival model in Japan, and Douglas admits to killing his wife.  Ruby drowns after admiring her reflection in a pool of water, and the demonic miller decapitates Douglas.  Abe kills Takahashi, revealing himself as the miller's assistant, since the miller can not kill innocents or remorseful people.  Abe lures Curt and Jennifer back to the windmill under the pretense of helping them to set it on fire.  Jennifer expresses no regret for killing her abusive father, and the miller attacks her.  She is saved when Curt escapes Abe and sets the windmill on fire. As the miller disappears, Jennifer remembers her dead brother and risks her life to rescue Curt, slashing Abe's neck.  Abe survives his wound by using the dead tourists' ground bones in the mill to staunch the bleeding.  As he taunts Jennifer, telling her she can not escape her fate, the miller reappears and kills her in front of Curt.  Later, Abe picks up another bus load of tourists.  When one of them can not pay, Abe allows him on the bus, repeating the same line from earlier.

The Women's Balcony
 An orthodox congregation in Jerusalem is celebrating a [[Bar Mitzvah]] when a section of the synagogue’s balcony, where the women sit, collapses. The rabbi’s wife is badly injured and in a coma. The elder rabbi, unable to cope with his wife’s condition, cannot function and is cared for by Zion. Rebuilding, with all the funding, permits and inspections is too much for the leaderless congregation. Congregants meeting in a schoolroom for morning prayers, are short of a quorum of ten men (a [[minyan]]) and stop a man in hassidic garb passing down the street who agree to join them. He is Rabbi David, a teacher, and he brings some of his students who more than meet the minyan requirement.   Hearing their story, Rabbi David takes charge and gets the synagogue repaired, but does not complete the woman balcony, claiming a lack of funds. Trying to get the congregation to be more strict in their observance, Rabbi David tells the men to get their wives to cover their heads and suggests they buy their wives nice head scarves as a gift.  The women mostly refuse. Angered at the lack of a place for them in the synagogue, the women, led by Etti, Zion’s wife, raise money sufficient to pay for the reconstruction and deposit it in the synagogue’ bank account, but Rabbi David refuses to allow rebuilding, saying the congregation’s Torah scroll, which was destroyed in the collapse, must first be replaced. Meanwhile Rabbi David’s assistant is discretely courting Etti’s niece.  The women leave their husbands saying they won’t return until the balcony is built and later picket Rabbi David’s school. The synagogue’s treasurer who must countersign any construction check has been avoiding the rabbi so he can’t be pressured into signing. Rabbi David visits the old rabbi and tries to convince him that demanding a new Torah scroll be written before completing the balcony is justified under Jewish law, but the old rabbi is still in shock and can’t respond.  Unable to find the treasurer, a determined Rabbi David forges a second signature and gives the check to his assistant to cash in order to pay a [[Sofer|scribe]] to write the new scroll. He further tells the assistant that he knows about the girl and forbids the relationship. He also gives the assistant legal notices, demanding they end their protest, to hand out to the picketing women. As Rabbi David watches from his office window, the assistant does so, seeming to ignore the niece, but she soon realizes that instead of a notice, he has handed her the check, thereby allowing the balcony reconstruction to begin. Meanwhile the old rabbi asks to see his wife in the hospital, finally coming to terms with what has happened. The film ends with the young couple’s joyous wedding, with the old rabbi in attendance, and Rabbi David being flagged down by another congregation that is seeking a minyan.

Yoga Hosers
 Colleen Collette and Colleen McKenzie are two average 15-year-old girls that spend their days studying [[yoga]] with their guru, Yogi Bayer, and working an after-school job at a [[Manitoba]] convenience store called Eh-2-Zed. They are also in a cover band called Glamthrax with their 35-year-old friend, Ichabod, on drums. The two are invited to a party by a popular senior, Hunter Calloway, who is the object of Colleen M's affections.  The next day at school, the girls' history teacher informs the class that the [[Nazi Party]] once had an influence in [[Winnipeg]]. Led by the self-proclaimed "Canadian [[Führer]]" [[Adrien Arcand]] and his right-hand-man, Andronicus Arcane, the Canadian Nazis were once a great force of terror. Arcand was later arrested by Federal authorities, but Andronicus Arcane was never found.  Colleen C's father Bob, who owns the Eh-2-Zed, and his girlfriend Tabitha, the store's manager, decide to take a spontaneous trip to [[Niagara Falls]], leaving the girls to run the store on the night of Hunter's party. The Colleens invite Hunter and his friend Gordon Greenleaf to bring the party to the store so that they won't miss out. Colleen M escorts Hunter to the back room at his request, only to discover that Hunter and Gordon are actually [[Satanism|Satanists]] who wish to sacrifice and dismember the Colleens. Before this can occur, an army of little monsters called Bratzis (one-foot-tall Nazis made from [[bratwurst]]) attack and kill Hunter and Gordon. Using their yoga skills, the Colleens fight and defeat the Bratzis, but are soon arrested for the murder of Hunter and Gordon.  Legendary man-hunter Guy LaPointe, who had an [[Tusk (2014 film)|encounter with the Colleens once before]], arrives at the police station to interrogate the girls. Having obtained some of his own evidence of the Bratzis, he believes the girls' testimony and wishes to help them prove their innocence. After sneaking them out of the station and taking them back to the Eh-2-Zed, LaPointe and the Colleens are knocked unconscious by the Bratzis. They are taken to an underground lair beneath the store where they find the Bratzis' master, Andronicus Arcane.  Arcane reveals to LaPointe and the Colleens that he once had dreams of becoming an artist. After having his work ridiculed by various critics, he decided to become a scientist for the Canadian Nazi movement. The Nazis hid him in the underground lair to create a clone army to conquer Canada and the United States. The clones, made from bratwurst and Arcane's DNA, needed to incubate for 100 years before they were fully grown, so Arcane cryogenically froze himself until the time when he and his clones could rise again. This process was interrupted when a power outage at the Eh-2-Zed 70 years later caused Arcane to thaw and the clones' incubation to stop, rendering them just one foot in height. Learning that the Nazi Party had long since been defeated, Arcane began a new mission to kill all critics as revenge for those that poorly reviewed his early work. He reveals he has constructed a ten-foot-tall [[goaltender]] from body parts of the Bratzis' victims to carry out his murderous deeds. This "Goalie Golem" is controlled by the Bratzis who operate it from its insides. No longer wishing to follow Arcane's orders, the Golem kills him and then turns on the Colleens. The Colleens once again use their yoga skills to defeat the Golem and soon after, clear their names.  After being dubbed "Hero Clerks" by the media, the Colleens return to their normal lives and end the film with a cover of "[[O, Canada]]", accompanied on guitar by Guy LaPointe.

Then, the screen moves to the present where they show newly wedded couple Balaji alias Bala ([[Ashwin Kakumanu]]) and Priya ([[Sshivada]]) moving into their new apartment. Bala's father Vijay Kumar ([[Ravi Raghavendra]]) does not approve of the marriage because of a history of mental illness in Priya's family. Her mother had gone mad after she was pregnant with Priya, and died giving birth to her. But Bala accepts Priya even after knowing her past, due to the great love he has on her. After moving into their new home, the young couple visit a store where she takes some lipsticks without paying and claims that she does not remember taking it. She argues with the security guard and is forced to leave. After returning home and refusing to meet Bala's visiting father, she shares her past with her neighbour and tells how she cannot get pregnant. Later that night, Priya dreams about her mother and talks to her about how everyone today called her a thief, and initially reluctant, she accepts that she stole the lipstick and explains that how she has an affinity towards pink color and how she enjoys it, and after that, she soon enters a world where her mother is and starts sleepwalking at night. This is the part where weird and eerie things begin to happen around her and she starts seeing illusions and becomes almost mad and stabs Bala one day. She gets stucked into the world   where her mom is and [[Lilith]], a [[Biblical]] demon ([[Andreanne Nouyrigat]]) starts to roam freely after taking over the body of Priya. Bala searches for Solomon ([[JD Chakravarthy]]), who has the supernatural ability to speak with ghosts and is an occult specialist and explains the situation to him. Solomon confronts the possessed Priya and when Priya/Lilith touches Solomon, he sees everything about the being called Lilith who was created before Eve at the beginning of the time with Adam and how when Lilith rebelled and abandoned Adam did God create Eve as Adam's better half. God had cursed Lilith for abandoning Adam with the inability to have a child and Lilith conceived so many times with the devil's child but every child was dead as still born, and she finally becomes a hateful spirit who, over the time as a spirit, tortured and caused pregnant women to miscarry, and kill themselves and trapping their soul in her spirit world, and Priya is the only child to escape her death, and now she wants to destroy the world as part of devils' bidding. It is revealed that the Devil himself, in the form of a snake has sent Lilith to carry his mission to destroy the world. Since Bala is a hindrance in her mission, she decides to kill him, but the Devil suggests that since Lilith resides in Priya's body and if Lilith touches Bala, her powers will be lost, as Priya and Bala have been soulmates for the past 7 births and their love is more stronger than Lilith. Solomon explains the situation to other priests and priests from different parts of the world come together to challenge Lilith but they eventually fail. When Lilith tries to choke Bala, he touches her, and Priya starts to remember all the times they spent together and gets unpossessed and returns back to the real world where Balaji and Solomon are, and when Lilith is about to possess Priya again, God freezes the time and saves the world and the God blesses Priya with pregnancy, it is then revealed that the God chose the couple to be the parents of his child and also destroys Lilith permanently. The film ends with the Devil in the form a snake taking his usual form of a giant human and vowing to complete his mission by himself, hence hinting at a possible sequel, '''Zero-2'''.

Bored, she wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins [[Body swap|switching bodies]] intermittently with Taki, a high school boy in Tokyo when they wake up. They communicate by leaving notes in Mitsuha's notebook and memos on Taki's phone, and sometimes by writing on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.  Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the shrine on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god who rules human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about a comet expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].  One day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha, but cannot reach her, and the body switching ends. He decides to visit Itomori, but does not know its name, his memories of it are fading, and Mitsuha's messages have disappeared. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him it was destroyed by a fragment of the comet. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers the date of the disaster. He realizes their timelines were separated by three years.  Taki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's ''kuchikamizake'', hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her of the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that Mitsuha, having fallen in love with him, met his past self while trying to meet him personally. He wakes in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces his identity, and tells him the body switching is part of the Miyamizu family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends Tessie and Sayaka to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a false emergency alert, but the plan fails. He realizes that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine and goes back to find her.  Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. Although they sense each other's presence, they are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls, they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.  As Mitsuha races back to town to convince her estranged father, the Itomori mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade. She realizes that Taki wrote "I love you" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece splits into two, one kept moving but the other one crashed onto to Earth, destroying Itomori. Taki wakes up in his own time at the shrine, remembering nothing.  Five years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important and learns that inhabitants of Itomori survived by following the mayor's order. He recognizes Tessie and Sayaka in a Tokyo restaurant, now engaged, but cannot identify them, and both Taki and Mitsuha's friends and family are shown to be pursuing their own paths. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. Feeling they have met before, they simultaneously ask for each other's name.

Yugo & Lala 3
   
Your Lie in April (film)
 Kosei Arima is a pianist who has won many awards and recognition due to his precision, timing, and ability to switch between tempos easily, earning him the moniker "human [[metronome]]". However, he came so far to his position because he was meticulously taught by his terminally ill mother, Saki, who was abusive and demanding. When, as a seven-year-old, she slapped him after a victory that she deemed unwarranted, he declared his refusal to play the piano again and wished that she died. Indeed, Saki died the following day; this caused Kosei to experience a [[mental breakdown]], making him unable to hear sounds from the piano as well as seeing everything as [[Color blindness|black and white]]. Kosei subsequently quit the venue.  Sometime in April of his teenage years, Kosei is asked by his childhood friends, Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryota Watari, to go on a [[double date]] with them and Kaori Miyazono, whom Tsubaki says is attracted to Watari. Kaori, as it turns out, is a bubbly children-loving violinist. She plays the violin in an unorthodox manner, refusing to follow the cues and instead creating her own flow that nevertheless impresses the audience. One of her competitions requires that a pianist play with her, so Kaori forces Kosei to come out retirement and assist her. During the competition, Kosei experiences a breakdown again, but Kaori encourages him to restart the recital, despite the fact that it will disqualify her. He succeeds and while Kaori is disqualified, she is invited to play at a gala concert. For the gala, Kaori picks [[Alt-Wiener Tanzweisen|Love's Sorrow]], a piece that Saki used to play as a lullaby for her son. Kosei is initially hesitant, but his mother's pianist friend, Hiroko Seto, tells him that it would be a good chance to prove to his mother what a pianist he has become.  During the concert, Kaori is unexpectedly hospitalized, so Kosei plays the piece solo. Kaori is later released and forces Kosei to "replace" Watari for a date the two had made, as a punishment for his not showing up for her during her hospitalization. The two visit the school that night, where Kaori reveals that she had lied about the date, as she is still hospitalized, but she does not want her illness to make her helpless. When she collapses, Kosei takes her to the hospital but otherwise is unable to say anything else. Watari correctly deduces that he is in love with her and encourages him to meet and confess to her. Meanwhile, Tsubaki anguishedly declares her own love for Kosei and reveals that she agreed to introduce Kaori because she hoped that would make Kosei turn to her. Afterwards, Kosei confesses to Kaori as the two share a meal in the rooftop, also saying that he has taken up a piano competition. Hearing his wish for her to play with him again, Kaori decides to undergo an risky operation. During the competition, Kosei is aided by an image of Kaori playing violin alongside him.  At spring of the following year, Kosei opens a letter written by Kaori, who did not survive her operation. He learns that Kaori had been admiring him since very young and decided to take violin so she could someday play with him. When she learned that her illness was [[Terminal illness|terminal]], she transformed her image and personality drastically. Telling him to apologize to Tsubaki and Watari in her place, she also said about her lie in the April of the previous year: when she said that she was in love with Watari, she was in fact in love with Kosei.

Zootopia
  In a world populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] mammals, rabbit Judy Hopps from [[Rural area|rural]] Bunnyburrow fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a [[police officer]] in [[urban area|urban]] Zootopia. Despite being the academy [[valedictorian]], Judy is delegated to [[parking enforcement officer|parking duty]] by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. On her first day, she is hustled by a [[Confidence trick|con artist]] fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.  The next day, Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of [[crocus]] bulbs known as ''Midnicampum holicithias''. Bogo reprimands her, but an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen [[Predation|predators]] who are missing. When Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment, Bogo has no choice but to let Judy take the case. He gives her 48 hours to find Emmitt Otterton on the condition that if she fails, she resigns.  Judy blackmails Nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to [[tax evasion]], having ascertained from the 'last-sighting' photo of Otterton that Nick was the last to see him. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went "savage"—reverted to a [[Feral animal|feral state]]—and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about "night howlers" before the attack. Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but when they arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds Bogo that Judy still has ten hours to solve the case.  At City Hall, Bellwether offers Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the "night howlers". They locate the missing predators—all gone savage—imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart hides them from the public while trying to determine the cause of their behavior. Lionheart and those involved are arrested for false imprisonment and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.  Judy, praised for solving the case, has become friends with Nick and asks him to join the ZPD as her partner. However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior, and her comments cause tension between predators and prey throughout the city. Feeling guilty for the results of her words, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.  Back in Bunnyburrow, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and that they have severe [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic effects]] on mammals, causing them to go savage. After returning to Zootopia and reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who tells them the bulbs he stole were for a [[Sheep|ram]] named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway, developing a drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a [[Tranquillizer gun|dart gun]].  Judy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and takes the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a [[Supremacism|prey-supremacist]] conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibition after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him kill Judy and summons the ZPD for help, but Judy and Nick have replaced the serum pellets in Bellwether's gun with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame the pair for the attacks, but Judy has covertly recorded Bellwether's confession. Bogo and the ZPD arrive and Bellwether is arrested.  Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of Bellwether's plot and states that his imprisonment of the savage predators was a "wrong thing for the right reason". With the cause of the epidemic identified, the savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.

Zulfiqar (film)
    Zulfiqar Ahmed ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee]]) is a Godfather figure and the most prominent member of ''Syndicate'' - a powerful organization which oversees most of the happenings in the heart of the city. Basheer Khan ([[Kaushik Sen]]), a member of ''Syndicate'' is a [[Indian nationalism|nationalist]], a [[gangster]] and the best friend of Zulfiqar, who does not support [[terrorism]]. Tony Braganza([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]) is the brain of ''The Syndicate'' who oversees the financial things of the organization, and Markaz Ali ([[Dev (actor)|Dev]]) is the brawn. If need be, Tony can shoot a bullet, but he is a man of the papers. Tony and Markaz have grown up together and they are inseparable. Though Zulfiqar is married to Karishma Ahmed ([[Paoli Dam]]), he continues an [[extramarital affair]] with Rani Talapatra ([[Nusrat Jahan]]), a [[money-lender]], and the owner of the "Blue Nile Bar", who in turns loves Markaz and vice versa. Kashinath Kundu ([[Jisshu Sengupta]]) is the wily and scheming guy of ''The Syndicate'', who has an ambition for power. The ''Syndicate'' also have some corrupt government officials as members, like [[Customs officer]] Kaushik Sinha ([[Sujan Mukhopadhyay]]), Port Trust officer Tribhuban Gupta ([[Srijato]]), and a policeman, Laltu Das ([[Rahul Banerjee (actor)|Rahul Banerjee]]). Zulfiqar is more equal than the others who carries his aura lightly, but even in this group of equals, his opinion on matters of business and policy weigh a bit more. Not everyone likes this including Kashinath Kundu who fuels Basheer's growing individuality and makes him believe that Zulfiqar was the one who gave shelter to [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] terrorists who came to [[West Bengal]] some days earlier by showing him some fake photographs and documents.  Basheer, fully convinced about Zulfiqar's involvement in helping the terrorists to hide in [[West Bengal]], reluctantly decides to kill him with the other conspirators on the auspicious occasion of [[Eid al-Fitr]]. Karishma has nightmares of some upcoming danger that is yet to take place with Zulfiqar and repeatedly prevents him from going out on [[Eid al-Fitr]]. Zulfiqar, to calm down his wife, decides not to get out. But Danish, ''Syndicate'''s member, escorts him to go out. Tony and Markaz had no idea about the conspiracy and they were prevented from attending the meeting by Tribhuban, who held both of them for some other cause. During the ''Syndicate'' meeting, Mithilesh Sikdar (Prasun Gayen) urges the members to rid his brother of the exile, given to him due to the latter's hand in killing of innocent people. Though majority of the members gave their nod to the proposal, Zulfiqar denies the proposal and also told that there is no one to oppose him. This brings an ending to Zulfiqar's rule as the conspirators with Sharafat Qasim ([[Aryann Roy]]) shoots first with others, including Basheer Khan, Kashinath Kundu, Kaushik Sinha, Shishir Tili (Barun Chakraborty) to end Zulfiqar's rule once and for all, whereas Laltu Das and Pavel Lateef (Aritra Dutta) escape due to the fact that Basheer didn't want to kill any innocent.  After Zulfiqar's death, Tony and Markaz, along with Zulfiqar's son Akhtar Ahmed ([[Ankush Hazra]]), Laltu Das, Rani Talapatra, Pavel Lateef and Tony's favourite aide Chenno Bablu ([[Kanchan Mullick]]) go into hiding. Basheer calls them, asking to return on the occasion of Zulfiqar's funeral. At the funeral, Basheer delivers an oration defending his actions and for the moment the crowd, which have gathered outside the assassination spot to know the reasons for Zulfiqar's murder, is on the conspirators's side. However, Tony and Markaz, with a subtle and eloquent speech over Zulfiqar's corpse deftly turns public opinion against the assassins by manipulating the emotions of the common people. Tony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to avenge Zulfiqar's murder. The conspirators go into hiding, but one by one Markaz, Tony and Laltu finds and kills Tribhuban, Shishir Tili, and Kaushik's twin brother (whom they mistake for Kaushik). Basheer reveals that his beloved wife Pariza Khan ([[June Maliah]]) had committed suicide under the stress of his absence after which the conspirators prepare for a gang war against the loyalists. That night, Zulfiqar's ghost appears to Basheer and tell him, he too will know everything when the right time comes and then once more the ghost will appear. Skirmishes and shootouts occur between the loyalists and the conspirators, in which Pavel, Mithilesh and Qasim is killed. Danish is shot during another shootout, and before his last breath he whispers something to Basheer. Kashinath inadvertently reveals his conspiracy against Zulfiqar to Basheer, the faking of the photographs and how he brainwashed Basheer into killing his best friend, after which Basheer informs him what Danish told him in his last moments- Kashinath is the illegitimate brother of Pariza. Now both of them indulges in a [[hand-to-hand combat]], which ends when they kill each other. With his dying breath, Basheer again sees the ghost of Zulfiqar, as promised before.  The remaining part of the story follows the growing evil ambition of Akhtar, along with Markaz's relationship with Rani Talapatra, and Tony's marriage to Albeena ([[Kyra Dutt]]), Akhtar's sister. With the ''Syndicate'' no more existing, Akhtar systematically removes every obstacle in his path, forcing Markaz and Rani to suicide, and killing Tony, Chheno Bablu, and Laltu, and ultimately becoming the new, all-powerful gangster of the area like his father.  
Zutto Mae Kara Suki Deshita
 The movie is centered around a group of high school friends who struggle to confess their love. The story begins when Natsuki Enomoto confesses to her childhood friend Yu Setoguchi. The movie cuts to its opening, Blooming into the Color of Love ("Koi-iro ni Sake"). After the opening, an embarrassed Natsuki denies her love for Yu and calls it a "practice confession." The next day Natsuki is confronted by her friends, Akari Hayasaka and Mio Aida, and admits her failed confession. Her friends cheer her on and discuss Mio's love life; Mio has feelings for her close friend Haruki Serizawa. Although Mio and Natsuki are having problems confessing their love, Akari remains untroubled by the possibility of unrequited love. However, she is the main focus of a boy in her class named Sota Mochizuki, who has been in love with her since the opening ceremony of school. Sota, nicknamed Mochita by his friends, has never talked to Akari and constantly has conversations with his devilish conscience about whether to confess his love. As Sota is feeling alone in his battle to tell Akari, he notices that one of his classmates, Koyuki Ayase, is secretly in love with Natsuki. Koyuki has changed his look, no longer wearing glasses and having cut his hair.  After school, Natsuki goes over to Yu's house and plays videos game with his sister, Hina Setoguchi. When Yu arrives home they begin studying and Natsuki asks Yu what he would do if she got a boyfriend. He responds he would support her, even though he is secretly in love with her. The next day Sota musters up the courage to say good morning to Akari and tells her about her bedhead, making it the first time they have spoken to one another. She tells him it is their little secret and he falls in love with her more, pondering who she could like. At lunch, Natsuki, Mio, and Akari are talking about their guy troubles when Koyuki gives Natsuki tickets to a HoneyWorks concert. Ecstatic, she accepts and chases after him to ask him questions about merchandise while her friends question if the concert is a date or not. After school, Natsuki decides not to hangout with Yu and instead picks out her outfit for the concert. Natsuki's brother, Kotaro Enomoto, asks about Hina, whom he likes, and Natsuki teases him which results in bickering between them. The scene shifts to Yu's home where he is eating dinner with Hina. Hina comments on Kotaro's temper and how he will never get a girlfriend.  The next morning Yu is returning a [[DVD]] to Natsuki and learns about her concert date with Koyuki. The two fight about her outfit, but are actually fighting about their relationship. Natsuki goes to the concert and has a great time until one of the songs (Diagnosis: Lovesickness ("Byoumei Koi Wazura")) makes her realize she is in love with Yu. Koyuki walks her home and notices Natsuki looking at Yu's house. Thinking about Natsuki and Yu's previous fight, Koyuki hugs Natsuki and tries to confess, saying he would not make her sad like Yu had. Koyuki is interrupted by Yu and the two argue about their hidden feelings in front of Natsuki, who begins to cry. Yu ends the conversation by leading Natsuki home. That night, Yu tries but fails to text Natsuki about his feelings. The next morning before school, the two pretend as if nothing has happened and walk together. Once at school, Koyuki apologizes to Natsuki.  On a train to school, Sota, still thinking over Akari, sees a trio of students from another school and gives up his seat to one of them and heads over to the next train car. Akari, riding in the same train, notices his act of kindness. Later during lunch, Sota gets motivation from Koyuki and musters his courage to confess his love to Akari; she accepts his confession and they walk to a cake shop after school.  Meanwhile, Haruki gets advice from their teacher, Mr. Akechi, about his feelings for Mio. Natsuki recalls a memory of witnessing a first year student delivering an unsuccessful confession to Yu. Troubled, Natsuki goes to Mio for advice. Afterwards, she musters her own personal courage and tells Yu to wait for her. The next day after school, she gathers her courage and confesses, but Yu still thinks that he was not the one she loves. He tells her she passed her confession rehearsal and wishes her luck in the real one. As he is about to leave, he is confronted by a crying Natsuki who finally tells him that the practice was a lie and her confessions were actually real. Yu embraces her, telling her that he accepts her feelings. The ending credits, Our Fraction of a Second ("Ippun Ichibyou Kimi to Boku no"), plays.  In the mid credits, Koyuki silently congratulates Natsuki in the background for finally confessing to Yu and getting accepted. Meanwhile, Hina is seen standing at the school lockers holding a letter, possibly a love letter that was meant for someone. After the credits, Natsuki barges into Yu's bedroom and wakes him, questioning his feelings for her since he didn't explicitly say that he loves her. After much pestering, Yu admits that he loves her. Natsuki is flustered and scolds him for saying it so abruptly, but happily hugs him.
