2-Headed Shark Attack
 The film opens with a group of [[wakeboarding|wakeboarders]] being attacked and devoured by a two-headed [[great white shark]]. Meanwhile, ''Sea King'', a [[Semester at Sea]] ship led by Professor Franklin Babish (O'Connell) and his wife, Anne (Electra), hits a dead shark. The shark becomes lodged in the boat’s propeller, damaging the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and causing the boat to take on water. Soon after, the two-headed shark attacks the boat and breaks the [[radio antenna]], preventing ship co-captain Laura (Thompson) from summoning help. Professor Babish and the students use a [[dinghy]] to take shelter on a nearby deserted [[atoll]], while Anne remains on the ''Sea King'' with Laura and the ship's crew, Han (Webb) and Dikilla (Valentin). Laura enters the water to repair the ship's hull, and is quickly ripped apart by the two-headed shark.  Meanwhile, professor and the students explore the atoll. Assembling in an abandoned fishing village, they set out to search the atoll for scrap metal to help repair the boat. Haley (Jackson) and Alison (English) decide to go swimming topless with Kirk (Conner), only to be attacked and eaten by the two-headed shark. The rest of the group meet up and find two small speedboats before an earthquake hits, causing Professor Babish to fall and badly injure his leg. Dana (Bach) bandages Babish's leg with her shirt, while Jeff (Carmouze) and Mike (King Leslie) accompany him back to the ''Sea King'' on the dinghy. On the way back, Jeff and Mike discover Laura's severed hand in the water. They are attacked by the shark and eaten while attempting to swim back to the ''Sea King''.  The students find two boats on the island, which Kate (Hogan) and Paul (Gallegos) manage to fix. Cole (Ward) finds a [[gasoline]] tank to fuel them, but then steals one together with Ryan (Charles), Jamie (Vera) and Alex (James). Kate, Paul and Dana follow them in the other boat. They are all unaware of the shark, which attacks Cole's boat. Ryan falls into the water and is eaten, alerting the others to the shark's presence. Paul concludes the shark is drawn to Cole's boat as it has a bigger engine. Cole also deduces this and bails; the shark eats Jamie and Alex. When the survivors reach shore, Kate furiously confronts Cole for his actions. A few minutes later, the ''Sea King'' is abandoned and the survivors meet on the island.  Shortly afterward, another earthquake hits. The group realizes that the  earthquakes are actually caused by the atoll collapsing in on itself. Escape being ever more urgent, the group hooks up a generator to metal poles and places them in the water to distract the shark with electricity while Kate and Cole travel to the ''Sea King'' and repair the hull. The plan works until the shark attacks the poles, knocking Han and Dikilla into the water to their death. Kate fixes the ship, only for Cole to drive away without her, forcing her to swim back to the atoll. The two-headed shark attacks the ''Sea King'', causing it to sink and send out a [[distress signal]]; Cole is eaten trying to escape on a [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. The atoll is sinking too, prompting everyone to flee for their lives. Many of the group end up in or near the water as a small [[tsunami]] hits the island, in which Professor Babish and Anne are eaten by the sharks after encountering the tsunami and the rest of the students lose their lives to the shark's appetite as well they head in a village chapel when the shark broke in, except Kate, Paul and Kirsten (Nobili) who escape.  They discover a gasoline tank, and lure the shark towards it. Kate plans to stab the shark and is nearly eaten, but Kirsten sacrifices herself to try to blow up the shark as it eats her. However, only one of the shark's heads get blown off. Kate and Paul find one of the boats and turn it on as a decoy, taking shelter on part of the remaining atoll. The shark attacks the unmanned boat. It bites the motor, which explodes, finally killing the shark (a homage to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''). A helicopter arrives, saving Kate and Paul, leaving only 2 survivors out of 23 people.

Now Cyril is stunned that he is not even able to face Tessa. Cyril recollects that her love was true and his love was overshadowed by his male supremacy concept and greed for wealth. Over the days he admits his actions that caused her pain. Then Tessa leaves him but not before inviting him to settle the score with her, if any remains there. Cyril accepts the challenge of a true criminal as he is and taunts her that he will confront her when he is ready, most probably knowing that he has to settle the score with her in terms of true love with roots in violence.

Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo ([[DeRay Davis]]), the leader of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|one-percenter]] motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' rights]].  The duo is reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson ([[Ice Cube]]) assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS (Holy Fucking Shit) at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly ([[Brie Larson]]), and he and Jenko meet the school's main dealer, popular student Eric ([[Dave Franco]]). The two take HFS in front of him to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drug's effects, the duo discovers that Schmidt's intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenko's lax attitude is frowned upon.  Eric takes a liking to Schmidt, who develops a romantic interest in Molly. Jenko becomes friends with the students in his [[AP Chemistry]] class and finds himself becoming more interested in geeky hobbies and academic pursuits. Schmidt and Jenko throw a party at Schmidt's parents' house, where they are living during the course of their assignment, and invite Eric. During the party, a fight breaks out between Schmidt, Jenko, and some party crashers. Schmidt wins the fight, solidifying his social status and gaining Eric's trust. Jenko's friends hack Eric's phone to enable them to listen in on his conversations.  At a party at Eric's house, using the phone hack, Jenko and his friends overhear information about an upcoming meeting between Eric and his supplier, but also catch Schmidt making disparaging comments about Jenko. The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS – the motorcycle gang from the park – and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play. They are expelled from school and are removed from the Jump Street program.  Eric, stressed and terrified, recruits Schmidt and Jenko as security for a deal taking place at the school prom. While dressing for the prom, Schmidt and Jenko rekindle their friendship. At the prom, they discover that the supplier is the physical education teacher, Mr. Walters ([[Rob Riggle]]), who created the drug accidentally and started selling it to the students to supplement his teacher's salary. Having caught Eric smoking marijuana, he was able to persuade him into being his dealer.  The motorcycle gang arrives for the deal but Molly interrupts them and starts arguing with Schmidt. As a result, the gang leader recognizes Schmidt and Jenko, and orders his men to kill them. Two of the gang members reveal themselves as undercover [[DEA]] agents Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall ([[Johnny Depp]] and [[Peter DeLuise]]), and former members of the [[21 Jump Street]] program. In the ensuing gunfight, Hanson and Penhall are fatally wounded. Mr. Walters and Eric escape with the money and Molly as a hostage; the gang, Schmidt, and Jenko follow close behind. Jenko creates a homemade bomb and uses it to kill the gang. Mr. Walters shoots at Schmidt but Jenko takes the bullet to his arm, sparing Schmidt's life. In response, Schmidt shoots Mr. Walters, unintentionally severing his penis. As they arrest Mr. Walters and Eric (in addition to successfully reading the Miranda rights), Schmidt and Jenko reconcile their relationship and Schmidt and Molly share a kiss.  Both officers are congratulated and reinstated in Jump Street as Dickson gives them a new assignment: [[22 Jump Street|infiltrating a college]].

They got to know each other through an exchange of letters and slowly fall in love. One day, Jaidev receives a letter informing him that Smruti had an accident and died. Now his sister Karuna ([[Vidya Malvade]]) is his only support system that keeps him motivated. One day Jaidev finds an unconscious girl near a lake and brings her home. After gaining consciousness, she is unable to remember anything from her past life except Jaidev's poems. Karuna becomes skeptical of her presence in the house and gets even more so when the keeper of the cemetery warns them of an evil spirit inside of her who is in love with her.  Jaidev is insistent on keeping her at home since he feels a connection with her. He even names her Sangeeta. Strange & spooky things start happening with Sangeeta like vomiting iron nails and seeing ghosts in her room. On their way to see a doctor, Sangeeta gets completely possessed by the ghost. To save her, the only person Jaidev can turn to is the cemetery keeper. Slowly Jaidev gets to know that Sangeeta is actually his lost love Smruti. He goes to Smruti's old address to find the truth. He discovers that Karuna had come there before, asking about Smruti. Jaidev returns home and finds Karuna's body hanging in the forest with suicide notes around it. From Karuna's letters, he comes to know that his best friend Amar ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), who was always jealous of Jaidev's success, exploited Karuna to get his revenge. When Amar discovered that Jaidev loved Smruti, he went to Smruti, posing as Jaidev, and took her to his residence in [[Shimla]] to exploit her, but in the process, Amar dies. It is his spirit possessing Smruti.  The cemetery keeper warns Jaidev that the spirit is very vengeful and has to be deceitfully taken to the same place it all happened—Amar's residence in Shimla. Once Smruti touches Amar's corpse, Amar's spirit will have to leave Smruti's body and return to his own body; the corpse can be set on fire then, releasing Amar's spirit from the karmic cycle of life and death. Whilst doing this, Smruti must not know where she is being taken, else the spirit will also know, so Smruti is made unconscious and completely enveloped in a sacred cloth. They reach the designated place, but the cemetery keeper trips and the sacred cloth moves away from Smruti's face, awakening the spirit. The possessed Smruti unleashes mayhem on all four persons, and in a matter of time, everyone except Jaidev is brutally killed by her.  Jaidev is badly injured in battle of evil versus just, and the spirit in Smruti burns the corpse of Amar, thus forever remaining in her body. Jaidev helplessly pleads with the spirit to kill him since there is no meaning in letting him live if the spirit will take Smruti from him. Amar's spirit refuses, saying that this is exactly what he wanted: for Jaidev to suffer. Jaidev cuts a rope attached to a loft in ceiling; a corpse falls from there, landing on Smruti, and making contact with her touch. It is revealed in a flashback that Jaidev and the group had hidden the real corpse of Amar in the ceiling as precaution.The corpse comes alive as Amar is forced to return to his original body. Enraged, Amar's corpse tries to kill Smruti but Jaidev saves her and sets Amar's corpse on fire thus releasing Amar's spirit from the karmic cycle of life and death.Jaidev marries Smruti and they live happily with each other in the end.

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
 <!-- PLEASE DO NOT add more detail to this summary, but instead adjust what is already present. Wikipedia's guidelines for film plot summaries state that they should be no more than 700 words; this summary is 676 words long as of May 7, 2016. --> In 1818, [[Abraham Lincoln]] ([[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]]) lives in [[Indiana]] with his parents, [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy]] ([[Robin McLeavy]]) and [[Thomas Lincoln|Thomas]] ([[Joseph Mawle]]), who work at a [[Slave plantation#Slavery|plantation]] owned by Jack Barts ([[Marton Csokas]]). There, Lincoln rushes to the aid of his friend, a young [[African American]] boy, [[William H. Johnson|William Johnson]] ([[Anthony Mackie]]), being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.  Nine years later in 1827, a vengeful Lincoln tries to kill Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a [[vampire]], overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturges ([[Dominic Cooper]]). Sturges explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to [[Springfield, Illinois]]. During his training, Sturges tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam ([[Rufus Sewell]]), a vampire who owns a plantation in [[New Orleans]] with his sister, Vadoma ([[Erin Wasson]]). Sturges also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, [[silver]], and presents him with a silver pocket watch.  In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper [[Joshua Fry Speed|Joshua Speed]] ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), and meets [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]). Though Sturges warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary.  Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturges is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturges, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturges' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since "Only the living can kill the dead"). Sturges has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam.  Disappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his activities and kidnaps Johnson to lure Lincoln into a [[ambush|trap]] at his plantation. Adam captures Lincoln and tries to recruit him, revealing his plans to turn the United States into a nation of the undead. Speed rescues his friends, and they escape to [[Ohio]].  Lincoln marries Mary and begins his political career, campaigning to abolish slavery. It is at this time in the movie Lincoln symbolically puts on the top hat which he dons the rest of the movie. Sturges warns Lincoln that the slave trade keeps vampires under control, as vampires use slaves for food, and if Lincoln interferes, the vampires will retaliate. After Lincoln's [[United States presidential election, 1860|election]] as [[President of the United States of America]], he moves to the [[White House]] with Mary, where they have a son, [[William Wallace Lincoln]] ([[Cameron M. Brown]]).  William is later bitten by Vadoma and dies.  [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] ([[John Rothman]]) convinces Adam to deploy his vampires on the front lines. Lincoln orders the confiscation of all the silverware in the area and has it melted to produce silver weapons. Speed, believing that Lincoln is tearing the nation apart, defects and informs Adam that Lincoln will transport the silver by train.  On the train, Adam and Vadoma, who have set fire to the upcoming trestle, attack Lincoln, Sturges, and Johnson. During the fight, in which Speed is killed, Adam learns that the train holds only rocks. Lincoln reveals that Speed's betrayal was a ruse to lure Adam into a trap. Lincoln uses his watch to stab Adam, killing him, and the three escape the train before it explodes. Meanwhile, Mary and the ex-slaves have transported the silver to Gettysburg through the [[Underground Railroad]].  The now leaderless Confederate vampires stage a final, massive [[Pickett's Charge|assault]] and are met head on by the Union. Armed with their silver weapons, the Union soldiers destroy the vampires and eventually win the battle. During that battle, Mary confronts Vadoma, the vampire that killed her son, and kills her.  Nearly two years later, on [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|April 14, 1865]], Sturges tells Lincoln that the remaining vampires have fled the country. Sturges tries to convince Lincoln to allow him to turn Lincoln into a vampire, so that he can become immortal and continue to fight vampires, but Lincoln declines.  In modern times, Sturges approaches a man at a bar in [[Washington, D.C.]] as he once approached Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies
 After his mother [[Nancy Lincoln]] (Rhianna Van Helton), falls victim to an illness that requires her to be tied to her bed, vicious and [[cannibalistic]], 10-year-old [[Abraham Lincoln|Abe Lincoln]] (Brennen Harper) sees his father [[Thomas Lincoln]] (Kent Igleheart) commit [[suicide]] at her bedside. Taking up a scythe, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak.  When an adult Abraham Lincoln ([[Bill Oberst Jr.]]) has become [[President of the United States|President]] of a [[American Civil War|fracturing]] United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate [[Fort Pulaski]] to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established [[secret service]] to accompany him in investigating the fort.  They get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivors led by General [[Stonewall Jackson]] (Don McGraw) as well as by several of the infected people. Abe kills one of his men who had been bitten by an infected and explains to the others in his party that if they are bitten or scratched by an infected, or if an infected's blood makes contact with their mouths or eyes, that they too will become infected and, within twenty-four hours, would no longer be considered "human". More are lost when attempting to investigate the surrounding neighborhood, and Abe encounters an old flame turned [[prostitute]] Mary Owens (Baby Norman) who is sheltering her help, including a young [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (Canon Kuipers), daughter Sophia (Hannah Bryan) and prostitute Annika (Anna Fricks) to protect them from the invasion.  The group makes their way back to the fort where Jackson refuses to kill the infected, believing them to only be sick and in need of care. He claims Lincoln's actions are only against the members of the Confederacy. Based on an old Bantu word he'd learned from his mother, Agent Brown (Jason Hughley) names the infected persons "zombies". [[Pat Garrett]] (Christopher Marrone) volunteers to help Abe, and guides them to a nearby plantation that has farming implements and other weapons they can use to combat the threat.  When returning to the fort, Mary is splashed in the face with zombie blood and soon falls ill. Meanwhile, agent John Wilkinson (Jason Vail) protests the killing and asks to remain behind as the rest of the group heads into the township to kill off the infected. Being greatly outnumbered, only Abe, Theodore, and Sophia return when the others are slaughtered. Wilkinson, who is revealed to be a spy, plots to kill Lincoln while he is alone but changes his mind when he catches Abe praying, as in his mind prayer would ensure Lincoln's soul going to heaven. After being convinced by Pat Garrett that Lincoln is right and escape is unlikely, Stonewall shows Abe a secret cache of gunpowder. They then decide to use the explosive to blow up the fort after trapping and containing the zombies inside. When the fuse goes out, Stonewall ventures down alone to re-light it, but is over-run and killed by the zombies just after doing so. Abe and Brown escape just in time and the entire place goes up. Mary accepts her fate and goes off with Lincoln to die, much to Sophia's heartbreak.  Eighteen months later, Abe goes to visit Mary who had been in the care of a doctor investigating the illness in vain hope of finding a cure. As Abe cleans wounds caused by her restraining shackles, Mary grabs his hand scratches his skin infecting him, much to his horror, forcing him to kill her. Knowing he is himself uncurable, Abe requests that a message be sent to John Wilkinson, as earlier he had discovered that Wilkinson was actually [[John Wilkes Booth]] who had a plot to kidnap Lincoln in response to the end of the war and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] the victor. The message gives Booth the information to know exactly where Lincoln would be the following night at the theater, thus leading to his [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] (purposely arranged by Lincoln to prevent another outbreak) at Booth's hands.

Ace Attorney (film)
 The court system, burdened by the massive number of crimes being committed, introduces a new trial system: the [[bench trial]] system. Both [[prosecution]] and [[Defense (legal)|defense]] face each other in open court, and have three days to make their case before [[List of Ace Attorney characters#The Judge|the judge]] renders a verdict.  Shortly after winning his first case, proving his best friend [[List of Ace Attorney characters#Larry Butz|Larry Butz]] innocent of murder, rookie defense attorney [[Phoenix Wright (character)|Phoenix Wright]] is thrust into the limelight after the murder of his mentor, [[List of Ace Attorney characters#Mia Fey|Mia Fey]]. The accused murderer is Mia's younger sister, [[Maya Fey]], who comes from a family line of [[Mediumship|spirit mediums]]. Wright faces off with childhood friend and rival prosecutor [[Miles Edgeworth]] on the case. After some cross examination of a witness and interpretation of evidence at the crime scene, photojournalist [[List of Ace Attorney characters#Redd White|Redd White]] confesses to the crime, and Maya is subsequently found [[Acquittal|not guilty]].  Wright explains to Maya that he became a lawyer because Edgeworth and Butz defended him when he was accused of stealing money as a child, and offers to defend Edgeworth when he is accused of the murder of attorney Robert Hammond at Gourd Lake, with Edgeworth's mentor [[List of Ace Attorney characters#Manfred von Karma|Manfred von Karma]] acting as prosecutor. The case takes an unexpected turn as Wright unravels a related 15-year-old mystery concerning the DL-6 case, which focuses on Miles' father [[List of Ace Attorney characters#Gregory Edgeworth|Gregory Edgeworth]]. Gregory was found murdered in the court's basement evidence locker room; [[List of Ace Attorney characters#Yanni Yogi|Yanni Yogi]], a court [[bailiff]], is initially accused of murdering Gregory after discovering Gregory allegedly [[False evidence|tampering with a gun used as evidence in a case]]. He is coerced into pleading [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] by Hammond in killing Gregory with the gun. The DL-6 case ultimately destroys Yogi's life, where he resorts to living as a hermit. A package arrives urging Yogi to take revenge, namely setting up the murder of Hammond by Miles. Yogi confesses to the ruse in open court, but Miles admits he believes that [[Patricide|he murdered his father]], not Yogi.  The admission by Edgeworth focuses new attention on the DL-6 case. Wright manages to prove in court that Edgeworth did not kill his father, and he uncovers evidence that von Karma had committed [[perjury]] and killed Gregory. However, key evidence in the form of the gun that Gregory thought was tampered with and killed with is missing to prove this theory. Mia Fey's notes on the DL-6 case and a timely discovery of the bullet that killed Gregory hidden in a clock statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'', which was used to kill Mia after she took the bullet evidence, help proves von Karma's crime and unravels the mystery. Von Karma has a breakdown in court and is subsequently arrested for the crime of murdering Gregory, and for hiring Redd White to retrieve the bullet from ''The Thinker'', and Miles is acquitted of all crimes. Wright vows to help defend Yogi of his crimes and reconciles with Edgeworth, while Butz admits to stealing the money when they were children and Maya returns home for further training.  During the credits, scenes based off cases from the game ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All]]'' are shown.

Destitute, they find shelter in the city of Dongri,Mumbai but Vijay harbours intentions to go back to Mandwa and kill Kancha. While in Mumbai, Vijay's mother delivers a baby girl named Shiksha. Vijay is attracted to Rauf Lala ([[Rishi Kapoor]]), a local girl-trafficker and importantly an enemy of Kancha and wants to get into his company. He earns his favour by refusing to stand as a witness in court to a crime committed by Lala and joins his gang. Meanwhile, his mother along with his baby sister leave Vijay's side as he kills a corrupt cop at a young age and resorts to violence.  A grown-up Vijay ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) now works for Rauf Lala and finds himself as his trusted wing-man. Once inspector and now commissioner, Gaitonde ([[Om Puri]]) acts as a silent guardian for Vijay and tries to eliminate crime in Mumbai. During the time when Rauf's influence over the drug business in Mumbai is falling, Kancha decides to grow his influence as a drug lord in the city and sends his aid, Shantaram (Ravi Jhankal) over to Mumbai for the process.Shantaram succeeds in bribing the Home Secretary of State of Maharashtra, Mr. Borkar([[Sachin Khedekar]]) in order to get the access to the interiors of Mumbai for smuggling cocaine. Vijay catches the Home Secretary of Maharashtra, Mr. Borkar red-handed while trying to smuggle cocaine from Mandwa into Mumbai through his headquarters in Goa. Borkar and Shantaram are forced to hand over the pure cocaine to Lala, thus making them Lala's suppliers rather than rivals.Lala rewards Vijay with the territory of Dongri for his achievement. He further gains the trust of Lala by taking a bullet shot which  was aimed for Lala's son, Mazhar (Rajesh Tandon); but is later revealed as a conspiracy involving Vijay and Shantaram to eliminate Mazhar.  After murdering both Mazhar and Shantaram, Vijay brings Mazhar's corpse to Lala, who falls sick and is admitted into a hospital. In the meantime, Vijay takes over Lala's empire and stops all the crimes committed by Lala's gang. He is then contacted by Kancha and offers to go to Mandwa for a business agreement. While in Mandwa, Vijay's companions are killed and Vijay gets severely beaten by Kancha's men.In wounded state, he tries to strike a deal with Kancha to hand over the drug business in Mumbai over to Kancha and in return taking Mandwa. Though Kancha initially suspects this deal, he later agrees on the condition that Gaitonde must be killed.  Meanwhile, back in Mumbai, Lala regains health and finds out the truth behind Mazhar's death. He gets hold of Shiksha ([[Kanika Tiwari]]) and tries to sell her off. Vijay is notified of this by Kancha and he flees back to Mumbai and kills Lala in a bloody skirmish. Soon after, Kancha sends a man to assassinate Gaitonde. This man identifies Vijay to be the son of the teacher killed by Kancha and reports this to Kancha. However, while he tries to assassinate Gaitonde, he is killed by Vijay. Vijay, meanwhile marries his love interest Kaali Gawde ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), who is killed right after during a shooting spree by Kancha's men.  Vijay leaves for Mandwa to avenge the death of his father and his wife. He destroys the island of Mandwa through explosions and after an intense battle with Kancha, kills him by hanging him from the same tree in which his father was hanged. However, due to his severe injuries, Vijay is last seen in his mother's lap passing away whilst seeing a vision of his father and his younger self calling him forward.  
Aftershock (2012 film)
 Three travelers, Gringo, Ariel, and Pollo travel through Chile. They party in a club and meet three young women, sisters Monica and Kylie, and their Russian friend Irina. The two groups pair up and decide to travel down to [[Valparaiso]] together.  They party at another club in Valparaiso when an earthquake strikes, killing many of the partygoers and trapping some under debris. Ariel's hand is cut off as he tries to help a trapped bartender. The group tries to get out but their exit is blocked by more falling debris. The cleaning lady of the club leads them through a tunnel to a nearby manhole. As they proceed to climb out, a passing truck hits the old lady and kills her. Once out on the street, the group tries to get to their car but find it destroyed. Ariel's condition continues to get worse due to blood loss and the group decides that they need to get him to the hospital on top of the hill as soon as possible. Suddenly, a tsunami warning is heard and they all rush to the hillside cable tram station that could quickly take them up the hill. After some intense negotiation, the owner agrees to allow only Ariel to board the tram car. The group watches the tram reach the top of the hill when suddenly a frayed cable breaks, causing the tram to fall all the way back down, destroying the tram and killing everyone inside.  After mourning the death of their friend, the group heads toward the cemetery, trying to reach the cathedral at the top of the hill through a previously mentioned hidden tunnel. The group comes upon a looting party on the street which turns out to be escaped prisoners from a nearby prison that was damaged during the earthquake. They try to run past, but the women of the group attracts their attention. While running away, part of a building falls on top of Gringo and pins him in place, still alive and conscious. Monica and Pollo leave to get help while Irina and Kylie stay with Gringo. While they are seeking help, Monica and Pollo come across an out-of-control firetruck. The truck crashes and one of the firefighters in the cab is run through by wooden beams while the other one is trapped. Pollo and Monica get the living firefighter out, who explains that some prisoners were trying to take over the firetruck, which was why it went out of control. Meanwhile, as Irina is trying to comfort the seriously injured Gringo, Kylie hears the prisoners approaching. Gringo tells Kylie and Irina to hide, reasoning that they would only take his money. The women hide in the tombs while the prisoners threaten Gringo. They pour alcohol on him, threatening to light him up if he doesn't tell them where the women were. Frightened, Gringo motions toward their hiding place with his eyes. Irina crawls out of her hiding place and tries to run away. She is quickly captured by the prisoners. The leader of the prisoners rapes Irina while the rest of the gang sit around telling jokes. Gringo throws a rock at the leader, trying to stop him from continuing raping Irina. The leader, enraged, lights him up and burns Gringo alive, killing him. Kylie, hearing all the chaos outside decides to run. The group goes after her, but the leader's brother stays behind to continue raping Irina. Kylie is able to run away, bumping into Monica and the others. They go back for Irina and Pollo axes the leader's brother to death. Just as the group is about to run, the prisoners return, the leader seeing the dead body of his brother and fires at them, killing Irina. The rest of the group manages to escape and comes across a gated building with other survivors who live there. A single mother does not want to let them through but her neighbor wants to open the gate. As Pollo begs, the woman shoots him in the chest injuring him. The others help carry him away but decided to hide him so they can go get help. Pollo's phone suddenly rings and one of the prisoners hears it and finds him. They kill him and continue to go after the others.  The group finally arrives at the cathedral where they are saved by a priest who shuts the door just in time. As another aftershock hits, the Cathedral begins to fall apart. The priest leads them to a secret passage inside the cathedral. As the group descends a ladder through the secret passage, another aftershock shakes the ladder off. The priest falls off in the process to his death, and Kylie falls on top of a metal object that pierces her thigh. Monica, meanwhile, is stranded at the top alone as she was the last to go down the ladder. The firefighter attempts to help Kylie by removing the object and takes off his own coat to try to stop the bleeding. Taking off his coat reveals the prison tattoos on his arms and shoulders. He turns out to be one of the escaped prisoners who was taking over the fire truck, Kylie panics and promises that she won't tell anyone.  Monica is able to find some ropes and goes down the ladder shaft to an empty landing. She finds Kylie's body in one of the tunnels. The fake firefighter/prisoner then tries to kill her but an aftershock occurs and Monica is able to kill him with the axe instead. Monica finally manages to escape through the tunnel and onto a beach. She walks around the beach, bewildered that she was able to escape to safety at last. As she turns around, she sees a very tall tsunami rushing towards her.

Ah Boys to Men
 The film opens with the Republic of Singapore apparently being under an immense invasion from a fictional army, with iconic Singaporean landmarks (such as the [[Merlion]] and the [[Esplanade, Singapore|Esplanade]]) coming under fire and many civilians killed brutally. It is later revealed that the war was fictitious setting of a war-based role-playing game played by Ken Chow ([[Joshua Tan]]), a rich and spoiled child reluctant to enlist into National Service. Ken plans to study abroad with his girlfriend Amy (Qiu Qiu), but his plans are derailed by NS. After being chided by Amy for his childishness, Ken takes it out on a nearby rubbish bin, to be apprehended by two policemen in the vicinity. A disappointed and embarrassed Amy looked very sad and angry.  Back home, after being driven back by his father ([[Richard Low]]), Ken confides to his parents about his fears of National Service. His overprotective mother (Irene Ang) decides to help him think of ways to defer, but to no avail. Eventually, they are all forced to face the hard truth - there is no going against the law. The Chow family sadly send off Ken on the day of his enlisting. Thereafter, Ken and a few other recruits are assigned to ''Ninja Company'' (Platoon 2, Section 2) and are sent to their bunk and introduced to their Platoon Sergeant ([[Tosh Zhang]]), a portrayal of the tough-nails sergeant stereotype. Whilst waiting for the mandatory haircut, Ken gets to know a few people - "Lobang" ([[Wang Weiliang]]), Aloysius Jin Sia-lan ([[Maxi Lim]]) and "I.P. Man" (Noah Yap).  After two weeks of training, Ken and the other recruits are allowed to book out. A lavish party is thrown to celebrate Ken's return, but his mood is ruined when he is shown a photo of his girlfriend  with another man. Ken angrily confronts her and demands that they meet, which she does not agree to. She later admits that she has fallen for another man and dumps Ken on the highway. Determined to regain her love, Ken devises a plan to escape from [[Pulau Tekong]] and send her off, for he feels she is merely just testing him. Ken stops drinking water, in hopes to get a heat injury, for which he would be sent home for ten days; he takes the extra measure of sleeping under a ceiling-fan after dousing himself in cold water. However, he gets into a situation worse than expected and he is quickly sent off to a hospital after collapsing during training. Ken's father is alerted of his son's critical condition while in a company meeting. He quickly drives off to the hospital, but the shock and strain is too much and he suffers a stroke while driving and violently collides with another vehicle.  Ken wakes up in the next scene, surrounded by his two sisters, in a hospital. He realised his foolish actions have caused problems for many people and cannot bear to face his father, who has survived the car crash and is recuperating in another ward in the same hospital. Awakened to reality, Ken is finally fit enough to go back to training. The film ends at this junction, and snippets of the next part are shown.

Aftermath (2012 film)
 The film is a contemporary drama.<ref name="Onet"/> It takes place in the fictional village of Gurówka in 2001. The story begins with the return of Franciszek Kalina (Ireneusz Czop) to his hometown in rural Poland after having lived in [[Chicago]] for two decades. He learns that his brother Józef ([[Maciej Stuhr]]) is shunned by the community for acquiring and displaying on his farmland dozens of Jewish tombstones which he discovered had been used by [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|German occupying forces]] as paving stones in a now abandoned road.<ref></ref> Józef is gathering the tombstones everywhere in the settlement and moves them into his own field to survive from oblivion. Against the growing opposition of the town residents, the Kalina brothers attempt to learn more about what happened to the Jews of the village. Their personal relationship, harsh after the brothers met, warms and becomes more cooperative after they both find themselves opposed by the whole village. The older priest blesses the brother and urges him to continue gathering the tombstones while the new one, to head the parish soon, displays no sympathy for Jews. Franciszek discovers in a local archive that his father along with other men of the village got the land that had been owned by Jews before the war. He is eager to study the truth.   After speaking to some of the oldest residents in the village, the brothers subsequently realize that half the residents of the village murdered the other half <ref></ref> (led by a neighbor and their father Stanisław Kalina). This discovery results in a terrible fight and split between the brothers after a dispute about the bones of the Jews they found the night before. After learning that their own father was directly involved in the murder of the Jews who were burned to death in the family's former house, the brothers' roles are reversed.  Now it is Józef who wants to keep the truth from coming out to the world, while Franciszek wants the world to know the truth and for the bones of the murdered Jews to be taken to their wheat field and buried with their headstones, so as to not compound the terrible sins of their father and neighbors. In a fight, Franciszek comes close to killing his brother Józef but Franciszek stops himself, puts the ax down and leaves the village by bus to go back to America.  But he is returned to the village by a hospital nurse/doctor—the daughter of one of the oldest surviving neighbors who had known the truth but kept it secret—only to see his brother Józef beaten, stabbed, and then nailed high on the inside of the barn door, his arms outstretched. His wrists and feet held by wooden cleats.  The movie ends with a scene of a group of young and older Israeli Jews being led by an Orthodox Rabbi reciting the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer in memory of the dead, in front of a formal memorial stone, at the now restored cemetery in the area of the stones that Józef had placed in his fields, while Franciszek watches with respect, lights a candle, leaves it on one of the tombstones and nodding slightly to the scene, turns and walks away.  
After Winter, Spring
  === Setting === [[File:Dordogne_sky_view.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dordogne%20sky%20view.jpg|thumb|A view of the Périgord region of [[South West France (wine region)|southwest France]] (Dordogne). The landscape contains the [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne River]], farms trees and rich agricultural land. Farming output of the land consists of [[walnut]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[tobacco]] and [[Helianthus|sunflowers]].<ref name=":4"></ref>]]The Périgord region of southwest France has been inhibited by humans for over 17,000 years, and farming tools have been found there dating back 4,000 years.<ref></ref> The fertile land that contains many natural resources has made it possible for farmer families to continue their practices through hundreds of [[generation]]s and through the multiple [[empire]]s and [[nation]]s that have occupied and fought over the area.<ref name=":4" /> In 1607 [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] of France united the region under the crown. The French influence over the area lead to legislation that preserved a portion of the region as the [[Parc naturel régional Périgord Limousin|Périgord-Limousin]] Regional Nature Park in 1998. The Périgord region's different terrains and areas were labeled the Périgord Vert, Blanc, Pourpre, and Nior (green, white, black, and purple).<ref name=":4" /> [[Protected area|Nature conservancy]] laws and increasing competition from [[Intensive farming|mega-farms]] pose the challenges that the documentary film addresses. According to Eurostat Statistics in 2012, the number of people working in agriculture dropped 26.7% since 2000.<ref name=":6"></ref>  “Despite the fact that the population of farms decreased by one quarter compared to 2000 (–173,830), in 2010 France was among the EU Member States with the highest number of holdings.”<ref name=":6" /> Moreover, the statistics indicate that the average size of the holdings has increased drastically. The more efficient mega-farms are increasingly taking [[market share]] as they are able to out-perform their rural competitors in cheap production.<ref> Why Industrial Farms Are Good for the Environment|date=2016-09-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The  Périgord region has remained a popular tourist destination.<ref></ref> As France adapts the Périgord region to be more fit for modern population needs, some of the endemic rural farmers may be displaced.  === Summary === At the turn of the 21st century, rural family farmers are competing with the increasingly efficient food production industry. Growth in mega-farm numbers, reduction of agricultural subsidies, and new laws threaten the existence of farmers and their long-lasting practices. Guy Phélip and Nanou Bouchat, as well as other community individuals farming in a small town of 100 in the Périgord region of southwest France, are interviewed. The film opens and Guy spots an ancient 4,000 year old farming tool in his field. He explains that the tool is proof that people have been farming in the Périgord region of southwest France for a very long time.  Judith Lit, neighbor and narrator, centers the story not around the history of French farming, but around the changes those in her community and in rural farming communities in France. Having moved from The United States, Lit explains that she noticed the same warning signs in her small town in France as she did on her family’s farm in Pennsylvania. Aging farmers, less interest to farm among youth, and shrinking profits seemingly lead to the ultimate downfall of many rural farmer families’ practices in the US. Between one hundred years ago and the time the film was shot, the rural farming population decreased over ten-fold in France.<ref> Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref>  Lit then interviews her farmer neighbors. Through these interviews, the issue of change and its effects are brought up. The responses of the community individuals depict their constantly changing farming environment, and how they adapt. The interviews are told in parallel with shots of the fields, foliage, country side, farming, empty barns and backyard gardens. In Lit's interview with Nanou, a grandmother in the village, Nanou expresses through her own experiences how much has changed. She says "I don't miss the days of wooden shoes," but she also laments the change in farming as a way of life to a "business susceptible to [[investment]], [[Profit (economics)|profitability]], and [[bankruptcy]]."  A new development of tourist lodging is then shown. It has been built on top of an old, once-used farm field. Other shots of changing landscapes are shown again, and now the youngest  farmer is interviewed. Oliver, the milk man, describes how in the past it took less production to incur more or the same revenue. "We had three or four cows. Now we have more than 100." In the changing era, profit margins are shrinking. He reiterates this point by quantifying the equal revenues he and his father earned selling the same amount of milk in the 1970s versus today. The film then focuses on the differences in the American and European [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to farm.  According to one farmer in the town, Europeans may seem to receive “Generous government subsidies,” but in reality these subsidies are divided among rural family farmers and their large [[Corporation|corporate]] competitors. Even then the subsidies do not help them sustain growth in production, but serve as a ‘last resort’ that will sustain their revenue for one harvest. He regrets that the subsidies have become necessary for the survival of his way of life and Lit says that the farmers fear government funding could be stopped at any time. Lit continues, regardless of French or American subsidies, the farmers’ way of life is easily affected by the legislation of politicians and susceptible to new regulation.<ref> Civil Eats|date=2015-02-27|work=Civil Eats|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}</ref>  The interviews switch back to Nanou. The issues mega-farms and [[European Union]] [[legislation]] are no longer the focus, yet Nanou describes how the future will be different. She says that the ways of old rural farming towns will be no more the same. She says, "My children, their lives will be different," but she hopes their "wisdom" rooted in the old rural farming ways will stay in-tact. Lit concludes that just like in her home farm of Pennsylvania where rural family farm numbers dropped to all-time lows the same change is occurring in France. However, Lit cites the "Number of small farms is increasing in the U.S" and that the organic movement in France is picking up momentum. She illustrates that a new adapted means of small farming could develop in France as it has in the United States.<ref>Lit, After Winter, Spring, Movie, 2012</ref>

Airborne (2012 film)
 Despite an approaching winter storm a near-empty airliner takes off from [[London]] for [[New York City|New York]].  One-by-one the passengers begin to disappear, while one passenger who frequents the route notices the plane has turned whereas it should be flying straight.  Soon it is discovered that the pilots are dead and that the plane is on auto pilot; and it is revealed that two on board are hijackers who have murdered the pilots to take control of the plane. The passengers who disappeared were killed when they witnessed parts of the hijacking.  The hijackers intend to steal and sell both the plane and an ancient vase being transported on board which, according to legend, acts as a prison for a [[death god]]. The passengers try to hinder the hijackers but they are unable to overpower them and instead wind up tied to the seats of the plane, the hijackers planning to use them as hostages.    Meanwhile, [[air traffic control]] becomes alarmed; they have lost radio contact with the plane as it first veers off course and then disappears from radar.  They alert the authorities, who assume the plane has been taken over by terrorists and send fighter aircraft to intercept it.  As fighter planes take off and close in on the airliner the would-be hostages escape their bonds.  The people on the hijacked airliner begin to go violently crazy, killing themselves and each other without apparent reason; the incorporeal death god has been released from the vase and is possessing people, trying to find a suitable host.  The airliner passes into [[South America|South American]] airspace, causing the fighter jets to give up pursuit; then the air controllers watch in horror as the plane begins to descend, its trajectory sending it into the ocean.  One of the passengers has disabled the autopilot and is flying the plane into the ocean to prevent the death god from being released into the world.  A passenger possessed by the death god and one of the hijackers try to stop the plane from crashing, but they fail; the death god leaves the passenger's body at the last moment, giving her only enough time to scream into the radio before the plane hits the water.   Back in London, the air traffic controllers are marched out of the control room by the authorities, who mean to leave no witnesses.  The eyes of one of the controllers flash blue, indicating that he is possessed by the death god.  
Air Collision (film)
 After a major [[electromagnetic storm]] cripples communications worldwide, a new satellite-based [[Airborne collision avoidance system]] (ACAT) air traffic control system is struck, with debris hitting the earth. The malfunctioning satellite puts all air traffic in danger on the U.S. east coast where it is being operated on a "pilot project".   Consequently, two aircraft are heading on a collision course. One is a commercial airliner carrying hundreds of passengers while the other is [[Air Force One]], carrying President Phillips (Andy Clemence), the President of the United States, and his family. The ACAT begins sending out errant commands that put both aircraft into serious jeopardy.  In the severe electric storm, satellites begin failing with debris hitting major populated areas in the United States. Dr. Antonia "Toni" Pierce (Erin Coker) comes upon some of the debris and contacts [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] FAA Air Traffic controller Bob Abbot ([[Reginald VelJohnson]]). Abbot tries to prevent the looming disaster, overriding all top level directives to keep aircraft flying, he wants to ground all traffic.   Both the commercial airliner and Air Force One are struck by repeated lightning strikes that partially disable the aircraft. The damaged satellite signals cause the ACAT to wreak havoc on the escorting [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters. The [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] airliner also loses both engines but gets a restart just before impacting. A rogue [[AIM-9 Sidewinder| Sidewinder]] missile from Air Force One also strikes the converging airliner and both aircraft impact in a glancing hit. The airliner crash-lands in Cleveland.  An Air Force [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] rescue effort ultimately fails to bring Air Force One's passengers to safety, and electrical impulses affecting the president's aircraft kill the flight crew, leaving the only alternative being the President's daughter (Stephanie Hullar) attempting to disable the ACAT system. When the ACAT is finally overridden, the President takes control of Air Force One and brings it into a landing at Detroit.

 Dr. [[Alex Cross]] ([[Tyler Perry]]) is a psychologist and police lieutenant who now lives in [[Detroit]] with his wife Maria ([[Carmen Ejogo]]) and their children. After learning Maria is pregnant, Cross considers accepting a job as an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler. Meanwhile, a man ([[Matthew Fox]]) participates in an underground fighting match and seduces businesswoman Fan Yau ([[Stephanie Jacobsen]]). The man is invited to Yau's house, where he kills her.  At the crime scene, Cross finds a charcoal sketch left behind by the killer in the style of the artist [[Picasso]], leading to the murderer being nicknamed after him. While examining the sketch, Cross deduces that Picasso's next target is German businessman Erich Nunemarcher ([[Werner Daehn]]). Picasso attempts to kill Nunemarcher but is foiled by Cross, and escapes after being shot by Cross's partner Tommy Kane ([[Edward Burns]]). Cross deduces that Picasso also plans to target billionaire CEO Giles Mercier ([[Jean Reno]]).  As revenge for foiling his attack on Nunemarcher, Picasso attacks Cross and Kane's colleague, Monica Ashe ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]), torturing her to death. Picasso then tracks down Cross, who is on a date with Maria, and kills her with a sniper rifle.  Picasso targets Nunemarcher and Mercier at a conference, killing Nunemarcher and seemingly Mercier. Cross and Kane track Picasso to the abandoned Michigan Theater. As Cross and Picasso fight, they fall through the crumbling theater ceiling. Picasso falls to his death, but Kane helps pull Cross to safety.  Cross deduces Picasso's employer was Mercier himself. Having embezzled money from his clients, Mercier asked for Yau and Nunemarcher's help to fake his death and flee to [[Bali]], then hired Picasso to eliminate them and a double pretending to be the real Mercier. After Cross frames Mercier for drug smuggling, Mercier is arrested in [[Indonesia]], where he will be condemned to death by firing squad. Having avenged Maria's murder, Cross decides to accept the job offer from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and moved to Washington with his family.

Allegiance (film)
  In October 2004, a [[New York Army National Guard]] unit prepares for an upcoming deployment to [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. First Lieutenant Danny Selfton, the [[Executive officer#United States|executive officer]] of his [[Company (military unit)#Army|company]], was transferred to a non-deploying [[Public affairs (military)|public affairs]] unit due to influence from his politically powerful father but is present to assist in the final preparations. Specialist Reyes, a combat medic in the same unit, applied for a compassionate reassignment due to his son suffering from lung cancer. However, his request for reassignment was denied by his [[Battalion#United States Army|battalion]] commander Lieutenant Colonel Owens due to his needed medical skills for the upcoming deployment.  Not willing to leave his son, Reyes attempts to [[Desertion#United States|flee the base]] prior to his unit shipping out. Unable to do it alone, he pressures Selfton into helping him come up with a plan to sneak out on a departing supply convoy. Selfton's plans are hindered by his replacement, First Lieutenant Chambers, due to Chambers accompanying him to the convoy and Reyes' [[Platoon sergeant#United States|platoon sergeant]] Staff Sergeant Hart discovering that he was missing. Selfton and Reyes flee from the convoy area and attempt to find another way to get him off of the base. Shortly after they flee Selfton is caught and arrested by the military police on base while trying to contact Reyes' cousin on a pay phone.  Captain Angelo, the company commander, orders Selfton to reveal Reyes' location. Selfton takes him to where he is located but a distraction by one of the other Soldiers in the unit gives Selfton a chance to get away and meet back up with Reyes. Selfton takes Reyes to meet up with his cousin and causes a distraction allowing Reyes to successfully flee the area. During his escape Chambers attacks Selfton and the two officers fight until the MPs arrive and arrest him again. Reyes climbs the fence leading off of the base and successfully flees with his cousin before he can be captured.  The following day Selfton is taken in front of the company in handcuffs so he can face charges. At the same time, a military police car arrives with Reyes, who was arrested earlier while with his son. Selfton is brought to LTC Owens' office but Owens drops all charges out of fear that Sefton's arrest for helping Reyes see his son would bring bad press to the National Guard. Before being dismissed, Selfton requests to stay with the unit and deploy with them, allowing Chambers to be discharged. His request granted, Selfton says goodbye to his fiancee Leela and then joins members of his unit on the back of one of the departing trucks.<ref name=imdb></ref><ref name=tomatoes></ref><ref name=hollywood></ref><ref name=movie></ref><ref name=nytimes></ref>

Alter Egos
 The plot follows the misadventures of the Fridge, an under-appreciated superhero, at a time when superheroes have lost government funding and all public support. In a synopsis by [[Interview Magazine]]:  "''Alter Egos'' inhabits a fantasy world where superheroes are a dime a dozen. If you have the powers, as lead supers Fridge ([[Kris Lemche]]), and C-Thru ([[Joey Kern]]), do, then, well, you can practice them for good, as long as you follow the guidelines, or at least some of them. Quite obviously, this is a parody of parodies and flips the superhero genre on its head. Like [[Superman]], Fridge is dorky in his human clothes. Unlike [[Superman]], it's not because he has to do so to keep his identity under wraps—more like he uses his superhero garb to explore different facets of his personality, as evidenced by the title. Somewhere along the storyline, he must tackle the fact that his girlfriend loves his superhero identity more than his unmasked self, and, naturally, face his nemesis, the man who killed his mom and dad—although he really doesn't want to."<ref name=autogenerated1></ref> {{Quote box | quote = We went through several versions of the style, or the approach, that we were going to take. At first, we did a kind of goofy, ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' sort of thing which didn't really work out. It sort of highlighted the wrong aspects of the film. Then there was another direction we went, which was a retro Italian superhero film, kind of a ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' direction. I really enjoyed making that music, but it didn't ground the film and it lacked gravity. Despite how silly the film is and how kind of comedic it is, it needed a certain seriousness to sort of propel the more important aspects of the narrative&nbsp;– you know, the parents having been killed by this bad guy and the superhero avenging the murder of his parents. It needed some grounding. That was when we sort of went with the third direction, which was kind of a straight-up action hero style– a serious, orchestrated superhero score. | source = [[Sean Lennon]] in Rolling Stone Interview<ref name="music"></ref> | align = left |bgcolor=#90ee90  | width = 28% }}

The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)
  A young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] discovers that his father [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s study has been burgled. Peter's parents gather hidden documents, take Peter to the home of his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]], and then mysteriously depart.  Years later, a teenage Peter attends [[Midtown High School|Midtown Science High School]], where he is bullied by [[Flash Thompson]], and has caught the eye of [[Gwen Stacy]]. At home, Peter finds his father's papers, and learns his father worked with fellow scientist [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] at [[Oscorp]] in the field of [[Genetic engineering|cross-species genetics]]. Sneaking into Oscorp, Peter enters a lab where a "biocable" is under development from genetically modified [[spider]]s, one of which bites him. He later discovers he has developed spider-like abilities, such as sharp senses, reflexes and speed.  After studying Richard's papers, Peter visits the one-armed Connors, reveals he is Richard's son and gives Connors his father's "decay rate algorithm", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. Connors is being pressed by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the dying head of Oscorp, [[Norman Osborn]]. In school, Peter is exposed after a basketball challenge with Flash, in which Peter accidentally shatters the backboard glass. His uncle changes work shifts to meet with the principal, and asks Peter to walk May home for him that night. Peter forgets to do so, distracted while at Oscorp helping Connors regenerate the limb of a [[laboratory mouse]]. At home, he and Ben argue, and Peter leaves. At a nearby deli, a cashier refuses to let Peter buy milk when Peter is two cents short; when [[Burglar (comics)|a thief]] suddenly raids the store, Peter indifferently observes. While searching for Peter, Ben attempts to stop the thief, and is killed. The thief escapes as Peter finds Ben dead on the sidewalk.  Afterward, Peter uses his new abilities to track down criminals matching the killer's description. After a fall lands him inside an abandoned gym, a [[luchador]]-wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He adds a [[spandex]] suit and builds mechanical devices to attach to his wrists to shoot a biocable "[[Spider web|web]]". Later, at dinner with Gwen's family, he has a tense conversation with her father, police captain [[George Stacy]], over the new masked vigilante's motives. After dinner, Peter reveals his identity to Gwen, and they kiss.  After seeing success with the mouse using [[lizard]] [[DNA]], Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a [[Veterans Administration]] hospital under the guise of a [[flu shot]]. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.  Peter suspects Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully confronts the creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via the name on an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, in order to keep her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.  In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Connors, in a prison cell, speaks with a [[List of Spider-Man enemies in other media#The Gentleman|man in the shadows]] who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors doesn't know, and demands Peter to be left alone before the man disappears.  
Ambuli
  The film begins with happening in the corn fields in a village in the [[South India]], where a [[United Kingdom|British]] forest ranger, who is in charge of the fields, has being alerted by some strange noises coming from deep inside the fields. He sets out with his dog and searches for the source of this strange noise, then suddenly the dog is being dragged inside and brutally killed by an unknown beast creature. Then the British forest ranger is also dragged inside and killed by the creature. Then the film shifts to the 1970s, where a college farewell party for Sir Arthur Wellington College is taking place. Two college friends, Amudhan and Vendhan, who is the son of the alcoholic college watchman, Vethagiri have decide to stay back in the college hostel and spend the vacation there. This is mainly because Amudhan's college girlfriend Poongavanam, who lives in the nearby village of Poomanandhipuram, where her father is the village landlord, so that he can't miss her during the vacation. The only thing that lies between the college and the village is the same corn field, which is now currently being protected by a big wall, that is believed to be the hunting grounds of the strange creature, that the people now call Ambuli. Though some people called it a myth, many believed that Ambuli did exist. One night, despite warnings from Vendhan, Amudhan decides to go through the corn field to reach Poomanandhipuram to meet Poongavanam. He makes the first trip successfully, but while he returns, he hears the same strange noise and is chased and thrown off his cycle by Ambuli, which is not yet shown on screen. Amudhan runs for his life and reaches the college, where he meets Vendhan, narrates him what happened, and reveals to him that Ambuli is real. Vendhan is little convinced by Amudhan's narration of his story and they both decide to visit the corn field together that night to see what really is happening. They both travel the entire field and reach one corner and find a wooden cabin, which is the very place where the British forest ranger once lived, and they meet Sengodan there. Sengodan guards the fields, but his looks cause a little bit of suspicion to Amudhan and Vendhan that he might be Ambuli. But Sengodan does not harm them and Amudhan and Vendhan escape the cabin.  The next day, Amudhan and Vendhan ask Vethagiri about Ambuli and about Sengodan. Vethagiri is very much angered by the news that they both travelled alone at night in the corn fields and tell them that death awaits whoever enters the field at night, as Ambuli lives there, that has killed so many people in the past and is still hungry for human life. Vethagiri, upon being asked whether Ambuli is real, he revealed that he had once seen Ambuli committed a murder in the corn fields, causing him to become an alcoholic to get rid of his fear of Ambuli. Before becoming an alcoholic, he planned to leave the village with Vendhan from Ambuli, but was unable to, when someone from Sir Arthur Welling College had given Vendhan a seat in the college, which Vethagiri accepted. He explains that Vendhan is the only person he has got and if something happens to him, he can't live. So, he humbly requests them not to go there again. But, he still accepts to tell them about Ambuli and Sengodan. About some 40 years ago, on the day of Solar eclipse, a pregnant woman named Ponni, who has no one except her elder child, walks into the village of Poomanandhipuram, but faints right under the sun, which it was believed that one who comes out on a solar eclipse, will be affected badly by the radiation. The villagers rescue her and she gives birth to a baby child the very night. But the baby, that was born was not exactly a human being. It was half human and half beast like a neanderthal. The baby then bites on the left arm of the village lady doctor, Seemati and it also attacks and kills another women fatally. The villagers then locked both Ponni and Ambuli in the house. Ponni, who was given a choice of either to destroy Ambuli, decides to let Ambuli go, while committing suicide, unable to face the humiliation. Ambuli escapes into the fields, and it has been till date been killing humans.  Vethagiri also reveals that Sengoden is a murderer.  Vethagiri remarks and points out that Amudhan and Vendhan are lucky not to be harmed by Sengoden. This is the story Vethagiri explained to both Amudhan and Vendhan .  Vendhan and Amudhan decide to collect more details about Ambuli. So, they visit many people in the village and enquire about Ambuli. During at that time, Vendhan fell in love with Valarmalai, who is a tuition master's daughter and Poongavanam's friend. They meet one of the senior students at Sir Arthur Wellington College, Marudhan, who is a practical youth and does not believe in Ambuli at all. But ironically, Marudhan's grandma is the village lady doctor, Seemati whose left arm was bitten by Ambuli at its childbirth. They find a painting of Ambuli from another senior student of the college, Velpari who writes a journal in the previous edition of the college magazine about the mass migration of people from the Poomanandhipuram village into another village, due to the fear of Ambuli and is currently running a rice mill. With this painting as a proof, they try to make a complaint in the police station, where the head police officer demand they need at least a photograph as a proof and not a painting. Vendhan and Amudhan accept the challenge and decides to visit the corn fields to take a picture of Ambuli. But they are once again interrupted by Sengodan killing Gugan, one of the villagers, who attempted to kill Ambuli to revenge for the death of his daughter, who is one of Ambuli's victims and they take a picture of him, thinking that he is Ambuli, only for them to get shocked at this fact, that Sengoden is revealed to be none other than the elder brother of Ambuli by Vethagiri, the next day, when they had attempted to make him stop his drinking habit and show him proof that Sengodan is Ambuli. Vethagiri also revealed that Sengodan killed the founder of the college, Sir Arthur Wellington, who was his first victim and had caused him to be viewed as a murderer in the villagers.  One night, as things went this way, Marudhan gets very curious about Ambuli, and decides to investigate things on his own. Thus, he secretly follows a villager, who takes a full grown goat with him, and ties it to a small boat and sends into the lake, that lies ahead of the old caves of a temple, that are now abandoned by the villagers. Marudhan watches the boat float away and the goat is now gone. He understands that the villagers were paying sacrifice to Ambuli to vent his anger. So the next day, he decides to see what lies ahead of the lake. He goes in the same boat and enters the caves where he encounters Ambuli. Terrified, he runs for his life and escapes from the caves. Now having started to believe in Ambuli, he enquires about it to Seemati. At the same time, Amudhan and Vendhan check for some details in the college library about Ambuli. They enter Sir Arthur Wellington's room, which was not opened at all for years and find an important clue about a book about [[Gandhi]] located in a book shelf in the college library on his table. They found the book shelf where they find a key inside the book about [[Gandhi]] on the shelf, which can unlock a secret Projector room hidden behind the book shelf in the library, which also contains a chemical lab that has been locked for years. They find some projector reels and old documents in a drawer and start watching and reading them, while at the same time Seemati narrates to Marudhan what actually happened to Ponni and why Ambuli was born like a beast. What follows is a very terrible truth that entirely shocks Amudhan, Vendhan and Marudhan.  Sir Arthur Wellington, who is not only the founder of his self-named college in the southern parts of India, but was also basically a scientist having worked with the [[British army]] during [[World War II]]. After his retirement, he begins the college in South India. His longtime goal is to successfully carry out and finish his project, which is to create humans who can live for 150 years healthily. He decides to use Ponni as his specimen/test subject and injects any kind of his chemicals into her womb. This starts having an impact on Ambuli. Sir Wellington dopes her with strong sedatives, so that she visits him often for checkup, so that he can carry out his test without any problem. As she reaches her pregnancy date, she is affected too much by the sedatives and starts heading to Sir Wellington's laboratory to get herself checked. That day turns out to be the Solar eclipse, and unfortunately, she is affected by the radiation form of the eclipse. This causes a big change in her womb and thus Ambuli is born as a beast. Seemati, who checked her pregnancy and is terrified by the looks and behavior of Ambuli, tells Ponni to kill Ambuli right then and there. But she lets Ambuli escape and commits suicide out of humiliation. Angered by this, Sengoden kills Sir Wellington, who is the reason for all this.  Now having collected all details about Ambuli, Amudhan, Vendhan and Marudhan decide that there is no use for all of them including the villagers hiding from Ambuli and they must fight against it or else they all will die of fear. Marudhan tried to a strong mass of villagers to hunt down and destroy Ambuli for good, but failed because of the refusal of the village landlord. Poongavanam and Valarmalai decided to check on Amudhan and Vendhan that night, having been well aware of their investigation on Ambuli. Both the tuition master and the landlord discovered their disappearances that night. So the landload accepts Marudhan's plan and the villagers gather as a strong mass and set out to hunt and destroy Ambuli for good, headed by Marudhan. Poongavanam somehow got trapped between thorn bushes in the corn fields, but is helped by Sengodan, only for Sengodan to caputre and gagged her at the cabin. Amudhan and Vendhan arrived to find Sengodan, only to find Poongavanam there, tied up and gagged. Amudhan and Vendhan then revealed to Poongavanam that of Ambuli's location, only for Sengodan to overhear their conversation and offering to go along with them. While setting out to meet Ambuli, Valarmalai attempted to attacked Sengodan, thinking he got Amudhan, Vendhan, and Poongavanam captives, only to stopped by them and ended joining along with them. They visit the caves at night, and there comes a tall, fierce looking ape like creature, which is finally shown and revealed to be Ambuli. As Ambuli tries to attack the group, Sengodan fights it bravely. The villagers also rush to the caves. Then suddenly the army and the police arrives there with tranquilizers, having been alerted by the head police officer, who is convinced by Amudhan and Vendhan that Ambuli does exist, thanks to the projector room, the chemical lab, the old documents, and the projector reels from Sir Arthur Wellington College. After an intense battle in the field between the army, the police, and Ambuli, Ambuli is tranquilized with the help of Sengodan. The army captures Ambuli and he is taken away in a secured box. Sengodan is heavily and critically injured by Ambuli, manages to survive from the fight between him and Ambuli. Amudhan and Vendhan apologized to him for suspecting him as Ambuli. Sengodan revealed that he wanted to kill and destroy Ambuli, right after killing Sir Wellington, but was only unfortunately, arrested by the police and put in jail as a result, only for to be released years later til now. When asked By Amudhan And Vendhan on why he killed Gugan and kidnapped Poongavanam, Sengodan revealed that he had mistaken Gogan as Ambuli and that, he was also trying to save Poongavannam from Ambuli. The villagers finally thank Marudhan, Sengodan, Amudhan and Vendhan for their heroics in capturing Ambuli and thus, ending their long time fear.   As the credits roll out, a final shot is shown which is to happen in [[Dehradun]], where the box in which Ambuli is being carried. The box slowly starts moving a little and it cracks suddenly. It is to be understood that Ambuli escapes from the box and sets on his next hunt. The film ends with a line in Tamil, which means in English, Ambuli's hunt will continue!

Billy is in need of a medical professional to patch up a man bleeding in his club's basement, the obvious victim of illegal dealings, and offers Mary $5,000 to perform emergency surgery, no questions asked. Mary accepts the money, but spends the next few days terrified the criminal activity she got involved in will follow her home.   In a way, it does. Mary is approached by Beatress Johnson, a stripper at the club where Mary applied. Beatress has had extreme plastic surgery to make herself resemble [[Betty Boop]]. Beatress offers Mary a large sum of money to perform illegal surgery on a friend of hers, Ruby Realgirl, in a veterinary clinic. Ruby wishes to be transformed into a human doll, and has been unable to find a surgeon willing to complete the last step in her transformation: removing her nipples, all external genitalia, and partially suturing her [[vulva]] shut. Mary performs the surgery because she needs the funds and is convinced Ruby's desire is genuine. Follow up on Ruby's website introduces Mary to the world of extreme body modification.  Mary begins her residency in the surgical specialty, and her teachers and mentors praise her promising skills. Mary is invited to what she believes is a networking party with several of the head surgeons at her hospital. It is not. Mary was the only young resident invited, and the surgeons commit lewd acts on the others in attendance, who are obviously escorts. Mary is drugged, choked, and raped at the party by her former teacher, Dr. Alan Grant, who films the assault. None of her teachers or mentors express guilt or remorse for her attack, and Mary drops out of her residency.  Mary hires Billy and his enforcers from his club to kidnap Grant and deliver him to her apartment for her revenge, which includes involuntary surgery.   Mary goes into consensual [[body modification]] surgery full-time, with word quickly spreading through dark web channels that "Bloody Mary" is a surgeon of great skill, willing to perform any extreme surgery desired. She establishes herself in Billy's strip club and uses his contacts for her new business.   A police detective, Detective Dolor, approaches Mary about the disappearance of Dr. Grant and the collection of disturbing tapes found in his apartment. Dr. Walsh, the surgeon who had invited Mary to the party, gave Mary's name to the detective on a long list of women who might bear a grudge against Dr. Grant.  Mary has actually been keeping Dr. Grant alive and using him as "practice" material for her extreme surgeries, using pictures of his modifications as the portfolio she's based her business on. Mary kills a security guard who came across Dr. Grant, and Billy, who has become attached to Mary, kidnaps and beats Dr. Walsh on her behalf.   Detective Dolor approaches Mary again, hoping to help her since he's learned about the sex parties the two missing doctors used to throw and believing she had been a victim of one. The police circle closer, suspicious about the second disappearance of a surgeon from her residency and Mary's recent wealth.  Mary begins to unravel from the police interest, worry that a tape of her rape will be found, and over the death of her grandmother.

Afterwards, the tour guide gives them each a dram of whisky and asks them to smell it, and Robbie is complimented on his ability to identify flavours.   However, Robbie is still being pursued by his old enemy, Clancy ([[Scott Kyle]]). He is about to undergo a beating by Clancy and his followers when he is unexpectedly rescued by Leonie's father. Robbie pleads to be given one last chance but the older man tells him that it's too late, and even if he wanted to change, he cannot escape the feuds and violence of the world he grew up in. Leonie's father tells him that the only way for him to escape the cycle is to leave Glasgow altogether and go to London, but without Leonie. He offers Robbie £5,000 to sweeten the deal and leaves Robbie to think it over.  At the next community service session, Harry approaches Robbie and asks if he'd like to come to a [[whisky tasting]] session in Edinburgh. Robbie, in turn, invites the other members of the group, where they learn about a cask of priceless whisky, the [[Islay whisky#Closed distilleries|Malt Mill]], set to go on auction soon, and Robbie is passed a card by a whisky collector, Thaddeus (Roger Allam). After they leave, Mo (Jasmin Riggins) reveals she spotted and stole documents detailing the warehouse in which the "Malt Mill" is kept but Robbie tells her that he is not interested in crime and is determined to stay straight for the sake of Leonie and Luke.  Robbie and Leonie view a flat which they could rent for six months while the owner is away. Robbie seems touched but it is then revealed they have been followed by one of Clancy's men and Clancy will know where they are going to live. Robbie, realising that he can't continue living under threat of assault on himself and his family, begins planning to steal the Malt Mill with his community service partners. They secure an invitation to the tasting and auction, during which Robbie hides in the warehouse overnight and siphons some whisky into empty [[Irn-Bru]] bottles, before he is interrupted by Thaddeus and Angus Dobie (David Goodall). Robbie covertly witnesses Thaddeus attempting to bribe Dobie into selling him some of the whisky before the cask goes on auction but he refuses and the two leave, after which Robbie then tops up the cask with cheaper whisky from an adjacent cask. At the auction, the group see Thaddeus outbid by an American, who tastes the cask, and is apparently happy with the slightly diluted blend.  Afterwards, Robbie approaches Thaddeus and negotiates a sale of three bottles for £200,000, and "a real job". They plan to make the exchange in Glasgow, and so begin the trek home, but inadvertently break two of their four bottles during an encounter with the police. Robbie is furious, but goes ahead with meeting Thaddeus, and negotiates a sale for £100,000 and a permanent job far away from Glasgow. Afterwards, Robbie reveals to his friends that he didn't sell two bottles, but one. The scene cuts to show Harry coming home to find a bottle of Irn Bru sitting on his kitchen table next to an open window, with a note thanking him and presenting his "angels' share", next to a newspaper piece showing a photo of the community payback group next to the cask. He smells the bottle and rejoices at the Malt Mill inside.  In the final scene, we see Robbie and Leonie leave for [[Stirling]] in an immaculate old [[Volkswagen Type 2]], having made temporary goodbyes to the rest of the group. After they leave, the rest of the group resolve to go get wasted. The film ends with [[The Proclaimers]]' "[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)|500 Miles]]" playing.  
Angus Buchan's Ordinary People
 The film opens with Angus Buchan's story as he realizes from the time he is a teen that he wants to be a preacher, and is discouraged when his minister tells him about the years of schooling he must complete.  He goes on to acquire a farm and eventually marry, and while he works hard to make a success of his land, he never abandons his dream.  He begins by preaching to the maize in his field from the back of his truck, and this grows into his audience of thousands at his Mighty Men's Conferences.  The story then shifts to three interwoven stories, based on real characters and real events.  Lucky Nzimande (Lucky Koza) is a career criminal who unwittingly attempts to hijack what turns out to be two policemen on their way to the Mighty Men's Conference.  After his gun fails to fire on Lucky, one of the policemen takes this as a sign from God that he is meant to take the man to the Conference with them. They handcuff Lucky in the back and ask him about his story; he talks about never knowing his father and his mother dying when he was 8.  He started stealing early on to help provide for his siblings and grandmother, who died when he was 13.  Lucky escapes from the policemen and is assaulted that night, suffering a gash on his head.  The next day the men see him and kindly offer to tend to his wound and give him a ride home.  Afterwards he agrees to go to the Conference with them.  André Cloete (Jaco Muller) is an alcoholic young adult who is self-destructing quickly due in part to his emotionally absent but strictly religious father.  His mother covers for him when he crashes his car into a neighbor's gate, begging her not to call the police.  After another severe accident his father prays over him and realizes he is too harsh, but Andre continues to drink and party after getting out of the hospital.  He then finally agrees to attend the Conference with his father and brother.  John Peters (Anton Dekker) is a middle-aged [[panel beater]] and biker with two sons.  He marries a woman named Marlene and she and her two girls move in with them.  Marlene's brother-in-law Danny (David James) asks John for a business loan; John doesn't have the money but agrees to stand surety if Danny applies for a bank loan.  John's youngest son then dies in a motorcycle accident, Danny defaults on the loan and John is diagnosed with a chronic lung condition. Sensing he is taking his anger out on his oldest son, Marlene encourages him to attend the Conference.  John reconciles with Danny and apologizes to his son before he goes.  The men all make their way to a Mighty Men's Conference where they listen to Buchan's preaching, which includes his recounting of the two heart attacks he suffered the year before.  After the Conference, Lucky returns to his impoverished hometown and begins passing out religious flyers.  Andre calls a friend and tells him that he's given his life to the Lord.  John suffers an accident on the way home and dies.  After his funeral, Danny is seen off to himself, crying and praying.  The film ends with titles revealing that Lucky continues to preach, Andre does volunteer work, and John's oldest son Gavin took over his business and continues to care for Marlene and her girls.<ref name="gateway" /><ref name=screenafrica></ref>  
Antiviral (film)
 In a [[dystopian]] near-future, Syd March ([[Caleb Landry Jones]]) is employed by the Lucas Clinic, a company which purchases viruses and other pathogens from celebrities who fall ill, in order to inject them into clients who desire a connection with celebrities. In particular, the pathogens supplied by the Lucas Clinic's exclusive celebrity Hannah Geist ([[Sarah Gadon]]) are extremely popular, and another employee at the clinic, Derek Lessing (Reid Morgan), is responsible for harvesting them from Hannah directly. To make extra money, Syd uses his own body as an incubator, steals pathogens from the lab, and sells them on the [[black market]]. To do so, he uses a stolen console to break the copy protection placed on the virus by the clinic; once injected in a client, the pathogen is rendered incommunicable. He then passes the pathogens to Arvid ([[Joe Pingue]]), who works at Astral Bodies, a celebrity [[meat market]] where meat is grown from the cells of celebrities for consumption.  After Derek is caught smuggling and arrested, Lucas asks Syd to take his place and harvest a pathogen from Hannah, who has recently fallen ill. Once he has taken a blood sample from Hannah, Syd quickly injects himself with some of her blood. He experiences the first symptoms, fever and disorientation, rapidly, and he leaves work early. His attempts to remove the virus' copy protection are unsuccessful, and the console is destroyed during the process. When Syd awakens from severe delirium the next day, he discovers Hannah has died from the unknown disease, and all products harvested from her have skyrocketed in popularity. Desperate to fix his console, he approaches Arvid, who sets up a meeting with Levine, the leader of the piracy group. Levine offers to fix the console in exchange for samples of Syd's blood, but Syd refuses. Levine subdues him and forcibly takes samples from Syd, as the pathogen which killed Hannah is now hotly in demand on the black market, and lethal pathogens are not legal to distribute.  The next day, a severely ill Syd is approached by two men, who drive him to an undisclosed location where Hannah is actually still alive. Syd learns from Hannah's physician Dr. Abendroth that the virus infecting them both has been intentionally engineered with a security measure to prevent analysis, which explains why Syd's console was destroyed. Hannah's death was fabricated to protect her, but she is shown to be in the extreme stages of the illness, extremely weak and bleeding from her mouth. Dr. Abendroth reveals to Syd that the virus is a modified version of an illness that Hannah has had before, and that he himself has an infatuation with her, having had samples of her skin grafted to his own arm. He further suggests that since Syd unnecessarily injected himself with Hannah's blood, he too is "just another fan." As Syd's condition worsens, he returns to the Lucas Clinic, where he traces the original strain of the virus to Derek, who sold it to a rival company, Vole & Tesser. Dr Abendroth discovers that Vole & Tesser patented the modified strain, though their motives remain unclear.  Before Syd can proceed further, he is abducted by Levine and incarcerated in a room where his deterioration and death will be broadcast on [[reality television]] to sate Hannah's fans, who could not witness her death. As Syd begins to show the final symptoms, he escapes by spearing Levine in the mouth with a syringe and holding a nurse hostage with his infected blood. After Syd realizes that Vole & Tesser infected Hannah to harvest their own patented pathogen from her, Syd contacts Tesser and negotiates a deal. The film closes with a [[virtual-reality]] version of Hannah that advertises her "Afterlife" exclusively from Vole & Tesser. Syd is shown working for Vole & Tesser, where Hannah's cells have been replicated to form a distorted cell garden from Astral Bodies' celebrity meat technology. Viruses injected into her system are sold. Syd demonstrates a new virus as he sticks a needle into a genetically created arm. Later, while alone,  Syd cuts the arm and drinks the flowing blood; it is revealed the arm is in fact Hannah's, as her  deformed face and body are shown to be in the Cell Garden chamber.  
Another (film)
 On April 19, 1998, Koichi Sakakibara is hospitalized at Yumigaoka Hospital due to a [[pneumothorax]] episode. He stumbles upon an eyepatch-wearing girl as she boards an elevator to the hospital's abandoned basement, ignoring Koichi's attempts to communicate. Three weeks later, Koichi enters Yomiyama North Middle School as a transfer student of Class 3-3. Yomiyama is his deceased mother's childhood home, and, while his father is abroad in [[India]], Koichi is temporarily staying there alongside his grandmother and aunt, Reiko, who is also Class 3-3's homeroom teacher. The eyepatch girl, Mei Misaki, is one of his classmates, but he is confused as others are apparently unaware of her existence. Koichi suspects that Mei is a ghost once told about a student named Misaki who died years ago. However, he quickly realizes that Mei is very much alive, only that her existence is ignored by the entire school.  Despite others' attempt to dissuade him from contacting Mei, Koichi continues to gather information about her, learning that beneath the eyepatch, she has a glass eye in place of her left eye. She claims that she is able to see a death aura using it, thus recognizing which people are about or already died. When a student is trying to stop him from talking with Mei, she suffers a fatal freak accident in which her neck becomes stabbed by the sharp end of an umbrella. Another accident occurs during Koichi's visit to Yumigaoka Hospital, in which his nurse is killed by glass impaling her head. The next day, Koichi discovers that for disobeying the rule of not talking with Mei, the entire school punishes him by also ignoring his existence. This allows Koichi to finally befriend Mei for good.  Koichi and Mei gather more information about the freak accidents from their teacher, Tatsuji Chibiki. Chibiki tells them the truth about the accidents, which are actually a curse connected to Misaki Yomiyama, a student of Class 3-3 who died 26 years ago. After his death, his classmates, unable to let him go, kept pretending that he was still around, even leaving an empty chair for him. However, this created an anomaly in which for every year afterward, a dead person would be a part of the class. Due to the extra body count, another student has to offer themselves to be excluded for the entire year; if the rule is broken, nature is compelled to "delete" the class members one by one. Also, a mass amnesia affects the class for the duration of the year, so everyone would not know the identity of the deceased, even the person in question themselves.   After two more people die from the curse, Koichi and Mei discover a tape in an abandoned classroom. The tape, recorded by a Class 3-3 student from the year 1983, is a method on how to temporarily end the curse: by killing the extra person during the school trip held in August. During the trip, the two are allowed to mingle with their classmates, as Reiko decides that since deaths still occur despite the student exclusion method, they will have to try other methods. As Mei is adjusting her eyepatch, she looks at Reiko and realizes that she is the extra person. However, she is distracted by students uncovering the contents of the tape and spreading the news around, causing them to turn on each other. The commotion kills at least four people, including Chibiki, and sets the hotel on fire. Despite Koichi's attempt to save her, Reiko, learning about Mei's discovery, decides to let herself die and stop the curse.   Several days later, everyone in Yomiyama has forgotten about Reiko being there for the year. Koichi and Mei record another tape for juniors about the clues in ending the curse (the old one having been destroyed during the school trip). As his father has come home, Koichi leaves Yomiyama and bids Mei goodbye. 14 years later, Koichi visits Yomiyama North to hand the tape to a student of Class 3-3, whose classroom teacher is revealed to be Chibiki.

Strange things begin to occur in the apartment and when Janet appears bruised at work, she rebuffs concerns that her boyfriend, Mark, is abusing her and blames the marks on sleepwalking.  Janet is shaken by the strange events that are happening preferring to stay late at the office rather than return to apartment 1303. She calls her sister, Lara, to ask if she can return home but Lara informs her this would be a bad idea as their mother is having another "drunk psycho rant". Janet suggests going to a hotel but this is quickly dismissed as Lara is not able to pay for it. Janet then calls Mark who is back in town and he agrees to call round. Later that night, Janet is awoken by strange supernatural elements in the apartment but unfortunately Mark is no longer around. An invisible [[ghost]] possesses Janet leading to her own depression and suicide. Her sister, Lara, later arrives to gather the possessed Janet's belongings and begins to experience the same terrors.  A detective that was on the case talks to Lara and she believes Janet was murdered. He agrees since he's been investigating unknown suicides with other tenants. Lara discovers the name of the first tenant from 20 years back, Jennifer Logan. The detective tells Lara the sad story of what happened to Jennifer. At the age of 12, she moved into apartment 1303 with her mother, Mary, a respectable school teacher and recently divorced. For the first few years in the apartment, they lived in peace and Mary was a loving mother to Jennifer.  However, the peace was shattered when Mary lost her job as a teacher during a dispute with a parent in a parent-teacher conference. She found work as a prostitute to pay for the apartment, became an alcoholic and brutally abused Jennifer. This leads to Jennifer murdering Mary and burying her in a built in closet. Soon neighbors complained about the smell of the apartment, causing the police and the health department to investigate. By the time they got to the apartment to confront Jennifer, she had already committed suicide by jumping out the window and the police found the decomposed body of Mary. In the years that followed, more tenants were thought to have committed suicide with Janet being the recent one.

However, another dispute with Maddie has Lara moving into the same apartment and unintentionally ignoring Janet's warning. Jennifer soon arrives and kills Mark by throwing him out the window. Horrified, Lara tries to escape the apartment complex to avoid Jennifer trying to kill her and permanently stay away from the complex for good. However, she catches Emily and the landlord, O'Neill in front of her. He finally reveals the truth to Lara about his and his daughter, Emily's fate. A year after apartment 1303 was cleaned, they moved in and became Jennifer's first victims.  Lara learns that O'Neill, Emily along with Janet and the previous victims had been trying to warn others to never move into apartment 1303 to no avail. When Jennifer starts to close in on her, Lara grabs a knife to try to defend herself. As Maddie tries to talk some sense to Lara, Jennifer pushes her towards the knife and kills her. Just before she can finish the job to kill Lara, the police arrive and Jennifer disappears. Lara is arrested for both Maddie and Mark's murder and is taken away to be booked. As the sun rises, Jennifer is last seen sitting on the same spot where she committed suicide: an unseen warning of what happens when anyone moves into apartment 1303.

Robert calls Jimmy Grant ([[Nate Parker]]), a twenty-three-year-old man from [[Harlem]] with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Robert's driver for many years. After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer ([[Tim Roth]]). Bryer is keen on arresting Robert for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together. Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.  Jimmy is arrested and placed before a [[grand jury]] but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good. Eventually, the sale is closed, but Robert finds a way to avoid being charged. He proves that Bryer had fabricated evidence. The case against Jimmy is dismissed, and the detective is ordered not to go near him. Robert's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth. When Robert refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and [[bleeding]] but will tell them that he was there all night if he agrees to sign.  In the final scene, Robert addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter. As Robert approaches the podium to deliver his speech the screen cuts to black, leaving his decision ambiguous.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  
Aquí y Allá
 Pedro returns home to the village of [[Copanatoyac]], the "(Aquí) or Here" of the title, in the [[Sierra Madre del Sur|Sierra mountains]] of [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]]. After a few years working in New York to support his family back home, he now finds his daughters on the verge of [[adolescence]], and is unsure of what to expect.  The younger of the two, Heidi, quickly becomes eager to reconnect, while his older daughter, Lorena, is more distant than he imagined.  His wife, Teresa, still has the same smile.  Although, she senses he may have had a woman in the US, and is guarded in their intimate moments.  Having saved his earnings from two long periods of work in the US, Pedro hopes to now finally make a better life at home with his family, without having to leave them again.  He even finally plans to pursue his own version of the [[American Dream]] on the side by starting a band: the Copa Kings.  Only the purity of music seems able to diffuse Lorena's moody resentment toward her father's years of absence.  The villagers think this year’s crop will be bountiful. There is also good work in the growing city of [[Tlapa de Comonfort|Tlapa]] an hour away. But the locals are wise to a life of insecurity, and their thoughts are often of family members or opportunities far away, north of the [[Mexican-American border|border]]. While working in the [[milpas|cornfields]], Pedro meets and begins to mentor a teenager, Leo, who dreams of the US.  Leo's love of [[breakdancing]] helps him to win over Karla, a studious girl he meets but a [[Folk dance of Mexico|folk dancer]] herself.  Their budding first love recalls Pedro's and Teresa's of a generation before.  For Pedro, whether consoling the grieving mother of a friend who died inexplicably "over there", or meeting a new nephew being raised by extended family members because his parents have [[emigrated]] to the US—that place, the "(Allá) or There" of the title, somehow always feels very present, practically knocking at the door.  Teresa soon becomes pregnant with a third child, but complications force Pedro to deal with the ensuing medical issues and their expense.  He also begins to have moments of triumph playing local concerts and dances with the Copa Kings—as Pedro sings in his song "Quiero [[Toast (honor)|Brindar]]", "I wanna drink to all I've got and to all I've accomplished."  Although earning a living as a band leader and musician proves difficult.  For the locals, work in the fields depends on a good [[harvest]], and construction work seems determined by inexplicable economic forces outside of their control.  Pedro may, once again, be forced to confront the [[paradox]] that, "in order to feed their love ones, [[emigrants]] have to leave them behind."<ref name="variety">http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947553/</ref>

Arjun: The Warrior Prince
 The story is based on the early life of the [[Pandava|Prince Arjuna]], loosely taken from the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The storyline begins with [[Arjuna|Arjun]] as a nine-year-old boy, and follows him until he grows into the [[Kshatriya|warrior]] that the world knows him as. It explores his life with his brothers in [[Hastinapur]], his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.  The movie begins with the young prince of Viratnagar asking a maid to tell him a story. The maid narrates him the story of [[Arjuna|Arjun]].  She tells him that Arjun was a student of [[Drona]], and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of [[Drona]]. None of his own brothers, nor his cousins - the hundred Kaurvas - could equal him in the art. [[Duryodhana]] and the other Kaurvas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne.  When the king [[Dhritrashtra]] grew older, the rivalry between his sons the [[Kaurvas]] and the [[Pandavas]] intensified. Twice, Duryodhana attempted to kill all the Pandavas, but failed. To avoid further conflict, [[Dhritrashtra]] proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of [[Hastinapur]], and asked [[Yudhishthira]] to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire.  In the meantime, Arjun won a [[swayamvar]], and married the daughter of the King of Panchala, [[Draupadi]]. Duryodhana, who loathed the [[Pandavas]], hatched a conspiracy with his uncle [[Shakuni]] and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called [[chaupar]]. After losing everything, [[Yudhishthira]] betted his own brothers and Draupadi, and even himself. Draupadi was insulted in front of everyone, but Arjuna could not say anything because [[Yudhishthira]] was the king, and the king's words are the last words. The Pandavas, according to the rules of the game, had to go into exile for twelve years and an [[agyatavasa]] for one year. While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do [[tapasya]]. Before leaving, [[Draupadi]] makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves, and does [[tapasya]], during which he earns a bow from the Lord [[Shiva]].  The story then shifts back to the present day Viratnagar. It is revealed that the Pandavas are spending their secret exile, or 'agyatavasa', there, and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the outcome of the game, if any one of the Pandavas is found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve-year exile.  The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits. However, that is the bait. From the other direction Duryodhana's army comes, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight.  Uttar's maid drives the young prince's chariot to the field, but the prince, distraught by the number of enemies, flees. The maid stops him, and reveals her true identity: Arjun. Arjun retrieves his bow and makes prince Uttar drive his chariot. The warrior massacres the army and emerges victorious and at last Arjuna alone defeats all kaurava warriors including Bhisma and Drona.  
Argo (2012 film)
 On November 4, 1979, Iranian activists storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. 60 of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for consultation. He criticizes the proposals, but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees:  that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.  Mendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a "science fantasy adventure" in the style of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.  Posing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.  Mendez is told that the operation has been cancelled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.  To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterwards. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.

The first day of snow arrives, and Seo-yeon is left waiting in the abandoned house alone. Heartbroken, she leaves behind her [[portable CD player]] with a CD of her favorite artist.  Seo-yeon in the present day receives that very same CD player and CD from Seung-min, meaning that he actually went to the house later and remembered their promise. But despite the bitter-sweetness of their first love, in the end, Seung-min still chooses his fiancée Eun-chae and flies with her to America, while Seo-yeon sits in the house he built for her, listening to the CD.<ref>[http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/architecture-101 "Architecture 101"].

However, this time, Asura speaks in the human tongue he learned from Wakasa, cursing himself and wishing he wasn't born. The monk lectures him about humanity; he chops off his right arm, gives it to Asura, and provokes him to consume it, scaring Asura away instead.  In the mean time, food has become scarce. Wakasa's father was given the choice of selling her for a high price by another villager but was chased away. Shichiro provides whatever food he can scrimmage for Wakasa, but it is still not enough as Wakasa goes around the village asking for any food that can be spared. Shichiro's desperation forced him to resort to stealing from other homes while Wakasa lays dying in her home, including her father. Seeing this, Asura returns to the village and kills Jito's horse, offering the horse's flesh to her and her father; she refuses to take it, believing it to be human flesh no matter what he said. Meanwhile, the villagers were informed by Wakasa's father that Asura is in the village and that he killed Jito's horse. Along with Jito as their leader, the villagers give chase with torches. Jito dies shortly after Asura ambushed him and he continues to run across a rope bridge. Before he could reach the other side, the villagers burned the rope holding the bridge and Asura falls into the river.  Winter arrives; Wakasa is dead and her corpse is being carried by Shichiro and four village boys presumably to her burial place. They passed by Asura, who somehow survived the fall but Asura does not look at her corpse. The monk narrates the beauty of life as Asura is shown carving a wooden statue with his head shaved, indicating he became a monk. In the post-credit scene, the land is seen rich and fertile again with white doves flying above.

Astronaut: The Last Push
 The film opens with a montage of footage which include greetings from Earth and an interview of the sponsor of the mission. Astronauts Nathan Miller and Michael Forrest are onboard Life One, a [[spacecraft]] built by Moffit Industries. They are supposed to be in hibernation for 6 years until they reach [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], taking a route around [[Venus]], sling-shotting around [[Earth]] to gain speed to get to Europa.   Midway through the first leg of their journey, Life One's proximity sensors sound; the ship is impacted and Michael Forrest is awakened. Michael escapes and seals the damaged hibernation and re-entry capsule with Nathan still inside. The habitation module Michael escapes to is leaking oxygen and is quickly repaired. Michael then makes contact with mission control. Aside from damage to the hibernation and re-entry capsule, along with engine control, the ship is intact.  Michael struggles to stay sane in the solitude while attempting to make repairs to Life One in order to fire the engines after swinging around Venus. Without the engines firing, Life One would stay in orbit around Venus. Mission control and Michael keep in regular contact, with Michael giving regular status reports on himself, and mission control giving encouragement and help in repairing the ship. Michael grows more frustrated over time as the repairs prove ineffective during engine tests. During one of the engine tests, the ship suffers a complete power failure. Michael desperately attempts to restore power but slowly loses hope as time progresses, the repairs fail to restore power, and the ship becomes cold. After a hallucination of his fellow astronaut jolts him awake, he makes one final effort to repair the ship which proves successful.  As the ship rounds Venus, Michael dons his space suit and re-enters the damaged hibernation capsule for the first time since the accident. He looks out of the window in awe at the sight of Venus' atmosphere below him. After passing Venus, he successfully ignites the engines and is two years away from Earth. On arriving at Earth he only has to reignite the engines to slow the ship down for a re-entry, but chooses not to. He instead chooses to [[Gravity assist|slingshot]] past Earth per the original mission, and go to Europa, stating "Someone's supposed to go, Someone's supposed to see this". The film closes with him addressing Earth, as he ejects the hibernation capsule (along with Nathan) sending it to Earth, then reigniting the engines to take him to Europa.

  David Hargrove ([[Brian Geraghty]]) is a [[stockbroker]] having trouble asking out his co-worker Emily Brandt ([[Alice Eve]]), who is resigning for a position with the [[Metropolitan planning organization|MPO]]. At a Christmas party, David offers to drop Emily home. Reluctantly, David also agrees to drive home his other co-worker Corey Thompson ([[Josh Peck]]), who accompanies them. During the car ride at midnight, Corey forces David to stop at a local [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] booth, needing to withdraw cash to buy pizza at a restaurant.   David spites Corey by parking some distance away, making him walk. However, David and Emily join Corey inside when he encounters card problems. When the three are about to leave, they spot a hooded figure (Mike O'Brian) in a [[parka (coat)|parka coat]] lurking outside in the parking lot. They panic and Corey suggests they return to the car, but David and Emily suspect the figure to be a robber. They also discover he cannot enter without an ATM card.  When the hooded man kills a dog walker, they attempt to phone the police, only to realize that their cellphones were left in the car. The hooded man shuts down the booth's heater, rendering the booth cold to match the weather. David opts to negotiate their safety by giving the killer $500, earrings and a watch. He uses this to escape to his car, where he finds out that wires are severed, and the car cannot start. David attempts to call 911 but is attacked by the pursuing figure. He accidentally drops the phone in his attempt to escape from the hooded man.  Trying to attract assistance, Emily then uses her lipstick to write "HELP" on the booth's window, as the hooded figure tidies the scene outside. David, Emily and Corey are freezing when a security guard (Ernesto Griffith) locates them. When the guard tries to call the cops, the hooded man beats him to death using a tire iron from David's car trunk, leaving the three witnesses in shock. When a man with a similar coat abruptly enters the booth, he is subdued and killed by David and Corey, but is later revealed to be only an innocent janitor. Frustrated, Corey takes the janitor's coat and leaves, but gets caught and stabbed by the hooded man, and seemingly killed.  After several hours, David and Emily realize Corey is still alive. They retrieve him from outside, narrowly managing to return to the booth before the hooded man can get to them. The hooded man then blocks the booth door with David's car and tries to freeze them to death, by filling the booth with cold water. Corey eventually dies of blood loss and [[hypothermia]]. David lifts Emily on his shoulders to successfully trigger the [[fire sprinkler system]] alarm using the janitor's lighter, a trash can, and some paper; but David slipped, cause Emily falls and fatally snaps her neck.  Relentless, the hooded man sends the security guard's car into David's car, which slams into the booth and breaks it down. Angered, David improvises a [[Molotov cocktail]] and throws it at the hooded killer, but the figure he sets ablaze turns out to be the dead security guard in a parka coat. The police arrive but David is arrested as the hooded man hides himself. As David is driven away, he sees many unknown figures wearing parka coats in the crowd at the crime scene. The killer among the crowd spies on David and leaves the scene. The police recover surveillance recordings of the events within the ATM booth, but it is made clear the killer had planned his actions so as not to appear in the footage, framing David for the killer's crimes. The killer has also planted other evidence against David. In the final scene of the film, the hooded man, whose face is still unseen, returns to his headquarters, where he begins to map out similar attacks on a mini-mart, a farm house, and other ATMs.  
Atlas Shrugged: Part II
 [[Dagny Taggart]] pilots an airplane in pursuit of another plane. Dagny asks herself, "Who is [[John Galt]]?" before apparently crashing into a mountainside.  Nine months earlier, Dagny is trying to understand the abandoned prototype of an advanced motor she and her lover [[Hank Rearden]] have found. Scientists across the country have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances, but Dagny is able to locate Quentin Daniels, who agrees to help from an abandoned laboratory in [[Utah]].  Dagny's brother [[James Taggart (Atlas Shrugged)|James Taggart]], president of the family [[railroad]] company, meets store clerk Cherryl Brooks and brings her to see a renowned pianist, who disappears during his performance, leaving a note asking, "Who is John Galt?" Later, at James and Cherryl's wedding, Dagny's friend [[Francisco d'Anconia]] argues with other guests about whether money is evil, and secretly informs Rearden about devastating explosions at his [[Copper extraction|copper mine]]—the next day. Rearden spends the night with Dagny. Later, he is confronted about the affair by his wife Lillian, but when he offers a divorce she declines, in order to maintain her position in society.  Rearden sells his advanced Rearden Metal to Ken Danagger's [[coal mining]] company, but refuses to sell it to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], in defiance of the newly enacted "Fair Share" law that forces businesses to sell to all buyers. The two are charged under the law. Dagny barges into Danagger's office, realizes that he too is about to disappear, and understands that she is close to understanding the force behind the disappearances. At trial, Rearden defends [[Individualism|individual freedom]] and the pursuit of profit, and is given only a token penalty by the court, which fears turning him into a martyr. The government announces "Directive 10-289", which freezes employment and production and requires that all patents be gifted to the government. Rearden defies this decree as well, but relents when he is blackmailed with photos of himself and Dagny that would damage Dagny's reputation.  When Dagny hears about Rearden's "gift" and her brother's complicity, she quits the railroad. During her absence, a Taggart Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel, due largely to political pressure by a passenger and human error by Dagny's poorly trained replacement. This impels Dagny back to her job. D'Anconia tries to dissuade her from returning, as he had earlier tried to talk Rearden into leaving his business, but she returns anyway.  Dagny takes a train to [[Colorado]] to show her faith in the railway, but its engine fails. The repair technician used to work for 20th Century Motor Company, which produced the motor Dagny found. He tells Dagny how the [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|need-based]] reward system in his company failed, and his coworker John Galt left the company vowing to "stop the motor of the world." Dagny calls Daniels, who tells her that he is quitting. Dagny buys a small airplane and flies to [[Utah]] to try to dissuade him, but as she is landing, she sees him get into a plane on the airstrip.  After a pursuit in the air—the opening scene of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by [[stealth technology]]. A wounded Dagny Taggart crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt.

One day, a software error in one of the bank's ATMs in Chonburi causes it to malfunction, causing it to double the money it withdraws. Through two poor men, Pued (Thawat Pornrattanaprasert) and Paed (Chalermpol Tikumporntheerawong), word spreads quickly and the ATM draws a large crowd of ecstatic football spectators. [[Thai baht|฿]]130,000 is withdrawn before the machine is shut down.  Jib and Sua make a bet that whoever recovers the money withdrawn from the ATM can remain employed, while the other must resign. Both go to extreme lengths to win. Jib tries to recover the money from the ones that withdrawn thru reasoning, while Sua uses more unorthodox strategies.  Pued used his ATM withdrawal to buy a motorcycle, while Paed used it to buy a golden tooth as well as a truck. Sua soon teams up with them in his attempt to recover the withdrawn money, unaware that they are two of the people who received double cash from the faulty ATM.

When they find news of the atrocious medical expenses for Jack's recovery, Jib decides to pay for them. Pued and Gob reconcile also.

The Avengers (2012 film)
  The [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]]. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. [[Nick Fury]], director of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and his lieutenant Agent [[Maria Hill]] arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a [[wormhole]], allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a couple of other agents, including [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], to aid him in his getaway.  In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers Initiative]]". Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit [[Hulk (comics)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Coulson visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.  In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.  The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.  Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.  In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth. In a [[post-credits scene]], the Avengers eat in silence at a [[shawarma]] restaurant.

Yegor doesn't get along with Artyom and also wants time alone with Kseniya. Kseniya tells Zaur she will only agree if he sends Artyom back when she asks.   On 7 August 2008, Kseniya learns that South Ossetia has become a conflict zone. She calls Zaur and demands that Artyom be brought back to Russia. Zaur tries to convince Kseniya that Artyom is safe and happy because his parents enjoy Artyom's presence. Kseniya doesn't agree. She approaches Yegor at his bank but he doesn't want to become involved in her family situation. The conversation becomes heated and turns to Kseniya's and Yegor's intimate relationship. The conversation continues loudly as Kseniya departs in the lift and it leaves Yegor publicly humiliated.  Kseniya immediately flies to [[Vladikavkaz]], then takes a bus through the [[Roki tunnel]] into South Ossetia. An [[anti-tank missile]] is fired at her bus.

When Zaur evacuates his parents, he and they are killed by shelling from a Georgian tank. Artyom is injured and runs from the scene in deep shock. Kseniya calls Artyom on his mobile phone but he can only say ''Mrakovlast was here... Mrakovlast killed all...''. Kseniya decides to rescue Artyom herself. Meanwhile, Artyom is hallucinating due to his injury and sinks deeper into his fantasies.   Kseniya joins Zaur's friend Khasan Baroyev, known as "Ilya" on a Russian military and journalist convoy. Based on events involving a [[58th Army (Russia)|58th Russian Army]] staff convoy, Ilya is killed by a Georgian soldier when the convoy is ambushed. Kseniya is saved by Lyoha who is with a reconnaissance unit. Lyoha takes Kseniya to his base which is near where Artyom is hiding.   En route to the base Lyoha's vehicle is attacked by a Georgian tank which he evades. At the base, Lyoha must help many refugees sheltering there and so Kseniya goes on alone. Kseniya finds Artyom who is unable to walk. When Kseniya steals a Georgian army [[UAZ-469|Jeep]], she and Artyom are fired upon. All seems lost but then the Georgian army is attacked with a [[Sukhoi Su-25]] air strike giving Kseniya and Artyom the opportunity to escape.   Kseniya and Artyom are stopped by a Georgian soldier, Aleksandr Khoshabaev. He takes pity on them and drives them towards the Russian army position. Kseniya walks over a hilltop to approaching Russian tanks. The leading tank stops right in front of her and the commander asks her if she speaks Russian. He asks her to get out of his way. Kseniya and Artyom do so and continue walking. Artyom recovers in hospital and learns the fate of his father. He and Kseniya meet with Lyoha who has won the battle before they are returned to Russia by helicopter.

Ayalum Njanum Thammil
 Dr. Ravi Tharakan ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithviraj]]) is a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon working in a private hospital. The plot begins with a traumatised girl being brought to the hospital. Ravi decides to operate on the girl for free, against the wishes of her father. The girl dies during the surgery. Her father and a few local politicians accuse Dr. Tharakan for the death and protest in the hospital. Ravi is forced to flee through the backdoor, followed by the girl's relatives. He has an accident on the way and goes missing without any traces. The girl's death gains media attention and the police start a thorough search for Dr. Ravi. The hospital management clears its name by sacking Dr. Ravi but the chairman's private secretary Diya ([[Rima Kallingal]]) expresses dissatisfaction over the hospital's decision and starts a search on her own. She is very much attached to Ravi, who had once convinced her the importance of following ethics in the medical profession. She meets Dr. Vivek ([[Narain (actor)|Narain]]) who is a very close friend and a former classmate of Ravi.  At the private medical college where Ravi completed his medical degree, Ravi and Vivek were amongst the worst students. They were irresponsible in their studies as well and were not even able to distinguish between surgical instruments. Ravi had a campus romance, a junior Muslim student named Sainu ([[Samvrutha Sunil|Samvrutha]]). After completing the course, Ravi and Vivek were left with two options: either to pay the college 5 lakh or to do an internship in a village hospital. Vivek opts to pay. Ravi, who is not able to get the cash from his father Thomas Tharakan (Prem Prakash), chooses to work in the Redemption Hospital in [[Munnar]] which is run by  Dr. Samuel ([[Prathap Pothen]]) — an altruistic physician who, by his absolute devotion to his profession, lives a lonely life. On his way to Munnar, Ravi's car crashes with a police vehicle and Ravi is in turn harassed by S.I. Purushothaman ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]). Ravi lodges a complaint and gets the officer suspended.  Ravi initially finds the job at the hospital uninteresting, mainly due to the uncompromising Dr. Samuel, who is very strict. He hates the lonely stay in a "jail-like" staff-quarters. The only consolations for Ravi are the letters by Sainu and occasional phone calls to Vivek. Ravi is soon accompanied by Dr. Supriya ([[Remya Nambeesan]]), another junior doctor, who helps him to develop an interest in the job. But he still finds it difficult to adjust to Dr. Samuel. Some months later, Dr. Samuel informs Ravi about a phone call he received from Sainu's parents who are planning to marry Sainu to someone else. Samuel was also asked to forbid Ravi from meeting or calling her. Ravi seeks help from Vivek, who secretly makes all arrangements for Ravi's and Sainu's marriage in [[Kochi]]. But Ravi is stopped by S.I. Purushothaman on his way to Kochi, in the name of a routine check. The officer who was actually waiting to avenge his suspension does not leave Ravi even after hearing about the marriage. Ravi arrives late only to see a house-arrested Sainu, who has unwillingly agreed for another marriage.  This incident shakes Ravi completely. His lonely stay in Munnar also haunts him, but he is able to be sincere to his job. One day, a girl is brought to the hospital in a serious condition. Dr. Ravi, the only duty doctor, rushes to her but decides not to attend the case after knowing that she is S.I. Purushothaman's daughter. He rejects the requests of hospital staff and other inmates and not even the tears shed by Purushothaman at his feet are enough to melt his heart. The girl's condition becomes very serious but she is saved by Dr. Samuel who arrives some time later. An angry Dr. Samuel slaps Ravi for his negligence. Insulted, Ravi decides to leave the place immediately but is stopped by Dr. Supriya who supports the action of Dr. Samuel. The next day, Ravi is summoned by a committee for investigation of a complaint filed by S.I. Purushothaman. Ravi is silent throughout the interrogation and the committee decides to recommend that the Medical Council cancel his recognition. However, Dr. Samuel testifies for Ravi stating that Ravi is innocent and, since the girl is saved, there arises no case of medical negligence. This incident and Samuel's testifying turns out to be an eye-opener for Ravi. His attitude to the purpose of life changes completely which he is able to follow throughout his later life. He leaves Redemption Hospital after his internship and leaves for London to pursue his higher studies, and later works in hospitals and gains a name for being service-minded.  Having known more about Ravi from Vivek and Supriya, Diya comes to the conclusion that Ravi might have gone to meet Dr. Samuel. The police also tracks him at Munnar after tracing his phone calls. In a cemetery, Dr. Ravi is shown talking to Dr. Samuel about the girl's death. But it is later shown that Dr. Samuel is no more and it was the news of Samuel's death that brought Ravi to Munnar. Ravi is arrested by the police and is brought to the court. He is acquitted in the case after the dead girl's mother testify for Dr. Ravi stating that it was upon her behest that Dr. Ravi opted to operate the girl. In the final scene, Dr. Ravi is shown sitting in front of the Redemption Hospital, with a narration from himself playing simultaneously, "This is the place where Dr. Ravi Tharakan was born."

When Headmaster Nash gives an expulsion notice to low-income student Matt Clark, Matt convinces him to change it to an eight-hour detention on Saturday. Matt serves the detention with the awkward Tarek Ahmed, the jock Craig Cook, the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon, the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst, and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes.  For their detention, Dr. Day takes away their phones, restricts their internet reach, and gives them an assignment to write the school's history. He then locks the students alone in the school's new library, which has had some further remodeling by the janitor, Max, with his addition of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] portraits and an [[Apache]] statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. Veronica hides Megan’s inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having an asthma attack and dying.  With limited computer access to the school's databanks, Veronica begins work on their history project. They learn how land was stolen from an Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, which was then taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school.  The new library was built on neighboring land that belonged to recently deceased Apache elder Jacob Rainwater.  As the students argue on-and-off, they discover a vent that allows them to navigate to different rooms that are locked. They learn that Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they learn that Tricia’s mother is the [[Governor]], Craig’s father is a [[city councilman]], and Megan's father co-owns the (former Rainwater) property on which Tarek’s father's company built the library, all of whom made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for gifting the library.  A dark storm rages outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students’ fear that there is paranormal activity. Craig falls down the steps in the library and is staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Rainwater lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craig’s camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob Rainwater at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no [[next of kin]] to take over. Deeply believing in the paranormal, they attempt to contact Jacob’s spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and Tricia uses a [[nail gun]] to commit suicide due to fright.  Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone's paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological [[inkblots]] tests, all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek's dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected [[booby trap]] involving the statue severs Dr. Day's head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued, placed in a straitjacket and gagged.  Max the janitor arrives, revealing he is related to Jacob Rainwater.

The next day, Frank gives the flash drive to Officer Malark and tracks down Panther at his hideout. But he is knocked unconscious, captured, and then tortured for information about the location of the flash drive by being hooked up to an electrocution device. He is shocked multiple times, like he was in Vietnam, but Frank still refuses to surrender the flash drive. Panther takes Frank's wallet, learns Frank's address and believes Frank is hiding not only the flash drive but a loved one there as well, due to Frank's insistence that there is nothing to find. Panther leaves his men to continue torturing Frank, but Frank breaks free from his restraints and throws a lit matchbook (the one he got from Amber) at some oil drums stored in the room, setting the building on fire and causing explosions. Panther escapes but Frank gives chase. They both steal buses and duel, damaging many other vehicles during their chase, and ultimately demolish both buses. While chasing Panther again on foot, Frank comes across the two skinheads he beat up on the bus earlier. The skinheads try to undo their previous humiliation at Frank's hands by using their cell phone to record themselves beating up Frank, but Frank overpowers them again and resumes his chase. Panther arrives at Frank's house, finds Amber, and threatens to kill her for the flash drive, but Frank arrives in time to intervene. Their fight spills out into the front yard, and just as Panther is about to go after Frank again, Amber jumps on his back and slows him down enough for Frank to get up and beat Panther senseless.  Panther is arrested, as is Mayor Williams when his connection to Panther's scandal is revealed on the news. Frank, Amber and Martin all live happily ever after.

As Rory boards into the ocean to set a buoy, a shark appears and kills a man in the water. Alerted to the danger, Josh quickly takes a jet ski and goes to get Rory, but is too late. Rory is pulled into the water, and Josh is unable to save him before he is devoured.  A year later, Josh now works for a supermarket. While stocking shelves with Naomi (Alice Parkinson) he sees Tina with her new boyfriend Steven ([[Qi Yuwu]]), returned from Singapore. At the same time two teenagers, Kyle ([[Lincoln Lewis]]) and Heather ([[Cariba Heine]]) are parked for a make-out session, accompanied by Heather's dog, Bully. In the supermarket a young girl, Jaime ([[Phoebe Tonkin]]), is caught shoplifting, and temporarily evades the security guard by meeting up with her boyfriend Ryan ([[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]]), who also works at the store. The store manager, Jessup ([[Adrian Pang]]), catches up with her, fires Ryan, and calls the police. The arresting officer, Todd ([[Martin Sacks]]), arrives, and is revealed to be Jaime's dad. After this, Jessup is held at gun point by a robber, Doyle ([[Julian McMahon]]). The tense situation eventually escalates, and Doyle's partner appears and shoots assistant manager Julie (Rhiannon Dannielle Pettett).  At the height of the commotion, a tsunami wave descends on the city and floods the supermarket. Doyle's partner is killed by the flood, and the survivors injured. As the survivors try to find a way out the security guard is dragged under water. It becomes apparent that a [[great white shark]] has been washed into the store by the tsunami. Additionally, a broken wire threatens to electrocute them all. Steven volunteers to shut off the power, and the others dress him in crude armor made of shopping carts and shelves to protect him from the shark. He succeeds but loses his oxygen tube and drowns. Despite their previous conflicts, the survivors work together to get Jessup into a ventilation shaft to go for help. A flood of crabs slides out of the vent, startling Jessup and causing him to fall back, however, he manages to grab hold of the vent. Unfortunately, the shark jumps out of the water and eats Jessup.  In the parking garage, Kyle, Heather, and Ryan have been cut off from the others. Ryan helps the couple escape from their drowned car, but a second great white shark is revealed. Kyle ditches the dog, Bully at the last second and they manage to get to temporary safety. After several unsuccessful attempts at luring the shark away, Ryan decides to join them on top of his flipped van, but the shark gives chase. Ryan successfully gets onto the flipped van but Kyle falls and is devoured.  Inside the supermarket, the remaining group make a plan to catch their shark so they can swim to safety. Jaime manages to swim to the butcher section and grab a hook with meat to use as bait. The shark does not go for the bait, so fellow survivor, Kirby ([[Dan Wyllie]]) grabs a hook and puts it through Naomi's shirt, using her as bait. Kirby is revealed to be Doyle's partner, who changed out of his clothes and mask so the others wouldn't know he was the murderer. Doyle stabs Kirby with a makeshift harpoon, and throws him into the water with the hook. Naomi is pulled from the water as the shark devours Kirby, catching its jaw on the hook and ensnaring itself in the trap. Josh apologizes to Tina, feeling guilt over her brother's death, but Tina reassures him and kisses him.  Below, Bully is found alive. Heather's newfound hope inspires Ryan to start banging on the pipes, calling for help. Jaime hears Ryan' call and with Josh goes to rescue him. Below, they are alerted to the second shark's presence. Josh and Jaime find her dad's car, in which are a shotgun and taser. Josh kills the shark with the shotgun, and the four of them get back into the supermarket. A tremor strikes as they are all swimming to the entrance, breaking the first shark loose. Josh kills the shark with the taser as Doyle wires a truck jammed in the entrance to explode, breaking a hole in the debris and freeing them. The survivors leave the supermarket, reaching the severely damaged city, and Tina asks Josh what to do now. At sea, a seagull swoops low over the water, and a shark jumps out and devours it.

The Barrens (film)
 Two young campers walk together through the woods, commenting that there are no animals or birds around. They discover a pile of mutilated deer carcasses left on the trail. They are chased by a mutilated deer that drops dead in front of them. Something sounding like a large swarm of birds is heard approaching.  Richard Vineyard, his wife Cynthia, his daughter Sadie, and his young son Danny leave their suburban home for a camping trip. They want to leave civilization behind and bond as a family in [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|the Barrens]], a forest in southern [[New Jersey]]. On the way to the campsite, they see a mutilated deer crossing the road. They stay in a crowded commercial campsite full of obnoxious campers who are not inclined to abandon civilization: cell phones and loud music abound. While setting up his tent, Richard has a flashback to a traumatic event from his childhood that occurred in the Barrens. Later that evening, when a fellow camper tells a story of the [[Jersey Devil]], the campers pull a prank that scares the Vineyard family. Richard overreacts, much to the embarrassment of the rest of the family.  That night, Richard has a nightmare in which he is being chased through a field by something unseen. He is awakened by Cynthia in the middle of the forest, having actually run from their tent while asleep. He accuses his wife of infidelity; she doesn't understand his suspicion and tries to reassure him. Richard apologizes. Cynthia returns to the tent and Richard goes for a walk. He sees a deer carcass fall from a tree.  Several facts are revealed in conversation the next day. Richard is taking pain medication for a wound received before they left home. Cynthia is his second wife after the loss of Sadie's mother a decade prior. One of the campers involved in the prank the previous night is missing. Richard, who appears weakened by illness, leads his family deeper into the forest away from the trails to a new camp site.  While resting, Danny finds the disemboweled corpse of the missing camper but says nothing. Richard begins hallucinating and becomes irritable. They find a campsite containing a decomposed dog, a shredded tent, and furs hanging to dry, but no people. They decide to set up camp there.

Barbara (2012 film)
 [[East Germany]] in 1980: Barbara ([[Nina Hoss]]) is a physician who arrives for her first day at a small rural hospital near the [[Baltic Sea]].  She had been at the prestigious [[Charité]] hospital in [[East Berlin]] but, after she'd filed an "Ausreiseantrag" – an official request to leave East Germany – she had been incarcerated and transferred to the small town where she is still monitored by the [[Stasi]].  She is punished - for the hours in which they cannot find her - by searching her house, strip-searching and cavity-searching her.  In her new job, she works in [[pediatric surgery]], a department led by [[chief physician]] André Reiser. Reiser eventually tells her a story (whose veracity she questions) of how he too had lost his job at a more prestigious hospital in Berlin – he was responsible for an accident with an incubator that left two premature infants blind. The Stasi had agreed to keep it quiet if he agreed to relocate to the provincial hospital and to work for them. So now Reiser reports on suspected people including Barbara.  Early on, when the police deliver Stella, a young runaway from a labour camp, to the hospital for the fourth time, Reiser thinks Stella is [[malingering]]. Barbara intervenes and orders removal of the restraints on the patient, readily diagnosing her with  [[meningitis]]. During her recovery, Stella develops a strong attachment to Barbara, whose welcome bedside manner includes reading the ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' to her. Stella is pregnant and wants to raise the child. Wanting to escape from the country and to have her child in a new land, she implores Barbara to take her with her.  However, they cannot find grounds for keeping Stella longer and soon she is returned against her will to the labour camp.  Meanwhile, Barbara makes secretive bicycle treks, to a place to stash her secretly received funds for escape, and to the woods where she meets with her West German lover Jörg, who has been supplying her with prized goods and is preparing for her escape. When she meets him for a second rendezvous in an "Interhotel" (an East-German hotel for foreigners), he tells her of his finalised plan for her escape the following weekend: she will be picked up in a small boat in the Baltic Sea and taken the short distance to Denmark.   As the two doctors spend more and more time together, Reiser begins making romantic overtures, which she rebuffs even while she is impressed by Reiser in turn. He has built a laboratory, to test samples on-site, and he has created his own serums with which to treat patients.  One day before her planned escape, Barbara is on duty caring for a critically ill patient named Mario, whose suicide attempt had landed him in the hospital. Barbara discovers that Mario has not been recovering from his traumatic head injury as well as believed and requires immediate brain surgery. She tracks Reiser down on his day off, to inform him of Mario's urgent need of surgery. She finds him at the home of the Stasi agent who has been overseeing her monitoring. Reiser is treating the agent's wife, who is dying of cancer. Reiser persuades her to return to the hospital – the same night of her planned escape – to perform the surgery, with her assistance as anaesthesiologist during the operation.  Following her agreement to be there, yet still planning her escape, Barbara accepts Reiser's invitation to let him cook a lunch for her at his home on the same day. When Reiser finally tells Barbara that he is happy to have her there with him, she kisses him. Then she abruptly pulls away from him, and returns to her house to continue preparations for the escape.  During this time, Stella flees the labour youth detention programme again and stumbles onto Barbara's doorstep the very night of Barbara's intended escape by sea.  Barbara takes her to the agreed-upon area on the beach, where she is to meet a person who will help smuggle her out. Barbara writes a note to accompany Stella that is presumably addressed to Jörg, explaining why she has chosen to let Stella escape, instead of herself. After helping Stella to a waiting raft, and a skin diver who will help her escape by sea, she returns to the hospital. She takes a seat, across from André who is watching over Mario, at his bedside. The implication of this last scene is that she has decided to stay in the East, to be with Reiser. In a final close-up, their eyes meet in mutual understanding.  
Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2
 A year after the events of the [[Barbie in A Mermaid Tale|previous film]], Merliah Summers is competing in the heats of an invitational surf-meet. Merliah wins first place, narrowly beating her rival, Kylie Morgan, though both ladies get to compete in the finals in Australia.  Merliah uses her magical necklace to transform into a mermaid and tell her mother, Queen Calissa, the good news. Calissa is preparing for the Changing of the Tides Ceremony to be held at the city of Aquellia, which is performed every twenty years to gift the ability to make Merliah a member of the royal family. Calissa expects Merliah to attend, but the surfing competition is on the exact same day. They both argue after which they part ways.  The next round of heats take place in Australia, and Kylie beats Merliah when she deliberately brushes Merliah's surfboard and causes her to wipe out. Despite Kylie's win, Merliah's handstand maneuver attracts the attention of reporters, and she's approached by Georgie Majors who asks Merliah to be a spokesperson for Wave Crest surfgear.  That night at a luau, Merliah has a photoshoot with Georgie. Kylie is approached by a fish named Alistair who tells her that Merliah has powers that give her an advantage with surfing. Alistair convinces Kylie to steal Merliah's necklace, which Merliah has taken off because of the photoshoot. Kylie gets the necklace, and following Alistair's instructions, puts it on and turns into a mermaid. Alistair then lures Kylie underwater to the deep trench where Eris is still trapped in a whirlpool. Snouts, the sea lion, who witnessed Kylie's transformation, secretly follows them. Alistair and Eris trick Kylie into entering the whirlpool, taking Eris' place and freeing her.  Snouts returns to the surface to Merliah, who has been searching for her necklace. Even without her necklace, Merliah can still breathe underwater, so she follows Snouts to the trench and frees Kylie from the whirlpool. Kylie is grateful to Merliah and apologizes for stealing her necklace, but when she takes it off to return it, her mermaid tail turns back into legs and Kylie loses the ability to breathe underwater. Merliah quickly hands the necklace back to Kylie to prevent her from drowning. Kylie then promises Merliah to help her stop Eris.  Eris and Alistair travel to Aquellia so that Eris can perform the Changing of Tides ceremony herself. Along the way they meet Stargazers, a group of large, powerful fish. Eris threatens them with her new spell to bring people's worst fears to life, and they agree to follow and obey her. They reach Aquellia while Calissa and the ambassadors of the ocean: Mirabella, Kattrin, Selena, and Renata, are waiting for the midday sun for the ceremony to begin. A fight ensues, and Eris manages to cast her spell on Calissa, whose tail becomes heavy and drags her down to the bottom of the ocean. Eris also casts the spell on all the ambassadors and puts them in a trap.  Merliah, Kylie and Snouts meet up with Zuma and Calissa, and Calissa and Merliah apologize to each other. As Calissa is unable to move because of the spell, Merliah decides to perform the ceremony in her place, accepting that in doing so she will have a tail permanently. Merliah, Kylie, Zuma and Snouts go to Aquellia, where they manage to get past the Stargazers and free the ambassadors. Merliah manages to get on the throne at the right time, but because she has legs, it doesn't work. Kylie passes the necklace to Merliah in time, and the ceremony is completed, undoing all of Eris's spells and giving Merliah a new tail. Eris' spell also bounces back to herself, giving her legs.  Merliah, Calissa and Kylie swim to the surface in time for the surf meet finals. Calissa gives Kylie the magical necklace since she has proven herself in keeping it after helping them. Although Merliah has accepted her duty, she wishes that she could be human again and her legs magically return by themselves. Calissa explains that the ceremony turns whoever does it into their true self, and Merliah's true self is both mermaid and human.  Kylie and Merliah join the competition together, but when they surf, Merliah is distracted by her newfound ability to create Merillia when she touches the water. Kylie wins the competition and is offered to become a Wave Crest spokesperson by Georgie. Kylie brings Merliah up on stage, and they hold the trophy together.

Battleship (film)
  In 2005, the distant [[Gliese 581|Gliese planetary system]] is discovered to have a potentially [[Habitable zone|habitable planet]] and a communications array is built by [[NASA]] in [[Hawaii]] to send a transmission to contact any intelligent life. Meanwhile, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane. His brother, naval officer Stone, forces Alex to join the [[U.S. Navy]] in order to improve his life.  In 2012, Alex and Sam are in a relationship and Alex serves as a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] aboard  while Stone commands , but Alex is in danger of receiving a disciplinary [[military discharge|discharge]]. During the [[Exercise RIMPAC#RIMPAC 2012|2012 RIMPAC exercise]], five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship collides with a satellite and crashes in [[Hong Kong]] while the other four land in the waters off Hawaii. ''Sampson'', ''John Paul Jones'', and their Japanese sister ship [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JDS]]  are ordered by Admiral Terrance Shane to investigate, and they subsequently discover a floating structure. When it is touched by Alex it generates a [[force shield|force field]] that encloses the Hawaiian Islands and separates the three ships from the fleet. Three alien warships surface and commence to engage both the ''Sampson'' and ''Myōkō'' which are destroyed, resulting in Stone's death, while the command crew of ''John Paul Jones'' are killed. With Alex assuming command as the ranking officer, they recover the survivors from ''Myōkō'' including its commanding officer, Captain Yugi Nagata. The aliens also launch drones to attack Hawaii which cause heavy damage.  On Oahu, Sam is accompanying retired [[U.S. Army]] Colonel and double amputee Mick Canales on a mountain hike. After becoming aware of the aliens' presence, they encounter scientist Cal Zapata who informs them the aliens have taken over the communications array, and Mick determines that they are planning to use it to re-establish military communications with their home planet. Aboard ''John Paul Jones'', naval personnel capture a semi-conscious alien. The alien forms a telepathic link with Alex, showing him their history of destroying worlds. Other aliens arrive and retrieve their comrade, but are prevented from sabotaging the ship. Examination of the captured alien's helmet reveals the aliens are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Nick and Zapata recover his [[spectrum analyzer]] from the aliens and they use it to radio ''John Paul Jones'' to inform them the aliens intend military telecommunication with their own home planet in four hours.  Captain Nagata suggests to surreptitiously use [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning buoys]] around Hawaii to track the alien warships. This allows ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy two of them. At dawn, they lure the remaining warship eastwards as Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows, blinding its crew and allowing ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy the alien ship. However, ''John Paul Jones'' is simultaneously sunk by alien drones.   The survivors return to Pearl Harbor and commandeer the previously decommissioned WWII [[battleship]]  with the aid of the retired veterans preserving her, restoring her to battle readiness and confronting the alien structure, revealed to be a giant mothership. The ''Missouri'' severely damages the mothership and disables the force field, and Admiral Shane scrambles a flight of [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18]] fighter jets from aircraft carrier [[USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)|USS ''Ronald Reagan'']]. Meanwhile, Sam, Mick and Cal attempt to stall the aliens at the communications array. As the mothership rallies against the ''Missouri'', Alex uses their last shell to destroy the communications array. All hope is lost for the ''Missouri'' and those onboard until the fighter jets arrive in time and destroy the mothership, saving the ''Missouri'' and eliminating the alien threat.   A ceremony is held to honor the military personnel, where Alex is promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] and presented with both a [[Silver Star]] and his brother's posthumous [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. After the ceremony, Alex asks Sam's father Admiral Shane for her hand in marriage. The admiral initially refuses, but then invites Alex to lunch to discuss the matter. In a [[post-credits scene]], three teenagers and a [[handyman]] in [[Scotland]] discover a crashed alien pod. When they open it, an alien hand reaches out, and they run off in terror.  
Batman: Death Wish
 [[Batman]], [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and [[Nightwing]] investigate a string of incidents where a mysterious assailant has been taking down numerous crime organizations all over [[Gotham City]]. In their findings, they discover that while the thugs were taken down and no cash was stolen in the crime scenes, [[Riddler|the Riddler]] and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|the Scarecrow]] have been lethally drugged with a botanical neurotoxin found only in the Far East. Moreover, blood splatters in the crime scenes indicate that the assailant was reckless, not caring about sustaining gunshot wounds during the fights while drugging the villains. Batman concludes that the assailant is [[Batgirl]], who is being manipulated by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]; the gunshot wounds she sustained were her failed attempts at breaking the spell. Batman and Robin confront Poison Ivy, who attempts to kill Batman with a lethal dose of the neurotoxin. An injured Batgirl, however, briefly breaks Poison Ivy's spell on her to block the shot as the villainess makes her escape and Nightwing rushes to the scene with the antidote.  
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (film)
 ===Part 1===  After the death of his protégé [[Jason Todd]], billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne was forced to retire from his [[Batman (Dark Knight Universe)|Batman]] persona. Ten years later, [[Gotham City]] is overrun with crime and terrorized by a gang known as the Mutants. The 55-year-old Wayne maintains a friendship with 70-year-old retiring Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] (who knows Wayne was Batman), while the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (Batman's [[archenemy]]) has been [[Catatonia|catatonic]] in [[Arkham Asylum]] since Wayne's retirement. Arkham inmate and former district attorney [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] undergoes plastic surgery to repair his disfigured face. Although he is declared sane, he quickly goes into hiding following his release. Dent's disappearance, news stories of the crime epidemic throughout the city and the memory of his parents' deaths drive Wayne to become Batman once more. He combats serious crimes, rescuing 13-year-old [[Carrie Kelley]], but now struggles with the physical limitations of age.  Public reaction to his return is divided. Dent's psychologist Bartholomew Wolper blames Batman for creating his own [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]]. Dent resurfaces, threatening to blow up a building unless he is paid a ransom. Batman defeats Dent's henchmen, learning that the bombs will explode even if the ransom is paid; he realizes that Dent intends to kill himself. Batman disables one bomb, and the other detonates harmlessly. He defeats Dent, who reveals that he thinks the reconstructive surgery was botched, as he considered his undamaged half as disfigured. Kelley dresses as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and looks for Batman, who attacks a gathering of the Mutants with a tank-like [[Batmobile]] (incapacitating most of them). The Mutant leader challenges Batman to a duel. He accepts to prove to himself that he can win. The Mutant leader (who is in his prime) nearly kills Batman, but Kelley distracts him long enough for Batman to subdue him. The leader and many gang members are arrested. Injured, Batman returns to the [[Batcave]] with Kelley, and allows her to become his protégée in spite of protests from his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]].  Batman has Kelley disguise herself as a Mutant, and she lures the gang to a sewer outlet at the West River. At the [[Gotham City Police Department]], the Mutant leader murders the mayor during negotiations. Commissioner Gordon deliberately releases the leader, providing an escape from the building, which leads to the sewer outlet. Before the amassed Mutants, Batman fights the leader in a mud pit; the mud slows the leader, removing his physical advantage, and Batman overpowers him. Seeing their leader's defeat, the Mutants divide into smaller gangs; one becomes the "Sons of Batman", a violent vigilante group. Batman's victory becomes public and the city's inhabitants are inspired to stand up against crime. Gordon retires after meeting his anti-Batman successor, Ellen Yindel. In Arkham, televised reports about Batman bring the Joker out of his catatonic state.  ===Part 2===  Feigning remorse for his past, Joker convinces Wolper to take him on a talk show to tell his story, and makes plans for his escape with an old henchman, who supplies him with mind-controlling lipstick. Meanwhile, [[Superman]], who works as a government operative in exchange for being allowed to covertly help people, is asked by President [[Ronald Reagan]] to end Batman's vigilante activities. Framing these events is a growing hostility between the USA and the [[Soviet Union]] over possession of the island of [[Corto Maltese (DC Comics)|Corto Maltese]]. As Batman's continued presence humiliates the national authorities, Yindel becomes commissioner and orders Batman's arrest, and Superman warns Batman that the government will not tolerate him much longer.  Joker makes his talk show appearance on David Endochrine's show as Batman fights with the GCPD on the studio roof; while they fight, Joker kills Wolper, gasses everyone in the studio to death and escapes. He finds [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] and uses one of her escorts and his lipstick to take control of a congressional representative, who calls for a nuclear strike on the Soviets before falling to his death. Batman's investigation leads him to Selina, whom he finds bound and dressed like [[Wonder Woman]]. Kelley notices cotton candy on the floor, and Batman deduces that Joker is at the fairgrounds. There Kelley accidentally kills Joker's henchman while Batman pursues the Joker, who indiscriminately guns down dozens of people. As Batman corners a wounded and partially blinded Joker, he admits to feeling responsible for every murder Joker has committed and intends to stop him permanently. In the ensuing fight, Joker stabs Batman repeatedly, and Batman breaks Joker's neck in front of witnesses.  Content that he made Batman lose control and that he will be branded a murderer, the Joker finishes twisting his neck, killing himself. The GCPD arrive and Batman, bleeding profusely, fights his way to Kelley and escapes. After Superman deflects a Soviet nuclear missile, he is hit with the blast and badly injured; the detonation creates an [[Electromagnetic Pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] that wipes out all electrical equipment in the United States and causes a [[nuclear winter]]. As the city descends into chaos, Batman, Kelley and Gordon rally the Sons of Batman and the citizens of Gotham to restore order, and Yindel accepts that Batman has become too powerful to take down. While the rest of the powerless U.S. is overrun with crime, Gotham becomes the safest city in America, embarrassing the President's administration and prompting them to send Superman and troop to finally stop Batman. Batman and Superman agree to meet in [[Crime Alley]].  Superman can't help but feel remorse for disregarding Batman throughout the years, and humbly asks him to not go through the fight. Wearing a powerful [[Powered exoskeleton|exoframe]] and supported by Kelley and former superhero Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]]), Batman fights Superman, using various tactics to make the fight even. When Superman gains the advantage, Queen hits him with an [[Trick arrows#Green Arrow's trick arrows|arrow]] made with synthetic [[Kryptonite]], severely weakening him. Batman defeats Superman, and claims that he intentionally made the Kryptonite weak, and tells Superman to never forget that Batman defeated him, and could have killed him had he wanted. Superman then notices Batman's heartbeat is irregular and rapid with his x-ray vision, and tries to warn him. Batman ignores Superman and continues beating him, all the while listing off his reasons for being angry at him. However, Batman apparently dies of a heart attack, while [[Wayne Manor]] self-destructs, and Alfred dies of a stroke. Superman holds Batman's body, orders the soldiers to stand down.   In the aftermath, the world learns that Bruce was Batman; all of his secrets are destroyed with the manor and his finances disappear. As Superman leaves Wayne's funeral, he gives Kelley a knowing wink after hearing a faint heartbeat coming from Bruce's coffin. In underground caves, Bruce is revealed to have survived his heart attack and faked his death to make preparations to continue his mission more discreetly, allied with Kelley, Queen, and his followers.

The Battery (2012 film)
 After a zombie apocalypse has overtaken the entire New England area, two former baseball players, Ben (Jeremy Gardner) and Mickey (Adam Cronheim), travel the back-roads of Connecticut with no destination in mind. Their backstory reveals that they were trapped in a house in Massachusetts, along with Mickey's family, for three months. Mickey's father, mother and brother were killed before they figured out how to escape. Since then, Ben opposes sleeping indoors and the two have had many arguments regarding the matter. Ben has long adapted to their new lifestyle, which includes scavenging for supplies and constantly being on the move. Mickey, on the other hand, longs for a "normal" life. He refuses to learn basic survival skills, and constantly isolates himself by listening to his CD player with headphones on, burning through batteries.  At Mickey's girlfriend's now-abandoned house, Ben finds two walkie-talkies. As they test the walkie-talkies' range, they overhear a conversation between two survivors, Annie and "The Orchard", implying they belong to an organized group of survivors. Mickey eagerly contacts them and asks to join, only to be flatly refused. Despite Ben's advice, Mickey tries contacting them again several times, but no one replies.  The duo travel further and explore a house inside a forest, where Mickey proposes sleeping inside. Ben relents, presumably to ease his friend's frustration, but keeps Mickey's CD player for the night. That evening, Ben drinks, listens to music and dances, while Mickey speaks on the walkie talkie. Annie replies, this time firmly tells him to stay off the channel and stop contacting her group.  The following morning, Ben discovers a zombie tied up near the house and releases it in Mickey's room. He keeps the door shut while urging Mickey to kill it with the baseball bat he left in the room earlier. After the sound of the struggle stops, Ben opens the door, discovering his friend has successfully scored his first zombie kill. Mickey angrily attacks Ben and storms outside. As Ben tries to cheer him up, Mickey breaks down in tears, telling Ben of his conversation with Annie.  Killing his first zombie and getting turned down by a community seem to have changed Mickey. He starts heeding Ben's advice, learns to fish and spends much less time with his headphones on. As the two stop by the road to inspect a car, a man takes Mickey hostage with a knife, and orders Ben to give him their car keys. Ben tricks the man into letting Mickey go, then shoots and kills him. Immediately after, two other survivors arrive. The woman explains that the man stole the car from them, and says Ben did the right thing. Her companion Egghead refuels the abandoned car and they prepare to leave. Mickey, recognizing Annie's voice from the walkie talkie, calls her by name. Annie, not wanting them to follow her to her group, shoots Ben in the leg and throws their car keys into a large grassy area, then leaves with Egghead. As it is too dark to find the keys, Ben and Mickey decide to sleep in the car.  Their car soon becomes surrounded by zombies. As Ben cannot move fast due to his wound, the two are forced to spend an undetermined number of days inside the car. They finally decide that Mickey should get out via the sunroof and try to find the car keys. When he returns, Ben finds out that he was bitten and is forced to shoot him. The movie ends with Ben talking to the walkie-talkie, claiming he will come and kill Annie to avenge Mickey's death. The mid-credit shows Ben has escaped the car and is walking down the road, with a horde of zombies shambling behind him.<ref name=fangoria></ref>

After one of their assaults, they are approached by Celeste, a witness to the incident, who offers them $25,000 to rescue her godson Rob and kill his godfather and captor,<ref name=NOLA></ref> the drug lord Carlos. The trio accept. Meanwhile, ATF agent Anthony Reese approaches Millard about the spree of criminal deaths and his suspects; the Oodie brothers. Millard is intentionally obstructive to Reese's request for aid.  The Oodie's travel to Carlos' home and assault the building, killing Carlos's men but failing to kill Carlos. They recover Rob; a young mentally disabled man in a wheelchair. Carlos sends a group of female biker assassins after them. The bikers find the brothers resting at a bar. The bikers seduce the unaware brothers, separating them from each other, but when Lincoln notices one of them wheeling Rob away, the women attack them. The brothers manage to kill the women and recover Rob, but the massacre ends up on the news with sketches of the three brothers provided by the bar owner, giving Reese the evidence he needs that the Oodie's are killers. Brick calls Celeste to find out why the simple job now involves assassins; Celeste confesses that Rob was from a wealthy family that were killed by Carlos so that he, as Rob's legal guardian, could obtain a large trust fund that Rob is to inherit on his impending 18th birthday. Brick makes a further call to Millard who tells them that because of Reese's evidence, he has to disavow them and will arrest them if they return to Alabama.  Though he cannot speak to them, the brothers bond with Rob. McQueen suggests they quit the job, but Brick tells McQueen that they once had a brother like Rob that was regularly beaten by their father until one day he woke up and the brother was gone; the resemblance makes Brick reluctant to let Carlos retake Rob. Another group of assassins in an armored vehicle attack the brothers on the road and snatch Rob from the moving car. The brothers give chase and Lincoln leaps onto the vehicle, singlehandedly slaughtering everyone inside, but he is badly injured and the brothers' car is broken. While walking down the road, the group are picked up by a passing van; one of the passengers is a nurse and tends to Lincoln's wounds but he remains weakened. The group is dropped off in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] where they wait for Celeste and prepare for further attacks.  Reese discovers a photo of Millard recovering the brothers as children after their father's death, and large cash withdrawals he suspects were used to pay the brothers. He confronts Millard with the evidence and forces him to give up the brothers location for a lesser jail sentence; Millard goes with Reese. A Native American gang arrives and attacks, leaving Brick and McQueen to defend Rob and Lincoln. Celeste later arrives and joins the brothers. They manage to kill most of the gang and Lincoln recovers enough to stop one of them from taking Rob, but Celeste and Brick are downed and the remaining gang member attempts to scalp McQueen; he is shot by Millard. Millard and the brothers are arrested; the brothers provide a false story that does not involve Celeste, allowing her to take care of Rob. Reese's success is rewarded with a transfer to manage the territory; much to his chagrin. Carlos is killed by an explosive package sent by Celeste. 57 months later, the brothers are freed from jail.  They receive a letter from Celeste, enclosing their promised $25,000 payment, with a new truck waiting for them courtesy of Rob.  Celeste ends the letter by saying that others could use their help.

During a battle against a robotic tank, Ben as Upgrade and Gwen argue about the best way to defeat it, leading to Gwen using her extraordinarily strong [[Pink (color)|pink]]-colored [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to cast a dismantling spell on the tank while Ben is attached to it. Unknown to the children, this leads to a malfunction in the Omnitrix.  Later, after a mishap in school where the Omnitrix accidentally teleports his homework away, Ben is grounded by his parents and forced to stay home and do a history report. Ben attempts to work on the report before the Omnitrix teleports his laptop away as well. Shortly afterwards, Tetrax Shard arrives and tells Ben that Azmuth has asked to meet with him. They go to meet Azmuth but are attacked by an evil version of Waybig. Tetrax and Ben fight the alien, who is teleported into the Omnitrix, though neither of them is aware of it. Tetrax decides to take Ben to search for Azmuth and activates a new function on the Omnitrix. Before he can explain this new ability, the ship is attacked and Ben is sucked out into the [[atmosphere]], falling to the ground as Diamondhead. It is later revealed that the new ability prevents Ben from returning to human form when he times out, simply switching alien forms. Ben as Fourarms arrives at [[Stonehenge]] and is attacked by a weaponizing Galvanic Mechamorph, the same species as Upgrade, who demands to know about the alien that attacked Ben. Ben tries to explain he knows nothing, but the Mechamorph only continues to attack and the Mechamorph's teleporting ability causes the pair to carry their battle across the globe, destroying part of Stonehenge and nearly damaging [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and fighting at the [[Great Pyramids]] in [[Egypt]] before arriving back in Bellwood. Ben transforms into Grey Matter and manages to escape the Mechamorph.  Meanwhile, Gwen and Grandpa Max receive a call from Ben's parents Carl and Sandra informing them that Ben has escaped the house. They go in search of him, only to find Tetrax and discover Azmuth's ship. Looking at the ship's log, they discover that Azmuth disguised it as a semi truck to track down and fix the malfunctioning Omnitrix, but crashed and was destroyed by the evil Waybig. After escaping the Mechamorph, they soon encounter Ben back at his house and Tetrax restores Ben's Omnitrix to normal just as the Mechamorph catches up to them. Gwen sees how the Omnitrix reacts after Ben returns to human form and deduces what has happened just as she, Ben, Tetrax and the Mechamorph are transported into the Omnitrix itself.  Inside, Ben and the Mechamorph continue to battle before being attacked by a swarm of Stinkflies just as Gwen and Tetrax are ambushed by a herd of Wildmutt. The four catch up with each other and they realize that the evil Waybig is inside with them just as he resurfaces. The Mechamorph, who is revealed to be Azmuth's father, attacks the Waybig in revenge for killing his son while Gwen explains to Ben about the malfunction that she caused to the Omnitrix when she cast the dismantling spell on the robotic tank while Ben was attached to it. She uses Azmuth's father to reverse the transportation and return them to [[Earth]]. Unfortunately, the Omnitrix malfunctions again and transforms Ben's parents into Wildmutt and Heatblast, causing Gwen to realize that the evil Waybig is Azmuth himself. Leaving Grandpa Max and Tetrax to handle his parents, Ben and Gwen follow Azmuth's father and Azmuth to the city park where Ben transforms into Waybig to subdue Azmuth and hold off his father while he and Gwen try to reverse the transformation. Between the two Waybigs, they do a few hundred million dollars in property damage from smashing huge building after huge building (there are most likely no one in the buildings as the battle takes place in the morning before people arrive to work in them, which may be why they are not concerned about huge loss of life). They soon convince Azmuth's father that his son is the very alien that they are fighting and the three work together to convince Azmuth to regain control of himself, use his father's Mechamorph abilities to fix the Omnitrix and return Azmuth to normal. Azmuth reprimands Ben and Gwen for their errors and reveals his father is a Galvan wielding Mechamorph-type enhanced armor. Azmuth reveals that the Omnitrix was so filled with pink [[Vitalism|mana]]; Gwen asks what he means, to which he simply says that she will know eventually.  Returning to Ben's house, Azmuth restores Ben's parents to normal and repairs the Rust bucket, previously destroyed in the battle, before leaving to reconcile with his own father. Ben's parents, having forgotten that they grounded Ben, tell him to enjoy his fishing trip with Grandpa Max and Gwen. Ben declines, having learned to be more responsible, and stays home to finish his history report for school. The movie ends with Ben, Gwen, and Grandpa Max on another road trip where they encounter Doctor Animo and the three prepare for another exciting battle.  
Being Flynn
 Nick Flynn (Dano) is an aspiring writer who works at a homeless shelter where his estranged father Jonathan (De Niro) is a client. Jonathan, an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] ex-con and self-proclaimed "master storyteller", left Nick's mother Jody (Moore) years earlier to raise Nick on her own. She eventually committed suicide, for which Nick feels responsible. Jonathan gets into fights with the other clients, and Nick is tempted to throw him out. Nick and Jonathan get into an intense argument, during which Jonathan tells Nick that they are the same. The stress of seeing his father again drives Nick to drink heavily and abuse drugs, costing him his relationship with his girlfriend and coworker, Denise ([[Olivia Thirlby]]).   Jonathan eventually gets kicked out of the shelter, with Nick voting with the staff for his removal. Nick tries to numb the guilt by smoking [[crack cocaine|crack]], but the drug only intensifies his pain, and he realizes that he has a problem. He enters a rehabilitation program, and makes amends with Denise. One night, he finds Jonathan sleeping on the street and invites him to stay with him. When they part ways the next day, Jonathan tells Nick that he is not responsible for his mother's suicide, and that they are not the same after all.   Nick becomes a teacher, starts a family, and publishes a book of his poetry, while Jonathan qualifies for [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8 housing]] thanks to Nick's recommendation. Jonathan shows his appreciation by letting Nick read his "masterpiece", ''Memoirs of a Moron'', which Jonathan finds to be initially promising, but ultimately falling short - much like Jonathan himself. He invites Jonathan to his poetry reading, where he introduces his father to his wife and infant daughter. After some hesitation, he allows Jonathan to hold his daughter.

The film documents the cultural ripple effects of his life and death.

Benvenuti al Nord
 While Alberto is back in his beloved northern [[Italy]] in [[Milan]], his friend Mattia is still in [[Naples]] with his friends. He has problems with his wife Maria, because she wants him to take his postal job seriously, now that the two have a son to look after. Then after a dispute, Mattia decides to transfer to northern Italy, in the town of [[Pordenone]]. Mattia appears to be willing to leave his little town, but as soon as the transfer comes through, he begins to despair. Many locals offer their opinions; his wise old mother tells him that the people in northern Italy are terribly cold and cruel. Mattia is slightly reassured and in the blink of an eye is in Milan, a whole new world for him as a citizen of the South. Alberto welcomes him very coldly because he is in big trouble. The director of Milan's largest postal company intends to provide Italy with a whole new economic plan from [[Japan]] to modify the [[postal service]]. Mattia starts working in the post office where Alberto is the deputy director, but he soon realizes how different the local mentality is: people are not like that back home.

Berberian Sound Studio
 British [[sound engineer]] Gilderoy (Toby Jones) arrives at the Berberian film studio in Italy to work on what he believes is a film about horses. During a surreal meeting with Francesco, the film's producer, Gilderoy is shocked to find the film is actually an Italian [[giallo]] film, ''The Equestrian Vortex''.<ref name=Quietus /> He nonetheless begins work in the studio, at one point made to do [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley work]], using vegetables to create sound effects for the film's increasingly gory torture sequences, and mixing voiceovers from session artists, Silvia and Claudia, into the score.  As time passes, and Gilderoy feels more and more disconnected from his mother at home, he begins to fear he's out of his depth. His colleagues seem increasingly rude – to both himself and to each other. The horror sequences grow ever more shocking, yet Santini, the director, refuses to admit they are working on a horror film. And, after a long passage through the bureaucracy of the film studio's accounts department, it turns out the plane ticket Gilderoy submitted for a refund can't be processed because the flight didn't actually exist.  The plot, from here on in, grows increasingly erratic. Gilderoy hears and sees things in the night. He discovers Silvia, the voiceover artist, was molested by Santini. She storms out, destroying much of their work, forcing Gilderoy to re-record the dialogue with a new actress, Elisa. As Silvia's recording sequences are revisited again, and tension grows between Gilderoy and the others, the boundaries between the blood-drenched giallo thriller and real life begin to erode. Gilderoy imagines he himself is in a film about his life – suddenly fluent in Italian and increasingly detached and vicious. After he and Francesco essentially torture Elisa during a recording session, she walks out, leaving history to repeat itself yet again, and Gilderoy to contemplate the monster he has become.  
Best Man Down
 Minnesotans Scott ([[Justin Long]]) and his bride Kristen ([[Jess Weixler]]) are having their wedding in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. During the wedding, Kristin is put off by the obnoxious behavior of Scott's best man Lumpy ([[Tyler Labine]]). Lumpy gets extremely drunk and more annoying to the guests until he is cut off from the bar by Scott. Returning to his hotel room, Lumpy continues drinking and carrying on until he accidentally falls and cracks his skull before passing out. He awakens a short time later disoriented and bleeding, and gets himself locked out of the hotel. Wandering into the brush, Lumpy passes out and dies on top of a cactus. He is found the next morning and Scott and Kristen are informed. Since Lumpy was his best friend, Scott feels it is his duty to arrange for Lumpy to be returned to Minnesota for a funeral. Kristen is upset that her honeymoon will be postponed but she supports Scott in his decision. After arranging transport for the body, they return to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] to contact Lumpy's friends and plan the funeral.  Meanwhile, in a small town in Northern Minnesota we are introduced to Ramsey Anderson ([[Addison Timlin]]), a fifteen-year-old girl living with her mom ([[Frances O'Connor]]) and her mom's boyfriend ([[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]]). Her mom is a drug addict with a history of moving around, and her mom's boyfriend is a former soldier who has turned to cooking meth to make money. Ramsey catches the local priest ([[Michael Landes]]) with another man in his home and tacitly blackmails him out of $50, which she uses to purchase groceries for their house. Later on, she deliberately allows herself to be caught [[shoplifting]] cold medicine so that she wouldn't have to supply it to her mom's boyfriend and is bailed out by the same priest.  Kristen and Scott find Ramsey's name in Lumpy's phone and try to contact her but she doesn't answer. They visit his old law school and job to try to locate Ramsey but discover that Lumpy suddenly quit school and was fired from his job for embezzling tips from the bar. The bar manager tells them that Lumpy was involved with some girl, whom they deduce to be Ramsey. After an uncomfortable argument at Christmas dinner, Kristen pushes Scott to drive up to Ramsey's town and find her. In flashbacks, we learn that Ramsey met Lumpy ten months earlier when he knocked on her door asking for permission to cut across her parents property to go [[ice fishing]]. After catching a fish, Lumpy falls through the ice and is rescued by Ramsey. He takes her back to his hotel room where they both get cleaned up but end up having an argument after he asks her to leave. The hotel clerk calls the police on Lumpy and he is arrested, but released after Ramsey shows the police the fishing hole and accident. After this, Lumpy begins visiting Ramsey more frequently and the two develop a close friendship.  Scott and Kristen arrive in Ramsey's town and find her house. They tell her that Lumpy has died and offer to give her details about the funeral, but instead she asks them to leave. Finding a hotel for the night, Scott admits that he quit his job after being denied a commission and that the money for their honeymoon was a gift from Lumpy. The next morning, Ramsey finds them at the hotel and asks for a ride to Minneapolis for the funeral. She tells them she is pregnant with Lumpy's baby and needs to leave. They take her home to get permission from her mom, and are confronted by the mom's gun-wielding boyfriend who believes they are police. Ramsey's mom, realizing that this is Ramsey's chance to get away from this lifestyle, gives her money and tells her it's ok to go.  Back in Minneapolis Ramsey gets into an argument with Kristen and Scott when she reveals Lumpy's biggest secret, that he had a heart defect and knew he was dying. After fighting, Ramsey walks out. The next day at the funeral Ramsey delivers a powerful eulogy, replete with information about Lumpy that no one knew but her. Afterwards, she admits to Scott that she is not pregnant and that Lumpy was a true gentleman who was never intimate with her. Lumpy's mom gives Ramsey an envelope with some money in it that he left for her, and tells her there's more in a safe deposit box and that Lumpy meant for her to pay for her college with it. Ramsey sees the priest's boyfriend from earlier at the funeral and realizes it's Scott's boss. She takes him aside and talks to him, leading to Scott getting his job back.  The next day, Ramsey prepares to catch a bus home when Scott reveals that her mom called. Her mom left her boyfriend and was moving, and gave Ramsey permission to live with Scott and Kristen until she gets on her feet. Scott asks what Ramsey told his boss to get his job back, and she coyly responds that he probably doesn't want to know. The film ends with them all preparing to go out for dinner.

Beyond the Hills
 Two Romanian orphaned young women, Voichița and Alina, visit a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] convent during [[Lent]], where Voichița tells Alina the altar includes an icon that grants wishes. Alina had been working in Germany, and the two girls were previously roommates at a children's home and had shared a physical relationship. The monastery is led by a 30-year-old Priest who speaks ill of declining faith in [[Western Europe]], citing [[same-sex marriage in Europe|same-sex marriage]], and forbids anyone outside of the faith from entering. He inquires about Alina to Voichița, who tells him Alina irregularly attends church and does not go to [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. They urge Alina to begin confessing. Alina hopes to sleep with Voichița, but Voichița tells her they must be cautious given it is Lent.  Some time later after Alina has left the convent, Voichița retrieves her, but Voichița tells Alina she is now a nun, that she has chosen to be with God so she will never be alone, and her love of Alina is different from before. They return to the convent, but Alina asks Voichița that they escape together. After Voichița refuses, Alina attempts to jump down a well, but is retrained by the nuns and taken to the hospital. There, doctors restrain Alina to prevent her [[self-harm]], after which they send her back to the convent to assist with recovery. There, the nuns read to Alina about sin. Alina begins a [[Black Fast]], but when the Priest learns of this when Alina is not at the table, they see Alina is attempting to enter the altar to make a wish to the icon. The Priest admits the icon exists, but says entering the altar is a severe sin, and tells the nuns the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] is in Alina and the convent.  Alina remains tied down to a board with chains and towels. The nuns witness a worsening in her condition and take her back to the hospital. There, the hospital staff find Alina is dead on arrival, and observe the wounds on her wrists and ankles from the restraints. The staff tells the nuns this constitutes homicide and threatens to call the police and media. An officer investigates the convent. Seeing the board Alina was tied to, the officer interprets it as a cross. The officer also says forcible restraint leading to death is a homicide. The Priest denies criminal intent, saying the restraints were to prevent self-harm, and invoking the analogy of a parent's right to force children to take medicine, though the officer replies Alina was not a child and the Priest was not her guardian. The nuns also cite Alina's strength as mysterious, but Voichița says Alina studied [[martial arts]]. The police take the Priest and the nuns who tied up Alina away, with Voichița choosing to go with them.  
Beyond Outrage
 The film begins with two anti-corruption detectives observing the discovery of dead bodies in a car being recovered from the bottom of a harbor. The detectives suspect that the drowned bodies are related to the recent gang war and power struggle at the huge Sanno-kai crime syndicate, which covers a large portion of eastern Japan. The new Grand Yakuza leader of Sanno-kai, Kato (Tomokazu Miura), must now reform his standing with the powerful rival Hanabishi-kai of western Japan. Otomo (Beat Takeshi), a former Yakuza, is serving time in a maximum security prison after falling out of favor with Sekiuchi, the former Grand Yakuza before Kato murdered him and took control.  When it is finally ascertained by detectives that one of the dead bodies recovered from the harbor in the opening scene was actually the body of a high government official, the departmental Chief of Police strongly suspects that Kato has become too strong and influential, believing he is so protected by his corrupt political ties that he can completely avoid police interference, even after ordering the execution of a government official.  The Chief appoints Special Detective Kataoka - who has previously infiltrated the Sanno-kai syndicate by posing as a corrupt cop - to see if he can ignite further dissent between the already aggressive Sanno-kai Yakuza leaders. Kataoka decides to shorten Otomo's prison sentence and have him released, theorizing that his returning presence might stir-up bad memories of old bitter clan rivalries which prevailed before Otomo was imprisoned. This would potentially cause old cracks to resurface in this new and growing version of the old Sanno-kai.  When Kataoka uses his influence to shorten Otomo's imprisonment, Kato allows his lieutenants to order his assassination. Otomo, with careful calculation and help from the rival Hanabishi-kai, initiates a ruthless and bloody rampage through the ranks of the Sanno-kai in order to exact his version of justice for having been previously betrayed and forced to serve his prison sentence. His careful calculation pays off as his ruthless campaign to dismantle the new Sanno-kai leadership, including Kato, is efficiently carried out. The decimated Sanno-kai ends up being absorbed into the Hanabishi-kai under their Grand Yakuza leader, who has virtually unified the entire underground of all of Japan into a massive, single and centralized organization.  In the closing scene, Otomo goes to a funeral home where some of his dead Yakuza brothers are being interred. He is surprised in the parking lot by Kataoka, who tells him that all the Yakuza leaders are inside and that he should not enter without a gun. When Otomo replies that he is unarmed, Kataoka - still acting the corrupt cop - offers his own gun. By now, however, it has fully dawned upon Otomo that Kataoka has been playing the two rival crime syndicates against each other in order to weaken and destroy the Sanno-kai. Upon receiving the gun, Otomo empties it into Kataoka at point-blank range, killing him.  
Bharath Stores
 Bharathi has come to Bengaluru after nine years with her husband, Sharath. She had promised her father that she would repay his dues to Mr Govinda Shetty. Only then did her father die in peace. Mr Govinda Shetty inherited the small grocery shop, "Bharath Stores" and was carrying on the family business with pride and such elan that the bus stop in front was named after it as "Bharath stores stop" After alighting near that stop, she was surprised to find no trace of it anywhere there. The queries to that effect went in vain.   Now the frantic search begins. By the fruition of a dedicated search, she meets Chandru and Manjunath, who had worked in that shop. Chandru tells her how he learnt along with the tricks of the trade, to be humane from him. Manjunath tells her, he stayed in the shop till the end until Shetty was hospitalized. He brings her to the old age home. Bharathi finds Shetty there gazing at nothing, having stopped speaking for months and unable to react to her.   Guess the reason behind Shetty’s present status?   Certainly not the events in his life, like Balaji, his son showing contempt to the family business, his love marriage nor his leaving the house for ever. Shetty showed his strong willpower at such situations.   Globalisation, liberalisation and industrialissation brought the countries nearer. It is a couple of decades India also accepted these, resulting in the gradual change in the lifestyle. Malls and marts popped up. New ethics and style of business were adapted. Curious clientele gradually were being attracted to the mall culture. Repercussion was the deteriorating retail, small and box shops. Govinda Shetty too was a victim of the tsunami of this dangerous evolution. It is the status of lakhs and lakhs of those like him.   Bharathi’s search unfolds the cruel reality of the invasion of mall culture. Many a gigantic question, appear and disturb us.

In the end, he feels that his being there would only bring trouble to those creatures living in that space. And he decides to walk out, one doesn't know where to.

 Scooby-Doo and the gang travel to Atlantic City, where Fred enthusiastically takes them to see The Brancusi Circus. They arrive to find that the circus does not open until tomorrow, but decide to look around when they notice that the front door is unlocked. Whilst searching, they meet a man who is pursuing a [[werewolf]] that has intruded into the circus. The werewolf attacks the gang, but is eventually scared off by Velma, using a spotlight. The man thanks the gang and introduces himself as Marius Brancusi, the ringleader. Marius inherited the circus from his uncle last year and has been working to modernize it. He informs the gang that the werewolf they had encountered has been shadowing the circus for a few months, has scared off many of his artists, and has stolen jewelry wherever they are. He even suspects that the werewolf might be one of his own artists. Velma notices that this incident alludes to a case during the 18th century, in Ingolstadt, where a werewolf named Hans collected a combination of jewels which enabled him to change into a werewolf at any time. After the gang tells Marius that they solve mysteries, Marius hires them to go undercover as circus performers.  The next morning, Marius introduces the gang to the other circus artists. Scooby and Shaggy pose as animal artists and team up with animal trainer Whitney Doubleday, who informs them that Marius plans to eliminate all the animal acts in order to modernize the circus. Velma is given a role as a human cannonball and works with strong man Archambault. Fred is given a position as a backup trapeze artist and meets the other trapeze artist, Oliverio, and his girlfriend Lena. Oliverio immediately becomes jealous of Fred when Lena begins to flirt with him. Daphne works as a motorcycle stunt artist and meets the circus clowns, Schmatko and Sisko. Sisko only communicates with a horn. Schmatko tells Daphne that he is reluctant to have this role as a clown, and says that he was once an actor in the Soviet Union. Afterwards, when Schmatko goes to get refreshments, he is abducted by the werewolf.  Later on the gang witness another robbery by the werewolf and are chased by a second werewolf wearing Schmatko's uniform. The gang escape and return to the circus to inform Marius. Despite this, Marius decides that the show must go on. Daphne fills in for Schmatko, while Fred does a tightrope act to fill in time. The shows goes very well, especially Scooby's act, although Shaggy takes credit for Scooby's performance when he tells the audience that he's Scooby's 'trainer'. Before Velma can perform her act, the two werewolves attack Shaggy and Scooby. Fred and Marius manage to drop the trapeze safety net on them, but werewolves are nowhere to be found when they search the net. In spite of the attack, the performers receive a big round of applause from the audience, who believe that the werewolves were just part of the show.  The next day, Marius shows the gang the reviews from last night's performance and comments that they are the best reviews he has ever received. In the reviews, the critics deemed Shaggy the greatest circus artist, much to the dismay of Scooby, whom the critics refer to as 'Scabby'. When Marius goes to show the rest of his artists the review, the gang find a book about the Ingolstadt werewolves in his office, causing them to suspect that Marius might be involved in the werewolf attacks, since Marius initially claimed to have no knowledge on werewolves. On the page which has the list of the jewels a werewolf needs, Velma finds that the only jewel the werewolf doesn't have is a carbonado. They confront Marius about the book, but Marius claims that the book isn't his.  When going for a lunch break, Shaggy receives numerous praises from the locals, which in turn continues to annoy Scooby so much that Shaggy bribes him with a wheelbarrow full of Scooby Snacks to prevent him from quitting. Marius informs the gang that they will be doing a private show for Wulfric von Rydingsvard, a singer from the band Wülfsmöøon which Shaggy admires. Later on, Velma finds out that a carbonado is also called a black diamond, a jewel that Wulfric owns. The gang prepare to catch the werewolf during the show, but before the show begins Archambault, Lena, and Marius go missing. During the show, the werewolves appear after Scooby's act, along with three more, each wearing the clothes of the missing artists. The werewolves manage to steal the black diamond from Wulfric and continue to chase the gang. During the chase, Shaggy pulls off one of the werewolves' fur and finds red fur underneath it, and Scooby notices that the cage which had Doubleday's baboons is empty, making them realize the werewolves were just Doubleday and his trained baboons in disguise. Shaggy uses one of Doubleday's Spanish commands to stop them. Doubleday tries to escape, but is tranquilized and caught by Archambault, who claims that he was tied up in a storage shed, but managed to break the ropes. There, they find the rest of the missing artists. Doubleday, who's still unconscious, is taken away by the police, but they are unable to find any of the stolen jewels.  The next day, the Brancusi circus packs up and prepares to leave Atlantic City. Marius thanks the gang by giving them free passes to any of the Brancusi Circus performances. Archambault bids Velma good luck in finding the 'black diamond'. Schmatko informs Daphne that he has decided to quit his job as a clown and to pursue his dream in theatre. However, after the circus train begins to depart, Velma starts to think that there is still something missing. Velma remembers that Archambault last heard that the jewel was referred to, not as a 'black diamond', but as a 'carbonado', and recounts that before Doubleday was captured, he said "you won't take 'us' that easy", suggesting that he had an accomplice. She also noticed during last night's performance that the ropes around Archambault didn't look like they were broken, but cut. She also remembers that they only found the book about the Ingolstadt werewolves when Archambault knocked it off the shelf, suggesting that Archambault planted it there. With the facts added up, the gang realizes that Archambault was Doubleday's accomplice. The gang pursue the train and see Archambault attacking Marius to get to the box office money. Scooby and Shaggy manage to jump onto the train and, while there, Shaggy apologizes to Scooby for taking credit for his act. The two free the baboons to aid them in stopping Archambault, and they subdue him using the tranquilizer darts.  As Archambault is taken away by the police, Marius informs the gang that Doubleday and Archambault had worked with his uncle for years and were angry when Marius took charge and decided to modernize the circus. When Doubleday was about to get caught, Archambault double-crossed him in order to buy some time to get away with the jewels and the box office money. At the end, Wulfric arrives and thanks the gang for recovering his jewel by giving them a private performance.

Black November
 The film opens in a [[Warri]] prison in the [[Niger Delta]] where a [[noose]] is being set up to [[Hanging|hang]] Ebiere ([[Mbong Amata]]). It switches to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; Tom Hudson ([[Mickey Rourke]]), [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of Western Oil is kidnapped on his way to the airport by a movement group tagged "United People's Front for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta People of Nigeria". The kidnap is carried out by Tamuno ([[Enyinna Nwigwe]] - the leader of the movement), Timi ([[Wyclef Jean]]), Opuwei ([[Akon]]), Timi ([[Razaaq Adoti]]) and Pere (Robert Peters) after orchestrating an accident near [[2nd Street Tunnel|the second street tunnel]]. Also kidnapped is a reporter, Kristy ([[Kim Basinger]]), and her cameraman. Tom Hudson, his wife (Kristin Peterson) and Kristy, together with several others at the accident scene are captured and held hostage within this tunnel which has already been closed off on both sides by the group. Seven hours, no communication is heard from the tunnel - the police, the anti-terrorism unit and the general public have no idea who the "terrorists" are or what they want. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Tamuno tells Tom that they are in Los Angeles to save Ebiere and declares that if Ebiere is eventually hung in Nigeria, then the "truly guilty" ones should go with her. He releases the women and children and instructs Kristy to record what is happening in the tunnel.  The film flashes back to 21 years earlier during military era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal to the public via Kristy's camera. Ebiere ([[Mbong Amata]]) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts and the people of the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede ([[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]]), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is different from the rest of the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.  However, Dede, whose wife and only child died in the explosion, believes that protests will never solve anything and that the Government can only listen through violence. Dede starts to have people on his side (including Tamuno, who was a dedicated police officer) after an incident in which the Army invades their village and rapes their women, right in front of them. Ebiere continues with her protests while Dede forms a militant group, showing their displeasure through violence, vandalism and kidnapping Western Oil officials. Western Oil eventually convinces Ebiere (who is now Dede's love interest) to help ask Dede and his group for dialogue with government. It turns out to be a ploy to get them arrested. A shoot-out occurs, leading to Dede and his group being killed.  Chief Gadibia (Isaac Yongo), one of the chiefs who have been receiving bribes from Western Oil, and also embezzling funds meant for community development, tells his fellow elders that he is no longer interested in the "unclean" money and he wants to return his share to the people. Gadibia dies the following day, the Elders having poisoned his drink the previous night. Peter ([[OC Ukeje]]), Gadibia's son, to whom he has already confessed, explains the incident to Ebiere and how sure he is that his father was murdered by the Elders. Gadibia's stolen fund is discovered in his house and the other elders involved are captured by the community people, led by Ebiere. Ebiere wants the Elders to be reported to the police, but the people refuse to listen and set them ablaze instead. Everyone at the vicinity of the crime is arrested by the Police; Ebiere however claims responsibility for the crime and is sentenced to death by hanging. The film shifts back to the present in the Los Angeles tunnel; Tom Hudson calls Nigeria's Head of State and tells him to do something to stop the execution of Ebiere, but his request isn't granted. Angela ([[Vivica Fox]]) of the US Anti-terrorism unit advises that the United States make a diplomatic call to the Nigerian Government, but the head of the department says they do not negotiate with terrorists. They eventually resolve to issue a deceptive press release, stating that Ebiere has been released. When the emancipation movement is informed about the release, they drop their weapons as a result and also release the rest of the hostages, including Tom Hudson. They are arrested by the United States Police, while Ebiere still gets hanged in Nigeria.

Unbeknownst to her until the cliff, Kristin chased Andrea and asked her to tell her everything so she'd share her own secrets. Andrea confesses that she's an [[orphan]] and she quit school due to the unwanted attention, complaining that no one really knows a person's true feelings but one's self.   When Gustav hosts a [[midsummer]] party with his friends at his place, Kristin and Andrea hide in the attic and have a little party for themselves. However, Linn is present in the party, and bumps into Andrea when Andrea had to visit the kitchen for a while. Andrea runs up to the attic to Kristin, fearing Linn may have recognized her from a [[Videotelephony|video chat]] as the French [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] Kristin is "staying with" in New York. They escape the house through the hole in the roof, and hang out by the fjord. When Andrea and Kristin hear the party approaching the pier they're sitting on, Kristin realizes she has nowhere to hide, and tries to swim away through the fjord. Having only had a few swimming lessons with Andrea, she drowns but is swiftly [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|rescued]] by Andrea.   Word spreads that the entire trip to New York was a hoax, with rumors spreading that she had to [[Self-sustainability|live off the earth]] and that she attempted [[suicide]] by drowning after being caught. The [[editor-in-chief]] of the newspaper Kristin was writing for forgives the incident, telling her that the controversy helped them sell much more copies, and that he wants Kristin to write about her lie, and to write again about a real trip. He then gives her a flight ticket to New York. During this entire time, Andrea's and Kristin's friendship is strained.  Kristin's friends held a surprise welcome home/farewell party for her after she was released from hospital. Despite not being in the mood for a party, she is coerced by her friends to stay. Andrea visits the party, expecting to get back on good terms with Kristin, but Kristin reverted back to her former apathetic self before meeting Andrea.  In grief, Andrea and Kristin get extremely drunk, and Andrea pulls Kristin's ex-boyfriend into the bathroom to have sex with her. Upon realizing the situation, Andrea pushes him off her, and runs out of the party. Kristin chases her and attempts to explain her behavior, and bursts out that their experience wasn't real. Andrea takes this as their relationship meant nothing to Kristin. Devastated, Kristin returns to the party and Andrea is picked up by Gustav while she states that she wishes to resume her education.  In an attempt to fix their relationship, Kristin buys a window to cover the hole on the roof of the attic, and hands Andrea her diary. They get back on friendly terms. Kristin explains that she doesn't wish to visit New York anymore, since it doesn't feel sincere and real anymore, having had the experience with Andrea already. Despite this, Andrea convinces Kristin to fly anyways.   The next day, Kristin boards the flight to New York, Andrea watches the plane take off and looks back to not see Kristin coming up the escalator again.

To be released from the jail sooner, he reluctantly follows his lawyer's advice to plead guilty for planning a [[school shooting]], even though he had no such plans. He is indeed released, under the condition that he does not have any contact with Deanna or the hockey team members. He avoids his previous goth look, but people still consider him weird and dangerous, and his car is vandalized.  Sean violates the condition of having no contact with Deanna and is arrested again. With his father's support, he decides to dismiss his lawyer and tell the truth, after which he is sentenced for [[perjury]] in the previous trial. He is returned to juvenile jail, where Trevor convinces one of his friends to murder Sean, but the attempt fails. Later on, it is Christmas time, which makes Trevor uncomfortable.

One day, he does not have to stay in the isolation ward any longer, but prefers to and is allowed to stay while Trevor is still there. Sean begins to feel sympathy for him, and they reconcile.

Bloodwork (film)
 Two college students — irresponsible slacker Greg ([[Travis Van Winkle]]) and his straightlaced best friend Rob ([[John Bregar]]) — decide to take a trip to Europe for their spring break. Lacking in money, they research odd jobs and find an opportunity with Ravexin Pharmaceuticals to participate in a two-week trial for the company's new allergy drug. When they travel to the unexpectly run-down, remote facility where the test is to take place, they are troubled by the stringent rules in place but enroll in the trial anyway, as it will earn them each over three thousand dollars.  Greg and Rob meet Dr. Wilcox ([[Tricia Helfer]]) and become acquainted with some of the other patients, including prudish Stacey ([[Mircea Monroe]]) and veteran trialgoer Nigel (Rik Denton). The patients are given the first dose of the drug, RXZ-19; though they experience violent bowel movements as a result of taking the drug, the test soon begins to take a turn for the better, as the patients start to exhibit remarkable recovery from illness and injury. However, strange circumstances begin to occur, such as the discovery of worms and insects in the food served to the patients and infestations in the building. Despite the seemingly grotesque events happening around them, none of the trialgoers seem to display any reaction to them, save for Greg. Greg confronts Wilcox in her lab and learns the truth about the trial: RXZ-19 is not an allergy drug, but a formula designed to give its users [[regeneration in humans|regenerative]] abilities, and the trials are being sponsored by the government. Greg is experiencing normal reactions to the facility's conditions because he is the [[scientific control|control]] in the experiment, while the others are losing some of their inhibition and sense of self-preservation due to their newfound immunity. Outraged, Greg attempts to rally the others to rebel against Wilcox, but she convinces them to stay by increasing the payment to $8,000.  Wilcox's superiors learn of the encouraging results so far and push her to extend the trial further beyond her original intentions. While administering additional doses to Rob, increasing his regenerative abilities to a degree that he heals from a normally fatal neck wound almost instantly, he escapes from his restraints and attempts to rape Wilcox before being subdued by her assistants. Seeing that the patients are becoming zombie-like as their dependence on RXZ-19 increases, Dr. Wilcox has a crisis of conscience and decides to pull the plug on her experiment. She has Rob brought back in for [[detoxification]], but before she can begin the process on any of the others, the facility's power is cut in a storm. The patients rebel en masse, desperate for more of the drug. They begin killing the staff and corner Wilcox in her lab to demand more, but when she runs out, they attack and mortally wound her. Greg escapes from his room and finds Wilcox dying, along with evidence that the patients have begun turning to [[cannibalism]] in their need to sate their addiction to RXZ-19. He comes across Aaron ([[Joe Pingue]]), the facility's [[phlebotomist]], frantically packing up records. The pair escape the facility, but when Greg overhears Aaron contacting his superiors to tell them of the chaos, he forces Aaron to return to the facility so he can retrieve Rob.  Greg arms himself with a fire axe and searches through the facility for Rob, having to kill Stacey when she attacks him. Meanwhile, Aaron's superior ([[Eric Roberts]]) arrives with a military unit to purge the facility and its victims to cover up the government's actions. After hearing Aaron's report, his superior has him strangled to death. Greg finds Rob, whose detox was successful in restoring him to his true self, leaving him traumatized by his actions while on the drug. They are forced to work together and kill Nigel when he discovers them, and barely escape before the military unit sets off explosives, destroying the facility.  The next morning, Greg and Rob wander aimlessly through the forest until they discover a road. A car stops for them, driven by Aaron, who survived his injuries. Aaron retrieves a blanket from his trunk for them, but they do not see that his hand begins trembling uncontrollably, prompting him to take a dose of RXZ-19. As they ride, Greg and Rob realize Aaron is driving in the wrong direction from the nearest town. Aaron locks the doors of the car and warns the pair that there are events much bigger than them taking place as they realize that their nightmare is not over.

The next day Joyita returns to her village and soon realizes her love for Avik. Meanwhile, in the city Avik also realizes the same and started planning to go to Balurghat to meet her.  Then a parallel story takes place where Noor Islam ([[Soham Chakraborty]]), a poor guy from the village of [[Murshidabad]] comes to [[English Bazar|Malda]] to find a suitable work. Noor falls in love with his neighbour Riya ([[Mimi Chakraborty]]), who is a nurse by profession. He watches her every morning for the last six months. One day Noor meets Riya, and expresses his love for her. Riya, however, is bold and forthcoming, agrees to his love and commences to command him mercilessly. She puts him through several tests such as getting him to agree to organ donation, HIV testing, talking him to a police commissioner who is her father, fixing meeting with her former one-sided lover and so on. She wants him to decide on the basis of all that she's put him through as to whether he wants to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her. Noor responds affirmatively and the two grow to love each other unconditionally with the consent of their families.  Then the story flashes back to the present where Noor takes Riya to meet his parents. They ride the same bus which is boarded by Avik too who went to meet Joyita albeit he is returning as he could not find her address.

The concluding scene shows Noor's body being taken away by a hysteric Riya and his grieving parents while Avik affectionately caresses the palm of a lifeless Joyita inside the ICU only to leave the hospital later, in grief. The site of the crash is declared an accident prone-area, and the film ends with few messages on road safety. One can never understand the reason behind what life has in store for him/her. Hence, the name:  'Bojhena Shey Bojhena'.

The Bourne Legacy (film)
 Six weeks after [[Jason Bourne]]'s ([[Matt Damon]]) [[The Bourne Supremacy|escape from Moscow]], Aaron Cross ([[Jeremy Renner]]), an operative belonging to a [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] [[black operation|black ops]] program called Operation Outcome, is assigned to [[Alaska]] for a training exercise. He is forced to survive weather extremes and traverse rugged terrain to arrive at a remote cabin as punishment for missing training and going off the grid for four days. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three ([[Oscar Isaac]]), who informs Aaron that he has broken the mission record by two days. As an Outcome operative, Aaron uses experimental pills known as "chems" (chemicals) which enhance the physical and mental abilities of their users.  Reporter Simon Ross ([[Paddy Considine]]) of ''[[The Guardian]]'', who has been investigating the CIA programs Treadstone and Blackbriar, is assassinated at [[London Waterloo station]] (a scene from [[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|the previous film]]). When the illegal adaptation of the programs is exposed by Bourne, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] investigate [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director]] Ezra Kramer ([[Scott Glenn]]), [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy ([[Joan Allen]]), Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen ([[David Strathairn]]), and Treadstone medical director Dr. Albert Hirsch ([[Albert Finney]]).  Eight months after the mayhem in [[New York City]] and Bourne's escape, Kramer requests help from Mark Turso ([[Stacy Keach]]), a retired [[United States Navy]] admiral, who runs the National Research Assay Group (NRAG). Turso informs Eric Byer ([[Edward Norton]]), a retired [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] colonel overseeing NRAG's research and development of various clandestine enhancement programs used by the CIA and Defense. Byer discovers a potentially scandalous video on the Internet showing Hirsch socializing with Dr. Dan Hillcott (Neil Brooks Cunningham), Outcome's medical director. To prevent the Senate investigation from learning about Outcome, Byer orders everyone associated with the program killed. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable to protect NRAG's next-generation "beta programs", including the [[supersoldier]] program LARX.  [[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|upright|[[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]], an unmanned aerial vehicle like the one featured in ''Legacy'']]  Byer deploys a [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to eliminate Outcome agents Number Three and Five (Aaron) in Alaska. Aaron hears the drone's approach and leaves moments before a missile destroys the cabin with Number Three inside. Aaron removes the [[radio-frequency identification]] implanted in his thigh and force-feeds it to a wolf which is then blown up by a missile, tricking Byer into believing Aaron is dead. Hirsch dies of an apparent heart attack before he can testify before the Senate. At Sterisyn-Morlanta, a biogenetics company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite ([[Željko Ivanek]]) shoots and kills all but one of his colleagues in the research laboratory. Security guards break into the lab and shoot him, though he seemingly does not feel the pain of the gunshots. Foite turns his gun on himself, leaving [[biochemist]] Dr. Marta Shearing ([[Rachel Weisz]]) as the sole survivor.  Meanwhile, other Outcome agents are eliminated when their handlers give them poisoned yellow pills disguised as new chems.  Four "D-Track" assassins disguised as federal agents visit Marta at her country house. After she states her belief of Foite having been chemically brainwashed into an emotionless killer, the assassins attempt to fake her suicide, but are killed by Aaron. He saves her life as she is his last link to the chems so that he can retain his enhanced capabilities and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Marta reveals that Cross has been [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] by a tailored virus to retain the physical benefits permanently without needing the green chems anymore. He still requires regular doses of blue chems to maintain his intelligence, but he is running out. Aaron confides to her that he is [[Private first class|Private First Class]] Kenneth J. Kitsom (reportedly killed by a [[Improvised explosive device|roadside bomb]] in the [[Iraq War]]) and that his recruiter added twelve points to his IQ, enabling Aaron to meet the [[United States Army]]'s requirements. Without his enhanced intelligence, Aaron believes they stand no chance of survival. Aaron and Marta travel to [[Manila]], where the chems are manufactured, to try to infect him with another virus so he will not need the blue chems and making his new intelligence permanent.  Aaron and Marta bluff their way into the Morlanta Pacific pharmaceutical factory where the program's chems are manufactured, and Marta injects Aaron with the live virus stems. Byer alerts factory security, but Aaron and Marta evade capture. Byer orders LARX-03, a chemically-brainwashed super soldier, to track down and kill them. As Aaron is struck by the flu-like symptoms induced by the virus, he hallucinates about his Outcome training. When police surround their shelter while Marta is buying medicine, she warns Aaron by screaming. Aaron rescues her and steals a motorbike. They are pursued by both the police and LARX-03. After a lengthy chase through the streets and marketplaces of Manila to [[Marikina]], they lose the police, but not the assassin.

While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon [[bear]], attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.  Ten years later, Merida, now a sister to three mischievous brothers, Hamish, Hubert and Harris, discovers that to her dismay, she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom, Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch.  The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's [[Arranged marriage|hand in marriage]]. Merida breaks the rules, announcing that as her own clan's [[firstborn]] she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans. Later, she and Elinor argue, and Merida runs away. After following the wisps to the hut of an [[Old age|elderly]] [[Witchcraft|witch]], Merida bargains with her for a spell to change her fate.  When Merida gives the spell, in the form of a [[cake]], to Elinor, it causes Elinor to transform into a [[bear]], losing her ability to speak but still retaining most of her human personality. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to "mend the bond torn by pride" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. In the meantime, Hamish, Hubert and Harris also turn into bears cubs after eating the cursed cake. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.  They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Having learned from her experience with her mother, Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but with nonverbal encouragement from Elinor, instead insists that the first-borns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.  Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her human personality, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unwilling to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. With the help of her younger triplet brothers, Merida escapes and repairs the tapestry while riding after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the real meaning of the witch's message, causing the queen and the princes to turn back into humans.  With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.   
Brake (film)
 Jeremy Reins, a [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] special agent assigned to the presidential detail, is drugged, kidnapped and held captive within a glass box in the cramped, dark trunk of a car. At first Jeremy thinks it is a prank from people he owes money for gambling debts, but he quickly learns that the truth is far more sinister. Jeremy begins to endure mental and physical torture as terrorists attempt to extract information. The information needed is the location of the secret bunkers, dubbed "Roulette", that are [[Presidential Emergency Facility|used]] by the [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] during a national emergency.  Jeremy's only contact is Henry, another hostage that is also locked in a trunk of a car; both hostages have timers in the trunk with them that counts down. The terrorists have left old radios in the trunk to allow them to communicate with their hostages as well as allowing Jeremy and Henry to talk to one another. Through long conversations, Jeremy learns that the cars are actually bombs, and that they are currently in Maryland traveling towards Washington D.C. The car is almost pulled over by police and a high speed chase ensues but Jeremy is unable to be rescued, although the box is shot, leaving a hole in the glass. Jeremy is tortured every time the counter hits zero, at one point bees are released into his tank, since he is allergic to bee stings. However, the terrorists give him an Epi-pen injection, saving his life: they need him alive. The terrorists also kidnap his estranged wife, Molly, and hold her in another trunk. After enduring much emotional and mental stress, Jeremy still refuses to give up the location. After his countdown reaches zero, Jeremy's glass box begins to flood with liquid. After nearly drowning, Jeremy is pulled out by someone, revealed to be Henry.  It is revealed that the whole situation was an exercise to test whether Jeremy would break or not. Everyone he saw or was in contact with is present, along with their radios, which they used to play their parts. Jeremy collapses from his wounds and is put in an ambulance with Molly. On the way to the hospital, he sees the Washington monument through the window and chuckles. Noticing this, Molly looks out the window and asks if the monument was the location, but Jeremy dismisses it as unimportant and gives her an engagement ring, asking her to marry him. When she replies that they are already married, Jeremy smiles and asks her to marry him again. As they kiss, Molly handcuffs him to the gurney and pulls a wire from her shirt. Revealing themselves to really be with the terrorists, Molly and Henry are told over the radio that they have the location now that they lured him into a false sense of security and Jeremy is to be killed. As Molly holds a gas-filled mask over Jeremy's face, the film cuts to black.

Branded (2012 film)

Moments later, he is struck by lightning. A woman who examines him after comments that he will have an interesting life. Over the following years, Misha uses his natural skills to become an important marketing executive, receiving his big break when he meets Bob Gibbons, an American hired to spread Western brands in post-Communist Russia. When Bob's niece, Abby, visits from America, she and Misha begin a relationship against Bob's wishes. They discuss the history of modern marketing, which Misha claims was invented by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and Communism as the first true global brand.   Meanwhile, on a private Polynesian island, an unnamed marketing guru meets with fast food company executives to discuss a plan to make the industry profitable again. They plan to change public perceptions of beauty and "make fat the new fabulous."   Misha is hired to promote a new reality TV show, "Extreme Cosmetica", in which an overweight woman will undergo plastic surgery to become thin. After the first operation, the woman falls into a coma and the public turns against the show, as well as the glorification of thin body types.  Misha becomes the scapegoat for the failed project and is swarmed by protesters before being beaten by police and arrested. Upon his release from jail, he confronts Bob; Misha has realized that the show and the woman's coma were orchestrated by fast food companies, such as "The Burger". Bob denies the accusations, claiming that such a plan would require too many resources. Misha and Bob fight and Bob has a heart attack. Feeling guilty for his role in the fate of the "Extreme Cosmetic" contestant, Misha leaves Moscow and withdraws from modern society; he believes his marketing powers are a curse.   Over the next six years, the "fat is fabulous" campaign is successful; most people are overweight and advertising images now focus on this change in perception of the ideal body type. Misha dreams that he performs the [[Red Heifer]] ritual, sacrificing a red cow and bathing in its ashes. When he wakes, he discovers that he can see strange creatures that appear to be the embodiment of marketing brand desires. They cling to people's necks and no one except for Misha can see them.   Abby tracks Misha to a rural community where he lives as a simple cowherd. She takes Misha to her Moscow apartment where she reveals that Bob left her a substantial inheritance and that she and Misha have a six-year-old son, who is overweight and loves many junk food brands. Misha—distressed by his visions and disgusted with the rampant commercialism around him—impulsively destroys Abby's apartment. Abby is frightened by this behavior and leaves, taking their son with her.   Misha plans to fight the branding creatures by using their own methods. He returns to his old company and uses fear based marketing to make customers turn on the world's major brands, beginning with an anti-beef scare that turns people away from "The Burger" and towards a vegetarian Chinese restaurant chain, "Dim Song". Branding creatures fight and destroy each other throughout the city. Public opinion turns against marketing in general and the Russian parliament considers banning all advertising.   Alone in his office, Misha leaves a phone message for Abby, asking for her forgiveness. Abby arrives at his office but the building is suddenly raided by anti-advertising protesters who assault the employees in the building. Misha is struck in the head as he attempts to escape with Abby. An emergency broadcast on television states that Russia and other nations have agreed to ban advertising as Misha lays on the floor, bleeding.   Some time later, Misha wakes in the hospital and plays with Abby and their son. In the same hospital, the "Extreme Cosmetica" woman awakens from her coma and wanders into the streets to see an advertising free Moscow and a skyline free of billboards.  
Breaking Wind
 One night, a young man named Ronald (Michael Hamilton) is attacked by an unseen assailant, and during the course of the attack he loses his shirt, then [[The Hangover (film)|one of his teeth]], and [[The Hangover Part II|gains a tattoo]]. Finally, he's bitten on his buttocks, which causes him to begin transforming into a vampire and incessantly break wind.  A year later, Bella (Heather Ann Davis) asks her boyfriend Edward Colon (Eric Callero) to transform her into a vampire, but he insists that he marry her first. Bella also has to deal with the affections of Jacob (Frank Pacheco), a member of a pack of overweight, flatulent werewolves (who oddly never transforms). One night, Edward gets a vision of Ronald breaking into Bella's room, and brings her to the Colon family home for help, but they are unsure of what to do. Jacob then takes her to meet his grandfather ([[Danny Trejo]]), who recounts the time that he faced an ancient evil that manifested itself as "different characters all played the exact same way" (a stab at [[Johnny Depp]] and his performances as [[Jack Sparrow]], [[Edward Scissorhands]], [[Willy Wonka]] and [[The Mad Hatter]]), and believes that a similar incident is about to occur. With this information and a recent spate of people going missing, the Colons are able to deduce that a rogue vampire is creating an army of newborns (or "noobs").  The army turns out to be under the control of Victoria (Kelsey Collins), who tricks Ronald into believing Edward killed [[Gary Coleman]] and killing Bella will avenge him. The noobs get Bella's scent from a pornographic magazine, and the Colons realize that they cannot protect her, especially because of Rosalie's homicidal rages toward her and Carlisle's (John Stevenson) inability to stop himself from drinking her blood. She seeks refuge with her flamboyantly homosexual father Charlie (Flip Schultz), but soon realizes that she cannot stay with him either, due to his insistence in graphically describing his sex acts and holding orgies at his house. Eventually, Edward works out a compromise with Jacob, who takes Bella to safety and uses his flatulence to mask her scent.  That night, Edward meets with Bella and Jacob and the three spend the night in a tent, where Jacob has sex with Bella as an oblivious Edward talks about how he thinks he and Jacob could be friends if they put their differences aside. The following morning the noobs catch up with the trio, but the Colons and Jacob's pack also arrive, and a fight ensues. Bella distracts the noobs by eating a special cake given to her by Jacob, which causes her to experience severe flatulence and creates a smell bad enough to distract Victoria and the noobs long enough for the Colons to kill them all. Bella agrees to marry Edward, while Jacob accidentally ends up stabbing himself to death during a fight with a [[TMZ]] reporter.  A year later a pregnant Bella learns dwarf-like copy of Edward (who had been hitting on her throughout the film, despite her obvious disgust) somehow fathered the child instead.  The movie then ends by parodying the trailer to ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1|Breaking Dawn – Part 1]]'', followed by a segment ridiculing the reactions to said trailer (in the form of [[YouTube]] videos) by certain "Twi-Hard" fans of the series.

Breathless (2012 film)
   
Buffalo Girls (film)
 The documentary is an intimate look into the lives of two very young, professional Muay Thai fighters: Stam Sor Con Lek and Pet Chor Chanachai.  At only eight years old, the two girls fight throughout rural Thailand to earn money to support their families, as well as trying to secure the 22-kilogram Muay Thai Championship belt of Thailand. The film also addresses the culture of children's fighting through interviews with the children's parents, the referees who officiate the fights, and the professional gamblers who bet on them.  The impoverished farming communities of rural Thailand offer few opportunities for economic gain and boxing is one of the few alternatives to the country’s commercial sex trade as a means of escaping the extreme poverty. Child boxers in Thailand can often earn a family’s monthly rent from a single bout, sometimes taking home more than what a farmer or factory worker earns in a month.  For the film’s young protagonists, boxing is an opportunity to help their parents supplement the family income and improve their standard of living.<ref></ref>

Washington, D.C., Detective Taylor Kwon arrives in New Orleans to investigate his former partner's death and meets Lieutenant Lebreton, who informs him Lola confirmed Greely was assassinated. Kwon goes to the morgue, and, after seeing Blanchard's body and finding out who he is, he deduces that Blanchard and Bobo killed Greely. Meanwhile, Keegan meets with his employer, Robert Morel, and Morel's lawyer Marcus Baptiste. Baptiste reveals that Greely tried to blackmail Morel, and provided local mobster Baby Jack with a file detailing Morel's illegal operations. Keegan later kills Baby Jack and his men and retrieves the file.  Kwon meets Bobo in a bar and informs him that he knows Bobo and Blanchard killed Greely. Bobo leaves, and when Kwon tries to follow him, he is attacked by corrupt cops who were ordered by Morel to prevent Kwon from further investigating about Greely. Bobo rescues Kwon and takes him to a tattoo parlor, where Bobo's estranged daughter, Lisa, treats Kwon's wounds. They later go to a massage parlor where Bobo interrogates Ronnie Earl, the middleman who hired Bobo and Blanchard on Morel's behalf. Ronnie Earl tries to kill Bobo, but Bobo manages to kill him, although his gun jams. Bobo later confronts Kwon, who admits to having tampered with Bobo's gun, nearly causing his death. Bobo and Kwon agree to work together.  Bobo and Kwon kidnap Baptiste and take him to Bobo's house, where he is forced to give them a flash drive detailing Morel's plans to acquire housing projects and demolish them to build office buildings and reveals Keegan is an ex-mercenary hired to be Morel's enforcer. Afterwards, Bobo shoots him in the head. Keegan and his men trace Baptiste's cellphone to Bobo's house, but Bobo and Kwon are able to escape and detonate a bomb, killing Keegan's men. Keegan escapes and swears revenge on Bobo. Angered at Bobo's methods, Kwon abandons him and continues alone.  Kwon meets with Lieutenant Lebreton to ask for his help, but Lebreton tries to kill him, as he is also on Morel's payroll. Bobo kills him and saves Kwon. Meanwhile, Keegan learns about Lisa and kidnaps her. Morel then calls Bobo and offers to trade Lisa for the flash drive. Bobo agrees, and meets with Morel in an abandoned warehouse, where he delivers the flash drive to him and Lisa is returned to him, while Kwon infiltrates the building to arrest Morel. Keegan becomes furious when Bobo is allowed to leave; he kills Morel and his men before confronting Bobo; they fight until Bobo stabs Keegan in the throat and Kwon shoots him dead from afar.  Kwon retrieves the flash drive and Bobo shoots him in the shoulder to make it appear as if Kwon failed to capture him. Lisa decides to stay with Kwon waiting for the police and Bobo leaves. He later meets Kwon at a bar, where Kwon tells him he did not mention Bobo's involvement to the police this time, but if Bobo continues in the business, Kwon will take him down. Bobo welcomes him to try and drives off into the night.

However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya's real nature to Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.  Surya is released after manipulating Bhardwaj by having his associates kidnap Chitra. He promises to leave crime behind him and asks Bhardwaj for permission to marry Chitra. When they refuse his proposal, he insists to Bhardwaj that he will set up a business which is untouchable by the police, and will eventually marry Chitra. Surya sets up a company named "Surya Exports & Imports" as a front for the organised crime that they indulge in.

Xiao Ai finds several cut-out photos of a girl and her mother inside a wardrobe, while Xiao Xin discovers a [[rag doll]] outside the mansion and takes an instant liking to it. Xiao Ai feels that ever since her son took the doll, the girl who is presumably the owner of the doll terrorizes her and makes Xiao Xin acts unnatural, though he claims that the girl is afraid of her abusive mother. During one of her attempts to write a draft, Xiao Ai finds that a story has been written in her laptop, seemingly by no one, and which updates itself every day. The story matches the tale told by Xiao Xin: a girl who was abused by her mother after her father left them.  Despite repeated attempts to dispose of the doll, it always materializes back and returns to Xiao Xin's possession. The hauntings grow increasingly violent and malevolent, with Xiao Ai becoming even more paranoid and worried because of Xiao Xin's claims about the girl and her mother, until one day, Xiao Xin goes missing. Yinan calls the authorities to search for Xiao Xin. Xiao Ai also learns that the previous occupants of the mansion were a girl and her mother as per the story, and that the mother killed her daughter and herself when she could not take the pains of her husband leaving her. However, a rumor goes that the girl escaped the incident alive and was brought up in an orphanage. During the search, Qi Kun manages to reach the mansion and demands that Xiao Ai tells him the whereabouts of their son until Yinan stops him.

At the mansion, Xiao Ai stumbles upon Qi Kun's researches. It is revealed that the girl who haunts Xiao Ai is in fact Xiao Ai herself and that Xiao Ai, deranged because of her own mother's abuses when she was young, is really the one who had abused Xiao Xin, but her bouts of amnesia meant that the only suspect of the abuses was Qi Kun, even though he only wanted to protect his son. She had also unknowingly wrote the story in her laptop, again because of her amnesia. Xiao Ai is led by her younger self to a secret room behind the wardrobe, where her mother hanged herself years before.

The Cabin in the Woods
  In a [[high tech]] underground facility, senior technicians Sitterson and Hadley discuss plans for a mysterious operation. A similar operation undertaken by their counterparts in [[Stockholm]] has just ended in failure.  Elsewhere, American college students Dana, Holden, Marty, Jules, and Curt are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest, a cabin recently acquired by Curt's cousin. From their underground facility where they possess significant technological control over the area in which the cabin is situated, Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that hinder rational thinking and increase [[libido]]. They take bets from coworkers as to what kind of monster will attack the students and discuss the failures of similar rituals in other nations.  In the cabin's cellar, the group finds many bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites [[incantation]]s from the journal, inadvertently summoning the [[zombie|zombified]] Buckner family despite Marty's warnings. By releasing [[pheromone]]s, Hadley successfully induces Curt and Jules to have sex. Attacked by the marauding Buckner zombies, Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes to alert the group. Marty, a frequent [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smoker, discovers concealed surveillance equipment before being dragged off by one of the Buckners. Later, the facility workers learn that the ritual in Japan has also ended in failure, meaning that the American ritual is humanity's last hope. It becomes apparent that the ritual involves [[blood sacrifice]].  Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their [[recreational vehicle|RV]], but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt jumps a ravine on his motorcycle in an attempt to flee and alert the authorities, only to crash into a [[Force field (fiction)|force field]], killing him. Holden and Dana retreat to the RV to plan their next move, but one of the Buckners, hiding within all along, fatally stabs Holden as they are driving away, resulting in the RV crashing and sinking into a lake. Dana escapes and swims ashore and is beset in turn. As she is attacked, Sitterson, Hadley, and their staff celebrate the successful completion of the ritual, viewing the events from their underground facility. The celebration is interrupted by a phone call pointing out that Marty has survived. His heavy marijuana use has apparently rendered him immune to Sitterson and Hadley's manipulations.  Marty rescues Dana and takes her to a hidden elevator he discovered under a grave. They descend into the underground facility, where a menagerie of monsters are imprisoned. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cabin's cellar and realizes that those items gave victims the opportunity to choose the agents of their own deaths during the ritual. Cornered by the facility's security personnel, she and Marty release the monsters, including [[zombies]], [[goblins]], [[mutants]], [[witches]], [[Ghost|wraiths]], a [[basilisk]], a [[werewolf]], a [[unicorn]], a killer [[robot]], a giant [[snake]], and an [[evil clown]]. They wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed by a [[merman]] and Sitterson escapes to the lower level.  Dana and Marty flee the carnage. Dana accidentally mortally wounds Sitterson, who begs her to kill Marty. Fleeing further, they discover an ancient temple and are confronted by the facility’s leader, known only as The Director. She explains that they are participating in an annual ritual sacrifice to appease the Ancient Ones (described as “giant evil gods”). Each facility’s ritual conforms to the rules of that region’s local lore; in America young people are chosen to be sacrificed based on similarity to certain archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). In order to complete the ritual the whore must die first and [[final girl|the virgin must survive or die last]]. Since all other facilities have failed, the penalty for not completing the ritual is the extermination of the entire human race. Hence, The Director urges Dana to kill Marty. Dana considers, but she is interrupted by a [[werewolf]] attack, while zombie Patience Buckner appears and kills The Director.  Deciding that humanity is not worth saving, Dana and Marty share a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] while awaiting their fate. The temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges, destroying the facility and the cabin itself.

When Eleanor is born in 1804, Clara leaves her at the local private orphanage and secretly visits her at night. Years later, Clara is dying of what appears to be [[tuberculosis]] when the brothel is visited by Darvell, who has become a vampire. He gives Ruthven a map to an island where people can become vampires if they are willing to die. Clara shoots Ruthven in the leg, steals the map and makes her way to the island to become a vampire. Darvell finds Clara and takes her to the Brethren, a secret society of vampires that protects the secret of vampirism.   As their members have traditionally been male nobles, they are appalled that a low-born prostitute has joined their ranks but decide to spare her life, warning her that she must abide by their code but that she may play no part in their Brotherhood. Shortly afterwards, Clara's decision to spare Ruthven comes back to haunt her, when the vengeful, [[syphilis]]-ridden Captain turns up at Eleanor's orphanage and takes her to the attic to rape her. Clara brutally murders him but she is too late; Eleanor is condemned to a slow, painful death. Desperate to save her daughter's life, Clara takes Eleanor to the island and has her transformed into a vampire, violating the Brethren's code. The Brethren begin hunting Clara and Eleanor.  In the 21st century, Eleanor falls in love with Frank and decides to help him turn into a vampire so they can be together, since he is dying from [[leukaemia]]. Before killing him, Clara finds out from Kevin that Eleanor has told Frank of their past. Noel is accidentally killed, falling down the lift shaft, when Clara tries to prevent Eleanor from leaving the hotel and succeeds in trapping her in the lift. While Clara is out dealing with Frank, Darvell and Savella, the Brethren's leader, posing as police, find out from Kevin's colleague Morag where Clara is and go to kill her. Clara leaves without killing Frank when she realises that Eleanor is in mortal danger. The Brethren kidnap Eleanor and drive her to an abandoned fairground to destroy her, only to be stopped by Clara. After killing Morag, Savella battles Clara and ultimately subdues her. Savella hands Darvell his sword (which he [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|took]] from [[Constantinople|Byzantium]] during the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusades]]) so he can kill Clara.

As the election nears, Marty meets with the Motch brothers and learns of their plans to sell Hammond to their Chinese business partner and turn the town into a factory complex. Marty realizes he has been used and rejects the brothers' support, leading them to defect to Cam's side. Marty meanwhile reconciles with his family.  On election day, Cam's victory appears certain until Marty exposes the Motch brothers' intent and promises to preserve Hammond if elected. Cam still wins and remains congressman due to rigged voting machines owned by the Motch brothers. While Cam gloats, Marty shows his large scars to Cam and reveals that he looked up to Cam in school for getting rid of the dangerous slide. Realizing he has strayed from his true objectives as a politician, Cam withdraws from the election and Marty wins by default.

Caroline and Jackie
 The film’s opening credits have a lingering sense of unease to them, which is capitalized on as soon as Caroline and Jackie arrive at the “surprise birthday party” Caroline has planned for Jackie (despite her birthday not being for two months and it actually being Caroline‘s birthday) – where the dynamic between the pair (and Ryan, to some degree) is pushed out to the larger group, ratcheted up by rapid cuts and lingering looks between Jackie’s friends. But it’s not just a surprise dinner party that Caroline has put together – when the group ends up back at Jackie’s place, the real “party” is revealed. It’s an intervention for Jackie, headed up by Caroline, who hopes that she and Jackie’s friends can help her with a variety of issues – anorexia, pill abuse, alcoholism, and even sexual promiscuity.<ref name=filmschoolrejects></ref>  When Jackie inevitably flees the house, much of the tension of the film is deflated, but it does allow deeper character reveals, with Caroline making a move on another intervention attendee (or two), Jackie taking off for a bar, and every one of Jackie’s supposedly worried friends acting less than caring. Clark uses some noticeable and basic plot tricks – pulling people apart and putting them back together, mixing up interactions between different characters, changing locations – but they all serve his aim, which is to slowly unfold the story in a believable way.<ref name="filmschoolrejects"/>  The film sets the sisters up as opposing forces, and a question quickly arises – who is more believable? Is Jackie in denial or is Caroline lying? Is Jackie sick or is Caroline even sicker? Is Jackie coping with alcohol because she’s a drunk or because she needs a stiff one after a terrible night?<ref name="filmschoolrejects"/>

This ignites his passion for the sport.  One morning, Jay ([[Jonny Weston]]), now 15, sees Frosty leaving early and hitches a ride on his van. He sees Frosty and three of his friends riding a gigantic swell known as [[Mavericks (location)|Mavericks]], which with [[El Niño]] coming in will be at its height in three months' time.  Reluctantly, Frosty agrees to teach Jay how to surf Mavericks, but insists that Jay learn about the "foundation pillars of surfing". These involve him learning to paddle board 36 miles across [[Monterey Bay]] (from Santa Cruz to Monterey), treading water for 40 minutes and being able to hold his breath for four minutes.  While training, Frosty encourages Jay to write essays to focus on the task. His first essay is about Kim ([[Leven Rambin]]), his crush, whose dog he saved when he was 8, which caused him to nearly drown. Jay gets closer to Kim as he trains, partially encouraged by Frosty's wife, Brenda ([[Abigail Spencer]]). A few weeks before the biggest swell of the season hits Mavericks, Brenda has a stroke and dies.  A few days later, distraught from Brenda's death, Frosty paddles out into the bay. Jay follows him, and using the knowledge from his training, he helps Frosty back to shore. Frosty realizes that Jay is ready to ride Mavericks.

Frosty gives him a custom-made "big wave gun" (a long surfboard especially designed for riding big waves). Kim reveals her feelings for him and they share a kiss.  Frosty had wanted to keep Mavericks a secret, but Jay's notebook that he had been using for preparation ends up in the hands of his rival Sonny ([[Taylor Handley]]). When Jay and Frosty go to Half Moon Bay, there is a large crowd and boats taking surfers out.  Many of the newcomers wipe out before getting to surf Mavericks.

 The film starts in a desert at night time.  Damyaan's resurrection time has come and he tells his troops that only a man who is pure and strong of heart can release him from the curse. As Damyaan’s evil plan is put into motion, a sage, sensing the upcoming evil, asks God to send someone to prevent this doom brought about by a trap that had been set thousands of years ago. He says that Damyaan can not be released and asks God as to who will save the Earth from the invincible and very dangerous Damyaan.  In Dholakpur, princess Indumathi, Chutki and a few other girls are kidnaped by Mangal Singh. Bheem enters and saves the princess and all the other prisoners. We also see that Jaggu, Bholu, Dholu, Raju, Chutki & Kalia are planning their friend Bheem's secret birthday party while Damyaan, a demon who, centuries ago, was granted immortality by the Book of Magi along with a curse that he would be confined to the city of Sonapur, wants to escape from this confinement and get back his power and kingdom.  Damyaan’s minister Skandi hijacks a convoy headed for Dholakpur and meets King Indravarma as the person sent to deliver the convoy. Bheem notices that something doesn’t feel right with Skandi and the rest of his gang but before he can speak to the King, Skandi tells him about the depleting treasury of Dholakpur and the hidden treasures of Sonapur, thus luring him.  The king agrees to go to the city in search of that hidden treasure. Despite being warned by the gypsies, he starts his journey along with Bheem and his friends. After reaching the city, the king unknowingly sets the demon free through the great demon entrance.  The demon captures the king, Chhota Bheem and his friends in a prison. Chota Bheem manages to set his friends free through his wit and strength. Bheem then meets Santrik, who tells him that the only way to get prisoners free from Damyaan's capture is defeating the demon by destroying the Book of Magi. Then Santrik sends them back in time where the while trying to find the Book of Magi, the Kaalsainiks (the henchmen of Damyaan) figure out that Bheem and his team are not from Sonapur and they don't allow them to enter. A fight ensues, and in the process, Dholu and Bholu are turned into frogs.  Bheem somehow manages to defeat them and dons their clothes along with his friends and enters Sonapur pretending to be a bunch of Kaalsainiks. Soon another group of Kaalsainiks arrive and a sweet shop owner named Gulabchand figures out that Bheem and his team are not Kaalsainiks and manages to save the group. In the process Bheem is badly wounded and faints while passing through the magical door. Upon regaining consciousness, he observes that Dholu and Bholu have regained their respective human forms.  The sage who saves them, Guru Sambhu, tells them that despite being brave and strong, they cannot defeat Damyaan without magic. He then takes them to a magical place and through a song (Jam Jam Jamboora), teaches magic to the group. After completing their class on magic, he provides them with powers: Raju gets a magical bow and arrow which never misses its aim; Chutki gets two magical trees; Jaggu a bunch of magical stinging bananas; Kaalia the power to become invisible; Dholu and Bholu the power to multiply into a hundred Dholus and Bholus and Bheem gets an almost impossible hymn to seize the power of the enemy which was not decoded till date. At night they hear sounds of celebrations, which are of the end of the second term of Damyaan's Kaalkriya (the process of his resurrection), which involves trapping ghosts for their powers in three different rings in three terms by using the hymns given the Book of Magi. Bheem and his team are teleported to Damyaan’s castle. Using their respective powers, they manage to seize the first ring, but while seizing the second ring, Kaalia activates a trap which covers them in a strange gas. Upon recovering, Bheem comes to know that they have been captured by Damyaan.  Damyaan tells Bheem that in an hour it will be Bheem’s birthday and that he has decided to give him a "birthday gift"- watching his friends die. In an instant, Bheem decodes the hymn and releases his friends.  They fight and defeat the Kaalsainiks while Bheem challenges Damyaan to fight without magic. Damyaan then transforms into his powerless form, a Naag (snake) with an ambition of ruling the world. Bheem eventually beats up Damyaan in his trademark "jump and kick and punch" style and eventually destroys him and all the existing Kaalsainiks.  On his birthday, Guru Sambhu, who is the rightful king of Sonapur, decides to proclaim Bheem as the next king while Bheem refuses, saying that "I am not the prince of Sonapur, but Bheem of Dholakpur" while Raju comments on the dialogue saying that it is "a real hero's talk". Before teleporting the group back to Dholakpur, Guru Sambhu turns a badly scared Skandi, who was found by Gulabchand while hiding in his sweets, into a mouse. Dholu and Bholu further punish him by chasing him dressed as snakes.  Then Bheem and his team return to the future to Dholakpur, only to realise that the whole of Dholakpur has fixed a grand party for its hero, Chhota Bheem.<ref name="Bolly Spice Chhota Bheem and the Curse of Damyaan" /><ref name="IBNLive Review: Chhota Bheem and the Curse of Damyaan"></ref>

Chittagong (film)
 The story is set against the backdrop of a little-known saga in 1930s [[British colonial India]]'s [[East Bengal]] (now Bangladesh) where a group of schoolboys and young women, led by a schoolteacher Masterda [[Surya Sen]] ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]), dared to take on the Empire. ''Chittagong'' is the story of a diffident 14-year-old boy, Jhunku (Delzad Hiwale). Swept up into this seemingly impossible mission, the reluctant teenager battles with self-doubts to achieve an improbable triumph.  Jhunku, now a 23-year-old youth, is being chased by the Bengal police. He hides himself in a bunker with his childhood friend Aparna (Apu/Opu). While hiding, he begins to reflect on his past hopes and dreams. The story goes to a flashback to narrate the events that happened 10 years ago.  In 1930, Surya Sen and his followers are protesting the death of the revolutionary Jatin Das. Jhunku is not allowed to join them by his lawyer father who wants him to study in England. Apart from fearing his father, Jhunku is also torn between his admiration and respect for the magistrate, Wilkinson [[Barry John]] and his wife, who show great likings for him and his fascination for the charismatic figure of Masterda, who is followed and revered by most of his friends. Jhunku, due to his faith in Wilkinson who is personally against torturing revolutionaries, has great belief in British justice and believes that by getting an English education he might better equip himself to free his country. This causes arguments between him and his friends, especially Aparna. Wilkinson is opposed by the police inspector Major Johnson who defies his orders and arrests the protesters, and badly tortures Masterda.  In protest, some students hit the strict police officer Maj. Johnson ([[Alexx O'Nell]]) by spilling oil under his motorbike, making him fall. Enraged, Johnson makes random enquiries about the culprits but are unsuccessful. However, Wilkinson manages to confirm the truth out of Jhunku, and an enraged Johnson then shoots Sukhen (Shaheb Bhattacharya), one of the boys involved. This incident makes Jhunku an outcast amongst his friends, and he becomes determined to avenge the death of Sukhen. Soon afterwards, Johnson is made the DIG of police although Wilkinson had requested his transfer. This incident further shocks Jhunku. All his faith on his tutor Sir Wilkinson is lost, and he joins Masterda's army.  Masterda and his comrades Nirmal Sen ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]), Loknath Bal ([[Rajkummar Rao]]), Ambika Chakraborthy ([[Dibyendu Bhattacharya]]) and Ananta Singh ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]) train the 50-odd students and plan to capture the town of [[Chittagong]] on 18 April 1930 by disconnecting all modes of communication. As per plan, the armoury of the police is captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and revolutionaries, led by Lokenath Baul takes over the Auxiliary Force armoury. Unfortunately the machine guns are not located. The revolutionaries also dislocate telephone and telegraph communications and disrupt the movement of the trains. After the successful raids, all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen takes a military salute, hoisting the national flag and proclaims a provisional revolutionary government. The whole town is overjoyed at the success of Indian Republican Army and Chittagong is officially conquered by Surya Sen and his boys for one day. However, reinforcements from Calcutta soon set out to capture the rebels. Knowing of the army attack, the revolutionaries leave town before dawn and march towards the Jalalabad hill ranges, looking for a safe place. But the British Army's first wave is demolished by Masterda's teenagers. This enrages the British and they bring in machine guns. Harish, the younger brother of Lokenath and a friend of Jhunku, dies.  Soon after revolutionaries disperse in smaller groups, to nearby villages. Ahsanullah Khan (Anurag Arora) from CID comes to Chittagong and cracks down on the revolutionaries. Jhunku is arrested and is severely beaten by Johnson and Ahsanullah during interrogation; he refuses to betray his leaders and comrades. He is sentenced to Kaala-Paani for life imprisonment. In due course, many revolutionaries and police officials are killed in the gun fights including noted revolutionary Nirmal Sen and police CID chief Ahsanullah. However, Pritilata Waddedar successfully attacks the European Club and assassinates DIG Johnson; being gravely wounded she commits suicide by swallowing cyanide.  After a prolonged search, police search and arrests Master Da Surya Sen and sentences him to death by hanging. Thus Jhunku ends narrating the part and says that he was released in 1939 and again participated in the uprisings with Aparna. In one such incident there is a plan to attack the government godowns where the Britishers and feudal landlords have kept common peasant's grain. The British block all the roads to godowns leading Jhunku to an idea to create underground dungeons till the granaries. Twenty villages join hands and operate. The last scene shows Jhunku being stopped by Maj. Wilkinson who says he is still sympathetic to Jhunku and wants him to go away else he will be bound to arrest him once again. Jhunku signals to Wilkinson that everyone is awake and shows him the mass crowd arising from the dungeons and heading towards the government granaries that forces Wilkinson to retreat. This is named the [[Tebhaga movement|Tebagha Uprising]] of 1945, which marked the end of British Raj in India. The film ends with the memorable song "Ishaan."

At school, Andrew is frequently bullied by his classmates.  Andrew's cousin Matt Garetty (Russell) invites him to a party to help him mingle with some people, but his filming causes an altercation with an attendee and he leaves disappointed. He is persuaded by popular student Steve Montgomery  (Jordan) to record something strange that he and Matt have found in the woods. The trio enter a hole in the ground, where they hear a loud strange noise and discover a large glowing blue crystalline object which turns red, and gives them painful nosebleeds. As the crystalline object begins to react violently, the camera cuts out. Weeks later, Andrew, Matt, and Steve record themselves as they display [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities, but begin bleeding from their noses when they overexert themselves. They develop a close friendship and begin using their abilities to play pranks, but when Andrew telekinetically pushes a rude motorist off the road and into a river, Matt insists that they restrict the use of their powers, particularly against living things.  After discovering themselves being capable of flight, they agree to fly around the world together after graduation. Andrew wants to visit [[Tibet]] because of its peaceful nature. Steve encourages him to enter the school talent show to gain popularity, and Andrew agrees. Andrew amazes his fellow students by disguising his powers as an impressive magic act. After the show, Andrew, Matt and Steve celebrate at a house party where Andrew becomes the center of attention. After drinking with his classmate Monica, she and Andrew go upstairs to have sex, but he vomits on her, humiliating both of them.  As time goes on, Andrew becomes increasingly withdrawn and aggressive. When Richard attacks and slaps Andrew during a fight, Andrew violently repels his father's attack, injuring Richard. His outburst is so extreme that it inflicts psychically connected nosebleeds on Steve and Matt. While Matt ignores the nosebleed, Steve flies up to Andrew in the middle of a storm and tries to console him. However, Andrew grows increasingly frustrated, and Steve is suddenly struck by lightning and killed. At Steve's funeral, Matt confronts Andrew about the suspicious cause of Steve's death. While Andrew denies responsibility to Matt, he privately begs for forgiveness at Steve's grave.  Andrew grows distant from Matt and again finds himself ostracized at school. After a bully at school mocks Andrew for vomiting on Monica, Andrew uses his powers to forcefully extract three teeth out of the bully's mouth, causing him to bleed extensively and horrifying the other students. Andrew begins to identify himself as an [[apex predator]], rationalizing that he should not feel guilt for using his powers to hurt those weaker than him. With his mother’s condition deteriorating, Andrew disguises himself using Richard's firefighter gear, where he plans to steal the money for her medication. After mugging a local gang, he robs a gas station; when the distracted owner notices the theft and holds him at gunpoint with a shotgun, Andrew telekinetically grabs the shotgun, which discharges into a [[propane]] tank, causing an explosion that leaves Andrew in the hospital with severe burns and under police investigation. At his bedside, his father informs the unconscious Andrew that his mother has died, and he angrily blames Andrew for her death. As his father is about to strike him, Andrew awakens and the wall of his hospital room explodes, again injuring Richard.  At a birthday party, Matt experiences a nosebleed and senses Andrew is in trouble. He and his girlfriend, Casey, go to the hospital, where Andrew is floating outside. After saving Richard when Andrew attempts to throw him to his death from a high floor of the hospital, Matt confronts his cousin at the [[Space Needle]] and tries to reason with him, but Andrew grows hostile and irrational at any perceived attempt to control him. Andrew attacks Matt and the pair fight across the city, crashing through buildings and hurling vehicles. When police shoot Matt in the arm, Andrew throws dozens of police - and their cars - through the air, and then uses his powers to destroy the buildings around him, threatening hundreds of lives. Unable to get through to his cousin and left with no other choice, Matt reluctantly uses his powers to impale Andrew with a spear from a nearby statue, killing him. The police surround Matt, after which he awakens and flies away.  Later, Matt lands in Tibet with Andrew's camera. Speaking to the camera while addressing Andrew, Matt tearfully apologizes to his cousin and states that he knows Andrew isn't a bad person. Matt vows to use his powers for good and to find out what happened to them in the hole. He positions the camera to view a Tibetan monastery in the distance before flying away, leaving the camera behind.

As Martin returns to his car, he is sniped and killed by Gorman ([[Joseph Mawle]]). Will retrieves Martin's phone as Gorman starts shooting at him and gives chase. As Will escapes, he takes a call from the kidnappers, who want to speak to "Tom", providing a 21 hour deadline and a meeting point to exchange the briefcase for his family.  Receiving no help from the US embassy, Will is picked up by Carrack in a car outside, but he realizes she is untrustworthy and gets away. Will arranges a meeting with his father's friend Diego at his office and meets receptionist Lucia Caldera ([[Verónica Echegui]]), Diego's niece, where he fights off one of Carrack's men. The pair go to Diego's apartment, but he was killed by Carrack and Gorman. Will and Lucia escape across the rooftops, but Will is shot. Lucia takes him to a nightclub, to a friend who has medical experience that cauterizes the wound. Lucia informs Will that "Tom" is Martin's alias in Spain, and she is Will's half sister, being Martin's daughter by another woman. As Will arrives at the meeting point, he is grabbed and tortured for his father's whereabouts by the kidnappers, actually Israeli Mossad agents lead by Zahir, who was using the briefcase to lure a traitor when Martin stole it from them. They realize Carrack framed Martin and she has the briefcase, so they want Will to lure her out. Will briefly sees his family before Zahir releases him.  Will meets Lucia at the nightclub, where she starts a tab on Carrack's credit card. Gorman appears and is subdued by bouncers at the nightclub and tortured for information but he refuses to budge. Will lets Gorman escape so he can follow him, leading them to Carrack, who tries to sell the briefcase in an underground car park. Zahir's men surround the deal but give away their position, so Carrack starts attacking and escapes, during which Lucia kills Gorman in a car crash. Will and Lucia pursue Carrack through Madrid, until eventually their cars collide and Lucia is seriously injured. Just as Carrack is about to shoot Will, she is killed by Zahir, who retrieves the briefcase and releases Will's family. Lucia recovers in hospital, surrounded by her half family.

Cockneys vs Zombies
 In a building site being developed by Hartman Construction in the [[East End of London]], two builders discover a 17th-century catacomb, sealed by order of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. When they enter to search for treasure, they are bitten by zombies, setting off a zombie outbreak in the area.  Elsewhere, Terry MacGuire and his younger brother Andy have planned a bank robbery so they can save their grandfather Ray's [[retirement home]] from being demolished. They recruit their cousin Katy, hopeless Davey Tuppence, "Mental" Mickey, an unstable war veteran who has a metal plate in his forehead, and gather a large supply of weapons. During the robbery, the group find they have crashed an embezzlement deal between the bank manager and the head of Hartman Construction. Expecting to find a few hundred grand, they find themselves staring at 2.5 million pounds in cash. The bank manager had thought they were from Hartman due to their costumes, but quickly realises otherwise and presses an emergency button to summon the police. With the bank surrounded, Mickey takes charge of the escape plan and takes bank workers Emma and Clive hostage. However, upon attempting to leave the bank, the group find that the police have been killed by a growing horde of zombies. They escape in their van with the cash from the vault.  Meanwhile, at the retirement home, the zombies attack the residents. Ray and residents Peggy, former gangster Daryl, Doreen and Eric take refuge in the kitchen; Ray also rescues a resident named Hamish and gets him inside.  The MacGuires, Katy, Mickey, Davey and their hostages drive through a devastated East End until they reach their safe-house, where they stowed their car earlier. Mickey is bitten by a zombie, and the group finds out from the radio about the extent of the epidemic but don't know what to do with themselves. Emma pleads with Mickey and Davey to let her and Clive go, saying she does not care about their 'selfish' plans, and Katy tells her they are not robbing the bank for themselves, but to save the retirement home.  Mickey, growing more irrational and tired of the friendliness of his fellow bank robbers, decides to leave and takes Emma and Clive with him to a side-room where he ties them up, and sits down to rest. Soon after, Mickey dies and turns into a zombie. Realising shooting him in the head is failing to kill Mickey, Terry destroys him with a hand-grenade he confiscated earlier. In the subsequent confusion, Clive picks up Mickey's gun and insists on handing the group over to the police. However, he is promptly attacked and eaten by zombies, and reflexively shoots Davey dead by accident in the process.   The group pack the money and themselves into Terry's waiting car, intending to travel to the retirement home, but on the way they stop to look for Emma's younger sister. Terry and Emma find her as a zombie, but Emma decides not to kill her in case a cure is found. They set off again, deciding to arm themselves from Mickey's gun cache. However, the group realise that the car is inadequate for ferrying the pensioners, so Katy hot-wires a traditional red London [[double-decker bus]].  Arriving at the care home, they manage to break the zombie siege and rescue Ray and the other surviving residents. They all escape aboard the bus, but it breaks down before it can reach safety and the group are forced to abandon it. Realising they are close to the river, they head off to find a boat. Making their way to a mooring they find a boat, and Peggy finds the keys, but they realise as they try to pull away that it is still chained up. Ray decides to sacrifice himself to save the others, but he still manages to survive and joins the rest on the boat as they make their final escape. On the river, the group wonder what will happen next; Ray tells them they can take East London back for themselves.

After suffering nightmares of his torture from the Collector, he is approached by Lucello, an employee of Elena's wealthy father, who has hired a team of mercenaries to hunt the Collector down and save Elena.

Later, Elena and Lucello reunite, rescue Paz, and find Abby, who asks to escape with them. Abby later tries to provide information of the group's location to the Collector before being killed. As police converge at the hotel, attracted to gunshots fired by Arkin, the Collector again kidnaps Elena. Lucello is caught in a trap and has to be left behind. Arkin and Paz find Elena strapped to an autopsy table, but when they approach, they are trapped in a cage that falls from above. The Collector appears and threatens to burn down the building, but Arkin manages to open the cage by having Elena re-break his arm so that he can reach the latch.  The group escapes and finds an exit door to the building, but it is jammed from the outside. The Collector appears again, kills Paz, and easily beats Arkin in a fist fight, thanks to the latter's broken arm. As the Collector is about to kill Arkin, Lucello intervenes, having escaped from his trap, and sacrifices himself so that Arkin can gain the upper hand. Arkin beats the Collector, throws him down a chute, and sets it on fire. As the building burns down, the firefighters hear Elena's screams and open the door from the outside, allowing Elena and Arkin to escape. As the two sit outside, Arkin notices a pile of trunks and, upon searching inside them, finds the Collector's burned mask with no corpse.  Sometime later, Arkin manages to track down the Collector's house by researching every registered [[Entomology|entomologist]] within a 200-mile radius of their last encounter.

When the Collector tries to attack him, Arkin forces him into the red trunk and locks him inside.

Cold War (2012 film)
 One midnight, a [[Hong Kong Police Force]] Emergency Unit (EU) van carrying advanced equipment and five police officers goes missing. As the police investigate the case, they became aware that the terrorists possess detailed knowledge of the police's procedures and have planned several steps ahead, even possibly breaching the secured police network. As the [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|Commissioner]] is away, Deputy Commissioner M.B. Lee ([[Tony Leung Ka-fai]]), plans and leads a rescue operation code-named "Cold War," and declares Hong Kong to go under a state of emergency.  After being repeatedly misled by the terrorists and failing to track them down, fellow Deputy Commissioner Sean Lau ([[Aaron Kwok]]) believes Lee is acting too rashly, due to one of the five abducted policemen being his own son, Joe Lee ([[Eddie Peng]]). After consulting with superintendent Vincent Tsui ([[Chin Kar-lok]]) and Albert Kwang ([[Gordon Lam]]), who both believe Lee is taking measures too extreme, Lau relieves Lee of his command and assumes command of Operation Cold War.  Lau plans to negotiate with the terrorists while secretly tracking them to their hide-out. The terrorists asks Lau to prepare a ransom equal to the calculated value of the policemen and the EU van. As the police force prepare the cash, the terrorists call again and say they only want roughly half of it, and for Lau to personally deliver the money. At the request of the bank manager, Lau takes only enough for the ransom and have the rest delivered back to the bank. When Lau eventually arrives at the meeting location, he is ordered to stop the car immediately and throw the cash down a bridge, causing a traffic blockage. In the confusion, Lau is attacked by the terrorists, and superintendent Tsui was killed in action in the crossfire. The terrorists escape, while superintendent Kwang notifies Lau that the terrorists simultaneously intercepted the other half of the money that was supposed to be returned to the bank. However, the police force did successfully rescue the missing policemen at a different location.  Lau attempts to question the bank manager, but the manager was then killed by a car bomb. Superintendent Kwang investigates the bombing to track the bombers, but is instead led into a trap and killed with his team. Lau suspects that the terrorists were aided by insiders in the force, but before he can investigate any further, he is arrested by [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] Officer Billy Cheung ([[Aarif Rahman]]), who received leaked information from an anonymous source about Operation Cold War. Lau is interrogated by Cheung, who accuses him of poorly handling the rescue operation, leading to the loss of the ransom money which he secretly took for himself. Lau denies this, and the ICAC fail to find evidence against him. Cheung makes some further investigations and discovers that the police Commissioner will be stepping down in two years, and thus either Lee or Lau will receive a promotion. Lau has the support of the Security Secretary because of his skillful management of the police's finances. On the other hand, Lee rose through the ranks from Constable and has the support of the front-line officers including the CID. Cheung now suspects that Lee is trying to use the failure of Operation Cold War to ruin Lau's chance for promotion.  The ICAC eventually discover, based on forensic evidence, that Joe Lee was the mastermind behind the abduction of the EU van. Lau presents this information to Lee, and reveals that it was Lau himself that leaked information to the ICAC (who has the power to act independent to the police force), in order to borrow their resources to investigate the case, thus not alerting the insider. Lee confronts his son, who reveals that he planned this with other associates from the police force who wanted to see Lee rise to the position of Commissioner. Seeing that Joe is unrepentant and unwilling to reveal anymore, Lee reluctantly shoots and arrest him. The following day, Lee and the current Commissioner announce their plans to retire, nominates Lau as the next Commissioner, and congratulate Lau on his resourcefulness on solving the case.  The film ends with Lau receiving a mysterious phone call from the terrorists, who announces that they have kidnapped his wife, and wants Joe Lee released in return.

Ben learns that Mimi Lurie ([[Julie Christie]]), an accomplice in the Michigan bank robbery, was last seen in Canada. A private investigator helps Ben find out that Jim had no Social Security number prior to 1979 and finds a copy of Jim Grant's California death certificate. Ben concludes that Jim is really Nick Sloan, another former Weatherman, and writes an article breaking this news, creating a sensation and accelerating the FBI's interest.  Meanwhile, Jim and Isabel arrive in New York City. They go sight-seeing and check into a fancy hotel. The manhunt for Jim/Nick is now national news. While Isabel is sleeping, Jim leaves the room key hidden in the hotel lobby, where his brother, Daniel Sloan ([[Chris Cooper]]), retrieves it. FBI agents, under the direction of Diana's boss Cornelius ([[Terrence Howard]]), have been tracking Daniel and follow him to the hotel. They nearly catch Jim there, but Jim creates a diversion and escapes. Sharon Solarz refuses to provide any information to the FBI, but she agrees to talk to Ben. She is unrepentant about her radical activism in the Weather Underground; she reveals that Nick and Mimi had a love affair long ago. Ben also questions Daniel and writes a gratuitously unflattering piece about him, annoying Ben's boss.  Jim/Nick goes to [[Milwaukee]] to find Donal ([[Nick Nolte]]), his old best friend, who now owns a lumber yard. Donal discourages him from looking for Mimi, but tells him to contact former [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] member, history professor Jed Lewis ([[Richard Jenkins]]). Jed resents the Weather Underground's role in splintering the antiwar left. He initially refuses to help Jim, but when he finds out that Jim has a young daughter, he uses his connections with their old radical friends to track down Mimi. At [[Big Sur]], California, Mimi imports marijuana into the U.S. aboard a sailboat as part of a big operation run by Mac McLeod ([[Sam Elliott]]), Mimi's boyfriend. Through Jed, Jim reaches Mac, who informs him that Mimi left to go "inland". Jim knows where she is going.  Ben begins to feel that Jim's actions make no sense for a guilty man. Defying his boss, he goes to Michigan to investigate the original crime. He meets with retired cop Henry Osborne ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), who was the first person to investigate the robbery. Osborne refuses to talk in front of his adopted daughter Rebecca ([[Brit Marling]]), and Ben realizes that he is hiding something important. Ben does some research, finding that Osborne had strong connections to Mimi's family before the bank robbery. He learns of the Linder-Lurie company property on the Michigan [[upper peninsula]] near Ontario, Canada. Osborne acknowledges that if Mimi were to come forward with the information that Jim was not present at the robbery (although Jim's car was used during it), Jim would be cleared of all charges. Later, Ben flirts with Osborne's daughter Rebecca.  Jim and Mimi meet in a secluded cabin on the Linder-Lurie property; she is still passionate about the goals of the Weathermen and unapologetic about her actions 30 years earlier, but Jim argues that life has changed. Jim asks Mimi to turn herself in and confirm his alibi, for the sake of his daughter, Isabel. He doesn’t want to leave Isabel behind and repeat the mistake that he and Mimi made 30 years earlier by giving up their own daughter. Mimi reveals that she saw their daughter recently in [[Ann Arbor]], and that she is a beautiful young woman now. Meanwhile, Ben realizes that Jim is searching for Mimi, who can clear him of the charges, and that Rebecca is their daughter. He tells Rebecca to speak to her father.  The next morning, Mimi flees the cabin to sail to Canada just as Ben arrives at the Linder-Lurie property to find Jim. Ben tells Jim that he knows the truth about Rebecca and Osborne; Jim says that Ben must now decide whether to reveal it or keep the secret. Jim leaves the cabin so that the FBI will chase him instead of Mimi. Cornelius catches Jim, and soon afterwards Rebecca learns of the circumstances of her adoption. Meanwhile, Mimi turns her boat around and returns to the U.S. to give herself up. The next day, Jim is freed from jail and reunites with Isabel. Ben decides not to expose Osborne's actions of 30 years before and to protect Rebecca's true identity.  
The Comedy
 Swanson (Tim Heidecker) is an upper class New Yorker who alternately feels apathy and resentment to his surroundings.  He lives on a boat and spends his time partying and wandering around the city with his [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] friends, humorlessly lampooning and mocking various strangers they encounter.  As of the beginning of the film, Swanson's father is comatose, and he is set to inherit his estate, as his brother is in rehab.  The film has no clear narrative, instead showing individual scenes of Swanson's behavior as he improvises in situations to make strangers and acquaintances uncomfortable.  Swanson and his friends ridicule one man, Cargill (Jeff Jensen), who shows vulnerability while saying they are important to him.  Cargill continues hanging out with them regardless.  Swanson takes a girl onto his boat from a party, and becomes fascinated with pulling on her eyelids later when she is sleeping.  He visits a bar in a poor neighborhood with a primarily African American customer base, flaunts his wealth, and eagerly predicts the bar will soon be [[Gentrification|gentrified]].  At one point, Swanson pays a cab driver 400 dollars to let him drive, then speeds recklessly and harasses a woman from the driver's seat, leaving the cabbie to deal with the fallout.  On a whim, Swanson takes a part-time job as a dishwasher.  His extremely sarcastic sense of humor attracts a waitress, who he takes onto his boat.  While undressing, she suffers a seizure, which Swanson observes with vague interest.  Swanson's friend Van (Eric Wareheim) shows the group a slide show of photos from his childhood interspersed with pornographic images as a gag.  Despite some initial laughs, the group falls silent and everyone appears saddened, including Van, who solemnly continues the slide show.  In the final scene of the film, Swanson visits the beach, where he plays in the water with a young child, an activity he seems to genuinely enjoy.

Compliance (film)
 Sandra, manager of a ChickWich fast food restaurant, receives a call from someone identifying himself as Officer Daniels. He claims to be in contact with the regional manager about a customer whose purse was allegedly robbed by an employee that day. Daniels claims that he is searching the suspect's residence, but will remain on the phone while Sandra detains the employee until the police arrive. Sandra identifies Becky as the suspect based on the description; Daniels confirms the name.  Sandra brings Becky to the restaurant office with another employee, Marti. She denies the theft. At Daniels' behest, Sandra searches Becky's pockets and purse and finds nothing. Telling her that the alternative is to have Becky go to jail, Daniels has her strip-search Becky. Daniels tells Sandra that he and other officers are searching Becky's home on suspicion that her brother is involved in drugs, and that Becky may be involved. He has Sandra put Becky's clothes into a bag and take it to her car for inspection by the police.  Sandra insists she resume managing the restaurant as it is busy. After Daniels stipulates that a male employee watch Becky for "security reasons", another employee, Kevin, is brought in, but questions Daniels' instructions and leaves. Sandra's fiancé Van takes over; under pressure from Daniels over the beers he drank before driving to the restaurant, he has Becky perform nude jumping jacks to "shake loose" any contraband concealed in her body. After Becky protests, Daniels has Van spank her. Eventually, Becky is coerced into performing oral sex on Van. Van leaves with guilt and is replaced by the custodian, Harold, who is outraged by Daniels' instructions. Harold tells Sandra about Daniels' orders; she calls the regional manager, who tells her he has no idea about any investigation.  The police discover that a similar incident happened elsewhere. Daniels is identified by closed circuit recordings and arrested; he is a family man working as a telemarketer. Becky meets an attorney to discuss options for suing Sandra. Sandra, now unemployed and no longer seeing Van, tells a journalist she is a blameless victim.

Contraband (2012 film)
 Chris Farraday ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) is an ex-[[smuggler]] who now has a peaceful life with his wife, Kate ([[Kate Beckinsale]]), and their two sons in [[New Orleans]]. They learn that Kate's brother Andy ([[Caleb Landry Jones]]) was smuggling drugs, but dropped them into the [[Mississippi River]] during a surprise inspection by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].  Andy's boss, mobster Tim Briggs ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]), threatens to kill Chris' family if Andy doesn't pay him back $700,000. Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney ([[Ben Foster]]), who now owns a legitimate construction company. Promising Kate he will not run drugs, Chris joins a cargo ship, planning to buy $10,000,000 in fake bills in [[Panama]] and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, his good friend Danny Raymer ([[Lukas Haas]]), and gets help from crew mates. After Briggs breaks into Chris' house and intimidates his wife and children, Kate moves into Sebastian's house for safety.  In [[Panama]], Chris discovers that the only one who can provide high quality fake bills is crime lord Gonzalo ([[Diego Luna]]). Leaving Andy in the van with the money for the fake bills, Chris meets with Gonzalo to negotiate. Briggs calls Andy, threatens to kill one of Chris' sons and forces him to take the money and buy cocaine. With the money gone, Chris and Danny agree to help Gonzalo rob an armored car in exchange for the fake bills. After a shootout in which Gonzalo's group along with numerous police and security officers get killed, they successfully steal a Jackson Pollock painting that resembles a splattered tarp. Chris and Danny barely make it back to the ship with the fake bills and the painting. They drive the van with contraband into a container, which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris hits and berates Andy for using the money to buy cocaine, but apologizes when Andy explains the reason.  It is revealed that Sebastian is working with Briggs, and he desperately needs money to pay gangster Jim Church ([[David O'Hara]]). Sebastian calls Chris and learns that Chris plans to get rid of the cocaine Andy bought. Sebastian instructs Briggs to threaten Kate. Through Kate, Briggs warns Chris not to dump the cocaine. Chris realizes that Sebastian has betrayed him. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp ([[J. K. Simmons]]), with whom he has a partnership. He tells Camp of Chris' smuggled contraband, and promises him a share if he secures it. Unable to get Chris to give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to inspect the ship in New Orleans. The Customs agents find the container with Chris' van, which is empty except for the paint splattered tarp, which they ignore.  Once Chris is on shore, Briggs and his thugs demand the drug package. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's carpet cleaner and retrieves the cocaine from it. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs's group and Camp are arrested for possession of the cocaine.  Warned by Chris, Kate leaves Sebastian's house. When she goes back to retrieve some personal items, Sebastian gets angry with her and accidentally pushes her against a bathtub. Thinking she is dead, he dumps her (unconscious) body in a yet to be poured foundation at one of his construction sites. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and manages to locate and save Kate by calling her cellphone. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison, where he is greeted by a lynch mob.  Danny retrieves the fake bills, which were dumped into the Mississippi River by Chris before docking in New Orleans. At a U.S. Customs auction, Andy buys the escape van earlier confiscated from the cargo ship, and finds the painting still in it. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake currency and asks about the missing Jackson Pollock. Chris learns the painting can be [[fence (criminal)|fenced]] for over $20 million on the black market. The film ends with Chris, Kate, Andy and the boys beginning a new life in a waterfront house.  
Confession of Murder
 Choi Hyeong-goo ([[Jung Jae-young]]) is a detective who was in charge of hunting down a serial killer who claimed the lives of 10 women from 1986 to 1990, and whom Choi suspects is responsible for the kidnapping and possible murder of another. He managed to hunt down the killer, but lost him after a fierce fight that left Choi nearly dead and permanently scarred. Before the killer vanished however, Choi managed to shoot him in the shoulder.  The film begins in 2005, on the day the 15-year [[statute of limitations]]<ref></ref> expired, thus rendering prosecution impossible. Choi is now an alcoholic, haunted by his failure to solve the case. He suddenly receives a worrying call from Jung Hyun-sik (Ryoo Je-seung) a family member of one of the victims. Choi rushes to his apartment, only to see Jung throw himself off a roof and land through the windshield of a passing bus.  Two years later, Choi is alerted to the news that a man called Lee Doo-seok ([[Park Si-hoo]]) has released a book titled ''I Am the Murderer'', claiming responsibility for the murders that took place 17 years ago. His book contains detailed descriptions of the murders, and he even displays a wound in his shoulder where he says Choi shot him, with the bullet still lodged there. His book becomes a bestseller because of the author’s charming looks and his claims of repentance for his crimes. He stages public visits to the homes of family members to beg for forgiveness, and even visits Choi at his precinct. Choi himself however, insists that Lee is in fact an imposter.  As the media frenzy surrounding Lee increases, some family members of the victims gather together to plot their revenge. They are led by Han Ji-soo ([[Kim Young-ae]]), whose daughter Kang Soo-yeon was the still-missing 11th victim. Snakes are released into Lee's hotel swimming pool during his daily swim, resulting in him getting bitten. The family members then pose as a paramedic unit sent to take Lee to the hospital. They are discovered and pursued by members of Lee's security unit as well as Choi, but manage to get away with an unconscious Lee after a lengthy and dangerous car chase.  Choi recognizes who the kidnappers are, but refuses to reveal his suspicions. Instead he goes out of his way to track down where Lee is being held, and stages a daring rescue, much to the consternation of the family members. He leaves Lee in a motel room with a note telling him to not make a fuss about the incident if he valued his life. Lee for his part tells the media that the kidnappers were a group of overzealous fans and that he will not press charges.  A television station then invites both Choi and Lee to be on a debate show to discuss the case. A daughter of one of the victims decides to head to the station to kill Lee when he comes out of the studio. During the show, a man calling himself J calls in to speak to Lee, and reveals that he knows many personal facts about Choi. J then drops a bombshell, saying that he is in fact the real killer.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Choi then goes to trace the call, while Lee himself is shot when he leaves the studio, resulting in him being hospitalized again.  The phone call is traced to Choi's mother's house, where J has left a video tape containing footage of the 11th victim Soo-yeon being tied up and later killed. It is then revealed that she was also Choi's girlfriend. Upon analyzing the contents of the tape, Choi calls for a press conference to tell the public that despite all this, it cannot be determined whether Lee or J is the killer.  Lee continues to insist that he is the real killer, and another television debate is arranged between him, Choi and J to settle the matter once and for all. The debate draws thousands of protestors and fans, as well as Han Ji-soo, who carries a pen filled with snake venom, intent upon using it on the real killer.  J arrives and it immediately becomes apparent that he is in fact the killer, as he arranged for a camera crew to be led to the remains of his final victim, Soo-yeon. Confronted with this, Lee then makes his own revelation, admitting that not only is he not the killer, but that he also did not write the book. In fact, it was Choi who wrote the book in an attempt to flush out the real killer, using his own detailed knowledge of the crimes. Lee turns out to be Jung Hyun-sik, who worked together with Choi to fake his own death and who underwent plastic surgery to assume a new identity.  Although surprised at the elaborate scheme, J claims that Choi cannot do anything to him, as the statute of limitations has long expired. Choi then plays the tape of Soo-yeon, revealing that a radio broadcast in the background proves that the footage was shot almost to that exact date in 1992, and that in fact he still has 14 minutes until the statute of limitations truly expires.  J then admits that he kept Soo-yeon with him for two years, and that when he finally decided to kill her, she claimed to be carrying his child in the vain hope that he would spare her. This enrages Choi so much that he attempts to kill J, but J makes an escape, leading to another intense chase scene.  Choi finally catches up to J, and is stopped from killing him just in time. Both Lee/Jang and Han Ji-soo try to kill J as he is being led away in handcuffs, but it ends up being Choi who stabs him with the poisoned pen, thus avenging all the victims and preventing any of the family members from being convicted of the crime.  The film ends five years later in 2012, when Choi is released from jail to be greeted by the media and the grateful group of victim's family members. It is also mentioned that because of this case, the statute of limitations was extended to 25 years.  
The Concubine (film)
 Set during the early [[Joseon Dynasty]], the film begins with a [[concubine]] of the previous king (Park Ji-young) in a precarious position of having no blood ties to her step son, the current childless, widow king ([[Jung Chan]]). She schemes to replace him on the throne with her submissive young son Sung-won ([[Kim Dong-wook]]). Indifferent to his mother’s plans, the timid prince falls in love at first sight with Hwa-yeon ([[Jo Yeo-jeong]]), an aristocrat’s daughter, who has already found love with Kwon-yoo ([[Kim Min-joon]]), a low-born commoner. When her father ([[Ahn Suk-hwan]]) must send her to the royal palace as a concubine for the king, the two lovers try to [[elope]] but are caught after their first night together. Hwa-yeon agrees to enter the palace in exchange for saving Kwon-yoo's life.  Five years later, Hwa-yeon has become the Queen from giving birth to a son. Sung-won comes back from traveling to see the King upon hearing of his ill-health. In a private conversation, Sung-won gifts a hair stick to Hwa-yeon as a present and confession of his feelings.   The king dies of a mysterious illness, and the former concubine sits her son, Prince Sung-won, on the throne as a puppet king, naming herself Regent and Queen Mother and taking firm control over the royal court. Hwa-yeon is moved to a closely watched, humble residence, where she is under surveillance constantly. When Hwa-yeon's father, a royal court minister, attempts to prove that the previous king died from poisonous assassination, he and all of the ministers disloyal to the queen mother are arrested for treason.   Hwa-yeon discovers her former lover, Kwon-yoo, working in the castle among the [[eunuchs]]. Initially glad to see him, she reaches out for comfort and assistance, hoping some of their original feelings remain. Though his life was spared, Kwon-yoo was castrated by Hwa-yeon's father for daring to elope with her and he is now resentful and embittered towards both of them. Kwon-yoo has aligned himself with Minister Yoon and the Queen Mother to find power in his new position and rebuffs Hwa-yeon. Hwa-yeon's efforts to free her father and rescue him from execution are sabotaged by Kwon-yoo, who directly undermines Sung-won's exoneration orders to ensure the man's death. Kwon-yoo agrees to assassinate Hwa-yeon and her child with a block of poisonous aconite received from Minister Yoon by the orders of the Queen Mother, who wishes to secure her position and remove Hwa-yeon from influencing Sung-won.   Sung-won is still very attracted to Hwa-yeon, bestowing favors and attention. In a fit of pique, he takes Geum-ok, Hwa-yeon's personal maid, as a minor concubine so he can inquire about Hwa-yeon's private habits. One night, Sung-won enters Geum-ok's room and is frothed into a rage when he sees her wearing the hair stick he had gifted to Hwa-yeon. To save her own life, Geum-ok reveals that Kwon-yoo had a relationship with Hwa-yeon, and that the young prince had been born prematurely, making his parentage suspect. Sung-won confronts Hwa-yeon, accusing her of hiding her lover as a fake eunuch, but dismisses the accusations after pulling down Kwon-yoo's pants to reveal his castration. Sung-won attempts to rape Hwa-yeon, but Hwa-yeon shoves him off and tells him to "come back when you become a true King."   After this incident, Kwon-yoo believes that he is the father of Hwa-yeon's child from the night they eloped together and has a change of heart about helping her, swearing to protect her and her son at any cost. In order to place his son on the throne and place a trap for the Queen Mother and King, Kwon-yoo turns on Minister Yoon by placing the poison in Sung-woo's medicinal drink. However, Kwon-yoo is left with no choice but to drink his own concoction to allay suspicion from Hwa-yeon and his child. After Kwon-yoo's violent reaction to the poisonous medicinal drink, the interrogated physician admits that Minister Yoon, who is directly beneath the Queen Mother, is head of medicine.   Hwa-yeon has sent her son away for his safety and been imprisoned by the Queen Mother, who charges Hwa-yeon with treason and orders Minister Yoon to end both the mother and son's life. Sung-won accuses his mother of trying to poison him, leading to her admission that she had poisoned the previous king to place Sung-won on the throne, which horrifies him since he had loved his brother and never desired to be king. Kwon-yoo and Minister Yoon are brought in to confirm or deny the plot to poison the current king. Keeping his promise to Hwa-yeon to protect her and her son, Kwon-yoo lies, saying the Queen Mother was behind Sung-woo's assassination attempt, with Minister Yoon providing the poison. Sung-woo orders the men's execution and for the Queen Mother to be permanently placed under house arrest in her chambers.   In a carriage heading towards his execution, Kwon-yoo says his goodbyes and asks Hwa-yeon to protect their son after he dies, but Hwa-yeon replies "Our son? The prince is no one's son. He is my son."  Kwon-yoo is devastated he has sacrificed his life for Hwa-yeon's child, who may not be his own, and Hwa-yeon has her revenge for her father's death.  Sung-woo, now a true king, is greeted in his room by Hwa-yeon and the two engage in sexual intercourse before Hwa-yeon kills him. Queen Mother is quickly disposed of after him.   The last scene shows Hwa-yeon smiling at her son playing on the throne in the empty royal court, before her face turns when the door shuts and she realizes she can't go back. <ref></ref><ref></ref>

The Conspiracy (2012 film)
 After watching an online video that mocks a local conspiracy theorist, filmmakers Aaron and Jim decide to make a documentary about him. The man, Terrance G., agrees to show them the various newspaper clippings that he has collected and that he uses to draw connections between significant historical events, including [[World War I]] and the [[September 11 attacks]]. Impressed with the depth of his research, Aaron begins to sympathize with Terrance, while Jim remains skeptical. During an interview, Terrance becomes agitated and points out a man whom he believes to be following him. Shortly afterward, Terrance disappears without a trace. Worried, Aaron and Jim return to his apartment, which is being cleared out. Aaron manages to salvage the newspaper clippings. When his house is broken into, Aaron moves in with Jim, his wife, and their young child, where he attempts to figure out what each of the newspaper clippings has in common.  It becomes apparent that Terrence had connected several significant historical events to the Tarsus Club, a [[non-governmental organization]] founded on an ancient [[secret society]] noted for the fact that its members tend to meet just before significant historical events, which has led conspiracy theorists to believe that the Tarsus Club is responsible for said events. The only evidence of its existence is a single article written in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine by Mark Tucker. Unable to find further information about Tucker, Aaron and Jim turn to the Internet and solicit information from the public. A man claiming to be Tucker contacts them and agrees to meet for an interview on the condition that Aaron and Jim remove from the Internet everything that they have written about the Tarsus Club. During the interview, Tucker explains that the Tarsus Club worships [[Mithras]] and as such is said to sacrifice a bull at each of its meetings.  Tucker later contacts Aaron and Jim with news that he can sneak them into the next meeting of the Tarsus Club, which will be held at a mansion in the woods. Armed with hidden cameras, the pair document their interactions with members at the meeting. Claiming to be new members, Aaron and Jim are forced to participate in an initiation ritual held outside in which new members declare their allegiance to Mithras and are given raven masks to wear for the remainder of the meeting. While waiting in line for the ritual, Aaron sees Tucker enter the meeting and greet various Tarsus Club members. Realizing that Tucker is a member himself, Aaron becomes worried that Jim, who was before him in line, is in danger. However, he calms down when he sees Jim leaving the ritual wearing a raven mask, and Aaron decides to go through with the ritual himself. Back inside the mansion, a member corners Jim and reveals that the Tarsus Club has brought his wife and their young child to the meeting. At the same time, Aaron finishes the initiation ritual only to be given a bull mask instead of a raven mask. The members then chase him through the woods. Although his hidden camera continues to record as the members catch Aaron and appear to attack him with knives, it does not show his ultimate fate.  In an epilogue, members of the Tarsus Club perform a series of brief interviews in which they claim to have faked their attack on Aaron in order to scare him off, which is a usual practice with intruders into their meetings. The members are also seen editing the footage, now subsumed into a neutral or even positive documentary about the Tarsus Club. Although visibly shaken, Jim seems cooperative, agreeing with their version of events and adding that Aaron was released unharmed. However, he notes that Aaron was traumatized as a result and later disappeared. Jim theorizes that Aaron has joined Terrance, although he does not explain what this means. The Tarsus Club then reassures the audience that its members are not engaged in any nefarious conspiracies, but rather that it simply seeks world-wide cooperation between "governments, businesses, and individuals."  
Cosmopolis (film)
  Twenty-eight-year-old billionaire [[Speculation|currency speculator]]/[[asset manager]] Eric Packer rides slowly across [[Manhattan]] amid traffic jams, in his state-of-the-art luxury [[stretch limousine]] office, to his preferred barber. Various visitors discuss the meaning of life and inconsequential trivia. The traffic jams are caused by a visit of the [[President of the United States]] and the funeral of Eric's favorite musician, a [[rap artist]] whose music he plays in one of his two private elevators. Despite devastating currency speculation losses over the course of the day, Packer fantasizes about buying the [[Rothko Chapel]].  He meets his wife, Elise, in her taxi, for coffee, in a bookstore, as well as outside a theater. She declines sex with him. Packer has sex with two other women. When after a day of poor trading he destroys a large part of his wealth, his wife takes this as a reason to dissolve their union.  Anti-capitalist activists demonstrate on the street. They wave rats and declare "[[The Communist Manifesto|A spectre is haunting the world]]: the spectre of [[capitalism]]". They spray-paint Packer's limo and later one subjects him to a [[pieing]]. Packer learns that an [[assassin]] is out to kill him, but seems curiously uninterested in who the person might be.  In his car, his doctor performs his daily medical checkup. Eric worries about the doctor's finding that he has an asymmetrical [[prostate]]. As the currency speculation wipes out most of his fortune, Eric's world begins to disintegrate. Eventually he kills his bodyguard. At the destination, the barber, who knew his father, cuts Eric's hair on one side. The barber and limo driver discuss their respective careers driving cabs. The barber gives Eric his gun because he had thrown away the bodyguard's gun.  Eric follows a path of further self-destruction, visiting his potential murderer, former employee Richard Sheets a.k.a. Benno Levin. Eric seems ready to commit suicide,  but instead deliberately shoots himself in the hand. Sheets/Levin, who feels adrift in the capitalist system, explains that Eric's mistake in speculating was looking for perfect symmetry and patterns in the currency market: he should have looked for the lopsided—his body with its asymmetrical prostate was telling him this. The film ends with the potential murderer holding a gun to Eric's head  threatening to kill him, but does not show a final shot. As Sheets points the gun to Eric's head, Eric seems to have overcome the fear of death and waiting for it.

He has actually been involved in many murder cases during the past few months.  The man's name is Lee Leung, who claims he is not a serial killer but an angel of God. This is God's test for him, first to have his wife commit suicide to end the pain of leukemia, and then to have him suffer from the pain of losing his wife; if suffering people want to end their lives themselves, they would have to suffer in hell; life and death is a tragedy, and there is no way out.  Lee Leung begins to pay attention to online news stories about suicides and incidentally finds a discussion site about suicide, where people share various methods of committing it, and some would also talk about their reasons for committing it, including some for their family, and others because they have lost the meaning of life. He understands the suffering of people wanting to commit suicide, and believes his mission is to help those people escape from pain. He asked God to give him strength to redeem these suffering people: since they choose to die, he will perform the duty of murder, so the victim can be murdered instead of committing suicide and that they may enter heaven after they die. He meets four suicidal people online and communicates to them one by one and fulfils their wishes. When Lee Leung opines that he is executing for God's will, he finds that his faith and plan of salvation suffers from an impact he is unable to withstand.

Damarukam (film)
 The protagonist of the movie is born with a divine grace of Lord Shiva ([[Prakash Raj]]) and the boy's parents are advised to name him as Mallikarjuna as he is destined to accomplish a great work. During his childhood, Mallikarjuna faces a great tragedy as his parents and grandparents are killed by a huge feline creature when they are returning from Kashi. This incident leaves his younger sister, Sailu ([[Abhinaya (actress)|Abhinaya]]) paralyzed from the waist and hence renders her lame (Sailu had a talent for dancing before this incident). Malli then develops strong hatred towards Lord Shiva.  Meanwhile, the scene shifts to the focus of a demon named Andhakasura ([[P. Ravi Shankar|Ravi Shankar]]). We see him performing a severe penance to obtain the boon of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva blesses the demon that he will not interfere in the latter's attempt to sacrifice a virgin girl in order to obtain complete rulership over the 3 worlds. The demon is advised by his aged friend Maayi ([[Jeeva (Telugu actor)|Jeeva]]) that the sacrifice must be made in a month having 2 solar eclipses, in such a way that he has to marry the girl and sacrifice her before the solar eclipse ends. This will render the demon matchless and a master over all the 5 elements.  The story then shifts to Malli ([[Akkineni Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna]]), now an adult whose motive is to help people and take care of his bedridden sister. He falls in love with Dr. Maheshwari ([[Anushka Shetty]]) on a visit to the hospital where his sister is being treated. There are many scenes where the atheist Malli forces the people of his colony who include Rudraksha ([[Brahmanandam]]), Ringu Raja ([[Raghu Babu]]), President ([[Krishna Bhagavaan]]) and others, not to worship, on account of his childhood tragedy. Then, on one occasion, Malli questions Lord Shiva for his condition and drives away in his car, only to meet with an accident. Lord Shiva comes and saves him. Lord Shiva calls himself as Saambayya, befriends Malli and goes to his home.  The demon chooses Dr. Maheshwari as his target for the sacrifice and prevents the Kaapaalikas (who arrive at the temple) from having access to Mahi, on the first solar eclipse day. Malli rescues Mahi from the Kaapaalikas and Mahi's parents entrust Malli to take care of Mahi. Then, Mahi's parents decide to get Mahi married to a relative, Rahul ([[Ganesh Venkatraman]]), who is to arrive from the US. This advice is given by saint known to Mahi's family. On his arrival to the airport, Andhakaasura kills Rahul in the washroom and takes his form. The demon, now in Rahul's form, enters Mahi's home and kills 3 dogs who guard Mahi. The demon also paralyzes Mahi's father, when he comes to know the truth about him. He also tries to kill Malli and Mahi, on their way to a temple, but Lord Shiva intervenes by sending his divine vehicle, Nandi who saves Malli. This infuriates the demon, who feels that Lord Shiva has not kept his promise. He challenges the Lord, to which he replies that it was his duty to protect his devotee. The demon then decides to oppose Lord Shiva, so he kills the saint known to Mahi's family, impersonates him and convinces Malli, Mahi and others that Saambayya is not a good person by faking his death at the hands to Saambayya. This makes Malli angry on Saambayya and he returns the ring of friendship given to him by Saambayya.  Finally, Malli convinces Mahi's family that Rahul is actually Andhakaasura. Then, the demon carries Mahi to the spot of sacrifice and prepares for the ritual. Meanwhile, Malli is advised by the Kaapalika chief ([[Avinash]]) to worship Lord Shiva, he tells Malli about his purpose of birth to destroy the demon and the means to do it, as he was the reason of the tragedy in Malli's childhood and Lord Shiva saved him as Saambayya. Malli confronts the demon, is initially defeated, but he heads skyward to get a blessing from Lord Shiva and finally destroys Andhakaasura by piercing the Trident given by Lord Shiva.

The Dark Knight Rises
  Eight years after the death of [[District Attorney]] Harvey Dent, [[Batman]] has disappeared and [[organized crime]] has been eradicated in [[Gotham City]] thanks to the Dent Act. Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] has kept secret Dent's murderous rampage and allowed blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. He writes a resignation speech revealing the truth, but decides that the city is not ready to hear it.  Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, and [[Wayne Enterprises]] is losing profits after Wayne discontinued his [[Fusion power|fusion reactor]] project when he learned that it could be weaponized. Cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] obtains Wayne's fingerprints from his home and tries to sell the fingerprints to Wayne's corporate rival John Daggett. She is double-crossed at the exchange, but alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Selina flees. The men capture Gordon and take him to [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], a mysterious masked figure and former member of the [[League of Shadows]], who has set up his base in the sewers. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]]. Blake, a fellow orphan, confronts Bruce and convinces him to return as Batman.  Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a transaction that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], reveals that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and then resigns in an attempt to convince Bruce to move on with his life. Wayne finds comfort in Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate, who becomes his lover.   Kyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill [[Ra's al Ghul|Ra's al Ghul's]] mission to destroy Gotham, and then steals Batman's technology from Wayne Enterprises. Bane fights Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have done so.  Bane lures Gotham's police underground and uses explosives to trap them and destroy the bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces a nuclear physicist to convert the reactor core into an [[atomic bomb]] before killing him as well. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the public, and releases the prisoners of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], initiating anarchy while holding the city hostage and isolated with the bomb.  Months later, a recovered Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the trapped police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the [[Batplane|Bat]] to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman subtly reveals his identity to Gordon.  In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Wayne presumed dead as well, [[Wayne Manor]] becomes an orphanage, and his remaining estate is left to Alfred. While visiting [[Florence]], Alfred discovers that Wayne is alive, and in a relationship with Kyle. Blake resigns from the police force and, in accordance with Wayne's will, inherits the [[Batcave]].  
Dangerous Ishhq
 The story of the film spans over a period of four centuries and tells four different stories set in different time periods. Supermodel Sanjana ([[Karisma Kapoor]]) and Rohan ([[Rajneesh Duggal]]), son of one of the nation's foremost business tycoons have been one of the most popular couples in the social circuit. When Sanjana decides against flying to Paris at the last minute for a lucrative modelling assignment, she does so, not just because she cannot bear to stay away from her boyfriend Rohan, but more importantly because her instincts push her against going. But what her instincts cannot do is stop Rohan from getting kidnapped. The high-profile kidnapping creates chaos in Sanjana's life. The kidnappers demand 500&nbsp;million. The police however believe that even paying the ransom will not bring Rohan back. Shortly after Rohan gets kidnapped, Sanjana starts hearing strange noises. She has visions of Rohan calling her Geeta. With all this happening, Sanjana realises that she can read [[Urdu]] even though she has never learnt it. She informs her doctor friend Neetu ([[Divya Dutta]]) about it, who in turns refers her to a psychiatrist.  The latter informs Sanjana that Rohan's kidnapping is somehow linked to her past lives. Sanjana undergoes a past life regression where she sees herself as Geeta, a young Hindu girl who is in love with Iqbal ([[Rajneesh Duggal]]). Her entire family has been killed by her uncle. Iqbal suggests that the only way Geeta can escape her death is by leaving the country and settle down in India. Later, it is revealed that Iqbal's friend Aarif ([[Arya Babbar]]) is the antagonist, whose purpose is to separate the two lovers.  Sanjana's next life is that of a Muslim girl, Salma. Here again, she loves a young man named Ali ([[Rajneesh Duggal]]). The latter leaves for a war with his companion Rashid ([[Sameer Kochhar]]). When the war is over, everyone returns except for Ali. Rashid informs Salma that her lover has been killed. It is later revealed that Ali is alive and that it was all Rashid's plan to separate the two lovers. With this particular regression, it is also revealed that Rohan's younger brother Rahul ([[Ruslaan Mumtaz]]) has a hand behind his kidnapping.  Sanjana's last past life is that of a young Indian celibate named Paro. She is secretly in love with Raj Dutt ([[Rajneesh Duggal]]). The Commander-in-Chief of Rajputana, Durgam Sah ([[Ravi Kishan]]) also loves her. When she rejects his love and commits suicide, Durgam Sah takes the help of a psychic named Mantra. He asks her to give him the power to remember everything regarding his current life so that he can continue to separate the two lovers in the next lifetimes. That being said, Durgam Sah, Rashid, and Aarif all have the same soul, but different faces. Their only aim was to separate Sanjana and Rohan. Now the question remains: in which form did Durgam Sah take birth during the present life? During the climax, it is finally revealed that ACP Singh ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) is the new Durgam Sah. In a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse all is revealed and at the film's climax, Sanjana is able to recognise who ACP singh really is by a mark on his shoulder which all his previous lives have had, and then proceeds to fatally wound him. This breaks the cycle, and it is revealed that Sanjana and Rohan's souls are able to be together for ever.  
Dangerous Liaisons (2012 film)
 Shanghai, September 1931: Wealthy businessman and serial seducer Xie Yifan ([[Jang Dong-gun]]) is introduced to his uncle's granddaughter, Du Fenyu ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), when his maternal grandmother, Du Ruixue ([[Lisa Lu]]), arrives at his apartment one day. Fenyu, a young widow who's just arrived from Northeast China (aka [[Manchuria]]) where the Japanese are making incursions, is staying at the country home of Madam Du, her grand-aunt.  At a glitzy fund-raiser for refugees thrown by Hudong Bank chairwoman Mo Jieyu ([[Cecilia Cheung]]) at Yifan's nightclub, Jieyu, an old friend of Yifan who's never succumbed to his advances, asks him to rob Beibei (Candy Wang), the 16-year-old fiancee of tycoon Jin Zhihuan (Zhang Han), of her virginity. Jieyu wants revenge on Jin, for publicly dumping her in favor of a schoolgirl. Yifan turns down Jieyu's request, partly because he has another quarry in his sights—the quiet and retiring Fenyu. Sensing an opportunity for some sport, Jieyu makes Yifan a wager: if he can seduce Fenyu without falling in love, she will finally agree to sleep with him; if he fails, he will sign over a valuable piece of land to her. Yifan accepts the challenge, but finds the virtuous Fenyu apparently immune to his charms.  Meanwhile, Jieyu employs a different strategy to get her revenge on Jin, encouraging an attraction between Beibei and her young drawing teacher, college student Dai Wenzhou ([[Shawn Dou]]). Despite Jieyu's strenuous efforts, the relationship is never consummated; but when she finds out about it, Beibei's mother, Mrs. Zhu (Rong Rong), forbids her daughter to see Wenzhou anymore. With time running out, Jieyu suggests to Mrs. Zhu that Beibei should spend some quiet time at Madam Du's estate—and secretly arranges for Yifan to be there, to "comfort" Beibei. Mission finally accomplished, Yifan refocuses on seducing Fenyu, but finds himself in deeper emotional waters than he's ever experienced.<ref></ref>

Dark Shadows (film)
 In 1760, the Collins family moves from [[Liverpool, England]] to [[Maine]] and establishes the fishing town [[Collinsport]], where they build their estate, [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]].  When he first arrives, the young son Barnabas ([[Johnny Depp]]), meets the young Angelique Bouchard ([[Eva Green]]), who instantly becomes besotted with him. Angelique's witch mother who was with her at that time warned her of socialising with people of noble birth. This, however, did not stop Angelique from following the family for many years, hoping to be loved by Barnabas, but to no avail.  By 1776, Barnabas, now a grown man, falls in love with a young woman named [[Josette du Pres]] ([[Bella Heathcote]]), scorning Angelique who was now working as a maid in his household. Turning to [[black magic]], Angelique curses the Collins family, first killing Barnabas's parents ([[Ivan Kaye]] and [[Susanna Cappellaro]]) in an assumed accident, then by enchanting Josette to leap to her death off a cliff called Widow's Hill. In a fit of grief, Barnabas attempts to leap to his own death but fails, as Angelique curses him to the [[Immortality|immortal]] life of a [[vampire]]. When he still rejects her advances, she turns the town against him, and he is buried alive in a coffin.  In 1972 (that is, 196 years later), a young Maggie Evans (also Bella Heathcote), under the assumed identity of "[[Victoria Winters]]", applies for a job as a [[governess]] at Collinwood and meets with the current reclusive [[matriarch]], [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]). Her nephew David ([[Gulliver McGrath|Gully McGrath]]), for whom Victoria will be caring, believes his mother, who drowned in a boating accident, still visits him. Victoria does not divulge that since her young age she, too, can see [[ghost]]s.  After meeting with David, his live-in [[psychiatrist]] [[Julia Hoffman]] ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), his father Roger ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), and Elizabeth's rebellious daughter Carolyn ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), Victoria is hired by Elizabeth. That night, Victoria sees the ghost of Josette, who warns that "he's coming" before disappearing after falling from a [[chandelier]].  Elsewhere, a group of construction workers dig up Barnabas's coffin and inadvertently free him. After satiating his bloodthirst of 196 years and shocked by the modern times he finds himself in, Barnabas returns to Collinwood, and [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the [[groundskeeper]], Willie Loomis ([[Jackie Earle Haley]]), as his personal [[Renfield]], and introduces himself to the family as a "distant relative". Elizabeth believes him to be a con-man until he reveals hidden riches buried in a secret passage within the house, whereas Elizabeth thought the family to be destitute. After realising who and what Barnabas is, she asks him to keep it a secret to protect the children of his true nature, passing him off as his own descendant, "Barnabas Collins III".  During his breakfast with his newfound family, Barnabas is instantly smitten with Victoria when he meets her as she resembles Josette. Resolved to honorably win her heart, he seeks out Carolyn's advice on courting her. Angelique, now an immortal witch herself and Elizabeth's rival, learns of Barnabas' resurgence and visits him, informing him that she now has taken over Collinsport as a member of the upstanding community. In retaliation, Barnabas reopens the Collins [[Canning|Cannery]] family business and uses hypnosis to steal several of the fisherman crews who work for Angelique. As a result, she tries to buy him off. However, even after an episode of supernatural lust between the two, he rejects her offer. Meanwhile, Julia later discovers his identity by hypnotizing him and offers to cure his vampiric condition via blood transfusions.  After successfully restoring the family fortune and business, Barnabas decides to hold a ball to reintroduce the family to the townsfolk with Carolyn suggesting that they make it a happening with musician [[Alice Cooper]] as the headliner. During the ball, Barnabas catches Roger stealing from guest's coats and later finds Victoria gazing out from a balcony. Feeling comfortable around him, Victoria confides to Barnabas that she's actually an escapee from the mental asylum where her parents had her confined since she was a child due to her powers. Meanwhile, Angelique makes a grand appearance in order to see Barnabas. When she catches him and Victoria kissing, she becomes even more embittered.  Motivated after Victoria reciprocated his feelings, Barnabas seeks out Julia (wishing even more desperately to be mortal again), only to find out that the latter has been using his blood to make herself immortal. Feeling betrayed, he drains her and dumps her seemingly dead body into the town bay with Willie's help. After catching Roger trying to break into the secret passage, Barnabas gives him a choice: to stay and be an exemplary father to David or to leave with enough money to live his thieving life elsewhere. Roger chooses the latter, anguishing David. Barnabas's true identity is finally revealed to the rest of the family and Victoria when he saves David from a falling [[disco ball]]. Victoria is scared by the revelation and runs away.  Upset, Barnabas barges into Angelique's office to demand her to release him from his curse, and while she offers him blood due to her knowing that Julia is no longer around to provide him blood transfusions, she also threatens to send Victoria off Widow's Hill, the same way she did to Josette, and offers him an ultimatum: Either become partners and lovers with her or be locked in a coffin again. With Barnabas rejecting the former, she proceeds to do the latter, this time placing him in the Collins Family [[Mausoleum]]. Shortly after, he is found and freed by David, alerted by his mother's ghost, and they return towards the mansion. Meanwhile, Angelique destroys the Collins Cannery and implicates Barnabas in the murders of Julia and all the people he had to feed on, turning the townsfolk against the family.  At the mansion, Barnabas and Elizabeth see the police, Angelique, and the angry mob approaching as Carolyn withdraws into the mansion. Willing to turn himself in as long as she goes along with him, Barnabas reveals his and Angelique's true natures in front of an angry mob and a fight ensues, pitting Barnabas and Elizabeth against Angelique. During the fight (following the mob's departure upon these revelations), Carolyn reveals to her family that she is a [[werewolf]] and joins her family in their battle against Angelique, but a fire later breaks out in the house. Ultimately, the ghost of David's mother (Josephine Butler) manages to hurl Angelique against the chandelier, which then falls to the ground, mortally wounding her as she starts to shatter. She reaches into her chest and literally offers her heart to Barnabas this time as it shatters as well, resulting in her death. Concerned for Victoria's well-being, Barnabas storms off to look for her as David informs him through his mother that she's headed towards Widow's Hill. As David asks Elizabeth what they will do now, Elizabeth says that they will do what they've always done as the Collins family: "Endure."  After catching up to Victoria at Widow's Hill, Barnabas stops her from leaping and refuses to turn her into a vampire to save her from eternal suffering as an immortal, despite her request. Touched, Victoria throws herself from its cliffs anyway, resulting in Barnabas leaping after her and biting her, so that she can survive the fall as a vampire. She awakens, asking him to call her Josette, and the two kiss passionately on the rocky shore.  The closing scene is at the bottom of the bay as Julia opens her eyes to her new immortal life.

Darkest Night (film)
 The story in ''Darkest Night'' unfolds as a [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)]] "documentary" by a Filipino television [[journalist]], Danny Valencia (Jonas Gruet). In what are purportedly his words, Danny writes that he created the film from [[videotape]] found at the site of a 2003 unsolved crime. The opening scene shows him and some workmen at the crime site, ruins of a mansion where a family disappeared.  Then, the [[video]] begins. On December 25, 2003, Michelle Espino (Issa Litton) and her husband, David (Allan Dale Alojipan), host their upscale family's Christmas Day reunion at their mansion in the mountains. Susan (Anne Gauthier) and American Ken Tyler ([[DJ Perry]]) are engaged after dating for months in [[Manila]]. They travel to the Espinos' home with Susan's live-in sister, Chelsea (Jill Palencia). When they arrive, Susan announces the engagement to the entire family and introduces Ken. An autistic cousin, Justin, a [[video]] camera savant, takes over videotaping from then on. (See [[Autism]] and [[Savant syndrome]].)  After dinner, a mild [[earthquake]] jolts everyone, and the power goes out, plunging all into darkness. Everyone realizes that all batteries and electricity are useless except for Justin's [[video]] camera. A dense fog surrounds the mansion and the entire area. David goes out, walking toward a neighbor's house to seek information. Later, the television switches on by itself without power, showing a strange pagan ritual congregation with weird singing. Now more frightened, the family members try to guard each other. After several other family members die or disappear, Susan finds an old book bearing the French title “The Way of [[Baphomet]]" and the motto ''Ensemble Toujours'' (Together Always). Soon, only Michelle, Steven, Susan and Ken are left. They realize the time is 9 am, and it's still dark outside. Susan discovers the French words ''Ensemble Toujours'' written on a wall. An upset Michelle rushes outside, finding a prowler. She shoots him, only to find David's grotesquely deformed body. Michelle then shoots herself dead.  Later, Susan, Ken and Steven gather in the kitchen. She shows them the old "[Baphomet]" book and demands an explanation from Steven. He tells them Michelle was into [[black magic]], and the book was her "Bible." She was able to learn powerful magic spells from the it. Many years ago, a [[cult]] from France worshiped the demon god [[Baphomet]] and practiced [[black magic]] on this very land. They all mysteriously disappeared on Christmas Day 1914. Steven confesses he and Michelle also had an affair. Michelle later told him she had found an easy way to ascend magically into "[[heaven]]" along with the whole family. Earlier, she had cast a spell on everyone there. However, these rites actually required [[human sacrifice]], mutilation and torture. When Michelle realized her "god" had deceived her, she killed herself. Susan reads from the book that in the final rite a man and woman must wed, and then the bride has to castrate her groom.  Trying to break the magic spell, Susan leads them all in a seance, calling on Michael and requesting release. Michael appears and goes to Steven. Both disappear. Finally, Susan finds that Ken is dead too, and only she is left. She places her engagement ring on his finger with a ring she gave him. Then he vanishes like all the others. The television flickers on again. They see the pagan [[cult]] robed in white, gathering outdoors around an altar. Before all, Ken and Michelle make love. She proceeds to castrate him as a human sacrifice. The set then shows a picture of the entire family, robed and near the altar, without Susan and Justin. The scene slowly dissolves. A robed Susan and Justin now stand with the rest of the family.  In the final scene the [[journalist]], Danny, is still among the original ruins with the work crew, as at first. Everyone gathers by a box they had found, and inside is the old French book, “The Way of [[Baphomet]]." On top of the book are the two rings together, Susan's and Ken's.

Eventually, Jim hallucinates Marznap himself, who urges him to teach the world what it feels like to be a victim.

Dead Before Dawn
 Casper Galloway, an overcautious boy, has become afraid of anything dangerous since the day his father died in an accident at the Occult Barn, his grandfather Horus's shop. When Horus receives a lifetime achievement award, Casper mans the shop so Horus can collect the trophy. Horus warns "no one is to come within spitting distance" of an urn kept on a high shelf topped with a skull. Horus goes on to explain his father Gilbert Galloway imprisoned a malevolent spirit inside the urn and it will curse the person that lets it out.  Charlotte, the girl Casper has a crush on, visits and he tries impressing her with a free purchase for loyal patronage to the Occult Barn. However, more of their friends arrive and make the situation worse. Casper  takes down the urn to show off to Charlotte and clumsily drops it. Casper tries warning them of the danger, but they laugh at him, thinking him to be paranoid. Skeptical, they invent a curse of their own: anyone with whom they make eye contact after 10pm (since midnight is [[cliche]]) kills themselves and comes back as a "zemon", a zombie possessed by the evil demonic spirit entrapped in the urn. The zemons spread their infection through hickeys rather than bites, and those infected kill themselves and become zemons. As an additional rule, if someone gives a zemon a French kiss, the zemon will become their slave. They are given until morning to undo the curse, or else they're cursed for eternity. However, they neglect to come up with an easier way to break the curse.  When Casper spends the entire evening preparing for the curse, his concerned mother believes him to be on drugs. Once 10 o'clock comes, Casper decides the curse is fake, makes eye-contact with his mother, and explains something happened at the Occult Barn, ending her worries. At a football game, players and cheerleaders begin killing themselves, and Casper and his friends realize the curse they made up has come true. Casper finds his mother dropped a toaster into the bathtub with her, and he flees when she comes back a zemon. Luckily, she's hit by a car, but Casper accidentally makes eye-contact with a passenger, forcing him to run again. He bumps into his best friend Becky, whose boyfriend had turned into a zemon earlier that night, and she says she now believes that the curse is coming true and that Casper was right. The two of them realize that the others are still at the football game and rush to their rescue. Once they arrive, Casper and Becky see the field covered with the bodies of the game's attendees and their friends are the only ones standing. The zemons awaken shortly after and chase down the group. They track down Casper's friend Seth, another member of the gang, to warn him about the curse. Seth, who had ignored the curse, reveals to the others that he had made eye-contact with everyone he met that night, thus speeding things up. The zemons manage to catch up to the group and attempt to attack them in Seth's house, but Casper and his friends escape in Seth's [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]].  Everyone plans to search the Occult Barn's books for the way to break the curse. Horus returns, horrified to learn of the idiocy that occurred in his absence. Before he can explain how to undo the curse, he succumbs to it and jams his trophy into his skull; however, he tells them they have to dig. They retrieve the items needed to seal the spirit again: the ashes from the previous urn (which Casper had stored in his backpack), a human skull (one of which, according to Dazzle, is in the anthropology classroom at their college), a heart (which they dissect from a toad), an urn (later replaced by one of Seth's mugs after Dazzle succumbs to the zemon curse and breaks it), and the watch belonging to Horus's father (which they have to get out of his grave). However, most of the group is killed by the zemons along the way, leaving only Casper and Charlotte. A final line in the instructions reveals that Casper must give his life to undo the curse. He sets off a grenade, ready to die, but instead time rewinds to the moment right before the urn broke; everyone retains memory of what happened, ensuring they don't cause another curse.  When Casper and Charlotte graduate, they visit Horus and explain that they wish to become Occult Barn employees to pay for their new place. Overjoyed, Horus decides to take his first vacation ever; his attire suggests, he is going to [[Hawaii]]. After he leaves, the couple make out and accidentally knock down the urn. Horrified, they state, "We're so dead."

Death of a Man in the Balkans
 An introverted loner who composes music for a living ([[Nikola Kojo]]) commits suicide in a Belgrade apartment in front of his web camera.   Drawn by the gunshots, his neighbours, handyman Aca ([[Emir Hadžihafizbegović]]) and bean-loving Vesko ([[Radoslav Milenković]]), gather in the dead man's apartment waiting for the paramedics, police, and forensic investigator to show up. Their respective wives Nada ([[Nataša Ninković]]) and Vera ([[Anita Mančić]]) also come in and out. They pass time by eating, drinking, playing chess, and telling stories of the deceased man unaware that the web cam is still running. They extol his music though nobody can quite remember his name.  When they finally arrive, paramedics and police display more concern for their personal mobile phone conversations than for the dead man. Eventually even a glib real-estate agent ([[Nikola Đuričko]]) shows up with a reluctant client ([[Mirjana Karanović]]) as well as a pizza delivery guy ([[Miloš Samolov]]).  It takes the arrival of the forensic investigator ([[Aleksandar Đurica]]) to alert the room to the presence of the webcam, which has been filming all along. Now aware of the unblinking eye of the camera, the members of the randomly assembled group suddenly feel the need to justify their previous statements and actions.  
The Death and Return of Superman (film)
 While drinking [[Johnnie Walker]] mixed with water, [[Max Landis]] talks about [[Superman]] and how he influenced the world of comic book superheroes until his fading popularity in the 1990s. [[DC Comics]] executives concluded that for Superman to be relevant again, he had to die. Landis describes the birth of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] and the events that set up his battles with Superman until the deaths of both combatants. DC Comics shipped three million copies of ''[[Superman vol. 2]]'' #75 worldwide, nearly all of which sold out within the first day of release.  After the death, DC Comics published the "[[The Death of Superman#Reign of the Supermen!|Reign of the Supermen!]]" story arc, which introduced four characters claiming to be Superman. One was [[Hank Henshaw]], a cyborg version of Superman who defeated the other three and destroyed [[Coast City]], causing [[Hal Jordan]] to lose his sense of reasoning and kill fellow members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. The Cyborg Superman continued his reign of terror until the real Superman appeared and defeated him. It was revealed that Superman had emerged from a "healing coma", identical to death except temporary. Superman's resurrection was met with outrage from fans who felt betrayed by DC Comics; sales of Superman's comics declined and have never recovered ever since.  As he pours himself another drink, Landis recalls a lesson learned from his father [[John Landis]] about how to kill a [[vampire]]. After the younger Landis lists ways mentioned in [[vampire literature]] like a stake through the heart and sunlight, his father explains that writers can kill vampires any way they want because vampires do not exist. In essence, the Death of Superman story arc did not kill Superman; instead, it made death irrelevant in comics, as hundreds of comic book characters would [[comic book death|die and resurrect multiple times]] in the years to come.  
Decay (2012 film)
 A security guard is walking along the maintenance tunnel of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] when he turns around, meets an unidentified man whom he recognizes, and  informs him that he is not supposed to be down there. The man proceeds to shoot the guard dead.  Connor, James, Amy, and Matt are [[physicist]]s at CERN working on the Large Hadron Collider. James works with the LHC, while the others analyze the data generated by it. They are on their way to attend an emergency meeting at CERN. They have no idea why the meeting was called, but Amy believes it can't be very important. At CERN, they overhear Dr. Niven and the Director General arguing over safety. Dr. Niven wants the LHC to be stopped till he can assess the safety, but the Director General overrides his concerns and informs him that, once the problem is fixed, the LHC would work normally and finding the [[Higgs boson]] is of utmost importance. The Director General realizes that Connor, James and Amy are listening to them and he asks the security guard to shut the door.  At the conference room they meet Lisa, who was supposed to be in [[Barcelona]] for a conference but missed her flight due to the party. The Director General addresses the attendees and informs them that the previous night there was a beam dump in LHC. The beam dump occurred because the beam sensors had detected that the [[monopole magnet]] at LHC segment 11G had quenched due to an unknown event. He further warns that, if the event occurs again, there could be a catastrophic accident. Dr. Niven is selected to take a team of technicians down to the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause of the incident and try to get the LHC running again. The Director General requests four volunteers to be in the control room while Dr. Niven is busy. Connor volunteers for the task and the Director General selects Connor, James, Amy and Lisa. Lisa bails out, informing the Director General that she has to attend a conference in Barcelona, so Matt is selected instead.  James introduces his girlfriend Kate to Connor, Amy and Matt. Amy uses the [[mainframe computer]] to run a simulation of the impact of Higgs boson radiation on human tissues. As Amy runs the simulation on the mainframe, the LHC beam monitor indicates that the LHC is up and running. James checks the system and realizes that the system has turned on by itself and Amy had nothing to do with it.  The team led by Dr. Niven is still in the maintenance tunnel of the LHC and they are at risk of being exposed to radiation. James and Connor try to shut down the LHC, but they are unsuccessful; the emergency shutdown switch is not working. The radiation alarm goes off and they decide to run away to avoid being exposed to the radiation. The elevator near the control room is not working and there is no mobile signal since they are over hundred meter underground. They decide to go down to the maintenance tunnel and James manually shuts down the LHC. Connor informs the group that the LHC cannot be turned on from the control room and neither do they have access rights to turn on the LHC. Since the LHC is now off, they can use the elevator in the maintenance tunnel to get out; they believe that the team led by Dr. Niven is dead due to radiation.  As they walk through the maintenance tunnel, they are attacked by the technicians of the team led by Dr. Niven and Kate is captured. Connor, Amy, James and Matt lock themselves up in a room and James uses the [[coolant]] to scare away the technicians. Amy and Connor realize that the technicians had radiation burn marks on their skin and cannot comprehend how the technicians are still alive. Connor finds another way out of the room and they head back into the maintenance tunnel, where they find the dead body of the security guard killed at the beginning of the movie. They find the interlock array and see that it has been destroyed, which indicates sabotage. They are again attacked by the technicians, so they decide to find a mainframe to contact somebody for help. On their way, they are attacked again and this time James is bitten.  They finally find the mainframe server room, James wants to check if Kate is still alive. Amy and Connor work on the mainframe consoles to breach the [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] to ask for help, but are unsuccessful. Finally, the results of Amy's simulations come up; they indicate that the boson radiation has the capability to destroy human brain. This makes them realize that the technicians are all dead and have become [[zombie]] like. Amy and James head back into the maintenance tunnel, where they find the Director General's security guard is dead. James recovers a gun from the guard. Finally, they find Kate's dead body, which the zombies have mutilated. Meanwhile, Connor is studying the simulation data when somebody triggers a deletion of the results. Amy and James return to the mainframe server room, where Connor informs them that only the Director General has the rights to delete the data.  James and Connor manage to unlock all the doors using the mainframe console. Finally, James succumbs to his injury and turns into a zombie, attacking the others. Matt bolts, leaving Connor and Amy to defend themselves. Connor shoots James. Amy and Connor go back to the maintenance tunnel and are attacked by the zombies. Connor is bitten and Amy shoots him when he turns. Zombies escape the maintenance tunnel through the unlocked doors and attack people outside. Amy is chased by zombies, but she manages to elude them. Matt is attacked and eaten alive by the zombies.  Amy manages to reach the surface and is chased by the zombies. She goes to Dr. Niven's office to collect data about his simulation to collect evidence against the Director General. She calls up Lisa on her mobile to inform her that the Director General is responsible for the deaths at CERN, but she is redirected to her voice mail. The Director General enters Dr. Niven's office, picks up the gun left behind by Amy and points it at her. Amy manages to get a confession out of the Director General; as he is about to pull the trigger it is shown that Amy had not disconnected the call and that the confession has gone to Lisa's voice mail. The screen goes black and the sound of a gunshot is heard.  
Delhi Safari
 Delhi Safari<ref></ref> is the story of a journey undertaken by a leopard cub, his mother, a monkey, a bear and a parrot when the forest they live in is on the verge of destruction. Builders have encroached upon their forest and the animals decide to go to Delhi and protest in front of the parliament and ask the parliament some very simple yet pertinent questions they were thinking of– why has man become the most dangerous animal? Doesn't man understand that if the forests and the animals don't co-exist with humans, the balance of the ecosystem will be endangered?  The film starts with Yuvraj (or 'Yuvi', for short) ([[Swini Khara]] in the Original Hindi Version) saying that he lost his father, Sultan ([[Sunil Shetty]]) in the morning, but doesn't want to lose his home at any cost. The film carries a flashback of the morning with Yuvi and Sultan playing in the forest and Sultan teaching self-defence to Yuvi while his mother, Begum ([[Urmila Matondkar]]) enters. The two mock her for her too much caring attitude towards son that gets Begum angry and she goes. Soon, Begum forgives Sultan and Yuvraj (following a song - her one weakness). However, while coming back, a whole pack of bulldozers come from nowhere and proceed to demolish the surrounding jungle. Begum manages to escape, but Yuvi and Sultan are trapped. The two try to protest bulldozers but land at a site in the forest where they see all the trees missing. In a bid to save Yuvi, Sultan catches Yuvi in his mouth and tosses him to Begum. However, he himself is killed by a human wielding a shotgun, making the whole forest a large enemy of the humans. A talk happens with attendants of all the animals in the area. Many believe that leaving their homes is the only way to survive; however, Bajrangi, a monkey ([[Govinda]]), says that he would beat out the wits of those men with his so-called "''vanarsena”'' - Marela ([[Sanjai Mishra]]) and Bharela ([[Saurabh Shukla]]), but Bagga the bear ([[Boman Irani]]) advices him to talk to humans  and Bajrangi asks whether there is anyone who knows the language of humans. A white bird, seemingly a pigeon, Hawa Hawaai ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) pipes up, saying he knows someone who knows both animal and human languages. Yuvi meets the white bird the next day, and asks who is the one he said about. The white bird says the animal he spoke of is Alex ([[Akshaye Khanna]]), a parrot who lives with a director, Vikram Khosla. Bajrangi, his "army" of two monkeys, Hawa Hawaai, Bagga and Yuvi go and kidnap the parrot and convince him to go to Delhi with them to talk to the parliament and save their land. Initially refusing, Alex agrees to go to Delhi. Begum, Bagga, Bajrangi and his army board a train to Delhi from Mumbai. After some time Yuvi joins them and Alex refuses to continue until Bajrangi drops his weapons,which he reluctantly does after Bagga hangs him upside down. They then reach Gujarat with guidance of road from Raju, a bat.In [[Gujarat]] they meet flamingos and a couple who give them shelter in their homes. One of the flamingos strictly advices them not to cross the banyan tree to avoid the wolf Kaalia ([[Prem Chopra]]) and his gang. But Bajrangi goes there and ties Alex using a rope for Kaalia to kill him so that no one can doubt him. Yuvi spots Bajrangi and confronts him but they are spotted by Kaalia. Begum arrives in time to save them.  After this incident Alex pretends to have lost his voice. The animals consult a doctor ''Jadibuti'' ''Baba'' a turtle who advices some [[ayurvedic]] medicines of sandalwood, rose, guava to recover Alex's voice, claiming that he has hypertension, stress and high blood pressure. Bajrangi wholeheartedly does the hard work, sometimes himself getting injured. One day he gets to know that Alex was just pretending and chases him leading himself to inadvertently hit a beehive. All the animals run with bees chasing them. A thrilling experience of trains follows after which Bajrangi tells Alex how guilty he feels of thinking to kill him. Alex also realizes how selfish he was and decides to help animals to help them to justice. Begum tells that no one is going to Delhi after listening to a tiger's story of how he only survived death at a human's hands by being a coward and forsaking his old ways; thankfully, following a pep talk and seeing Sultan's spirit and Yuvi who inspires them, Begum changes her mind and with renewed hope, proceeds to Delhi. They finally reach Delhi and tell their message through Alex to the Prime Minister of the country that they want peace between humans and animals and how this young little cub Yuvi inspired all of them to go to Delhi despite all the incidents. In the last scene, it is shown the jungle is saved courtesy of a shared land act (with the area being called the "[[Sanjay Gandhi National Park]]-Borivali") and all are happy and settled.The film ends with all animals settled in the Jungle with Yuvi seeing his father's spirit and Begum together happy and Yuvi smiling.

He contacts Agnihotra Narasimha Sastry ([[Amanchi Venkata Subrahmanyam]]) but as he was unavailable, he goes to the college where Krishna Sastry (Samrat), the son of Narasimha Sastry studies. Krishna Sastry, in a fit of rage (as his love interest Aparna is close to Sulaiman), shows Sulaiman to Bangarraju and tells him that he is  Krishna Sastry but prefers to be called as Sulaiman. Though initially he refuses to accept, Sulaiman accepts that he is Krishna Sastry as this would be a Golden Chance to unite the two families. He, along with his friend David ([[Vennela Kishore]]) and a group of Bramhins (Played by [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam]], Master Bharath, Raghava, Kadambari Kiran, Ananth and others) goes to the palace of Narasimha Naidu.  There he manages to act well, only to be noticed by Sharmila ([[Hansika Motwani]]), the daughter of Narasimha Naidu. Though she tries to make his true colours screened (i.e. he is not a Scholar),  he escapes by his wit and timing.  In a unexpected situation, Bangarraju visits Krishna Sastry's home to pay Sambhavana but shockingly he finds out the truth that Sulaiman is acting as Krishna Sastry. Having a fear of getting murdered by Narasimha Naidu, he discloses the facts and wants the Yagam to be completed as soon  as possible. Sulaiman, though interested in Sharmila, finds his mother's wish much important and starts playing various plans to intimate feelings on Saraswati in Narasimha Naidu's heart but all go vain. Meanwhile, Narasimha Naidu's Opponent Rudrama Naidu ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) attacks Sharmila and Sulaiman saves her. Sharmila falls for him and Narasimha Naidu feels that the attack was done by Basha.  Now for Sulaiman, things go much worse as Aparna (The Daughter of Bangarraju and The girl who is loved by Krishna Sastry) returns to the palace, proposes to him, and warns him that if he refuse to love her, she would reveal the Secret. Meanwhile Sampangi Sastry, who is  in deep frustation as Bangarraju made him not to perform the Yagam, wants to take revenge on him. Sulaiman plays a very clever game to hide his skin playing with the weaknesses of everyone (For example, Sulaiman calls to Bangarraju and introduces himself as Prabhas, a Telugu actor and is in love with Aparna. Poor Aparna believes it and makes her focus shifted from Sulaiman to Prabhas, which later comes to the knowledge of Bangarraju that Sulaiman acted as Prabhas etc. ). Everything goes Smooth till Sharmila tells about her proposal of marriage with Krishna Sastry to her dad and her dad sends his brothers to talk with Krishna's Parents. Sulaiman reveals his identity to Sharmila and sets to Krishna Sastry's House. There too he plays a game with the weaknesses of Krishna Sastry's Mother so that she would refer Sulaiman as her son before Narasimha Naidu's Brothers. Things get on the right path and Marriage planning activities are done in full swing.  Rudrama Naidu's Son wants to marry Sharmila so that he can torture her to the core. This plan disturbs him and Rudrama Naidu threatens Narasimha Sastry to Leave her or else his son aka Krishna Sastry would be Killed. Thus Narasimha Sastry summons Krishna Sastry and finds that he neither loved Sharmila nor he performed the Yagam. Sulaiman enters the scene, plays a game again, forces Narasimha Sastry to misrepresent Sulaiman as Krishna Sastry at that place. Sulaiman makes Narasimha Naidu to invite Saraswati for the marriage and Basha says that he would come to the marriage only for Sharmila. Thus when the family along with Sulaiman visits the temple, Rudrama Naidu attacks Narasimha Naidu's family and Sulaiman makes a call to Basha that he is attacked. Basha reaches there with his men and in an emotional Juncture, he saves Nrasimha Naidu's family and Nrasimha Naidu saves Saraswati. After knowing the truth that Sulaiman acted as Krishna Sastry, he asks about the reason for the fraud and Sulaiman tells that it was to unite the two families. Thus the two families unite and Sulaiman marries Sharmila.  
Detention of the Dead
 High school student Eddie ([[Jacob Zachar]]) reports to after-school detention at Lincoln High School. Upon arrival,  Eddie sees a few familiar faces: Janet ([[Christa B. Allen]]), a cheerleader whom he has a crush on; Brad ([[Jayson Blair (actor)|Jayson Blair]]), a jock and high-school football player who bullies Ed and plans to join the ROTC; Jimmy ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]), another football player/jock who also bullies Eddie and is good friends with Brad; Ash ([[Justin Chon]]), a happy-go-lucky stoner; and Eddie's best friend Willow ([[Alexa Nikolas]]), a goth who shares with him a love for zombie movies. During detention, Ash attempts to sell drugs to Mark (Joseph Porter), a quiet student in detention. Ash quickly realizes Mark is unwell and alerts Mrs. Rumblethorp (Michele Messmer). However Mark becomes aggressive, biting Mrs. Rumblethorp and forcing the group to evacuate the detention room.  In the school corridors the group discover a wide-scale zombie outbreak with all the other students now undead. They decide to barricade themselves in the school library; believing no one would ever go there. Mrs. Rumblethorp eventually dies and reanimates, causing the group to restrain her as Ash decapitates her with a paper cutter. Some time later, the group decide to search the library for available information on zombies. While searching the book stacks, the librarian attacks and bites Jimmy, before Brad kills the zombie. Eddie and Willow argue that they must kill Jimmy before he becomes a zombie, but Brad remains confident that his friend can survive his bite, quickly revealed to be denial from previously being bitten by Mrs. Rumblethorp on the finger himself (due to stupidly trying to grab her head when they decapitated her). However, Jimmy accepts his fate and jumps out a window where he is eaten by a group of zombies.   As the group panic at their situation, Ash convinces the group to smoke [[weed]] to calm their nerves. While doing so, the group bond, learning more about each other, challenging their original high-school stereotypes, which they list openly: the nerd (Eddie), the social outcast and goth (Willow), the popular, self-involved cheerleader (Janet), the jock (Brad) and the stoner (Ash). The group are attacked by the zombies and narrowly manage to remain safe within the library. Realizing the barricades will not hold, Brad, Willow and Ash decide to escape through the vents while Eddie and Janet remain in the library. While in the vents, the group discover zombified rats who eat Ash, before the vent breaks, leaving Willow and Brad stranded in the halls of the school. They arm themselves with Ash's severed legs and begin to fight through the hordes of zombies back to the library. Meanwhile, Janet convinces Eddie to take her virginity, but the pair are interrupted by Willow and Brad.  Inside the library, Willow is hurt when she realizes Eddie's intentions with Janet. Quickly the barricades of the door begin to weaken, before Brad eventually succumbs to his wounds and attacks Janet, who manages to knock him out of a window nearby. Eddie formulates a plan to escape, using a gun he had obtained in order to commit suicide after not getting into Harvard University. The survivors fight through the school corridors and make it to the school gym. While climbing a ladder up to the roof, a zombie bites Janet on the leg, but all three make it onto the roof. Realizing she is going to die, Janet pleads with Willow to shoot her. However the group are shocked to find the zombies can climb ladders, and all the bullets are used to fight back the oncoming zombies. The zombified Brad attacks the group, and Janet sacrifices herself by jumping off the roof with Brad. Eddie and Willow lose hope of survival, shortly before military units descend. The zombies are killed, and Eddie and Willow leave the school. As the pair share their first kiss, a zombified Janet tackles Eddie and the military open fire on her.  
The Devil Inside (film)
  On October 30, 1989, Maria Rossi ([[Suzan Crowley]]) committed a triple murder during an [[exorcism]] performed on her. The [[Catholic Church]] became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Rome]]. A news story and police investigation show the three members of the clergy whom she murdered. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her.  Twenty years later, Isabella ([[Fernanda Andrade]]) is in the process of filming a documentary about exorcisms and, to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome. She meets two priests, Ben ([[Simon Quarterman]]) and David ([[Evan Helmuth]]), who take her with them on an exorcism performed on Rosalita ([[Bonnie Morgan]]). They bring along medical equipment to determine if it's possession or mental illness. Rosalita attacks the crew after spouting out obscene remarks in different languages and accents. She calls Isabella by her name, despite not knowing her. Eventually, they get her under control.  When Isabella goes to visit her mother, Maria, in the asylum, she finds that her mother speaks in different accents and has paintings all over the walls. Maria then soils herself while screaming a weird language. She has inverted crosses carved into her arms and her bottom lip. Maria tells Isabella that killing a child is against God's will. Isabella tells David and Ben that she had an abortion years ago and her mother had no way of knowing that—another sign that showed possible possession. As the crew prepares to perform an exorcism/analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past.  After analyzing the data from the video and audio files, they present the evidence to the Church. David shows many signs of stress, as Ben plays the audio files over and over. Ben finds that there are four different demons speaking in unison. David is to perform a [[baptism]] at his church, in which Michael tags along to record. When he holds the baby to start the [[immersion baptism]], he mutters some lines from the [[Bible]] and starts forcefully submerging the baby in the holy water. The crowd rush up to save the baby as he passes out.  Soon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and David acquires an officer's handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]], and forgets the last few words. He laughs and shoots himself. Isabella begins having a seizure.  Ben hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. Ben and Michael leave with Isabella in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She then tries to strangle Michael and breathes into his mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, and acceleration can be heard as Michael speeds into oncoming traffic. The camera goes black, and cuts in with short sequences of chaos, most likely of Michael, Isabella and Ben flying through their car windshield.  Before the credits start rolling, a title card is shown informing that the case of the Rossi family is still unresolved, followed by another title card directing viewers to a website "for more information on the ongoing investigation".  
Detective Conan: The Eleventh Striker
 The [[Detective Boys]] attend a promotional event where the [[J. League]] play soccer with children. There, the group are introduced to several people. The next day, the Detective Boys watch the soccer match at Touto Stadium. [[Kogoro Mori]] receives a phone call from a bomber who relays the location of a bomb in the form of a riddle. The riddle reads "Blue zebra and blue boy, rain from above, people from below, their left hand, as it is shows, the tree on the left. [[Ran Mori]] relays the riddle to [[Shinichi Kudo]] allowing Conan to decipher it. The blue zebra and boy refer to the mascots of the teams currently playing at Touto stadium. The rest of the riddle is a play on [[kanji]]; The top part of , bottom part of , left of ,  as it is, and the left of . Filling in the missing parts of the kanji and adding them together forms the word . With little time to evacuate the spectators, Conan traverses up the infrastructure and arranges the explosives so the scoreboard falls in a safe location.  The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (Case Closed)|Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] work with Kogoro to find out the bomber's identity. Conan reveals the bomber revealed information only the people they acquainted with during the promotion event would know, limiting the suspects down to five. Kogoro receives a letter from the bomber stating a larger crowd will witness the next bombing and a second letter will arrive later to reveal the location of the next bomb. The police speculate Shiodome Arena is the next target as it is the closest event with the largest attending audience. The second letter arrives and reveals the [[J. League All-Star Soccer]] is the next target as it has the highest viewership. The letter declares in all ten simultaneous games, the strikers must use the following play hidden in the letter against the [[home team]] to stop the bomb and challenges Kogoro to confront him as the eleventh striker. Conan reveals the border and the staple matches an [[association football pitch]] and the kanji written in red is written in a way so that the staple has red markings on top of it; He deduces the bomber wants the strikers to kick the ball in the center of the goal post. As per the letter, the police are only able to alert the coaches and the strikers in each game about the bombs.  While the strikers in all ten matches successfully hit the goal post to deactivate the bombs, the police visit Keiichirō Motoura who they believe has a strong motive to be the bomber. Motoura confesses he holds hatred towards Kogoro and fans of the J. League All-Star Soccer games since they stalled the ambulance his dying son, Tomofumi Motoura, was in and blamed them for his death. Kogoro reveals the group mistakenly believed the ambulance they called was for a collapsed elder and attempted to charter the ambulance to their direction. Motoura however reveals he is not the bomber. Conan  watches a video of Tomofumi playing soccer and realizes Kazumasa Nakaoka is the culprit. Conan then leaves to Touto stadium to confront Nakaoka.  There, Nakaoka reveals his brotherly relationship with Tomofumi and how he also believes Kogoro and the J. League All-Star Soccer fans were the cause of Tomofumi's death. Nakaoka then reveals that the eleventh switch to stop the bombs is on the goal post; However the detonations have begun. Conan attempts to kick the ball to the goal post but is blocked by falling debris. The Detective Boys give Conan a second ball allowing him to make the shot and stop the explosions.  
The Devil's Carnival
 God, in his heavenly workshop, is painting the face onto a doll.  He messes up on the eyebrows, and tosses the doll into a bin labeled "Broken", and begins working on another one.  Meanwhile, on Earth, three people are about to meet their deaths.  John, a grieving father, slits his wrists in his own grief after losing his son, Daniel. A thief, Ms. Merrywood, is killed in her trailer after a shootout with police.  Tamara, a teenage girl, is killed by her angry boyfriend. All three are greeted by denizens of Hell as they die ("Heaven's All Around").  In Hell, which is a carnival, Lucifer's second-in-command, the Ticket Keeper, rallies the carnies in a big-top circus tent. There, he calls out the names of the carnies who will be "performing" that night for the recent arrivals. He selects the Painted Doll, a mute woman with a cracked face; the Twin, a chameleon-like character; the Hobo Clown, a mute man; and the Scorpion, a knife-thrower. The Scorpion is absent from the meeting, so Ticket-Keeper sends Painted Doll to go find him. The Magician, another carnie, opposes Ticket-Keeper and demands to be in the show.  Ticket-Keeper threatens him with Lucifer's wrath, and he backs down. In other parts of the carnival, John, Ms. Merrywood, and Tamara all awaken, given an envelope containing a ticket to enter. John, Ms. Merrywood, and Tamara all begin to wander to the entrance. John and Ms. Merrywood bump into each other, and they arrive at Ticket-Keeper's booth as the carnies welcome them to the carnival ("The Devil's Carnival"). John attempts to cut ahead of Ms. Merrywood, believing his lost son is in the Carnival. Ticket-Keeper admonishes him for attempting to break the rules, and explains all the 666 laws of the Carnival ("666"). They are welcomed in.  Tamara, wandering in the back of the Carnival, finds The Scorpion, who resembles a typical "bad boy". She releases him from a cage, and he woos her over with his deadly knife-throwing act. Meanwhile, John, in search for his son, finds himself in the Big-Top tent. He is harassed by Wick and her three cohorts, the Woe-Maidens, as the circus band. The Hellharmonic, led by The Major, play a tune ("Kiss the Girls"). The tormentors vanish suddenly, however, and John sees Painted Doll in a kissing booth. She offers John knowledge of Daniel's location in exchange for a kiss.  However, she bites his ear off, which spontaneously reappears.  Meanwhile, Daniel meets Lucifer, who begins reading him Aesop's Fables, starting with "The Dog and Her Reflection". Ms. Merrywood, following a pamphlet to find a large diamond, unintentionally litters, and runs from the carnival's enforcer, the Tamer, into a dark tent. There, the Twin has the large diamond, and morphs into Merrywood herself. Merrywood, not recognizing her own reflection, fails the Twin's game ("Beautiful Stranger"). She is then stripped naked and whipped for the carnies, while the Hobo Clown sings a metaphorical song that retells the fable Lucifer is reading ("A Penny for a Tale").  Lucifer begins reading Daniel another fable, this time "The Scorpion and The Frog". Tamara is continually wooed by the Scorpion, and follows him into a dark tent where a knife-throwing wheel has been set up. There she walks in on the Scorpion and the Painted Doll kissing. The Scorpion accuses Tamara of not trusting him, which she denies. He straps her to his knife-throwing wheel, and tosses three knives at her, all of them missing. He brandishes a fourth knife, a switch blade, and throws it directly into Tamara's heart, killing her ("Trust Me").  The Painted Doll then retells the fable to the carnies through song, showing off Tamara's body for them ("Prick! Goes the Scorpion's Tale").  Lucifer reads one final fable for Daniel, "Grief and his Due". John finds an entrance-way to find his son. He wanders through a room of red balloons, swings, a hallway of mirrors, and eventually to a replica of the bathroom where he slit his wrists. John, distraught over losing his son, claims Heaven has abandoned both Daniel and himself ("Grief"). John finds Daniel in Lucifer's study, only for him to morph into the Fool, a dwarf carnie, much to Lucifer's amusement. Lucifer taunts John, revealing to him that he is in fact in Hell as he could not let go of his grief. John weeps but eventually decides he no longer wants to grieve and Lucifer sends John to heaven. John crawls out of God's "Broken" bin, surprising him.  Later, Ticket-Keeper questions Lucifer about letting John go to Heaven. Lucifer rallies the carnies, announcing a grand plan to offer the condemned souls redemption and thus, access to Heaven ("Grace for Sale"). Ticket-Keeper informs the carnies that, come tomorrow, they will wage war with God and his angels, in order to "put Heaven out of business". The carnies dance and celebrate, excited to start their battle with Heaven ("Off to Hell We Go").  In a post-credits scene, Tamara finds Lucifer in the big-top tent. She blindly places her trust in him, like she did with the Scorpion, and is seduced by Lucifer, ultimately repeating the sin that brought her to Hell ("In All My Dreams I Drown").  
Devasthanam (film)
 The movie begins with the introduction of two characters Srimannarayana ([[Kasinathuni Viswanath|K. Viswanath]]) and Samba Murthy ([[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]]).

Talented Samba Murthy tricks her to buy a routine red saree lying that it is specially made as rare piece for MLA's wife.  One day in the temple Srimannarayana happens to see Samba Murthy and his devotion to God. He gets impressed with Samba Murthy's happy go life attitude and approaches him for a help. He requests Samba Murthy to light his pyre and perform his funeral rituals post his death. Samba Murthy gets shocked and furious with Srimannarayana's request. He tells him that he will think about it and leaves angrily from there. Next day morning, Srimannarayana directly comes to Samba Murthy's home for answer. Samba Murthy asks Saraswathi to lie that he is not home and manages to send Srimannarayana back. From then, Srimannarayana starts following and persuading Samba Murthy everywhere. Saraswathi convinces Samba Murthy that it is another chance given to him by God to fulfill the old man's wish because he failed to light the pyre of his own father. She reminds the incident when Samba's father died and he couldn't obey a son's responsibilities because he was stuck in Mumbai Bomb attacks.Samba Murthy finally accepts Srimannarayana's wish and Srimannarayana gives rupees two lakhs for his funeral expenses including flight fare to Kasi for immersing his ashes in Ganga river. He tells Samba and Saraswathi that he will visit them every morning and if he did not arrive any day, it means he is no more.  Samba Murthy gets to know from the temple priest (Nayar Raman) that Srimannarayana is a great artist who performs Harikatha and is not performing for some reason now. Samba Murthy promises the priest to arrange Srimannarayana's performance for coming temple Dasara festival celebrations. Srimannarayana accepts Samba Murthy's request on a condition that Samba Murthy will write Harikatha script by studying all the old scripts. Upon incorporating repetitive review comments from Srimannarayana, finally Samba Murthy comes up with a beautiful script. From then, they perform Harikatha everyday and answer philosophical questions after Harikatha in the temple.  A fine day in the temple, Lawyer Purushottama Rao (Dr. K. V. Ramanachary IAS) invites both of them home and asks way to attain peace. He confesses that he has earned lot of money by undertaking false cases and he is not happy with that money anymore and wishes to get rid of all his sins now. Upon the advice of Srimannarayana, Purushottama Rao sacrifices all his wealth, transforms himself into a good man and starts a new trust called "Sarve Jana Sukhinobhavanthu". He requests Srimannarayana and Samba Murthy to be trustees of the foundation. Samba Murthy who is astonished to see that change in the lawyer, returns 2 lakhs given by Srimannarayana to him saying that he now realised how lucky he is to find an elderly person like Srimannarayana as his guide. Srimannarayana returns those 2 lakhs to the trust saying that he was so foolish about his cremation on who performs his last rituals but is not concerned about it anymore. Slowly, they both become great companions and perform Harikatha not only in temples but also in schools, colleges, orphanages etc., Then the story takes a tragic twist in the climax and ends with a message that "All the life's a stage. Nothing remains forever, only good deeds will."

Greg returns home to learn that Frank signed him up for an unpaid summer internship at his work without his consent, and Greg lies about having a job at the country club. Frank and Susan are delighted, and give him a starter cell phone, a Ladybug, which only allows him to call home or 911.  Later, Rowley invites Greg on a family trip to their beach house near the Boardwalk, but Greg finds the lifestyle banal and attempts to escape.

Stan arrives at the tent, Greg manages to escape while Stan accidentally throws his own tent into the campfire, and Greg admits he was responsible but his friends tell him that he did it to defend his honor. Frank, having lost his respect for Stan, then confronts him with the electronic conveniences (although he was jealous of Stan throughout the movie), and Stan runs into Greg's trap, leaving him humiliated.  Frank reveals that he never liked camping anyway, and decides not to send Greg to Spag Union, much to Greg's surprise and delight. Frank gives Greg advice about learning from mistakes and taking responsibilities, and the two ultimately that they're actually much more alike than they originally thought.  At Heather's Sweet 16 birthday party a few days later, Löded Diper performs a [[hard rock]] version of "[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]" by [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Ludacris]], during an attempt to win over Heather. However, Rodrick accidentally knocks over a huge [[ice sculpture]] of Heather, which results in her losing her temper and accidentally smashing a [[chocolate fountain]] with a [[microphone stand]], splashing chocolate all over her, and the party ends in disaster.  Holly then implies that she likes Greg by holding his hand, and in the final scene, Greg, Holly, and Rowley all hang out together at the local pool. Greg describes that his summer did not go the way he expected, but had positive circumstances.

Maya is engaged to Deepak, who is in France. Maya is diagnosed with cancer and treated by Savithri. Deepak leaves her due to her illness, leaving Maya depressed. While moving Maya's belongings to the ward, Arun notices a diamond necklace worth 7 million Indian rupees.  One day, Arun comes to know through Venu ([[Sreenivasan]]), a laborer from his town in Kerala, that his mother is not well. Arun cannot leave the country due to his creditors. He gets to meet  Narayanan ([[Manian Pillai Raju]]), who also happens to be from his place. Through Narayanan's influence, Arun is granted permission to leave the country. When he arrives in India, he is tricked into marrying Narayanan's niece, Rajasree ([[Anusree]]). Rajasree is a typical "village" girl who has no clue about city life.  When he comes back he finds out his friend's family has returned and he can no longer stay with him. He goes searching for a space, but finds that he does not have enough money to pay the advance. He moves to the labor camp with where Venu is staying. Lakshmi learns that Arun is married and puts an end to their relationship. He ends up staying with Maya, who is searching for a person to share her spacious flat. Arun and Maya develop a liking for each other. Maya is unaware of the fact that Arun is married. Savithri forces Arun to vacate Maya's flat and bring Rajasree to Dubai. Arun vacates Maya's flat, he brings his wife Rajasree to Dubai, and the couple starts staying together.  Maya and Arun see each other on Maya's last day in her flat and they have sex as Maya is unaware of Arun's marriage with Rajasree. A few days later Maya happens to see Arun and Rajasree together in a mall. This leaves Maya mentally shocked and her illness further aggravates. Injecting morphine, a pain reliever, is the only option. Upon Maya's request to relieve her pain, Arun injects an excess dose of morphine. Arun, to pay off his dues, steals Maya's diamond necklace and replaces it with a fake one. Meanwhile, Maya admits that she is sorry to have entered into Arun's life and falls asleep. Rajasree, on finding the diamond necklace, thinks it is her birthday gift from her husband Arun.  Maya develops complications from the overdose and narrowly escapes death. Lakshmi, who is on duty at that time and had injected an initial dose of the pain reliever, is dismissed from duty. Maya leaves the hospital leaving a gift cover with Savithri to be given to Rajasree by her husband, Arun. When Arun opens the cover the gift eventually turns out to be the fake diamond necklace that he replaced.  Arun drops Lakshmi at the airport, and puts the original diamond necklace into her bag, so that she can fulfill the dream that she and her mother had seen, the hospital. Although she lost her hair as a result of the treatments, she now shown living a lonely but happy and content life at some remote Himalayan valley remembering Arun's words to live life without worrying about past and future.  The story ends with Arun realizing that Rajasree loved him more than the diamond necklace (the fake one, a fact that Rajasree was unaware of) that he had given her, when she throws it into the ocean to prove her love to him.

The Dictator (2012 film)
 For years, the fictional nation of the Republic of Wadiya has been ruled by Admiral-General Aladeen ([[Sacha Baron Cohen]]), a childish, [[Tyrant|tyrannical]], [[Sexism|sexist]], [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-western]], and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] despot who surrounds himself with [[Amazonian Guard|female bodyguards]], sponsors [[al-Qaeda]] (specially giving shelter to [[Osama Bin Laden]] after "[[Death of Osama Bin Laden|they killed his double one year ago]]"), changes many words in the dictionary to "Aladeen", and is working on developing [[nuclear weapon]]s to attack [[Israel]]. He also refused to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father on his deathbed. After the [[United Nations Security Council]] resolves to [[Military intervention|intervene]] militarily, Aladeen travels to the [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]] in New York City to address the council.  Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton ([[John C. Reilly]]), a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir ([[Ben Kingsley]]), whom Aladeen's father passed over as successor in favour of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted [[political decoy]] named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally [[Democratization|democratizing]] Wadiya while opening up the country's [[oil field]]s to [[China|Chinese]] and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally kills himself in a botched torture attempt; when his burnt corpse is discovered, Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognisable as Clayton shaved off his iconic long beard prior to his death.  Wandering through New York City, Aladeen encounters Zoey ([[Anna Faris]]), a [[human rights activist]] who offers him a job at her [[Progressivism|socially progressive]], [[alternative lifestyle]] co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters "Nuclear" Nadal ([[Jason Mantzoukas]]), the former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons programme, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the warhead's shape. Aladeen follows him to New York's "Little Wadiya" district, which is populated by refugees from his own country, and meets him in "Death to Aladeen Restaurant", run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had personally ordered to be executed. Nadal saves Aladeen from nearly being recognised by angry refugees and reveals that rebels infiltrated the secret police, and all the condemned were sent into exile instead of being executed. Nadal agrees to help Aladeen thwart Tamir's plot and regain his position as "rightful" dictator, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiya's [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] programme again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoey's job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and teaches him how to [[Masturbation|masturbate]], and eventually falls in love with her after seeing her angry. Turning around Zoey's struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a [[Cult of personality|personality cult]] around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review.  However, Aladeen's relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he decides to be honest with her and reveal his true self; she cannot love a man who was so brutal to his own people. After acquiring a new beard taken from a corpse, Aladeen ziplines into the hotel and tells Efawadh he has recovered; (his double being fooled into thinking the Supreme Leader was ill). At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamir's document in front of the UN delegation, and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of [[dictatorship]], drawing unintended parallels to current issues in the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoey's strongly held views, vows to democratise his country and open up Wadiya's oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Angry with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to assassinate him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet and survives, as it is his job "to be shot in the head". Tamir, afterwards, is arrested.  A year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are [[Guided democracy|rigged in favour]] of Aladeen (who has now added the titles [[President]]&ndash;[[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] to his previous Admiral-General). Afterwards, he marries Zoey, but is shocked when she [[Glass-breaking ceremony|crushes a glass]] and reveals herself to be [[Judaism|Jewish]]; throughout the film he was shown vowing to "destroy Israel". Scenes during the [[Closing credits|credits]] show Aladeen's convoy, now consisting of [[Green vehicle|eco-friendly cars]], visiting a reinstated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Aladeen responds to the news by asking if Zoey is having "[[Sex-selective abortion|a boy or an abortion]]".  ===Unrated version=== The unrated cut of ''The Dictator'' runs an additional fifteen minutes from the original 83-minute theatrical version. Much of the added material is additional sexual content and dialogue. There is a scene following Aladeen falling asleep in the back of the store where one of his bodyguards, Etra, tries to kill him by beating him with her enlarged breasts. Another added scene is Mr. Ogden, the manager of the Lancaster Hotel, talking to Zoey at The Collective and cancelling the catering contract because of Aladeen.

Din Tao: Leader of the Parade
 Ah-Tai ([[Alan Ko]]) narrates that he is the son of Uncle Da (Chen Bo-Zheng) and Aunt Da (Samantha Ko), who run a troupe in [[Taichung]]. Uncle Da's troupe does traditional performance in front of religious processions. The religion requires performers to "initiate the faces and pose as gods" — to put on a special face painting, or to put on a heavy body puppet costume, both of these represent gods' persona. The performance demands training of martial arts, acrobatics and endurance, and the society associates performers with gangsters. Uncle Da has been competing with Wu-cheng (Liao Jun), who studied with Uncle Da under the same master. Ah-Tai grew estranged with his father and the troupe, and went to Taipei to study Rock Music, until a mysterious old man in a blue coat bids him home.  Ah-Tai's home is a small private temple which also accommodates Uncle Da's troupe, now named Jiu-Tian. The troupe is composed of one young woman Min-min (Crystal Lin) and three young men: Li-Zi is autistic, A-Xin is abused by his father, and Min-Min, A-Kui and Ma-Liya came to Uncle Da's strict discipline to avoid becoming gangsters. Uncle Da is aided by middle-aged Betelnut-Cheng. Betelnut-Cheng is married with a mainlander immigrant wife, and may have to quit the troupe to concentrate on his betelnut stand.  At home Ah-Tai quarrels with Uncle Da and his troupe. They call Ah-Tai "Three Minutes" because he cannot commit himself long enough. Meanwhile, the Jiu-Tian Troupe is pushed out of business by Wu-Cheng's troupe. With the support of Aunt Da, Ah-Tai challenges Wu-Cheng and his son Ah-Xian ([[Alien Huang]]): Ah-Tai takes charge of the Jiu-Tian Troupe, and promises that under his leadership, the Jiu-Tian Troupe will defeat Wu-Cheng's troupe in six months, or else the Jiu-Tian Troupe will leave Taichung altogether.  As he takes charge, Ah-Tai learns the art of the troupe and the difficulties of each troupe member. Ah-Tai starts training them with drumming, and tries to use stage elements and create a new performance that "earns respect without initiating the face and posing as gods." Uncle Da is against Ah-Tai's idea, and all crew members are loyal to Uncle Da. Ah-Tai insists on his authority, and takes the troupe on a tour to circle the Taiwan island on foot. Outside the troupe, Ah-Tai is also challenged by Ah-Xian, who performs the challenging sequence of "Settling Camp" before him.  On their island tour, the Jiu-Tian Troupe performed drumming before a temple. Ah-Tai's style is accepted by the crowd and other troupes, and Ah-Tai earns the hearts of all the troupe members. The tour also attracts coverage of TV show host Xiao-Bi (Esther Liu) and becomes famous. Ah-Xian, though antagonistic to Ah-Tai, admires Ah-Tai's will to take over his father's place. Both Xiao-Bi and Min-Min develop romantic interest in Ah-Tai, but Ah-Tai only sees Min-Min and Xiao-Bi gives up.  After the Jiu-Tian Troupe returns to Taichung, they win the promised contest with Wu-Cheng's group. Ah-Xian eventually joins Ah-Tai, and the two young men want to combine the two troupes to perform on the "International Cultural Festival" hosted by the Taichung government. However their fathers reject the plan. The man in blue coat shows up again and is revealed to be the master of Uncle Da and Wu-Cheng. He beats the two disciples and lectures them. Later in the temple, the two fathers reconcile each other and their sons and the two troupes join hands for the Festival.  On the night of the festival, the Jiu-Tian Troupe performed on a stage in the amphitheater of an urban park. the Jiu-tian Troupe's new style of performance modifies the face painting and costumes, and is combined with stage props, effects, performers' vocals and electric guitars. They win the respect of their families, the master, and all other audiences. Ah-Tai's narration concludes that his way now earns Uncle Da's support, and the Jiu-Tian Troupe undergoes an even more difficult training including climbing [[Yushan (mountain)|Mount Yu]] and passing Sahara desert, Africa.  
The Dinosaur Project
   A group of explorers from the British Cryptozoological Society goes on an expedition into the Congo in search of a [[cryptid]]—the so-called [[Mokele-mbembe]]—which is believed to be a [[Plesiosaur]]. Along with the five explorers are two television cameramen who will be recording the whole expedition. The explorers consist of their leader Jonathan, their medic Liz, their sponsor organiser Charlie, their pilot, and a local guide, named Amara. During the helicopter flight, Johnathan discovers that his son Luke sneaked into the chopper as a stowaway.   Shortly after that, a flock of large flying reptiles appears next to the helicopter and one of them crashes into the chopper blades, causing the helicopter to crash. The pilot dies in the crash and everyone else escapes just before the chopper explodes. Now lost, they discover that the satellite phone they had with them was broken during the crash, Amara suggests that they should head to the village they saw while they were in the helicopter. Upon arriving, the group discovers that the villagers have been killed and the village destroyed. Johnathan chooses a hut to stay in for the night and his son, who is technically talented, installs a night vision camera outside the hut.   At night, everyone is woken up by strange noises and Luke sees a swarm of bat-like reptiles outside the hut on the monitor linked to his night vision camera. Charlie accidentally alerts the creatures by making a noise and they try to flee from the village which is infested with the animals. Liz is attacked and killed while the rest escape in a pair of wooden boats and spend the night and part of the day on the river, until they arrive on a small island. On that island they encounter a group of dinosaurs with one in particular that seems to like Luke, which he decides to name Crypto. He spits a fluid on Luke. The next morning, they discover that the dinosaurs are still there and Luke decides to attach one of his cameras onto Crypto's neck to see where he would go to. The broadcast cuts out as the dinosaurs swim into a cave.   The group heads back on the river when the broadcast returns and Luke and Charlie see that the dinosaurs went straight to where they originated, some kind of underground gateway, where the camera is dropped. When they try to steer through a whitewater, Luke's and Charlie's boat gets separated and drifts off towards the cave where the dinosaurs went earlier. The rest of the explorers follow them and rejoining them in a river canyon, they encounter a [[Plesiosaur]]. A suddenly emerging [[Pliosaur]] attacks the group. Charlie and Luke get out of the water, believing that the rest of the group died and continue to search for the place where the dinosaurs came from, in the jungle. Eventually they arrive there and when Charlie learns that Luke has fixed the satellite phone, he pushes Luke down into the gateway, intending to kill him.   On the other side of the underground passageway, Luke speaks into the camera, trying to reach the other survivors via the monitor. In the next scene the survivors are seen walking around at the river beach amidst the remains of the boats, the camera monitor lies shattered on the ground. Amara reveals that she was supposed to lead the group to do some records at a safe place in the jungle but she refuses to go towards the gateway and leaves, taking one of the boats. Jonathan and Pete continue the search for Luke and Charlie. In the meantime, Luke meets Crypto and follows him deeper into the jungle, where he is attacked by the bat-like creatures. He is rescued by Pete, who suddenly appears together with Jonathan and drives off the creatures. Pete chases them into the jungle, when he is suddenly encircled by the creatures who attack and presumably kill him. Charlie is seen, speaking to the camera at an unknown place, when he is interrupted and forced to hide by Jonathan and Luke, continuing through the jungle. They follow a steep cliffway, when they are hit by a rockfall, causing Jonathan almost to fall down the cliff. As Luke looks up, Charlie is seen with a stick in his hands, indicating that he caused the rocks to fall. Luke tries to help his father who is holding onto a rock, but, telling him that he loves him, he lets go of the rock and falls down the cliff.   Luke escapes from Charlie and hides in the dense jungle, evading Charlie who is chasing him, when he meets the little dinosaur once more who leads him to the place where he dropped his camera earlier, when suddenly Charlie emerges in front of him, intending to kill him. Crypto spits the fluid into Luke's face, when two adult dinosaurs appear just behind Charlie, sniffing on Luke and smelling the fluid, they leave him alone and kill Charlie.   Luke proceeds into the jungle and stops at a high cliff, filming himself and the little dinosaur, saying that the satellite phone has been crushed again and that he has to destroy the cameras to use the parts, he waves the camera over the view from the cliff, showing a big valley full of dinosaurs. In the next scene he is seen throwing the backpack down a waterfall into a river, as a message. Luke's fate is unknown.  The floating backpack is found by men in a boat, who find video hard drives and tapes labelled "the Dinosaur Project" inside. In a blurry video, Luke says "I think it works".  
Dino Time
 Ernie Fitzpatrick ([[Pamela Adlon]]) is a daredevil kid who lives in Terra Dino with his best friend Max Santiago ([[Yuri Lowenthal]]) and his sister Julia ([[Tara Strong]]) who likes to tattle on him. Ernie and Julia live with their overprotective mother Sue ([[Jane Lynch]]), who has been chosen as the mother of the year. Ernie is told to go to the store after school to keep an eye on it, but he disobeys orders and goes with Max to the Terra Dino Museum to sneak into a forbidden area still under construction to see the bones of the ferocious [[Sarcosuchus]]. Julia follows them there and uses a quarter that Ernie gave her to set off the alarm. Julia is able to escape while Ernie and Max get caught by the guards, and Sue grounds Ernie for three weeks. Ernie disobeys orders once more by sneaking out of the house.  Ernie goes to Max's house to see if his father Dr. Santiago ([[Fred Tatasciore]]) has had any success with activating a time machine he built four years ago. While Ernie and Max admire the time machine, Julia, who followed Ernie, reveals herself and attempts to call Sue. When Ernie and Max try to stop her, the former ends up spilling soda on the time machine's control panel, activating it and sending the kids back in time 65 million years ago, to the time of the dinosaurs.  Upon exiting the time machine, the kids meet a friendly [[Tyrannosaurus]] named Tyra ([[Melanie Griffith]]) who runs an orphanage for dinosaurs without parents. Among the orphans is a hyperactive dinosaur ([[Rob Schneider]]) who quickly befriends the kids. Tyra decides to take the kids in as her own, but the other dinosaurs do not think that the kids can protect them from the evil [[Sarcosuchus]] Brothers, Sarco ([[William Baldwin]]) and Surly ([[Stephen Baldwin]]). The brothers reside in the lower valley, and because their lair is sinking into the tar pits ever so slowly, they plan to kill Tyra so they can move into and take over the upper valley. The brothers' three bird henchmen Morris ([[Nolan North]]), Borace ([[Tom Kenny]]) and Horace ([[John DiMaggio]]) find out about Tyra's "newborn babies", and because they mistake the time machine for a real egg, the brothers decide to have their henchmen steal it so they can lure Tyra to their lair and kill her. Back in the present, Sue and Dr. Santiago discover their kids' disappearances and learn that Tyra's real egg has switched places with the time machine.  Ernie, wanting to explore the environment before they leave, hides the power key of the time machine in his pocket and tells a lie that it's missing. The kids sneak away from Tyra early in the morning to "look" for the power key, but they run into the hyperactive dinosaur from earlier who accidentally causes them to fall into a river. Because the dinosaur helps the kids dodge several boulders scattered throughout the river, they decide to name him Dodger. Unbeknownst to Ernie, however, the power key falls out of his pocket while he's in the river, and it is found by Horace who swallows it. After Tyra takes everyone back to her nest, the kids and Dodger decide to have some fun while Ernie is busy looking for the power key. At the same time, Sue and Dr. Santiago start building their own time machine out of Sue's car.  The next day, the group spot tracks from Morris and his gang and follow them, but it turns out to be a trick so that the henchmen can steal the time machine. As they are leaving, however, Horace spits out the power key. When the group return to the nest, Ernie finds the power key and reveals his earlier deception, angering Julia and Max. The kids become horrified to find the time machine gone and start to worry that they're trapped in the prehistoric era until Ernie gets the idea to make a landmark containing instructions to activating the time machine. By writing it on a place that's still in the present time, their parents will see it and discover how to find them. The kids decide to write the landmark on Mystery Rock, the center of Terra Dino, but before they can do so, Julia is captured by Morris and his gang to lure Tyra to the lower valley since stealing the time machine didn't work. Once the kids and Tyra reach the Sarco Brothers' lair, Tyra fights the brothers and knocks them unconscious. The kids and Tyra then attempt to escape, but Ernie gets separated from the group when Morris and his gang start chasing him. Before the henchmen can eat him, however, Dodger plays a trick on them, scaring the henchmen and causing them to fall into a tar pit.  Meanwhile, Tyra's real egg hatches in Dr. Santiago's house, and the newborn escapes and starts causing mayhem. Sue and Dr. Santiago are able to capture it with hamburgers from the Burgersaurus restaurant, but they still fail to activate the time machine. Upon seeing a landmark on Mystery Rock, however, Sue realizes that spilling soda on the controls activates the time machine. Back in the lower valley, the kids run into the Sarco Brothers again after they regain consciousness. Knowing Tyra will die fighting the brothers alone, the kids forego their chance to return home so they can help her, resulting in the time machine sinking into a tar pit. After having Julia blind Surly, Ernie throws his rocket-powered skateboard into his mouth and activates it, causing the ignition from the skateboard to blast Surly into the lava and kill him. Sarco goes for another attack but is stopped by Tyra, who is badly weakened. When Sue and Dr. Santiago arrive in the lower valley, Tyra regains her strength and kills Sarco by pushing him into a tar pit. Sue initially thinks that Tyra is an enemy, but once the kids clear up the misunderstanding, they all leave the lower valley together and return to the upper valley. Before the humans return to the present time, Dr. Santiago reunites Tyra with her real baby.  As the humans head back home, Ernie reveals to Sue that he did not write the landmark because he went to save Julia. They soon learn that Dodger is the one who did it when they see him in the time machine with them.  
The Dino King
 80 million years ago, during the [[Cretaceous]] period, a young ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' named Speckles, for his unique birthmark, lives with his older brother, Quicks, twin sisters, and mother. Speckles is left alone when a rogue ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named One-Eye causes a massive stampede to kill Speckles' siblings, and personally kills his mother, in order to usurp their territory. [[File:OneEyed SpecklesTheTarbosaurus-DinoKing-2012-KoreanFilm.jpg|thumb|left|One-Eye, a ''Tyrannosaurus'', is the [[villain]] of the film.]]  Four years later, Speckles has scraped by on his own, scavenging and raiding nests. One day while attempting to steal food from One-Eye, Speckles encounters a female ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' named "Blue-Eyes" and the pair team up to hunt and survive together. Over the years, Speckles and Blue-Eyes attempt to maintain a hunting territory away from One-Eye. Eventually, however, One-Eye discovers their hunting grounds and again attempts to usurp their territory. After Blue-Eyes is hurt by One-Eye, Speckles fights him, and eventually defeats and drives away his old nemesis.  After defeating One-Eye, Speckles and Blue-Eyes reclaim Speckles' old family nest and hunting grounds. Now a mature adult pair with three young offspring, the family is happy until forced to flee from their territory due to a volcanic eruption. During the disaster, one of the children is killed and Blue-Eyes is wounded. After this, Speckles becomes the de facto alpha of a large migratory herd of dinosaurs fleeing the natural disaster. Two weeks into the journey, Blue-Eyes collapses from exhaustion. Seeing this, a pack of ''[[Velociraptors]]'' attacks the family, and though Speckles tries to hold them off, Blue-Eyes dies from her injury, forcing Speckles to leave her body behind in order to save their children.  After a long journey, the herd arrives at a new, fertile area in which to settle. However, Speckles once again encounters One-Eye, who has been driven out by the same natural disaster. Just as he did before, One-Eye causes the herbivores to stampede in order to ambush Speckles and his two babies. One-Eye kills another child and remaining child, Speckles Jr., is knocked off a cliff into the ocean during the ensuing fight. Speckles dives into the sea to save him, but pursued by One-Eye. After a long fight in the ocean, One Eye is attacked and eaten by a pair of ''[[Tylosaurus]]''. Speckles eventually reaches Speckles Jr. and returns him safely to shore.  In the closing monologue, Speckles wishes a peaceful, happy life for his son.

They track the Brittles to the [[Tennessee]] plantation of Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett and kill them. Bennett musters a large gang to raid their camp in the night; Schultz ambushes them with an explosive, killing most of them while Django kills Bennett. Feeling morally obliged to Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue . Schultz trains Django as his apprentice, and the two become partners.

In 1859, Django and Schultz travel to [[Mississippi]] where they learn the identity of 's new owner: Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called "Mandingo fights".

Angered, Calvin has several attack dogs devour D'Artagnan alive. After finding  and telling her of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Calvin's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious and accurately deduces their plan. He alerts Calvin, who alters the deal at gunpoint so that  will be sold for $12,000 instead of the Mandingo fighter. Schultz agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. Calvin smugly insists that the deal be sealed through a handshake; Schultz, sick of Calvin's cruelty, shoots him through the heart with his [[Sleeve gun|concealed]] [[derringer]], killing him. Schultz is killed by Calvin's bodyguard, who is then killed with his own [[revolver]] by Django. A shootout ensues, and Django kills many of Calvin's henchmen before surrendering.  The next morning, Stephen tells Django that Calvin's sister Lara has taken charge, and that he will be sold to a mine and worked to death. En route, Django proves to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them his first handbill, tells them that the men on the handbill are back at Candyland, and promises them all but $500 of the reward money if they free him and help him kill the wanted men. The escorts release him and give him a revolver, which he immediately uses to kill them before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of [[dynamite]]. Django kills Calvin's slave trackers, takes 's freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, and frees his wife from a nearby cabin.

Do You Really Want to Know?
 The main subjects of the film are [[Jeff Carroll]], a US Army Veteran and [[Huntington's disease]] researcher from Washington; Dr. [[John Roder]], a renowned cancer specialist at the [[Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto]]; Theresa Monahan of Ohio, who was among the first Americans to undergo [[predictive testing]] for Huntington's disease in 1988, and Dr. [[Michael R. Hayden]], who is the director of the [[Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], and the world's most-cited researcher with regard to Huntington's disease.<ref></ref>  Jeff Carroll's story involves learning about his family's genetic history after he was already married and considering having children. He underwent testing at Dr. Michael Hayden's [[Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics]] and learned that he had inherited the genetic abnormality that will cause him to develop Huntington's disease later in life. Subsequent to his diagnosis, he joined Dr. Hayden's research team and obtained a Ph.D for his research on Huntington's disease. Meanwhile, he and his wife had decided that it would be unethical to conceive children who might inherit the disease from him, so they used [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] to ensure their children were born free of the genetic abnormality. He is now an advocate and frequent public speaker on Huntington's disease<ref></ref> and encourages all at-risk individuals to be tested and to participate in clinical trials so that research into treatment can progress as quickly as possible.  Dr. John Roder and his wife Mary-Lou were already parents when Dr. Roder underwent testing for Huntington's disease in the 1990s and learned that he carried the gene for Huntington's. Roughly ten years later, in his 50s, Dr. Roder began showing symptoms of the disease, including severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and Huntington's [[chorea]], a muscle control and movement disorder typical of the disease. Despite his decline in health, he continued working with the goal of retiring at age 65 as someone with normal health would. When the Roders' two adult children underwent testing, they were both negative for the Huntington's gene, though it was earlier discovered that son Nathan had [[schizophrenia]]. Subsequent to his and Nathan's diagnoses, Dr. Roder changed the focus of his research from cancer and metabolism to schizophrenia and brain diseases.<ref></ref>  Theresa Monahan is from a large family with a history of Huntington's disease. Her mother and eldest brother died of the disease, but her surviving siblings, like most people at risk for Huntington's, have declined to be tested<ref></ref>  over concern that a positive diagnosis could ruin their quality of life long before symptoms affected their health. Without telling her family, Theresa proceeded with testing as part of a landmark study at the Indiana University in 1988, but declined to read her results until her daughter got married and she became concerned about the possibility of passing the disease down to her potential grandchildren. Her results showed she was negative for the HD gene, meaning she would not get the disease. As is typical of people of at-risk people who test negative for HD, she reports feeling some [[survivor guilt]] over her results.<ref></ref>

Jonathan takes Lina to see the painting at Dracula's home, where Dracula begins to hypnotically seduce Lina, who reminds him of Lucy. Jonathan and Lina head back home, but their car breaks down on the way, causing them to camp in the woods. During the night, Dracula seduces the detectives and goes to bite Lina, sparking her illness. At dawn, the car is able to start back up and Jonathan takes Lina to get blood work done by Dr. Joan Seward (Dani Lennon).  The following day, the detectives discover Lucy's corpse in a trunk. Jonathan finds out Lina is infected with an anonymous organism that is multiplying inside her system. While on the run, Quincy pleas to Jonathan for help to kill Dracula, although Jonathan refuses to believe Dracula is a vampire. Shortly after, Renfield runs Quincy over with a truck, killing him. When Lina begins feasting on their dog's corpse, Jonathan gets in contact with [[vampire hunter]], [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]] (Keith Reay) for help and learns Quincy was killed. After Dracula seduces Lina and takes her away, Jonathan learns from Van Helsing and a mythical book that they have one day to rescue Lina and kill Dracula, or Lina will turn into a vampire.

Dredd
 The future United States is a dystopic irradiated wasteland known as the [[Cursed Earth]]. On the east coast lies [[Mega-City One]], a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]], who act as judge, jury and executioner. [[Judge Dredd]] is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit [[Judge Anderson|Cassandra Anderson]], a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.  In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as "Ma-Ma", executes three rogue drug dealers by having them [[flaying|skinned alive]], infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' executions. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.  Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with [[rotary cannons]] that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.  Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges [[Judge Volt|Volt]] and [[Judge Guthrie|Guthrie]] respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.  While Dredd works his way towards Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's [[biometric device|DNA scanner]] does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading Kaplan's mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition, and is shot by Lex in the abdomen. Lex moves in to execute Dredd, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.  Anderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, in the case of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.  In the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed, and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed.

Eden (2012 film)
 Hyun Jae, or Jae for short, is an 18-year-old Korean-American girl living in New Mexico in 1994 with her immigrant parents. Jae goes out one night with a friend and hits it off with a young fireman at a bar, who offers to give her a ride home at the end of the night. Jae eventually notices his fireman badge is fake and attempts to escape his car, but she is captured, bound and transported in the trunk of another car.  Jae is taken to an isolated warehouse, where she is drugged, has her braces removed, personal belongings taken away, is fitted with a tracking bracelet and put into an area of the warehouse called the stables. Jae is introduced to Bob, a corrupt law enforcement official who was earlier shown killing two people in cold blood and who is the local leader of a sex trafficking ring, as well as his volatile, drug-addicted overseer, Vaughn. Bob informs Jae that he has information about her parents and that they will be harmed if she doesn't cooperate. He renames her Eden and gives her two days to adapt to her new life before she is forced to work. Eden endures daily pregnancy tests, being forced to star in pornographic films and being prostituted out. During her first prostitution "job," Eden attacks the client and tries to escape once again, but Vaughn captures her and punishes her by forcing her to lie in a tub filled with ice overnight.  One year passes, and Eden has adapted as much as possible to life in the operation and has befriended another girl named Priscilla, who is shocked to learn Eden is as old as she is (by now, 19). Priscilla tells Eden something unknown happens to girls who become "too old." Moments later, Priscilla herself is mysteriously taken away. Eden notices that Vaughn's trustee, a girl named Svetlana, has obtained the class ring she was given by her father the day of her abduction and makes an attempt to forcibly retrieve it from her until Vaughn and an enforcer pull her off. Vaughn forces Eden to swallow the ring, which she does, but Eden then volunteers to assist Vaughn in overseeing the operation, specifically with accounting. After working one night at a college fraternity party, Vaughn has Eden assist him in accounting from the frat brothers, and in recapturing two other girls who attempt to escape. Eden begins replacing Svetlana as Vaughn's trustee, answering phones and assisting with day-to-day operations, and is taken out of the sex work side of the operation.   Bob is shown leading a seminar on drug trafficking, but is questioned by detectives as he was placed by a GPS at the location of a missing deputy and landowner, the two people he killed earlier in the movie. Eden and Vaughn meet Bob later to dispose of bodies in the nearby lake, including Svetlana. Vaughn suddenly and brutally kills Bob on the boat, presumably because of his implication in the death of the deputy and landowner.   One day, while answering phones, Eden is taking a customer's order when the customer asks how much it'll cost, which Eden knows is an indication that it is a police sting, but she takes the order anyway and says nothing. Eden and Vaughn take a girl to the house of a man named Mario, and Eden instantly recognizes him as the one who transported her to the warehouse in the trunk of his car. Eden goes to the bathroom and finds a room full of baby beds. She also finds Priscilla, who is heavily pregnant (why she was taken away, as she'd tested positive on one of the daily tests) and blissfully ignorant as to what will actually happen to her baby (he or she will be sold). Vaughn notices Eden being withdrawn on the way back, deduces that she found out what Mario's house is used for and attempts to force Eden to kill a girl in the desert to prove her loyalty, but she is stopped at the last minute by Vaughn.   Vaughn is informed that one of his enforcers have flipped on the operation, presumably because of Eden sending him to a sting. Eden is forced to start packing the girls for the move and is taken to Vaughn's house, where Vaughn informs her they are moving to Dubai. Eden realizes this could be her last chance to escape. While he is in the bathroom, she sprays Vaughn's meth pipe with chemicals that Vaughn inhales, killing him. Eden then cuts the tracking bracelet off her ankle, takes drugs and money from Vaughn's house, and goes to Mario's house. Eden attempts to negotiate Priscilla's freedom; Mario refuses but admits that he remembers Eden.  He agrees to let her see Priscilla. While his back is turned, Eden injects Mario with drugs and kills him. Eden finds Priscilla, telling her her baby was sold, and they both escape the house. Eden finds a pay phone and calls her mother, hearing her voice for the first time in a year.

Their friendship develops as Riana gives Rahul a long break he always wanted. As they grow closer, Rahul develops feelings for Riana, who fails to reciprocate them.  As [[New Year's Eve]] approaches, Riana plans to visit her family in India and asks Rahul to accompany her. He disagrees initially, as his parents live in [[Mumbai]], but later succumbs to her argument. Upon arrival, she introduces him to her family, making his feelings towards her grow. The next day, Riana takes him to visit her school. Amidst reflecting over her past relationships, he unsuccessfully tries to kiss her. Realising that she does not feel the way he does, he angrily leaves the school, only to almost run into a car revealed to be his mother's. He lies and tells his mother that he is in India for a research trip, and that Riana is a colleague. They have lunch with Rahul's parents, where he spins a web of intricate lies to avoid telling his father the truth. He leaves Riana's house and moves in with his parents, trying to tell them the truth, but once again is overpowered by his father.  Two days later, during a family dinner, Rahul angrily divulges the complete truth to his in-denial parents and their business partners (including Mr. Bulani), after realising the meaninglessness of his pretense he indulged in all these years. As he rushes back to Riana to apologise for his behaviour, Riana apologises she never intended to lead him on. After a night of reflection and deep conversation, they decide to maintain their friendship.  The duo return to Las Vegas and finalise their annulment. Rahul gets a new job, while keeping time out for photography. He remains hopeful that one day he will convince Riana to go back to that chapel with him. Both remain good friends, with an ending note from Rahul claiming that he is finally happy with his life, as the credits roll.

Fellow RAW agent Gopi ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) accompanies Tiger on this mission.

He tries to befriend Zoya to extract information, but begins to discover his human side as he grows closer to her. Tiger is attacked and robbed at his residence by a person suspected to be an ISI agent.   Despite several warnings from Gopi to not let any personal feelings get in the way of the mission, Tiger falls in love with Zoya. Tiger asks Zoya for a date and there they both came to know about their feelings for each other. Before telling her his feelings, during a visit to the dance academy, Tiger discovers that Zoya is an ISI agent and she refuses to commit treason on Pakistan when he asks. Instead of killing Zoya, Tiger lets her go.  Some time later, Tiger and Zoya meet again at a [[United Nations|UN]] Foreign Minister's Meeting in [[Istanbul]] when Zoya signals to him using a cryptic message. They decide to leave everything for their love and fool their respective agencies by taking a flight to [[Cuba]], having told their agencies that they are in [[Kazakhstan]].

Instead of returning to India, the pair trick Gopi and escape aboarding an aeroplane. Tiger calls Shenoy, who tells him that RAW will find both spies, calling him this time by his real name, Avinash Singh Rathore. Tiger tells Shenoy that they will only return when Pakistan and India no longer need ISI and RAW. In the epilogue, several images of Tiger and Zoya in cities including [[Venice]], [[Cape Town]], [[Zurich]] and [[London]] are shown, where sightings of them have been reported. But neither agencies have been able to catch them.  
El Yazısı
 Set in a humble Anatolian town, ''El Yazısı'' follows three stories on a day when the town is welcoming its very first foreign English teacher. As an accidental tourist is mistaken for her, the wind of change starts to blow.  The first story is young Ahmet's. He loves a girl from the village; both the townspeople and the villagers are against this relationship. Today, as he is planning to elope with her, he is assigned to guide the foreign teacher around the town.   Second story is about Zeynep, the town's pharmacist from the big city. She is about to marry the town's respected teacher Celal. Today, Volkan, a drug representative and an old friend, arrives for stock-taking. Wedding news is a surprise for him.   And finally Ragıp, an eight-year-old boy who is on a quest for his missing love letter to Zeynep.

''El Yazısı'' is a tale about the ones who try to break the enduring morality of the small-town life.  
Ekla Akash
   ''Ekla Akash'' is a story of love, despair, infidelity and a tragedy in general. It deals with a troubled marriage between a young couple, Arijit and Nisha. The ambitious couple have reached a point in their relationship from where there is no turning back so they continue to live with each other and their child is also born. Arijit’s infidelity is primarily the reason as he is having an affair with his colleague . Arijit also has questions regarding Nisha’s special relationship with her mentor S.R, who is a film director and wants to make a film star. Eventually he does make her a star, but it only makes things worse.  The film is an extremely dramatic film and can be depressing for most people. You might even hate Arijit and call him names, but eventually that anger lessens because he realizes the meaning of true love, of a family, of what it feels to be like a father and what he had done with his life so far. Though the relationship is at crossroads, yet both of realize their own mistakes and come back to each other, but then it is too late. Everything happens at the cost of losing their only child to a lung disease. This tragic ending perhaps heightens the drama of the film and makes it worth watching which was perhaps not so initially. Goutam Ghosh also plays a very interesting role as S.R, Nisha’a mentor who just sees talent in his protege and that is all there is to that relationship. There is love and affection between the two-but of that between a mentor and his protege, nothing else. He is a happy go lucky scion of a North Kolkata family who stays in a sprawling mansion literally all by himself and he finally finds peace when he goes to Darjeeling as the music teacher of Disha’s school. The film proves once again that nothing can replace the love between a husband and a wife no matter how many affairs you indulge in because somewhere down the line it is devoid and empty and does not have any lasting value or feelings . However, if you realize things too late, things can be tragic as in this film.

She goes to a very powerful person who can sense beneath the lives and asks him why only Ram can see Sravanthi.

While Shashi is in New York, she has a traumatic experience at a cafe due to her inability to communicate in English. She is comforted by a French chef Laurent who happened to be queuing up behind her at the cafe.  Using the money she made from selling laddoos, Shashi secretly enrolls in a conversational English class that offers to teach the language in four weeks, showing her resourcefulness at navigating an unfamiliar city alone. The class comprises David Fischer, the instructor; Eva, a Mexican nanny; Salman Khan, a Pakistani cab driver; Yu Son, a Chinese hairstylist; Ramamurthy, a Tamil software engineer; Udumbke, an African-Caribbean man; and Laurent.

Shashi thanks Laurent for making her feel better about herself. Shashi's family return to India; during their flight home, Shashi asks the flight attendant in fluent English whether she has any Hindi newspapers.  
The End (2012 film)
 Felix is invited to a weekend reunion with a group of old friends at a remote mountain cabin. It has been twenty years since the group last met, and although at first it seems that little has changed between them, behind the laughter and stories, secrets emerge from their collective past that create rifts between the friends.  Before leaving for the reunion Felix is stopped in the subway by a strange man carrying a sheaf of drawings. Only much later does he realise that the man is one of his friends, Ángel, although he does not recognise him at the time. Later, as Felix and his new girlfriend Eva drive to the cabin, Felix describes his friends to Eva (who does not know any of them), although he evades her questions about Ãngel.  Eva is introduced to Felix's friends – Sergio (whose family owns the cabin), Sergio's wife Sara, party boy Rafa, the motherly Maribel, handsome playboy Hugo, and Hugo's new wife Cara (who, like Eva, has never met the other members of the group). As the group reminisces and parties late into the night, tensions begin to surface.   Eva soon learns that Felix had previously had a brief relationship with Sara. As time passes Maribel, who has apparently organised the weekend, becomes increasingly agitated by the absence of the mysterious Ãngel (whom the friends refer to as "The Prophet"). Finally she confesses that it was Ángel himself who had instructed her to invite everyone to Sergio's cabin for the reunion, a revelation that greatly disturbs the rest of the group.   Later, while Eva is making mojitos in the kitchen (and just as Felix had warned her), the philandering Hugo makes a pass at Eva; she rejects him, but the encounter is seen by Hugo's wife Cara.   Late that night, sitting around the campfire, an intoxicated Rafa strips naked and throws his clothes into the fire. He taunts Sergio about the failure of his business, then claims that he has spiked the group's food and drink with hallucinogenic mushrooms. The ensuing argument leads to a disturbing revelation – at their last gathering 20 years earlier, several of the friends had forced Ãngel to take a large quantity of unknown drugs, which had apparently tipped Ãngel into schizophrenia, causing him to become violent and delusional,   and he had to be institutionalised.   Moments later the group is startled by an eerie flash that illuminates the entire night sky, accompanied by an ominous rumbling; when it ceases the friends hear the sound of animals and birds crying out in panic. They soon discover that all power and communications are out, all electrical and electronic devices including their cars and phones are totally inoperable, and they have no contact with the outside world and no way to leave except on foot. They also notice that all the clock in the house has stopped at the exact moment of the flash, 12:20am.   The next morning the group decides to walk to the next farm to get help, but they find it totally deserted, with two vultures scavenging food from the dining table, and everything appears as if the occupants have left very suddenly. The friends also notice that the clock here has also stopped at 12:20am.  As they move on further, they come across a hikers' campsite, but it too is totally deserted, and they are puzzled by why the hikers would leave all their expensive hiking gear behind. They gradually realise that the phenomena caused by the previous night's event seem to be in effect everywhere, and that all the people they might have expected to encounter have apparently vanished, as if into thin air.    Soon, after first Sergio and then Rafa suddenly and inexplicably vanish, the group begins to realise that some invisible power or force is abroad, that it is apparently making people disappear, and that this apparently affects only humans, since the group repeatedly observe animals, although these act in an increasingly strange and sometimes aggressive manner.  Heading down the mountain, they traverse a narrow, precipitous path cut high into the face of a steep river gorge. Halfway along, the group is suddenly charged by a panicked herd of mountain goats; the stampeding animals push Hugo off the path and he almost falls to his death, but after his friends rescue him the group realises that Cara too has inexplicably vanished.  Further down the gorge they come upon a lorry full of sheep that has crashed into the wall of a road tunnel. The driver has vanished, although the seat belt is still fastened, and they realise that the truck has collided with another vehicle, which has crashed through the guard-rail down into the gorge. They are horrorified to discover that the dead driver (who is still behind the wheel) is their missing friend Ãngel. They realise that he was killed in the car accident on his way to the cabin – although his watch reveals that he had died some hours before the mysterious phenomenon, suggesting that the mysterious force is only taking living people. Felix also recovers Ãngel's sketchbook, which is filled with a sequence of strange, ominous drawings.  When they reach the bottom of the gorge Hugo and Felix go for a swim in the river, but after a short argument about Cara, Hugo walks away from Felix, and dives back into the river, but he does not surface. Although Felix and Sara both dive into the pool in search of him, they soon realise that Hugo too has  vanished without a trace.  Hours later, the remaining four – Felix, Eva, Sara and Maribel – arrive at a caravan park, but it too is completely deserted. They find bicycles, collect some food, and decide to ride to the nearest town, but just as they are about leave they are suddenly surrounded by a pack of ravenous German Shepherd dogs, which begin to attack them. They are forced to abandon the food and flee for their lives on the bicycles, with the dogs in hot pursuit, but just as the pack is about to catch Sara, the dogs inexplicably turn and run the other way as if in fear of something ahead of the group. Moments later, Felix, who is riding in front, hears the panicked Maribel sobbing and calling to him not to leave her; he tries to reassure her, but moments later he realises he can no longer hear her, and when he, Sara and Eva stop, Maribel has vanished, and only the  bicycle she was riding remains on the side of the road.  Sometime later, the surviving trio see an object hurtling down from the sky on fire, and it crashes nearby. When they investigate, they find the wreckage of Jumbo Jet, but there is no trace of the bodies of any passengers on board.  Felix concludes that the plane must have been in the air since before last night's mysterious event, and that it must have flown on with no-one on board until it ran out of fuel. He surmises that the mysterious event must have happened everywhere.  Reaching the port town, they find that it too is totally empty, except for a few animals. They go to the church to ring the bell and raise the alarm, but there is no response. Inside, Felix reveals to Eva that the images in Àngel's sketchbook are indeed prophetic, depicting in sequence each of the bizarre incidents that have befallen them. He also confesses that he has not shown it to Sara because he has realised that only he and Eva appear in the penultimate drawing.  Sara then hears the sound of a child's cry...Following the sound, they see a little girl running away from them through the narrow streets, but they also hear the approaching roar of a lion that has escaped from a visiting circus. They chase the terrified girl to the local marina, where she locks herself in the cabin of a yacht, but while Sara tries to convince the girl to unlock the cabin, she is horrified to see the girl vanish before her eyes.   Felix and Eva then realise that the escaped lion has followed them to the marina and is blocking their escape, but (as he had explained the night before) Felix has gained his mariner's licence and can sail them to safety aboard the yacht. He tells Eva and Sara to cast off the ropes and gangway, but Sara (finally realising what has happened to her own children) ignores Felix and Eva's pleas to get on board, she deliberately walks toward the lion, and is killed by it.  Now apparently the only survivors of the catastrophe, Felix and Eva sail out to sea. Felix reveals that, at the car crash site, he had also found the torn-out final page of Ãngel's prophetic sketchbook, which seems to indicate that only Eva will survive. They go to sleep that night on the yacht, expecting that Felix will vanish, but they awake the next morning both still alive and together. The final scene shows the boat sailing into an unknown future as it fades out of sight into a luminous mist.

He leads them to Sook, who is being savagely beaten nearby. After arresting the culprit, the officers learn that Van Hauser is not returning to patrol and Sook is leaving the force. Taylor marries Janet, and at their wedding Zavala tells Taylor that, should anything happen to him, he will take care of Janet. The next day, the officers perform a welfare check on an elderly woman. In her house, they discover drugs, dismembered corpses, and a message from the cartel. Unbeknownst to them, a cartel member has "[[Contract killing|green-lit]]" the officers, and the gangsters from the earlier drive-by begin following them. On patrol the officers encounter Tre who, out of respect for Zavala, warns them that the cartels plan to have them killed, but Taylor and Zavala shrug it off.  Shortly after Janet gets pregnant, the officers are baited into chasing a reckless driver into an apartment complex, where they are ambushed by the same group of Latino gang members. They fight their way into an alley, where Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala desperately attends to his partner, the assassins arrive and shoot him several times in the back, killing him. Police backup eventually arrives and the gangsters are brutally slain after refusing to surrender.  Taylor survives, having been shielded by Zavala's body. At Zavala's funeral, Taylor tries to deliver a eulogy, but only manages to say a few words: "He was my brother." In a flashback to the day of the shooting, Zavala recounts to Taylor a story from his teens before the two receive the call from dispatch.  
Emperor (film)
 Brigadier-General [[Bonner Fellers]] is sent to Japan as a part of the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation force]]. He is tasked with arresting Japanese [[war criminal]]s, including Prime Minister [[Hideki Tojo]]. Before he departs, he privately orders his Japanese interpreter, Takahashi, to locate his Japanese girlfriend, Aya Shimada. After arresting Tojo, the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]], [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] informs Fellers [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] can be tried as a war criminal. Doing so could lead to a revolt, but the American people want the Emperor to stand trial for Japan's actions. MacArthur gives Fellers ten days to investigate the Emperor. When Takahashi informs Fellers that Aya's Tokyo apartment was bombed, he orders him to investigate her hometown, Shizuoka.  Fellers and his staff compile a list of people who advised Emperor Hirohito when the war started. None of the Japanese who are friendly to the Americans are among them and they resort to Tojo for more information. He gives them the name of [[Fumimaro Konoe]], the former prime minister. Fellers then asks Konoe's if the Emperor was responsible for starting the war and Konoe gives no conclusive evidence, but directs Fellers to [[Kōichi Kido]], [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan|Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal]]. While Fellers waits to meet with Kido, Takahashi informs Fellers Kido will not show up. Fellers soon after recalls his 1940 visit to Tokyo when he reunited with Aya, then an English teacher. He learns Aya returned to Japan after her father became ill and died. After a banquet at MacArthur's residence, Takahashi informs Fellers Shizuoka was bombed; Fellers immediately travels there. He is devastated by the damage and orders Takahashi to find a list of the dead.  Fellers recalls his visit to Aya's uncle, General Kajima, for help with a paper on the mindset of the Japanese soldier. Kajima insists if the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] were at war, the Japanese would win because of the Japanese soldier's sense of duty to the Emperor. When Fellers returns to Tokyo, he decides he must interview Teizaburō Sekiya, a member of the Privy Council. Sekiya, like Konoe, does not give any evidence to exonerate the Emperor.  During Fellers' interview with Kido, he discusses the time before the Japanese surrender. The Supreme Council's deadlock between those in favour of surrender and those who were not led the Emperor to address the Council. Because there were strong militarists in the army, the Emperor made an audio recording of his order to surrender. Before the recording could be broadcast, the militarists attempted [[Kyūjō Incident|a coup]] and attacked the Imperial Palace. The Emperor and Kido survived and broadcast the recording. Unfortunately for Fellers, the other witnesses committed suicide and all records were destroyed, leaving him only with Kido's testimony. Kido informs Fellers the Emperor's role is, in actuality, a ceremonial one and the Emperor was influential in ending the war.  Fellers decides to visit General Kajima, who was also Aya's uncle. General Kajima explains to Fellers that the Japanese people are selfless and capable of great sacrifice as well as unspeakable crimes because of their devotion to a set of values. Kajima does not know if the Emperor is guilty, but he notes his role in ending the war. He gives Fellers a box of folded letters written by Aya to Fellers and learns Aya died in an Allied bombing raid.  Fellers concludes it cannot be determined whether the Emperor is guilty or innocent, but his role in ending the war was significant. He gives his conclusion to MacArthur, who is displeased because of the lack of conclusive evidence. Fellers argues the Emperor should be exonerated as the Allies agreed they would allow Japan to keep him as the head of state. MacArthur orders Fellers to arrange a meeting between him and the Emperor. Before the Emperor arrives, Fellers informs MacArthur of his role in diverting Allied bombers away from Shizuoka. MacArthur replies because no American lives were lost because of it, he will turn a blind eye. When Emperor Hirohito arrives, he offers himself to be punished rather than Japan. MacArthur states he has no intention of punishing Japan or Hirohito and wishes to discuss Japan's reconstruction.  
Ernest & Celestine
 Celestine is a young mouse who lives in the underground world of rodents. At the orphanage where she lives, the caretaker known as the Gray One tells scary stories about the evil nature of the bears that live in the outside world, though Celestine doubts they are entirely true. She loves to draw but must soon study dentistry, since that's what all rodents do, and to prepare, she must travel above ground to collect bear cubs' lost teeth from underneath pillows. On one such occasion, the cub's family catches Celestine in the act and chases her into a trash can where she is trapped and spends the night. The next morning, a destitute and starving bear named Ernest discovers Celestine and attempts to eat her.  Celestine convinces him to let her go by helping him break into the basement of a candy shop, where he can eat his fill.  He is soon caught by the store's owner, however, and arrested.  Celestine, who is behind on her quota of collected teeth, agrees to free him from the police wagon if he will help her break into and rob the teeth from the office of the store owner's wife, who happens to be a dentist.  Although the robbery initially seems successful, the pair soon find themselves being pursued by the police forces of both the mouse and bear cities.  They manage to evade capture by stealing a van, and escape to Ernest's remote cabin.  Ernest is initially reluctant to allow Celestine to stay with him, but they begin to bond after he discovers her love of art.  He reveals to her that his current destitution is a result of his rejection of his family's plan for him to go into law, like his ancestors, due to his desire to become an entertainer.  The two spend the winter happily together, though their joy is somewhat dampened by the constant radio broadcasts declaring that both police forces are still searching for them.  In the Spring, the police are able to track the stolen van to the cabin.  Ernest is arrested by the mice, while Celestine is arrested by the bears.  Both are simultaneously put on trial, in the main floor and basement of the same courthouse. Though each of them protest their unfair treatment along with the government's bias and prejudice, as well as refusing to sell out their respective companion, the furious judges refuse to listen. Ernest and Celestine then call the judges and the rest of the higher class out on their cruelty to the lower class common folk. During the proceedings, a fire is accidentally started in the courthouse, and while the rest of the citizens flee despite the furious judges' demands to stay, Ernest and Celestine each stay behind to rescue their respective judges. The judges are both humiliated and broken that their people, the ones they thought they could always rule, have abandoned them to save their own lives while the ones they sought to wrongfully punish are their saviors. Having truly admitted defeat in their own hearts, the shameful judges drop the charges against them and have no other choice then to grant their wish to be able to remain living together. All the while, the judges express their inability to comprehend the concept of unconditional bonds; and can only watch along with the shaken populace of each place as the courthouses burn to the ground.  Reunited in Ernest's cabin, the pair decide to write and illustrate a book, telling the story of their friendship, though with some embellishments after Celestine protests including the part of their meeting where Ernest attempted to eat her.

When Ruth enters one of the rooms, visions of torture overwhelm her, and she says that the victims were psychics like her.  An entity harasses them in a hallway, and Ruth tells them to remain calm, as it feeds off of their reactions.

Relieved, Kate and Matt split up to recover their equipment.  After she sees suspicious footage of Ruth's battle with Mischka, Kate becomes concerned for Matt, only to find him dead.

Bandits led by Dagmar kill her entire family; Dagmar herself murders Signe's brother Tormod as she watches helplessly.  Before the bandits can kill Signe, Dagmar stops them and orders them to take her prisoner.  At their camp, Signe meets Frigg, a young girl that Dagmar has adopted.  When Frigg shows kindness to Signe, Dagmar chastises her and says that Signe deserves no compassion, as her people have driven them to banditry.  Arvid, Dagmar's lover, stops Loke from raping Signe.  As the others watch Arvid and Loke fight, Signe strains to recover Loke's dropped knife.  Frigg notices and alerts Dagmar, who tasks Frigg with Signe's punishment, cutting off a finger.  When Signe calls Dagmar a witch, Dagmar gloats that she will soon allow the men to rape Signe, as she wants Frigg to have a younger sister.  Instead of cutting off Signe's finger, Frigg frees her.  As the others sleep, the two girls sneak out of the camp.  The bandits wake and give chase, though Signe and Frigg evade them in the nearby forest.  One bandit dies when Signe destroys a log bridge as he attempts to cross it.  Dagmar stops them from killing Signe, and the girls escape as the bandits search for another crossing point.

Dagmar promises to allow Signe to live if Frigg surrenders.  Signe, knowing that Dagmar will not keep her word, jumps off the cliff just as Dagmar signals Grim to kill her.  Signe survives her fall, and, after dreaming of her murdered family, buries Trygve.  After retrieving his spear, she goads Skjalg into chasing her and uses it to impale him as Trygve taught her.  Her next trap fails to kill Grim, and she is forced to use a bow and arrow to shoot him, a weapon that her father had unsuccessfully attempted to teach her earlier.  Her first shot misses. Remaining calm, she hits and kills Grim with her second shot.  Dagmar uses Frigg as bait to lure Signe. As Signe frees the bound girl, Dagmar attacks. As Dagmar drowns Signe in a river, Frigg calls out to her, addressing Dagmar as her mother.  Dagmar turns toward her joyously, and Signe kills Dagmar while her back is turned.  Together, the girls bury Signe's family, and Signe hands Frigg a necklace she made for her brother.  When Frigg asks what the rune on it means, Signe explains that it means "family".

Salvaged from Unit 01, Shinji is fitted with an explosive [[choker]] and sent to Colonel [[Misato Katsuragi]], who now leads WILLE, an organization intent on destroying her previous employer NERV, the paramilitary organization that deploys the Evangelion units. As more drones attack, Misato launches the flying battleship ''Wunder'', powered by Unit 01, to destroy them. Shinji is warned that he will be killed if he pilots any Evangelion units because of Near Third Impact, which has also prevented Shinji and his peers from aging. The other previous occupant of Unit 01, [[Rei Ayanami]], was never found.  An Evangelion unit, [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Mark 09|Mark.09]], intercepts the ''Wunder''. Hearing Rei's voice, Shinji escapes with the unit. Rei takes him to the ruined NERV headquarters. [[Gendo Ikari]], Shinji's father and NERV's leader, informs him that he is to pilot a new Evangelion, [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Unit 13|Unit 13]], with Kaworu.

When Unit 13 reaches the body of the alien lifeform [[Lilith (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Lilith]], Kaworu realizes that the spears are not what he expected. Kaworu, Asuka and Mari attempt to stop Shinji, but Shinji removes the spears. On Gendo's orders, Mark.09 decapitates [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Mark.06|Mark.06]] to release the Twelfth Angel, which is absorbed by Unit 13.  The awakened Unit 13 rises into the sky, starting another cataclysm, the Fourth Impact. Kaworu reveals that as the First Angel, he is now "cast down" to the Thirteenth. Rei loses control of Mark.09, which boards ''Wunder'' on its own in an attempt to take control of the ship. Rei ejects from her unit and Asuka blows up her own unit to destroy Mark.09. To stop the Fourth Impact, Kaworu stabs Unit 13 with the spears and allows the choker to kill him, to Shinji's horror.

 Tom, a scientist, invents a machine that can insert a person into the subconscious mind of another person. Desperate for funding to complete his prototype, he is forced to accept money from an anonymous investor. When the investor threatens to pull out, Tom reluctantly agrees to a demonstration a month ahead of schedule. The investor turns out to be an official at the Department of Corrections who wants to use the machine to extract involuntary confessions from convicts. Initially repulsed by the idea, Tom's friend, an entrepreneur, convinces him to proceed, and Tom enters the mind of Anthony, an addict who is suspected of having killed his girlfriend Adrienne. Though Anthony volunteers in order to prove his innocence, Tom is able to walk through Anthony's fractured memories and prove his guilt. However, when Tom tries to return his consciousness to his own body, the machine malfunctions and traps him in Anthony's mind. Unable to leave, Tom passes the years by watching Anthony's memories, while his body remains in a coma.  Meanwhile, Anthony returns to jail and, despite his father's lack of faith in him, still maintains his innocence. When his father gives him a box of photographs, Anthony happens to recall a memory as Tom watches it. Inside the memory, Anthony stares in shock at Tom, something that Tom believes to be impossible. Convinced that this will allow him to communicate with Anthony, Tom haunts a commonly-recalled memory and waits for Anthony to stumble on him again. When they make contact, Tom explains his situation and asks for Anthony's help. Anthony agrees and sets up a meeting with Tom's wife, Abbey. With Tom's help, Anthony is able to convince her to set up another experiment with the machine, though she must agree to give the technology to the Department of Corrections in order to get authorization.

Understanding that he is dying, Anthony abandons his revenge on his former friend and instead drives to Abbey. With Tom's help, Anthony is able to guide Abbey through the process and extract Tom from his unconscious. Anthony dies from his wounds, but Tom is finally reunited with his family.  Haunted by merged memories, Tom makes contact with Anthony's father, Martino, who reveals that he set up his son for Adrienne's death, in the belief that jail would finally allow Anthony to clean up from his addiction. Finally realizing that Anthony was innocent all along, Tom pieces together the last few parts of the repressed memory: Adrienne breaks up with Anthony because of the guilt she feels over cheating on him, and when Anthony confronts her, she commits suicide.

Evil Head
  For their vacation, [[Ash Williams|Ash]], his wife [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Linda|Linda]], their friend [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Scotty|Scotty]], and his wife [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Shelly|Shelly]] travel to an apparently abandoned woodland cabin, where they find a recorder, audio reels, and an old book. Scotty plays one of the reels, which were made by the cabin's owners, [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Professor Raymond Knowby|Professor Raymond Knowby]], and his wife, [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Henrietta Knowby|Henrietta]]. The reel reveals that the professor and his wife were working on translating the book, a seemingly demonic sex guide known as the ''[[Necronomicon|Necronomicum]] Ex-Mortis''. While reciting [[Klaatu barada nikto|a mantra]] that he found in the ''Necronomicum'', Knowby seemingly went insane, laughing maniacally as he repeated the words over and over again, awakening an evil force.  The group ignores the reel, and while Shelly goes to lie down, Ash, Linda, and Scotty have a [[threesome]] in a bedroom. Shelly walks in on the trio and, distraught over Scotty's infidelity, runs out into the forest, where she is violated by possessed trees that turn her into a "Deadite". Shelly returns to the cabin, knocks Ash out, and stabs Linda with a piece of bark that she pulls out of her vagina, infecting the other woman with the evil. Shelly proceeds to seduce Scotty, have sex with him, and rip his throat and testicles out.  When Shelly tries to attack Linda, Ash fends her off with a fireplace poker, and locks her in the cellar, but she escapes, and begins having sex with the now demonic Linda. Aroused by the sight of the two Deadites going at it, Ash tries fingering Shelly, which results in his hand becoming possessed. Ash is forced to cut his hand off with a chainsaw, which he then uses to kill Shelly by forcing her to "ride" the tool's blade.  Linda, who has returned to normal, confronts Ash with a locket identical to the one that he had earlier given her. Inside the locket is a picture of Ash having sex with another woman, which angers Linda to the point of causing her to turn back into a Deadite. Ash and Linda wind up having sex; afterward, Ash beheads Linda with the chainsaw, and takes her body out into the woods to dispose of it. Linda's still-living severed head taunts Ash, annoying him into masturbating onto it out of spite.  Ash returns to the cabin, and goes into hysterics when the furniture and fixtures (including a mounted deer head) go haywire. Outside, Linda (who has reattached her head) rises from the grave, along with Deadite versions of two of Ash's ex-girlfriends. Ash tries to kill the Deadites with the chainsaw (which he has replaced his missing hand with) but it will not start, leaving him unable to fight off the demonesses as they force him into an [[orgy]]. The reverse gangbang ends with Ash using the now functional chainsaw to dismember the undead women as he quips, "Groovy!"  
The Factory (2012 film)
 In [[Buffalo, New York]], a man named Carl picks up a woman he thinks is a prostitute and takes her to his home. When he spots that she is [[transsexual]], he angrily murders her, cuts up the body, and places the pieces in a freezer. Meanwhile, Mike Fletcher, a detective, becomes obsessed with the case, which is under threat of being shut down due to its inactivity. A troubled [[Thanksgiving]] holiday dinner reveals that he has been ignoring his family, including his rebellious daughter, Abby. Following an argument with her mother, Abby sneaks out of the house to be with her boyfriend Tad. At the diner where he works, Tad breaks up with her, and Abby runs outside. Tad sees her talk to a person in a car; when he next looks, she has disappeared. Carl kidnaps Abby and chains her up in his basement, where he keeps two other young women prisoner, Brittany and Lauren, who suffer from [[Stockholm Syndrome]].  Mike and his partner, Kelsey Walker, immediately investigate Abby's disappearance. Although he initially denies any knowledge of Abby's disappearance, Tad shows up at the police station the next day and identifies Darrell, a former suspect and Carl's co-conspirator, who he saw at the diner. Mike and Kelsey interrogate Darrell, but Mike physically assaults him and is taken off the case. Mike breaks into Darrell's house and finds a list of pharmaceuticals that Darrell has supplied to Carl, before Kelsey shows up to back him up. He takes the list to the hospital and has a brief conversation with Carl, who works as a cook there. Darrell's boss tells Mike that Darrell has not shown up for work and the list of drugs is written by a non-professional. Mike calls the company on the back of the list in the hope of finding him, but they are too busy to immediately respond.  That night, a snow storm shuts down the airport and forces Darrell to stay in town. Mike and Kelsey track Darrell to a hotel but find Darrell dead and circumstantial evidence planted by Carl pointing to him as the kidnapper. Mike receives a call from the company, which turns out to be a catering company. He pieces that together with details of Carl's description by a would-be victim and realizes that Carl is the killer. He and Kelsey make their way to Carl's house as Kelsey reports it over the phone. Meanwhile, Abby, who had framed Brittany for breaking Carl's rules, convinces him that Brittany was just celebrating the fact she is pregnant, and Abby takes Brittany's place for a special dinner he had planned; she uses this opportunity to stab him with a corkscrew. Carl throws her back into the basement, where a pregnant Lauren's water has broken. Due to her immobility, she asks Abby to help cut the baby out.  Mike and Kelsey arrive at the house and find plenty of evidence, including a nursery with several babies in it. They hear noises from below, and, searching for the basement, Mike briefly talks to Abby over the house intercom. Abby tells him that Carl keeps the basement door key around his neck. Mike confronts and shoots Carl, but Kelsey picks up Carl's discarded shotgun and shoots Mike, revealing that she was with Carl the entire time (as she was Carl's first victim); her infertility left them unable to have children, so he set up the operation to kidnap prostitutes and force them to have children. Carl dies, but before Kelsey kills Mike, he reveals that Abby is pregnant. Kelsey frees Abby and takes Lauren's just-born baby, assuring them that they're safe. The police find Carl's nursery, which is now empty. Weeks later, Kelsey, using a new name, is shown to have moved to another city with the missing babies. She leaves a phone message to Abby in which she congratulates Abby on her expectant motherhood, which Abby later listens to, including the sound of a baby crying in the background.

Natsu follows Dist and knocks him off the phoenix, but the monster continues to rampage and begins absorbing the wizards' magic for a final, cataclysmic attack.  With her memories now restored, Éclair reveals to Lucy that she is immortal, having drank the phoenix's blood to survive the destruction of her village 400 years ago, which is now Veronica.

A Fantastic Fear of Everything
 Jack is a children's author whose happy marriage has been destroyed by his obsession with his unpublished first book, ''Harold the Hedgehog''. He is working on a series of scripts titled ''Decades of Death'', about [[Victorian era]] serial killers. He has become obsessed with serial killers and paranoid that people are watching him and trying to kill him, which isn't helped by the fact that a serial killer called the [[Hanoi]] Handshake Killer, who cuts off the fingers of his victims, has been active in his neighbourhood.  While trying to give money in a sock to carolers, Jack is startled by a phone call from his agent, Claire. She tells him that Harvey Humphries, the head of scripts at the [[BBC]], is interested in Jack's scripts and arranges a meeting between the two in just a few hours. Jack convinces himself that Humphries is a serial killer but plans to attend the meeting anyway.  Jack tries to clean his clothes in the oven to be presentable for his meeting with Humphries, only to find that he has [[Cyanoacrylate|super-glued]] a carving knife to his hand. After trying to remove the knife, he discovers that his clothes are ruined. Jack realises that he has to go to the [[Self-service laundry|laundrette]]. Since he is terrified of the prospect, he calls Professor Friedkin, an old friend, and asks for help. After listening to Jack's traumatic memories of the launderette, Friedkin convinces Jack that he must confront his fears and go there.  While at the laundrette, he doesn't understand how the machines work. Frustrating the fellow patrons, he decides to just dry the clothes because he doesn't have time to wash them again. A beautiful young woman then enters, causing Jack further distress, so he rushes to remove his damp clothes from the dryer so he can leave. Forgetting that the carving knife is still glued to his hand, he removes his hand from his pocket and causes the other customers to panic and lock him in the laundrette.  The police arrive, break into the laundrette and subdue Jack. The police remove the knife from his hand and treat his wounds. They are about to take him to the police station when a helicopter flies over and announces that there is an emergency and they are needed elsewhere. They hastily throw Jack into the back of the police van and drive off, but he falls out of the vehicle as it begins driving.  Perkins, a [[Police community support officer|community support police officer]], follows the young woman while Jack returns to the laundrette to get his clean shirt for his meeting. While Jack is changing into his shirt, he notices that a back door that had been locked is now open. He goes through the door and finds a hatch in the floor. As he looks through the hatch, someone hits him from behind.  Jack wakes up in the basement of the laundrette tied up next to the young woman. As they begin to panic, Perkins comes down the stairs. They urge him to get help but he reveals that he is the Hanoi Handshake Killer; he cuts the fingers off of his victims and blames the killings on the [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] [[mafia]]. Perkins says the laundrette used to belong to his grandmother until the Vietnamese immigrants pushed her out, and he now murders for revenge. He then goes upstairs to sharpen his knife.  Jack tells the woman about the traumatic events in his childhood regarding the launderette, and she comforts him and urges him not to give up hope. She says her name is Sangeet and Jack asks her if she will have dinner with him if they survive. Perkins returns carrying a [[boombox]] playing the song "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]" by [[Europe (band)|Europe]]. Perkins and Jack argue about the song's genre, causing Perkins to tell them about his childhood. His mother died when he was very young and his grandmother took him in and gave him a room in the cellar. During this story we see that this was the same launderette that Jack was abandoned in and he was being watched by Perkins from the back room.  Jack and Sangeet try to get Perkins to admit that his grandmother did not take proper care of him. Jack argues that Tony is not a good serial killer because he is not original (he supposedly has his grandmother's body in a rocking chair, which references the film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.)  Sangeet frees herself and injures Perkins as he is about to murder Jack. Sangeet tries to escape but Perkins recovers and drags her back into the cellar. As Perkins is struggling with Sangeet, she frantically suggests that Jack tell a story. Jack convinces Perkins to listen to a story as his final request. Jack tells a story called ''Brian the Hedgehog''; Perkins relates to the story and cries, admitting that he didn't kill the first victim and he had only found the body. The owner of the launderette opens the hatch, prompting Jack and Sangeet to scream for help.  Several months later, we see a well-groomed Jack reading his book about Harold and Brian to a group of children. Sangeet and Professor Friedkin are there. Clair finally introduces Jack to Humphries, causing Jack to become briefly fearful. Sangeet reminds Jack that they are going to dinner, and so they leave the event and catch a taxi as the credits roll over the frame.  
Farewell, My Queen
 In 1789, on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]] still live their routines, relatively unconcerned by the increasing turmoil in [[Paris]] a mere twenty miles away. The routines are seen through the eyes of the young Sidonie Laborde, who serves Queen [[Marie Antoinette]].  When news about the [[storming of the Bastille]] reaches the Court, most aristocrats and servants desert the Palace and abandon the Royal Family, fearing that the government is falling. But Sidonie, a true believer in the monarchy, refuses to flee. She feels secure under the protection of the Royal Family. She does not know these are the last three days she will spend by the Queen's side.  The Queen orders Sidonie to disguise herself as [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron]], [[Duchess of Polignac]], and serve as bait so that the latter can safely flee to Switzerland. This Sidonie does, despite a prior warning from one of the Queen's ladies in waiting.  Sidonie is stripped naked and then redressed in a green gown. The coach carrying Sidonie is also occupied by the real Duchess and her husband, dressed as her servants. They treat her with disdain during the journey but she plays her role convincingly enough to enable the party to safely cross the border. As the film ends, she remarks that she has no connections other than her position as reader to the Queen, and soon she will be a nobody.

Famous Five (film)
 '''Chapter 1 The start'''  Julian, Dick and Anne get off a bus at a lonely street near by the sea. Anne mentions, that someone should have picked them up, but the Kirrins don't have a car. Julian puts Anne in mind of not calling Georgina "Georgina" but "George". A woman in a car arrives and introduces herself as Mrs. Miller, the neighbour of the Kirrins, and she takes the children to their destination. Whilst that George is hitting a punching bag, when her mother tells her to be friendly to their upcoming guests. George is not happy of having them stay with them and tells her mother that she doesn't need any friends. When the three siblings arrive together with Mrs. Miller, Uncle Quentin is packing, because he plans to stay the next days on Kirrin Island ("Felseninsel") where he wants to concentrate on his research work. At the welcome scene Anne calls her cousin accidentally "Georgina" but corrects herself immediately. Around a corner of the house a man is secretly taking pictures of Uncle Quentin.  '''Chapter 2 Here you live'''  George loathly shows the three the house and their room. Dick tries to get a view into Uncle Quentin's lab, but George slams the door right in front of him. Being asked what her father's research is about she says, that she could tell them, but then had to kill them right after. Anne says, that in this case they didn't want to know. George spends the evening alone by the sea where she meets Timmy. The next morning the children are served some porridge-like stuff for breakfast, which they don't really like. George is persuaded by her mother to do a cycling tour with the three and she wants to take them to the "Teufelsfelsen" (Devil's Rock). Julian and George are having a cycling contest, which Julian almost wins but is tricked by George. He tells her, that it's no wonder that she's having no friends. George leaves them alone and cycles to the harbour to say Goodbye to her father, who promises to send her a blip every evening so she will know he's OK. Meeting Mrs. Miller it becomes obvious, that she hides Timmy, who isn't allowed to stay in the Kirrins' house. Again Uncle Quentin is secretly photographed by a man. Julian, Dick and Anne try to find the Teufelsfelsen on their own. They meet a couple next to the sea, who don't know the way either.  '''Chapter 3 Saving Timmy'''  [[File:Valeria Eisenbart.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Valeria Eisenbart (2012) plays George]] [[Image:Timmy (Famous Five - Fünf Freunde 2012).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Filmdog Coffey plays Timmy]] Finally they find the Teufelsfelsen and enter a cave regardless of a sign saying "stay out, dangerous", because they hear the barking of a dog from inside. Julian almost falls into a hole, where they spot Timmy the Dog at the bottom of it. With their jackets and a rope they let down Julian in the hole and pull up Timmy. Then Dick and Anne try to pull up Julian, but are unable to hold the rope. They nearly drop him the second time when George comes up and together they pull Julian out of the hole. George realises that the three saved Timmy and she thanks them.  '''Chapter 4 The voice in the cave'''  Together they examine the cave and find a radio transmitter with a voice distortion device. They listen and answer to a voice saying "It's about time we took care of the professor. Let's hope he co-operates." and after finding a map of Kirrin Island George figures out, that there is somebody after her father. They run to call the police. Dick writes down the frequency of the radio on a piece of paper he found next to it. At the local police station they finally convince PC Peters, who is already quite comfortable on this Friday afternoon, to come with them to the cave. Back to the cave his assistant PC Hansen has already blocked the area with lots of barrier tape "police line, do not cross". Both policemen don't seem to be very smart. Inside the cave the radio is gone and there is no evidence left that there ever was one. The children are taken back to Aunt Fanny and get a fine for illegally entering the cave. George is blamed by her mother, but the others tell her that they did this together.  '''Chapter 5 Blip'''  George is upset and tries to convince her mother that Uncle Quentin might be in danger. Then they see the blip from Kirrin Island, telling them that everything is OK. On that evening the four of them are together in George's room and she tells them about the secret work of Uncle Quentin: He is developing a technique to produce electricity with plants. He seems to be quite save on Kirrin Island, for the island is surrounded by dangerous rocks, where only he knows the way through them. George never was on Kirrin Island. The friends decide to unmask the unknown persons (called the "alphas") threatening Uncle Quentin. The next morning they sneak out of the house and want to go to the cave looking for clues. We learn that Timmy is banned from the Kirrins´ house, because he accidentally destroyed parts of Uncle Quentin's work and now lives with Mrs. Miller. On the way to the cave Anne notices a man, who installs a video camera in the dunes to spy on Kirrin Island. It is the man, who formerly took pictures of Uncle Quentin. They follow the man to a hotel, where he has rented a room.  [[File:Quirin Oettl.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Quirin Oettl (2012) plays Julian]] '''Chapter 6 False alarm'''  The friends try to figure out how to get into the room of the suspect and examine it. They cause a false fire alarm getting everybody out of the hotel and then enter the room. They find a lot of information that this man has about Uncle Quentin. Shortly after that the false alarm is ended and now time is running short, because the man is coming back to his room. Even Timmy doesn't succeed to detract him and the friends have to escape through the bathroom window and jump from the roof into a laundry container, not without taking pictures of the evidence they have spottet.  '''Chapter 7 Chase'''  The man chases them through the village and along the beach on a bike. They finally hide at the couple that Julian, Dick and Anne have met on their first way to the cave near the beach. This couple tells them that they are bird watchers looking for a puffin. After that George takes the others to their secret place, an abandoned shipwreck, that she has equipped all on her own. Suddenly the man who has hunted them appears. He introduces himself as Peter Turner, an agent from a European secret service. After passing several tests the Five trust him, believing that he only wants to help Uncle Quentin.  '''Chapter 8 With the secret agent'''  We learn that the secret service does not know who is after Uncle Quentin and his work, but Uncle Quentin refuses to receive help from the secret service. The children are told to keep their eyes open but not to interfere. The agent then examines the cave on his own. The friends are recapitulating the information that have by now. Dick shows the piece of paper he picked up in the cave and George finds out, that there is an imprint of a signature on it and she makes it readable. They call agent Turner, who tries to answer the call, but is being knocked out by an unknown person at that very moment. The friends are unaware of that and conclude to find out the author of that signature by their own, because that must be one of the villains. It is Dick's plan to get a signature from all the inhabitants of the village and compare it with the signature on the paper. [[File:Justus Schlingensiepen.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Justus Schlingensiepen (2012) plays Dick]]  '''Chapter 9 Police check'''  Anne is collecting people's signatures for a faked campaign "save the seals" and is getting controlled by the two policemen. As she doesn't have an approval for her information desk, she tells the policemen that they are collecting signatures to convict the people who are after Uncle Quentin. By the way she learns from the policemen that the bird watchers want to visit Kirrin Island. With that information and not having found any matching signatures by now the friends now concentrate on the bird watchers and find out, that they have a hovercraft, which could bring them to Kirrin Island in spite of the dangerous rocks. The bird watchers act quite suspicious and they also have a pocketbook with them, that the children have formerly seen in the cave.  '''Chapter 10 The lab on the island'''  On the island Uncle Quentin is working on his invention, almost forgetting to send the blip to George. By now the friends are sure, that the bird watchers are the villains. They plan to sabotage the hovercraft to prevent them to get to Kirrin Island. While George and Anne are distracting the bird watchers Julian and Dick get on the hovercraft.  '''Chapter 11 on the hovercraft'''  Accidentally Julian and Dick start the hovercraft and speed through the harbour bay unable to get it under control. They finally crash into some pile of junk on the mole destroying the hovercraft and the equipment on it. They want the police to arrest the pretending bird watchers and try to prove that they are fake. But it emerges that they are real bird watchers and not the villains.  '''Chapter 12 The children are in danger'''  Aunt Fanny is horrified when she hears from the policemen what the children have done. The friends are helpless and confused, because everything seemed so obvious. Julian gets a call from his father who wants them to come home immediately. George wants them to stay and help her. Julian accuses her, that it was her idea to sabotage the hovercraft, what got them into that big trouble, and George runs out of the room seeming to end the friendship with Julian, Dick and Anne. Back in her shipwreck she takes the fine order, which she got for illegally entering the cave, out of her pocket. She takes a look at the signature and learns that it matches to the so far unidentified signature on the piece of paper Dick found in the cave. As PC Hansen has signed the fine order it is now clear, that he must be one of the villains. George follows him.  [[File:Neele Marie Nickel.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Neele Marie Nickel (2012) plays Anne]] '''Chapter 13 Back home'''  The next morning the three siblings sadly start their journey back home with Mrs. Miller bringing them to the bus station in her car. Whilst that PC Hansen enters the cave with George and Timmy breathing down to his neck. She follows him into a tunnel that leads under the sea and directly to Kirrin Island. George reaches the island and her father's lab and finds him captured by PC Peters, who has a bomb with him.  '''Chapter 14 The end of the coffee party'''  Then PC Hansen captures George and Uncle Quentin promises to give his invention to Peters and Hansen, when they promise not to hurt George. George is arrested in a cell under the lab and Timmy runs away. We learn that Agent Turner is also jailed by Peters and Hansen and that the two policemen have set the friends on a wrong track so that they suspected the bird watchers.

Filmistaan
  In Mumbai, an affable [[Indian Hindu|Indian]] [[Punjabi Hindu]] Bollywood buff and wanna-be-actor Suneet ("Sunny"), who works as an assistant director, fantasizes on becoming a heart-throb star. However, at every audition he is summarily thrown out. Undeterred, he goes with an American crew to remote areas in Rajasthan to work on a documentary. While filming near the India-Pakistan border, the crew encounters Indian police officers patrolling the area. After the American director unsuccessfully argues that he has obtained official permission to film anywhere in Rajasthan, Sunny entertains the chief officer and plays to his desire to be exalted and filmed. Impressed and in a happy mood, the officer allows the crew to continue their work.  Later in the night, as Sunny is busy changing the tire of his car, the rest of the crew leaves in another vehicle. On his drive back, he encounters a cyclist lying on the road and checks him out, but soon realizes from the shadows that it's a ruse. A terrorist Muslim Jihadist group kidnaps him and brings him and his camera equipment to Pakistan. The group leader is disappointed that their original plan to kidnap an American crew-member didn't occur. He says that holding an American hostage would force the government to meet his demands to avoid international backlash, but an Indian hostage would be worthless. He instructs Mehmood and Jawaad to keep him hostage in a village while the others attempt another kidnapping.  Sunny wakes up to find himself in an unfamiliar house. He demands to be let go, but after Mehmood gives him the opportunity to walk out, he stays realizing they will kill him if he did. The house where he is confined belongs to Aftaab, a Pakistani Muslim whose trade stems from pirated Hindi films, which he brings back every time he crosses the border. Aftaab gets enamored by Sunny's camera equipment as he too loves movies. Aftaab plays Sunny's favorite film ''[[Maine Pyaar Kiya]]'' from a pirated DVD for the villagers to watch. Sunny wants to watch it too, but Mehmood doesn't allow him to leave. Sunny loudly mimics the dialogues of the film in his room and this forces Mehmood to let him join the villagers and watch it. As Sunny helps fill in for the muted dialog of the pirated DVD, Aftaab starts forging a bond with him.  A few day later, a messenger of the group leader arrives with a digital camera and the leader's demand for a hostage video. As none of the group members knows how to operate the camera, Sunny steps in and offers to direct the shot himself. He does several takes as he is repeatedly disappointed with each take and attempting to do better in the next. At first he tried shots with just himself, then with two gunmen pointing guns at him, and finally with Mehmood making the demand himself on-camera. Satisfied with the last take with Mehmood, they return to the village and send off the messenger with the video.  One day while Jawaad is taking a shower, Sunny walks around the area and picks up his gun. He gathers the village children and entertains them with mimicry of how Bollywood actors would shoot their guns. Mehmood and Jawaad sneak up on him thinking he is attempting to escape. Though Mehmood has a clear shot to kill Sunny, he realizes that Sunny is just entertaining the kids but shoots a bullet to graze Sunny's arm to teach him a lesson. The physician who cleaned up the wound and gave Sunny medicines talks about his desire to visit Amritsar as he used to before the partition of India and Pakistan. Sunny tells him that he reminds him of his grandfather who also wanted to visit Lahore as he once could.  After learning that India is playing against Pakistan in a [[cricket]] match, Sunny makes a deal with Mehmood that he would allow him to leave if India wins. The villagers gathered around a truck's radio to hear the match. Though it appeared that Pakistan had a chance, India wins with a six-run hit. Sunny is thrilled and starts dancing, much to the dismay of the villagers. But soon Mehmood is enraged and attempts to destroy his camera equipment. Sunny holds on to the camera to prevent Mehmood from destroying it, and gets slapped hard several times before Jawaad stepped in and stopped him.  The Pakistani border patrol arrives at the village, causing Mehmood to suspect that Aftaab had tipped them off. However, Aftaab convinces them that they are just patrolling and gets them to hide. Sunny tries to make himself known to the patrol, but Aftaab tells him that he would either be killed as an Indian spy or put in prison. Aftaab entertains the patrol officers, gives some pirated DVDs to the chief officer and sends them off. Mehmood gains more trust in Aftaab, while Aftaab grows closer to Sunny and they share their passion for Bollywood movies. Aftaab hopes that Pakistan's Lollywood would also make similar blockbuster movies that Bollywood wants to copy, instead of the B-movies it currently makes.  Aftaab promises to help Sunny escape with his knowledge of the border. They devise a plan where they will invite men of the village to audition for a movie. While shooting a scene for the movie, they enact an escape scene together, raising suspicion of Mehmood but soon dispelling it when they returned. After the scenes were shot, the villages including some women in black [[burqa]] are leaving. Jawaad finds a watch in the sand and returns it to one of the villagers. But later he realizes it is Sunny's watch and Sunny had escaped in a burqa.  Aftaab and Sunny attempt to escape on a motorbike but are soon stopped by Mehmood. He locks both of them up after Aftaab promises to help Sunny escape as long as he is alive, and questions why people like Mehmood are destroying Pakistan in the name of [[Allah]]. When the terrorist group leader arrives at the village, Aftaab's father pleads with him to let Sunny go. He reluctantly agrees realizing that the village could turn against them if he didn't oblige.  Mehmood and Jawaad bring Aftaab and Sunny to a barren land near the border. Mehmood stops the vehicle and claiming that he has orders, he prepares to kill Aftaab and Sunny. However, Jawaad disbelieving him points his gun at Mehmood. After a verbal argument between the two, Mehmood swings his gun to shoot Jawaad but is shot down and falls dead. Jawaad tells both Sunny and Aftaab to escape, saying Aftaab would be killed in Pakistan as a traitor. The group leader soon arrives and kills a desolate Jawaad who was waiting on his knees for his fate.  Sunny and Aftaab wait near the border for the patrol officers to leave, then start running towards the border. The group leader and his assistant catch up with them and start shooting at them. When they hide out behind a grass-patch, Aftaab urges Sunny to escape while he holds them off, but Sunny refuses to leave without him. They again run towards the border while bullets were fired at them but missed, with the interlaced public dialogues of [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in the background. The film closes with them crossing the border milestone and Aftaab turning around to shoot back at the terrorists.

After Jeremy narrowly escapes with his life, police detective Mike Cella, whose old partner was murdered by Hagan while they pursued him in a different case, sees an opportunity to bring justice. Hagan is arrested and Jeremy identifies him in a line up; however, Hagan demonstrates that he knows full well that Jeremy is behind the two-way mirror by reciting Jeremy's full name, address and social security number.  Prior to the trial, Jeremy is forced to change his last name to Douglas and surrender his entire career as he is placed into the witness protection program. Although Jeremy finds it difficult to cope with the loss of his career, he finds consolation in his budding romance with Talia Durham, a Deputy [[United States Marshal]] assigned to his case. Later, Hagan's attorney arranges for him to be released from prison in the weeks leading up to the trial. As a result, Jeremy and Talia find their lives in jeopardy. Talia is wounded by one of Hagan's hit men, and Hagan calls Jeremy, threatening to kill everyone he loves whether he testifies or not. Jeremy vows to kill Hagan first and abandons the witness protection program.  Jeremy travels home to [[Long Beach, California]], where he seeks out an Eastside Crips leader to exact revenge. The Crips decline to help but give him a gun. Jeremy stakes out one of Hagan's hiding places and kills three of his men while in pursuit of Hagan. However, he leaves behind his fingerprints which can not be traced back to him due to his [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|WITSEC]] status. The evidence, though, leads detective Cella to believe Jeremy is behind the killings. Jeremy grows bolder in his actions, torturing one of Hagan's men and confronting Hagan's attorney to find out where Hagan will be. Hagan's attorney, who only works for Hagan out of fear, gives Jeremy the location of an abandoned building Hagan will be at that night.  Talia arrives at Long Beach and tries to convince Jeremy to abandon his plan. Jeremy locks Talia in the bathroom and gets away, but Hagan's hit man arrives soon after and kidnaps Talia. That night, Jeremy, using his firefighting knowledge, sets ablaze the building where Hagan and his men are meeting. When Jeremy realizes Talia is also in the building, he puts on his fireman's suit and enters the building to rescue her. Talia manages to break free of her bonds and kills Hagan's hitman as he attempts to flee the blaze. Jeremy runs into Hagan inside the burning building and, after a struggle, Talia kills Hagan. Jeremy leaves the building with Talia. In the aftermath, detective Cella, while conversing with the DA, states that no evidence was left behind at the burnt building to charge anyone with the deaths of Hagan and his men. Cella is seen putting away a photo of him and his old partner.  
The First Time (2012 film)
 Dave, a senior in high school, is in a back alley at a house party, rehearsing a confession of love for a girl named Jane, when he's interrupted by a junior Aubrey. They talk, and when he practices the speech to get her opinion, she is not impressed. When he offers to dance with her she refuses, explaining that public displays of affection (PDA) are distasteful, in her opinion. She eventually gives in and starts to dance with him, minutes before the police raid the party. Aubrey invites Dave to walk home with her and then into her house, noting that she has a boyfriend. She then invites him to her bedroom. They share some wine and a meaningful conversation.  Aubrey asks him if he's ever had sex, and Dave admits he hasn't, but she refuses to answer the same question. They talk while lying side by side on the floor and both accidentally fall asleep. The next morning, Aubrey’s mother knocks on the door, awakening and surprising both of them. Dave goes through the window to get out of the house, spilling his glass of wine on the carpet in the process.   Dave meets with his friends, the cocky and British Simon and quiet Big Corporation, in a diner for breakfast, telling them about Aubrey. They suggest that claiming to have a boyfriend could be a strategic lie, and tell him he should contact her. Dave receives her home number through a mutual friend and calls her house, catching Aubrey as her parents are berating her about the wine on the rug. Dave informs her that he and his friends are catching a movie that evening, and Aubrey tells Dave she's going to the same theater with her boyfriend Ronny.  Jane and her friends happen to be at the theatre. Aubrey persuades Ronny to go to the same movie as Dave and Jane, as she is feeling a touch of jealousy. Jane repeatedly flirts with Dave inside the theater, sitting next to him, taking off her jacket and attempting to hold his hand. Confused and upset, Aubrey leaves the theater during the film, and a concerned Dave follows her. In the lobby, she apologizes for being strange on the phone and having him jump off the roof. They have another conversation, in which Dave gets her cell phone number and invites her and Ronny to Jane's friend's house afterwards.   At the friend's house, Aubrey and Jane end up together at the pool, and talk about Dave. Jane has high praise for Dave, but clearly takes him for granted while complaining about all the awful guys she's been with. Aubrey seems to suggest that sometimes the right guy is right in front of them, but stops and pretends to have forgotten what she was about to say.   Meanwhile, inside the house, a jealous and tipsy Ronny brags to Dave that he and Aubrey are planning to have sex that night... in his van. This annoys and worries Dave, who finds Aubrey and tells her not to have sex with Ronny, and that her first time shouldn't be with a guy like him. Aubrey denounces the romantic notion of the first time being so important, and tells him it's none of his business. Things take a flirtatious turn but Ronny appears, telling Aubrey they need to go. Dave intervenes, nearly leading to a fight before Simon and Big Corporation intervene, stopping it. Aubrey leaves with Ronny.  At the end of the small party, Dave ends up in a bedroom with Jane, where she half flirts with him before starting to complain about her latest sexual misadventures. Jane notes that something weird is going on with Dave. He realizes he'd rather be with Aubrey and leaves. On his way home, he gets a text from Aubrey asking him to pick her up. Smiling, he obliges. They drive around, she tells him that she's just dumped Ronny. They eventually pass a van that they both recognize, which turns out to be one in which they interacted with the teenagers inside on the night of the party where they met. The van appears to have crashed, and the teenagers inside are no where to be found. This greatly upsets Aubrey, who says she’s going to be sick and Dave pulls over. Throughout this, they gradually reveal and discover their feelings for each other, ending in them kissing in the parking lot where Dave pulled over.   They talk on the phone the next day and meet at a park with Dave’s little sister, Stella. Aubrey learns that her parents are going out and invites Dave over that night. Dave struggles with himself before deciding to not bring a condom.   That night they make out, then hesitate before deciding to have sex. Dave awkwardly puts on a condom that Aubrey has, and the scene fades out as they decide to have sex.  Afterwards, both of them are upset for it hasn't gone well, and they don't know how to talk about it. Everything they say seems to make it worse, and they decide it was all a mistake and they should not see each other.  Later that night, Aubrey keeps looking at her phone hoping Dave will call, while Dave repeatedly picks up his phone to call, but backs down.  He meets with Simon and Big Corporation, telling them that the idea of sex was better than the experience. Simon tells him its no big deal, but Big Corporation reminds him that they spend every weekend looking for someone special and it never happens, but this time it did. He says Dave and Aubrey hit a speed bump because it was their first time, but Dave should be a man and give it another try.   In the following morning, Aubrey tells her parents that she found a great guy and messed it up by pushing him away. Her parents try to make her feel better. Dave is waiting for her in the driveway, declaring his feelings and wants to try again. She leads him to believe she's not interested, but asks for a ride to school. In the car, she expresses her desire to be together and a need to work on the sex, which he happily agrees to. He drops her off and they say goodbye awkwardly, but she runs back to him, breaking her no PDA rule with a warm, passionate kiss in front of the other students.

Alex fires him, telling Tom that he is the better chef and should open his own franchise. Tom launches a specialty taco truck. Meanwhile, Violet starts a relationship with Winton and receives an assistant professorship at the university, but becomes upset when she learns she got the job because she was dating Winton rather than her abilities as a researcher and breaks up with Winton.

Copilot Ken Evans takes over while Whip discreetly mixes [[vodka]] in his orange juice and takes a nap. He is jolted awake as the plane goes into a steep dive. Unable to regain control, Whip is forced to make a controlled crash landing in an open field losing consciousness on impact.  Meanwhile, [[heroin]] addict Nicole Maggen is on the verge of being evicted. She overdoses on heroin and has to be wheeled out of the house by a paramedic. SouthJet Flight 227 flies inverted overhead in the midst of its emergency landing.  Whip awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries and is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson, who represents the airline's pilots [[Trade union|union]]. He tells Whip that he managed to save 96 out of 102, losing two crew members and four passengers, but mentions his copilot is in a coma. Whip sneaks away for a cigarette in the stairwell and meets Nicole, who is recovering from a heroin overdose in the same hospital. The next morning, his friend and drug dealer Harling Mays picks him up from the hospital.

Later at a crew member's funeral, he attempts to persuade a surviving flight attendant, Margaret Thomason, to tell the NTSB that he was sober.  Whip pays a visit to his co-pilot Ken Evans after he awakens from his coma. Evans has likely lost much of his ability to walk and may never pilot an airplane again.

Harling is called, who revives him with cocaine. At the hearing, lead NTSB investigator Ellen Block explains that a damaged [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] assembly [[jackscrew]] was the primary cause of the crash. She commends Whip on his valor and skill and notes that no other pilot was able to land the plane in trial simulations of the crash. She then reveals that two empty vodka bottles were found in the plane's trash, despite the fact that beverages had not been served to passengers, and that Whip's test was excluded for technical reasons. The only other member of the crew to test positive for alcohol was Trina, who died in the crash, and with whom Whip had spent the night before. Whip, unable to bring himself to blame Trina for his actions, admits to being intoxicated the day of the crash.  Thirteen months later, an imprisoned Whip tells a support group of fellow inmates that he is glad to be sober and does not regret doing the right thing. Whip is seen looking at pictures of Nicole, family, and friends on the wall of his cell, along with greeting cards congratulating him on being sober for a year. He is working to rebuild his relationship with his son, who visits to talk with him about a college application essay on "the most fascinating person that I've never met." His son begins by asking, "Who are you?" As a plane flies overhead, Whip replies, "That's a good question."

The Flowers of War
 In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal [[Nanking massacre]].  As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their [[convent]] at a Western-run [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral. Here, John Miller ([[Christian Bale|Bale]]), an American [[mortician]] on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls.  He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape.  After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a [[chorale]] for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the [[virgin]]al schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13.  When the [[de facto]] leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo ([[Ni Ni|Ni]]), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son, volunteers as well. Miller initially opposes their self-sacrificing decision, but ultimately assists in disguising them, using his skills as a mortician to adjust their makeup and cut their hair to appear like schoolgirls. The prostitutes also create knives out of broken windows and hide them in their cloaks.  The next day, the "13 Flowers of Nanking" are led away by the unsuspecting Japanese soldiers. After they depart, Miller hides the schoolgirls on the truck he repaired and, using a single-person permit provided by the father of a schoolgirl, drives out of Nanking. In the last scene, the truck is seen driving on a deserted highway heading west, away from the advancing Japanese army. The fate of the 13 Flowers remains unknown, apparently martyring themselves for the students' freedom.

The Forger (2012 film)
 Joshua Mason ([[Josh Hutcherson]]) is a troubled 15-year-old who is abandoned by his mother at a motel in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea]]. The story begins with Joshua finishing a painting at an old mission and selling it for $50, only to be caught by the artist who had left the painting on an easel.  He returns to the motel room to sleep. When the motel manager comes to collect payment, Joshua grabs his belongings and runs out the back door.  A social worker, Vanessa Reese, visits the manager and he explains that he hasn't seen the boy's mother for some time. He shows Vanessa the room and that the boy has painted some amazing art on the walls, mirror and ceiling. Joshua, meanwhile, wanders around the town and chats to a girl, Amber, through a school yard fence. One of the school's faculty reprimands Amber for not returning to school and grabs her by the arm to take her to the principal's office. Joshua becomes upset with how aggressive the teacher is, pulling at her arm,  and shouts at him to give her a break and pick on someone his own size. Joshua climbs the fence and pulls Amber from the teacher's grip only to be confronted by two boys - one of them her brother Ryan, who thinks she's being harassed. Joshua punches Ryan, who then punches back. Joshua runs off, climbs the fence and shouts back he's sorry to the girl. When it starts to rain, he hides in a [[culvert]] but gets caught in the flowing water. His hand is cut as he falls out of the culvert into the sea/coast below.   Joshua walks along the rocky coastline and happens upon a large sea-side mansion and finding a side door that's been left open, 'breaks' in. He showers, cleans up his cut and now starving, makes himself a large sandwich. While exploring the mansion, he finds an art studio with a painting that is half complete (being copied from a photo) and finishes it before falling asleep. When he awakens he's confronted by the police and taken to child services. He tells the social worker that he doesn't know where his mother is.  Back at the mansion, the owner, Everly ([[Alfred Molina]]), finds the now-finished painting and believes the boy has real talent since he had been unable to find anyone to complete the portrait, let alone do it with such complete accuracy. Everly decides to take in the boy thinking that he might be able to exploit his art talent. While eating breakfast one morning, Everly gives Joshua an expensive fountain pen as a gift and the two talk about art. Joshua, knowing little on the history of art, jokingly tells Everly that his favorite artist is [[Hank Ketcham]], the creator of [[Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics)|Dennis the Menace]].  During a charity art benefit, Joshua meets a kind old woman named Anne-Marie Cole ([[Lauren Bacall]]). He also meets Ryan, Amber's brother, and the two apologize to each other about what had gone down at the school yard the other day. Ryan says Amber told him the full story of what happened and thanks Joshua for looking out for his sister. The two talk about Anne-Marie and how she's indeed cool but also loaded.  That night, Joshua breaks into Anne-Marie's home but is unsure of why he does. He begins to go through some of her things and finds a leather-thong necklace with a small vial (filled with something that he later finds out to be cyanide) which he pilfers, as well as a picture of an unknown man. Anne-Marie discovers Joshua in the room and asks him what he is doing. He asks who the man is in the photograph. She tells him it is an artist named George and nothing more. She then calls Everly to come and collect him.  The next day Joshua and Amber talk on the beach. When Amber asks what she could do to repay him, he states that she could give him a kiss. She laughs it off and races him down the beach but drops her keys in an effort to win. She beats him and while trying to get her keys back from him, he kisses her without warning. She pushes him off, demands for him to give her the keys before leaving him on the beach. There he finds a large black dog and learns that it is Anne-Marie's dog Matilda. He takes Matilda home to Anne-Marie and the two of them talk over a bowl of soup.  Meanwhile, Vanessa continues her search to find Joshua's mother and learns that she may be living with her boyfriend. Joshua goes to Amber's and gives her a portrait of her that he had drawn. She smiles and comments that it looks good and invites him to sit with her.  Joshua apologizes for what he did at the beach and that he was foolish for kissing her like that. She tells him that it was the worst kiss she had ever experienced and teaches him how to "properly" kiss a girl.  Meanwhile, Everly has sold the painting that Joshua had completed earlier but needs to complete a [[Winslow Homer]] in just a couple of weeks or lose his art galleries along with everything he owns. He decides to take a risk and use the boy seeing as he is the only one who could complete the portrait accurately and on time.  Joshua attends a party that Amber is throwing and sees her in the arms of another guy, who happens to be her cousin. He grows jealous and follows them in the house and is about to confront him but he is held back by Ryan. Joshua and Ryan fight, resulting in Joshua hitting Ryan with a pool ball.  Joshua goes to Anne-Marie's where she tends to his wounds. She tells him that just seeing something won't give you the truth, that you sometimes have to look at something in a different light. She then asks if he would like to live with her. He tells her that he would have to think about it.  Back at Everly's, Joshua confronts Everly about his forgery scheme and how for $500 he will keep his mouth shut. Everly gives him a different proposition:  If he does one more painting he will get half the money made from it - a possibility of millions. Joshua, amazed, says yes. For a week he learns what forgers have to do so their paintings pass as authentic. When the painting is finished, Joshua and Everly have an unpleasant conversation. Joshua, having second thoughts, then takes the painting from the house and hides it.  Meanwhile, Vanessa finds Joshua's mother living with her boyfriend and a child. Vanessa then calls child protective services to rescue the child. She goes back to her office and takes a closer look at Joshua's file and learns that he has been abused by his mother. She discovers that Anne-Marie wants to become Joshua's permanent guardian. She learns how Anne-Marie had been questioned by the police and fell under suspicion of forgery. Vanessa also learns that Anne-Marie lost her family in a house fire and was unable to save her only surviving daughter.  Joshua goes to Anne-Marie's after hearing a rumor from Everly that she was once a forger.  He goes through her stuff and finds a forger's hammer and a newspaper clipping about how she was suspected of art forgeries. He then runs away feeling that he cannot trust anyone.  Vanessa then meets with Joshua and tells him she could not find his mother. Joshua then breaks down in tears feeling that he is unwanted.  Ryan talks to Joshua and tells him he needs to apologize to Amber, which he does. Joshua then goes ahead and steals the painting. Anne-Marie goes to Everly's to talk to Joshua and finds the door unlocked. She goes in and wanders into the art studio where she learns that Joshua has stolen the painting. Joshua then goes to the art exhibit and returns the painting but before he leaves, Anne-Marie in front of everybody, slices the portrait and tells everyone that it was a forgery and that she at one time painted one of Everly's forgeries and has regretted it ever since. The portrait is confirmed to be a forgery when an underpainting of Dennis the Menace is revealed.  In the end, Joshua agrees to Anne-Marie's request and lives with her, and is also in a relationship with Amber. He states that, "I wasn't sure what I was looking for at first when I broke into Anne-Marie's house, but now I know. I was looking for a place to belong."  
Fortress (2012 film)
 The B-17F ''Lucky Lass'', part of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[99th Air Base Wing|99th Bombardment Group (Heavy)]] (the "Diamondbacks") from the [[Twelfth Air Force|12th Air Force]] is stationed at Navrin, [[Algeria]] in 1943. We learn in the opening reveal that air crews are expected to complete 25 combat missions before they can be sent home. However, losses are heavy and the odds are that only 2 in 10 will survive 25 missions. During a raid on [[Gerbini Airfield|Gerbini]], Italy, with her [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] crew, the ''Lucky Lass'' is heavily damaged and the ([[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] "Pops" (Jamie Martz), and both waist gunners, Jake (Anthony Ocasio) and Joe (Steve Holm) are killed.  Five days later, Wally ([[Donnie Jeffcoat]]) is now the Lass' [[Pilot in command|aircraft commander]]), and replacements arrive. [[First officer (aeronautics)|Co-pilot]] Michael Schmidt ([[Bug Hall]]) reports to Wally, and two new waist gunners, Tom ([[Jeremy Ray Valdez]]) and Oliver (Tony Elias), introduce themselves to the enlisted crewmen. On their [[walk-around]] of the North African base, the replacements are introduced to the [[Still|alcohol still]] [[flight engineer]] Burt ([[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]]) has put together from bomber parts and other scraps. Burt explains that the Army adds [[ethanol]] to boost the octane rating of [[aviation fuel]], so they are cooking the fuel to distill out the alcohol. The crew, anxious to get back into the air, push maintenance chief Sgt. Caparelli (Howard Gibson) to clear their aircraft to fly. After some griping, Caparelli tells the men that the Lass has already been cleared earlier that day. The crew throws a party/wake to celebrate their return to flight status and mourn their losses. Only Wally dares to sample the local cuisine, goat meat and cous-cous, while everyone else sticks to their C-rations. Michael is present and appears standoffish. Further alienating him from the crew, he does not join in Wally's toast to their recently departed crewman because he doesn't drink.  Wally takes the you new young pilot outside and gives him some advice to try harder to fit in, including drinking with the men.  During the next mission which is supposed to be a milk run, an already hungover Wally succumbs to [[Foodborne illness|ptomaine poisoning]]. Michael takes over the controls. The squadron is ordered to fly into the clouds in a roundabout course to avoid flak emplacements on the approach to the target in Messina. Michael simply tries to keep an eye on the plane in front of him and doesn't use instrument navigation. Unfortunately, when the Lass comes out of the clouds, the rest of the squadron is nowhere to be seen. Not only are they off course, they have flown over territory heavily defended by antiaircraft guns. They abort and manage to make it home without any injury. A despondent Michael tells Wally that he's going to apply for a transfer to another plane. Wally says that while getting lost is a serious screw up, shit happens. He convinces Michael that the crew will eventually forgive him and suggests he start by admitting his mistake and apologizing to the crew. However, as he approaches the crew's tent, he overhears them making disparaging comments about him. The complain that they won't get credit for what was an easy mission, and he realizes now is not the right time to talk to the men. That night, there is a fierce [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] forcing everyone on the base to take cover. Burt finishes collecting a batch of alcohol, but in his haste to get away from the storm, he fails to shut down the still, allowing the flammable liquid to drip and pool on the ground.  To help boost the crews' confidence in Michael, Wally lets him take the pilot's chair. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots notice the oil pressure rising rapidly, and the engines begin losing power. Since they can't stay in formation, the Lass is forced to abort yet another "milk run" (an easy mission) to [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. To make matters worse, the still is destroyed in a fiery explosion. The crew blames Michael at first, considering him a [[jinx]].  Later, the squadron limps back, indicating that it had not been an easy mission. At the debriefing, we learn that the squadron's fighter protection was diverted, and enemy fighters had unexpectedly shown up over the target. Wally assures Michael that by aborting the mission, he had perhaps saved their lives.  With the ''Lucky Lass'' grounded and the squadron decimated, some of the Lass' crew are mixed into other crews for the next mission. Charlie ([[Manu Intiraymi]]), Eddie  (Joseph Williamson) and Michael are not assigned. Michael feels guilty at missing yet another mission, but his crewmates point out this is a blessing in disguise because as the only officer on the ground, he can ensure that Caparelli fixes the plane properly. After having worked all night to ready the squadron for today's mission, Caparelli is loath to order his men to work in the 105 degree in the shade sun. He tells Michael they've already checked the plane and didn't find any mechanical problems, but Michael won't take it lying down. After reading Caparelli the Riot Act, he persuades Caparelli to inspect the Lass again to discover the "[[gremlin]]s" that brought down the aircraft. Since excessive oil pressure was the problem, Michael insists that Caparelli take apart the [[Oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]]<nowiki/>s despite the new pump having been installed just last week, and a visual inspection not revealing anything. Caparelli reluctantly follows Michael's orders and discovers that the oil lines have been fouled with sand from the last sandstorm. Meanwhile, to make good on a promise to Al (Tim Hade) for a celebration on his safe return, and with no alcohol left, Charlie is caught stealing liquor from the officer's club by the chicken-shit quartermaster, Monroe (Matt Biedel), and is facing a summary [[court-martial]]. Eddie pleads with Michael to intervene with Col Shay ([[John Laughlin (actor)|John Laughlin]]), the "Old Man". Michael arrives just as the colonel asks Charlie if he has an exonerating explanation. Michael explains about the Lass' newly discovered mechanical problems, and claims he ordered Charlie to get alcohol to use as a solvent to clean the oil lines, and accepts blame because he wasn't explicit enough in his order to Charlie to get it legitimately. The colonel pretends to believe Michael's ridiculous lie and lets Charlie off. Monroe protests, but the colonel dresses him down and tells Monroe he doesn't have time to waste on anything that doesn't effect the operational efficiency of the squadron and dismisses Monroe. Before dismissing Charlie, the colonel asks why he only grabbed [[Scotch whisky|Scotch whiskey]], to which he replied the Lass is an Irish bomber with discriminating taste. The colonel takes a bottle from the case and chuckles to himself after Michael and Charlie leave. That night, whole crew celebrate Charlie's vindication, and declare Michael an honorary Irishman, christening him, "O'Schmidt".  July 19 arrives and the ''Lass'' is cleared to fly the Rome mission. On the final run to the IP, Burt is blinded by shrapnel from [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]], but they continue and manage to release their bombs over the target. However, as they make the turn home, a B-17 flying above them is hit and begins falling in their direction. They take evasive action, but the doomed bomber's wing clips part of the Lass' right [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]], causing them to go into an uncontrolled climb until they [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] and begins a lateral [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]. The plan loses altitude rapidly as Michael and Wally struggle desperate to regain control.  At the last second, Michael and Wally manage to pull up, but they are now very low over Rome and taking heavy ground fire. As they reach the edge of the city, a barrage of flak takes out another engine and obliterates Wally. Back in the waist, Tom checks on a wounded Oliver. Oliver says he's OK. As Tom turns back to his guns, another flak round kills him instantly. Michael asks Archie (Sean McGowan) to come to the cockpit to help him fly, since the [[navigator]] was once in flight school. Archie makes his way to the cockpit without saying a word about his wounds. He looks at the pulped flesh that used to be Wally before climbing into the seat. The ''Lucky Lass'' gets away from Rome, and makes a run for a British airbase at [[Malta]].  Michael asks Al from his position as the [[ball turret]] gunner about their situation. He reports that aside from the knocked-out engines and other damage, the B-17 appears to be fine. However, the damaged port landing gear falls away as it's being lowered, leaving Michael no choice but to order everyone to bail out. Michael, not noticing that Archie is wounded, leaves the cockpit with Archie at the controls.  As Michael helps the crew bail out, Archie begins to cough up blood. Archie opens the bomb bay doors and makes his way back to Michael as the last of the crew exits the plane. As he turns around, Michael is horrified to see blood soaked Archie, obviously in excruciating pain. Archie knows he's not going to make it. As Michael tries to help him get ready to bail out, he sees Archie's parachute has been destroyed. Michael says that they can land the aircraft on the water or both jump together using his parachute. Archie nods, but he then tells Michael to "take care of the boys" and pushes Michael out. Archie makes his way back into the pilot's chair to take control of the B-17 and starts climbing, but in its damaged state, it cannot take the stress and disintegrates, taking the navigator with it.

 Through narration, 12-year-old Marty tells the story of discovering his brother Steve is a serial killer when he took Steve’s bowling ball bag without asking and discovered a human head inside. Each week, Marty finds a new head, usually of a black woman, inside the bag hidden in Steve’s closet. Marty keeps the confusing discovery to himself, and immerses himself in a world of watching horror movies and drawing comic books with his best friend David.  A black classmate named Marcus bullies Marty at school. Marty refuses to fight back, which indirectly leads to a rumor that Marty tried to kiss Marcus. Marcus is given detention while Marty is sent home.  Marty sneaks into his brother’s room again but finds that the bowling bag is empty. He turns on Steve’s stereo and looks at himself in the mirror while wearing Steve’s rubber gasmask. Steve enters unexpectedly and yells at his brother for being in his room. He then asks why Marty is home from school and learns that his brother did not stick up for himself during his fight with Marcus.  Marty’s mom takes Marty to the video store to rent movies for a sleepover with David. Marty rents “Death Rattlers” and “Deep Dwellers,” but when he tries to rent an empty box for a strange movie titled “Headless,” the clerk informs him that the tape was either lost or stolen.  While going through his brother’s VHS collection later, Marty finds the tape of “Headless” that was stolen from the store. Inside is a slip of paper noting certain times from the film. Marty and David watch the unrated movie, which turns out to be so graphic that it makes Marty uncomfortable knowing his brother uses it for inspiration. David criticizes Marty for being a baby and says that he no longer wants to be Marty’s friend because no one likes him. Upset, Marty forces David to look inside Steve’s bowling bag, where they find Marcus’ severed head. Marty tells David that if he tells anyone, Steve will kill him. Horrified, David gets sick in the bathroom and his mother comes to take him home. Steve comes home and realizes that his brother knows his secret.  Marty and his father go to the movies. Marty goes to the bathroom where Steve barges in demanding that his brother reveal how much he knows. Steve threatens Marty to keep quiet. Marty has another confrontation with his brother later. Steve confesses that he only kills blacks out of hatred for their race, and pledges that he would never harm his little brother. Marty continues struggling with how to handle himself and his brother’s true nature.  Marty attends a church service with his mother and ends up beating a classmate named Trevor after Trevor bullies him. Marty refuses to apologize, claiming that he is only sticking up for himself when no one else will.  When Marty returns home, his father begins striking him over the altercation at church. Steve interrupts and starts beating his father and pushing his mother before his father kicks him out of the house.  At night, Marty secretly meets with his brother outside. Steve asks for Marty’s help with an unspecified plan, but Marty refuses. As they argue, their father comes outside and Steve hits him with a shovel. Steve runs inside after his mother. Marty follows and sees his brother preparing to rape their mother. Marty tries to stop him, but he is knocked unconscious.  Marty awakens tied to a bed with a ballgag in his mouth. He hears his mother screaming and crying as she's being raped in another room. Steve enters naked and wearing his gasmask, tells Marty to be quiet, grabs a weapon and proceeds to kill their parents. He comes back into the bedroom covered in blood. Steve tries telling his brother that he will understand and that he will explain everything in the morning, but Marty only cries. Marty’s reaction drives Steve mad.  In the morning, Steve walks out of the house still covered in blood.

Frankenweenie (2012 film)
 Young scientist [[Victor Frankenstein]] lives with his parents, Edward  and Susan Frankenstein, and his beloved [[Bull Terrier]] dog, Sparky, in the quiet town of New Holland. Victor's intelligence is recognized by his classmates at school, his somber next-door neighbor, Elsa Van Helsing, mischievous, Edgar "E" Gore, obese and gullible Bob, overconfident Toshiaki, creepy Nassor, and an eccentric girl nicknamed Weird Girl, but communicates little with them due to his relationship with his dog. Concerned with his son's isolation, Victor's father encourages him to take up [[baseball]] and make achievements outside of science. Victor hits a [[home run]] at his first game, but Sparky, pursuing the ball, is struck by a car and killed.  Inspired by his science teacher Mr. Rzykruski's demonstration of [[Galvanism|the effect of electricity on dead frogs]], a depressed Victor digs up Sparky's corpse, brings him to his makeshift laboratory in the attic and successfully reanimates him with lightning. Seeing Weird Girl's living cat, Mr. Whiskers, the undead Sparky escapes from the attic and explores the neighborhood. He is recognized by Edgar, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to [[Undead|raise the dead]]. The two reanimate a dead goldfish, which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. Edgar brags about the undead fish to Toshiaki and Bob, which, in panic of losing the upcoming science fair, inspires them to make a rocket out of soda bottles, which causes Bob to break his arm and Mr. Rzykruski to be blamed and fired due to his accused influencing and reviling the townsfolk for questioning his methods when he steps up for self-defense. So, the gym teacher replaces Mr. Rzykruski.  Eventually, Edgar's fish disappears when he tries to show it to a skeptical Nassor (who was told by Toshiaki), and when Edgar is confronted by Toshiaki, Nassor and Bob on the baseball field at school, he accidentally reveals Victor's actions, inspiring them to try reanimation themselves. Victor's parents discover Sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. Victor and his parents search for Sparky while the classmates invade the lab, discovering Victor's reanimation formula. The classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters — Mr. Whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, resulting in him fusing with it and becoming a monstrous bat-cat with wings and fangs. Edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a [[wererat]], Nassor revives his mummified hamster Colossus and Toshiaki's turtle Shelley is covered in [[Miracle Gro]] and turns into a [[kaiju]]. Bob's [[Sea-Monkeys]] grow into amphibious humanoids. The monsters break loose into the town fair where they wreak havoc.  After finding Sparky at the town's pet cemetery, Victor sees the monsters heading to the fair and goes with his classmates to help deal with them — the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn, and Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, while the rat and Shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after both being electrocuted. During the chaos, Persephone, Elsa's pet poodle, is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill with Elsa and Victor chasing after. The townsfolk blame Sparky for Elsa's disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which Mayor Burgermeister accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa and Persephone, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers. A final confrontation ensues, and just as Mr. Whiskers has Sparky cornered, a flaming piece of wood breaks off and impales Mr. Whiskers to death. The windmill then collapses on Sparky, presumably killing him again. To reward him for his bravery and saving Victor, the townsfolk gather to revive Sparky with their car batteries, reanimating him once more. Persephone comes to Sparky as the two dogs share their love and kiss.

At night Fred has disturbing dreams of being at home (with a normal voice) but wakes to find he is still at camp.  Fred learns that Camp Iwannapeepee and Camp Superior have been competing in summer camp games for sixty-nine years and that Superior has always won. He also thinks he has unearthed a plot to drug the food of the Iwannapeepee campers, in order for a giant rat to eat their brains in a place called "The Rat's Hole". Avoiding the gruel, Fred instead eats [[hallucinogen]]ic red [[berries]], and throws up when the others show up. Fred learns that Magoo, Chatter, Spoon, and Dig go to "The Rats Den" because it's a hideout they've had since being in camp. The "drug" that was put in the gruel was super-vitamins, because the gruel is partially bad. When he learns that his arch rival Kevin ([[Jake Weary]]) is on the team from Superior, Fred becomes determined to defeat the rival camp. When the competition begins, Camp Iwannapeepee falls behind in the contests.  After losing to Camp Superior for the day, everyone is down, and Magoo, Chatter, Spoon, and Dig don't even want to go their hideout (The Rat's Hole).

When the singing competition comes up, Kevin and Camp Superior perform a very impressive song-dance routine.

Fred and Camp Iwannapeepee are nervous at first, but go on stage. Fred starts singing a made-up song of his own called "The Loser Song". It starts making Kevin and the others laugh, but then Fred and the camp perform an impressive song-dance routine of their own, making everyone (except Kevin) cheer. Kevin wants the gruel to hit Fred, but Diesel says it's stuck. Camp Iwannapeepee finally wins The Summer Camp Games and Fred gets off-stage, where Kevin complains saying that "Fred always loses." Diesel's messing with the gruel blaster results in Kevin losing his clothes and being laughed offstage. As the campers leave the camp for summer and prepare to go home, Fred has made some new friends, and his mom has found a new man.

On his own, Albert meets a convenience store employee named Fuzzy who seeks revenge against Jörgen, a mixed-martial arts fighter, who won the heart of his ex-girlfriend Lara. Recognizing Albert for his well-known reputation from a video arcade, he seeks his help to get even with his ex, and the boy accepts his offer and friendship. Wren and April just miss him at the convenience as Fuzzy drives off with Albert, and they both encounter Roosevelt and Peng again. Wren coerces Roosevelt into driving his mother's car around the city to look for her little brother. Roosevelt's parents are semi-eccentric pacifistic lesbians, and Wren previously thought his reference to them as his "Moms" was an attempt to mimic rappers such as [[Li'l Wayne]]. Roosevelt asks his mothers to borrow the car, but when they insist that he asks it in [[Ancient Greek dialects|ancient Greek]]; he does so, and they say no. Citing his lack of ability to translate the word "seat belt" into ancient Greek, he sneaks the keys to the car and drives off with them anyhow. The car is a yellow 1986 [[Volvo 245]] station wagon with mechanical issues. Peng turns on the [[car stereo]], which is set to an [[National Public Radio|NPR]] station and starts messing with it, and as he and Roosevelt fight over it, the knob breaks causing it to blare [[Josh Groban]]'s cover of "[[You Raise Me Up#Josh Groban version|You Raise Me Up]]" at full volume, thus making them appear uncool as they roll onto a street that's popular for kids who cruise with their cars at night. And to make matters worse, the car stalls right in front of the SUV driven by Mike Puglio the "Wedgie King" and his sidekick dressed like [[The Incredible Hulk]]. Both harass the four kids, until one of them bangs on the hood, causing it to start up again, giving them an opportunity to escape.  Across town, Fuzzy and Albert arrive at Lara's apartment building, and he climbs the building to throw toilet paper all over her apartment while Albert keeps lookout for the police, only to find that he not only threw it into the wrong apartment (Lara's was the one next to it), but he also accidentally set it on fire from some candles. The owners of the wrong apartment turn out to be a Samoan couple who begin to beat Fuzzy, but he manages to escape. During this time a police tow truck confiscates his , provoking Peng to get out of the car and challenge the bully to a duel. Initially, Puglio does not take the challenge seriously, believing the gun is not real until he fires it at him, blowing apart a chicken drumstick Puglio used as a mock weapon. The drive-thru girl calls the police, and Puglio and his friend flee the scene while April escapes. Police officers arrive and try to arrest the three of them, but they drive off only to find their patrol car covered with toilet paper.  Albert seems to be having a good time with Denise and her friends, until Jörgen crashes the party and takes some of his candy, throwing most of it on the ground, and tries to dance with the girls at the party, who throw him out. Remembering Fuzzy's description of Jörgen, Albert stows away in his  convertible, just as Fuzzy and Lara arrive at the same party, which Lara wanted to attend. Denise and her friends tell them that they were partying with Albert, and Lara soon realizes Fuzzy was telling the truth, just before Jörgen throws Albert's Halloween pumpkin basket at Fuzzy, who suddenly spots Albert in the backseat of Jörgen's car, evidently with his own revenge plot. Wren, Roosevelt, and Peng drive off looking for both Albert and now April, who later calls from Aaron Riley's party with the false impression that she has found Albert. Wren, Roosevelt, and Peng arrive at the party, and for at least this night, the earlier duel gives Peng some level of social acceptance, whereas he had previously became convinced he and Roosevelt were pre-destined to be social outcasts. Wren calls the police to ask if Albert has been arrested, since he gets into a lot of mischief, but Albert was still out there. Later, April fulfills a promise she made earlier to Peng to let him touch her breasts. When he gets nervous about the chance to feel her up, she grabs his hand and puts it on one of them herself, but still tries to conceal her own desire for him by slapping his face in case anybody saw them together.  Seeking to escape Keevin and the party, Joy tries to find the bathroom and unexpectedly stumbles upon Brueder's parents. All three share a cup of tea, and Joy tearfully confesses that she's dating their son's friend not only to compensate for the loss of her husband, but also the potential loss of her daughter to college and her son to silence. Eventually she leaves the party and returns home, discovering the children are not home. Jörgen arrives at his home, unaware that Albert stowed away in his car. Soon after, Fuzzy arrives, and he and Albert hatch a plan to get revenge on Jörgen by leaving a flaming bag of dog feces and fireworks on his front porch. When Jörgen investigates what's going on, the bag explodes, hurting his foot. He spots Albert but not Fuzzy. Albert attempts to run away, but Jörgen catches him and locks him in his bedroom, leaving Fuzzy to come up with a rescue/revenge plan. Back at Aaron Riley's party, just as Roosevelt is about to confess his love for Wren, Aaron Riley sings a song dedicated to Wren, but she turns him down and tries to chase Roosevelt as he drives away in frustration. Just then Wren receives a phone call on her cell phone from Jörgen, who is holding Albert hostage at his house, and threatens to turn him over to the police for pulling the stunt with Fuzzy, unless she gives him $400 in cash, which she doesn't have. After Jörgen gives her his address, Wren desperately runs through the streets of Cleveland trying to find his house. Arriving there and telling Jörgen she doesn't have the money, he calls the police but puts them on hold when Wren finds out that he is a big fan of the [[Beastie Boys]], and offers to give him the collectible jacket she inherited from her late father which was left behind by [[Mike D]] as a substitute for cash. Jörgen seems satisfied and takes it as a better offer, but he decides to turn them over to the police anyhow. Just then, Fuzzy breaks in to rescue the boy and his older sister, by throwing bricks and fireworks throughout the house. Jörgen is slightly injured in the explosion. Before the police arrive, Fuzzy strips down naked and runs off in order to divert attention from the two kids.  Wren and Albert visit the cemetery where their father is buried and place a plastic pumpkin with flowers on his grave. Albert thanks Wren for finding and rescuing him, just before their mother picks them up and drives them home. It is morning when they arrive home. Upon their arrival, they find Roosevelt trying to prevent Wren's mother from entering her house without the opportunity to profess his love for her, something which he was encouraged to do by his parents despite coming home with the Volvo severely damaged and confessing to them about the night's events. Meanwhile, April wakes up to find herself in the arms of Peng, and after looking around for witnesses decides to make out with him again. Fuzzy meets Denise, who asks him out on a date. Fuzzy also reveals that his real name is Manuel. Later, Albert reveals that he secretly has been pulling prank phone calls on both his mother, sister, and his sister's friend for six months, which includes the uploading of a video to Wren's Facebook page, making fun of Wren's bug dance and "explaining rap" that she did during the period of Riley's invitation.

Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 1
  A gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in [[Wasseypur]]. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir. The whole scene is then revealed in the sequel.  ===Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad=== Nasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the [[British Raj]], Wasseypur and [[Dhanbad]] were located in the [[Bengal]] region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of [[Bihar]] in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of [[Jharkhand]] where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the [[Qureshi]] Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension.  During British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals.  ===1940s=== Shahid Khan ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]), a [[Pathans in Bihar|Pathan]], takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a [[Qureshi]], by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh ([[Tigmanshu Dhulia]]) receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorises the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance.  On a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to [[Varanasi]] for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji ([[Harish Khanna]]). Nasir ([[Piyush Mishra]]), Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi ([[Vipin Sharma]]), another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar ([[Jameel Khan]]). Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder.  ===Early and Mid 1970s=== The coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a [[Coal India]] official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad.  Sardar marries Nagma Khatoon ([[Richa Chadda]]). The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name.  Sardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh (Satya Anand), Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asghar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting.  ===Early 1980s=== Sardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu]] woman named Durga ([[Reema Sen]]). Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorise the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During [[Muharram]], both [[Shias]] and [[Sunnis]] are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan.  Eventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite Khan. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his chillum. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.  ===Mid and Late 1980s=== Sensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.  ===1990's=== Sardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between  Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family.  A mature Faizal ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan (Faizal's grandfather) and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), another kin of Sultan. ===Sardar's death=== Faizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan.  Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise & unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head. He steps out with his gun drawn to stop the a cycle ferry on which he eventually collapses to his death.  
Gambit (2012 film)
 British art curator Harry Deane ([[Colin Firth]]) decides to seek revenge on his abusive boss Lord Shabandar ([[Alan Rickman]]) by conning him into buying a fake [[Claude Monet|Monet]] (''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]] at Dusk''), to complement the one he already has (''Haystacks at Dawn''). He teams up with a master art forger, the Major ([[Tom Courtenay]]), and travels to [[Alpine, Texas]]. He searches for rodeo queen PJ Puznowski ([[Cameron Diaz]]), the granddaughter of the sergeant responsible for capturing [[Hermann Göring]] in 1945. Harry explains that PJ's participation will lend authenticity since the Monet was last seen at [[Carinhall]] after being [[Nazi plunder|plundered by the Nazis]]. She agrees and the next day the three drive out to PJ's grandmother's [[mobile home]] out in the desert. They hang the fake Monet on the wall and take a picture with the painting in the background. The picture is to appear with an article on the rodeo queen that will be published in a magazine that is part of Shabandar's media empire.  Back in [[London]], Harry meets with Shabandar and discusses the photos of PJ and her grandmother, turning the attention to the painting. Shabandar replies that it is a reproduction, based on the fact that it is hanging on the wall of a mobile home in Texas. Harry suggests that they at least check to see if the painting is real or not, because the painting is so rarely reproduced. Shabandar reluctantly agrees, and Harry tries to find PJ to follow up on the matter. PJ offers the painting to Shabandar for 12 million [[pounds sterling]], but only after arranging to meet him at the [[Savoy Hotel]], which Harry can barely afford. Harry's frustration with PJ grows after she accepts romantic advances from Shabandar. While they are alone, Shabandar tells PJ that a different art curator named Martin Zaidenweber ([[Stanley Tucci]]) will replace Harry. PJ meets Zaidenweber and tells him that the painting has been hanging in her house since she was a little girl. When Shabandar opines that Harry is an idiot, Zaidenweber counters that Harry is a good man who simply has a bad eye for art. Back at the hotel, PJ tells Harry that she no longer wants any part in his plan.  The following night, PJ has dinner with Shabandar again. They are stopped by his rival businessman, Akira Takagawa, who has wanted revenge ever since losing to Shabandar in a 1992 auction for the first Haystacks painting. By the time she leaves, Harry has called Zaidenweber and convinced him to abandon his partnership with Shabandar. Meeting Harry in the courtyard, PJ agrees to take part in the plan once more. When they arrive at Shabandar's masquerade ball, Harry heads to the gallery, counting on PJ to distract Shabandar while he makes final preparations. As the inspection is about to begin, Zaidenweber arrives, having lied to Harry and remained loyal to Shabandar. He announces that the painting is real, but suddenly, Harry speaks up and disagrees. To everyone's shock, Harry wipes away paint to reveal the likeness of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] underneath. Shabandar announces that PJ will be of no further use to him and tries to re-hire Harry. Harry turns him down, noting his disapproval of the way Shabandar has treated PJ.  Harry and the Major meet with Takagawa and his men. It is revealed that the Major had painted copies for both ''Dusk'' and ''Dawn'' paintings. Harry had removed the staples on the canvas of the real ''Dawn'' painting and switched it with its copy.  Takagawa tells Harry that his payment for the real ''Haystacks at Dawn'' by Monet, 10 million pounds, has been transferred to his Swiss bank account. Harry and the Major thank Takagawa, and head on their way. Meanwhile, while PJ goes through security, she finds a painting from Harry as a gift. She smiles, just before boarding the plane. The end of the film shows Harry and the Major walking through the airport talking about [[Donald Trump]]'s fascination with Picasso.

He resides in the heart of Bhopal, with Nisha, a school teacher and his loving and caring, but doubting wife, who is concerned more about her husband's promotion from cashier to manager rather than his flying tricks onstage. Bharat's father, Shivnarayan, an old-timer who values freedom and hopes to see his country corruption-free someday, completes the small and happy family. However, there's also an uninvited houseguest in Bharat's household; Amita, a young, beautiful girl who works at a call center and often likes to hitch a ride with Bharat on his scooter, when he is not busy dropping his wife to her school.  Contrary to his wife's wishes, Bharat's sole ambition in life is to graduate from his role as 'Hanuman' to 'Lord Ram' someday. However, that puts him at loggerheads with Sattu Tripathi, the younger brother of the local MLA and a bad actor playing 'Lord Ram', who is perpetually annoyed at being upstaged by 'Hanuman'. His older brother, MLA Manku also has his share of problems with Bharat, who refuses to let out an extra room to him for his re-election campaign.  Bharat's happy little haven is disturbed rudely one day when the local 'havaldaar' Kushwaah comes knocking at his door, claiming to have caught a thief, Chunnu Farishta, who purportedly stole a fan from his house, a theft that Bharat has no idea about, though the local 'panwala', Bachhu Gulukand, is a sworn witness. Virtually ordered to come to court, Bharat finds himself suddenly dealing with made-up testimonies, lazy judges, and crooked characters of all sorts, trapped in the system that plagues the country today.  Out of nowhere, Bharat finds himself stuck in a hilariously vicious circle of corruption, having to bribe his way from cops to criminals, witnesses to lawyers, and even the judge, all in an effort to get out of the quagmire that is the Indian system. Along the way, this cashier-cum-Hanuman also finds his ideals again, learning to stand up for the rights of the common man and give a slap to the system, and becomes the subject of national news, exposing the thieves that line every lane here...!

Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2
  The film resumes with the murder of Sardar Khan by Sultan Qureshi and three of his men. When Danish ([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) (Sardar's eldest son), Faizal ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) (Sardar's second son) and Asgar ([[Jameel Khan]]) (Sardar's cousin) go to retrieve his body, Danish instantly kills the lone captured killer and vows to kill the other three. Danish and Asgar explain to Faizal that his friend Fazlu Ahmed had doped Faizal with marijuana the night before Sardar's death and had informed Sultan that Sardar would be travelling without bodyguards the next day. Faizal later meets Fazlu, and overhears him on the phone talking to another of Sardar Khan's killers, Saggir. Faizal learns that Saggir would be at the shopping centre the next morning. The next day Danish and Asgar go to the shopping centre, and Danish kills Saggir. Sultan and Fazlu then kill Danish outside a courthouse. At Danish's funeral, Nagma doubts Faizal's ability to exact revenge, but Faizal promises her that he will.  Faizal lies low and waits for right opportunity. When Fazlu wins a local election Faizal meets him on the pretext of congratulating him, but instead beheads him. By doing so, Faizal makes his mark and becomes so feared that illegal iron traders become his cronies. Faizal then makes a truce with Ramadhir Singh. According to their agreement, Ramadhir would provide political support to Faizal's business in Wasseypur on the condition that Faizal would not avenge his father, brother and grandfather. As Faizal's business grows, he marries his sweetheart Mohsina Hamid. Faizal's gang then determines the whereabouts of Sardar's third killer, Khalid, through an aide. Faizal has Khalid's head shaved and then shoots him, enraging Sultan.  Babu Khan ([[Aditya Kumar]]) (Sardar's third son, known as Perpendicular) and Definite Khan (Zieshan Quadri) (Sardar's son with Durga) are then introduced. Perpendicular is a 14-year old who manages to get away with looting shops because no one is willing to testify against him in fear of Faizal, and Definite is an up-and-coming goon. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has spawned a new generation of money squandering lobbyists that turn into gangsters overnight. A small-time goon named Shamshad Alam ([[Rajkummar Rao]]) has his own transport business and then moves to trading iron, in doing so making an alliance with Faizal. Shamshad offers to increase Faizal's profits with his astute knowledge of the scrap iron business. However, Shamshad begins to keep increasingly significant portions of the profit for himself. When this is revealed to Faizal, Shamshad goes to the police and provides phone calls as evidence of Faizal's involvement in the illegal iron trade. Meanwhile, local shopkeepers lose their patience with Perpendicular's antics and hire Sultan to kill him. Ramadhir meanwhile is losing his faith in his son J.P's ability to run his empire and J.P often finds himself in line of fire for his inability. This results in waning  of J.P.'s prominence and influence.  Sultan's men chase Perpendicular and his friend Tangent after they watch a film. Tangent manages to get back to Faizal's house but Sultan catches Perpendicular and kills him by some railway tracks. Faizal and his gang arrive at the scene and as they are removing Perpendicular's body, the police turn up and arrest Faizal. With Faizal in jail, Definite decides to kill Shamshad before Shamshad tries to fill Faizal's vacant position. However, Definite's pistol jams in the middle of the assassination attempt and he is forced to run. Shamshad and his friend chase him, but Definite manages to jump onto a train. However, the train is full of Indian Army soldiers and Definite is arrested. He is sent to jail, where he meets Faizal.  Ramadhir advises Shamshad to bail Definite out of the jail and then instigate him against his own brother for his empire. Durga worked as a cook for Ramadhir after Sardar's death, and thus Ramadhir feels that he has the influence to put Definite up against Faizal. Faizal is aware of Shamshad's plan and cautions Definite before he leaves the jail. Definite visits Shamshad's office and throws in a grenade, causing Shamshad to lose his leg. Sultan, who was also at Shamshad's office, chases Definite and goes to Faizal's house looking for him. There Sultan doesn't find Definite but finds his sister Shama instead. Although Shama is happy to see him, Sultan shoots her in the head and she falls into a coma. When Faizal is about to be released from jail, J.P cautions Sultan and advises him to kill Faizal in a pre-emptive strike. Sultan along with his gang attacks Faizal's house, but Faizal and his entire family have a lucky escape. As Sultan's gang is leaving, they find a police checkpoint waiting for them and realise that they were double crossed by J.P. Sultan escapes in the ensuing firefight. A few days later, Sultan's men kill Nagma and Asgar in a market in broad daylight. Definite and some other members of Faizal's gang track Sultan to [[Bhagalpur]] and kill him. Upon realising that Definite has avenged Danish, Shama, Nagma and Asgar, Faizal tells him to surrender to cement his reputation. With Definite in jail, Ramadhir then aims to create a rift between Definite and Faizal.  Iqlakh, an educated English-speaker, enters Faizal's gang. Iqlakh actually wants to exact revenge and is Ramadhir's mole. Iqlakh's father raped a Wasseypur woman in 1985 and when Sardar Khan found out, he forced Iqlakh's father to divorce his wife and marry the woman he raped (depicted in Part 1). Iqlakh is his father's son with the first wife, whom he divorced. Faizal is initially impressed with Iqlakh's skills and is later made aware of Iqlakh's background, but decides to ignore it. Iqlakh has an astute knowledge of business and bags scrap auctions by force. This brings in a lot of profit for Faizal without any risk, and causes him to neglect Definite. Iqlakh advises Faizal to enter politics in order to provide political protection to all his activities. Faizal decides to contest from Ramadhir's constituency to exact his own revenge.  Ramadhir, feeling threatened, tries to use Definite against Faizal. He releases Definite from jail and sends J.P to broker a deal. J.P, however, is tired of his father's insults and wants to use Faizal to kill him. Ramadhir's plan is that Iqlakh will kill Faizal on the polling day and if he is unable, Definite will take the shot. Definite goes straight to Faizal and informs him of the plan. On the polling day Definite's gang disrupts the elections by force in an effort to prevent Faizal from winning. Iqlakh leads Faizal to an isolated place and tries to kill them, but Definite arrives, double crosses Iqlakh and kills him. Definite explains that Ramadhir changed the plan.  Faizal decides to attack Ramadhir. He knows that Ramadhir is meeting with Shamshad in hospital. Faizal, Definite and other gang members take an ambulance with a large cache of weapons and head towards the hospital. They enter the hospital, and Faizal kills all of Ramadhir's men as the police arrive. He lets other civilians out of the hospital but kills Shamshad. Faizal then finds Ramadhir in a bathroom and kills him, emptying multiple magazines of ammunition into his body. In the meantime the police kill most of Faizal's gang. Faizal and Definite, the only survivors, are arrested. En route to prison the police halts at roadside restaurant for refreshments, leaving Faizal alone in the police van. Faizal is then shot dead by Definite. It is revealed that J.P was the architect of the massacre and Definite is seen free, walking towards his mother.  Four years later, Mohsina and Nasir have moved to Mumbai with Faizal's young son, Firoz. Definite now rules Wasseypur. Nasir describes that Wasseypur was not affected by Ramadhir's and Faizal's deaths and concludes that it is still a battlefield like before.  
Gayby
  Jenn (played by Jenn Harris), a [[yoga]] instructor, and Matt (played by Matthew Wilkas), a comic book store worker, are best friends from college who are now single and in their 30s. In agreement with a pact they made in their youth, the two decide to have a baby ("gayby") together, even though Jenn is straight and Matt is gay. Jenn's grandmother set her up with a [[trust fund]] if she ever had a child, so Jenn is confident that she and Matt will have the finances to have one. However, Jenn states that she wants to have a baby through natural conception, so the two begin awkwardly having sex. Meanwhile, Jenn is concerned with the stunted life she is living, treated as an underling at her yoga studio. Matt is recovering from a devastating break up with his partner of six years, Tom, who is a rising comic book publisher. Matt finds difficulty in getting back into the dating game and finds himself constantly avoiding awkward run-ins with Tom.  The two friends resolve to reinvigorate their dating lives and achieve their longterm goals—Jenn pushes the idea of innovative [[Hot yoga|"warm" yoga]] classes at her studio, while Matt works on his own comic book, "Gayby"—about the adventures of a heroic gay baby—to pitch to a distributor. Both receive advice from friends about their goals and the pregnancy attempts—Jenn from her gay co-worker Jamie and her aggressive sister, Kelly, who is in the process of adopting a child, and Matt from his dry-witted friend Nelson, who helps them with their [[fertility treatment]]s, having been a surrogate father himself.  After dating around, Jenn has a one-off night of passionate sex with her boss's brother, Louis. Meanwhile, Matt meets a divorced, newly [[coming out|out]], gay father, Scott, who buys comic books at his store. The two begin a relationship, but Matt is frustrated at how slowly Scott wishes to proceed. Jenn and Matt are later thrilled when they learn Jenn is finally pregnant.  While talking with Louis, Jenn is furious to learn that Louis has a girlfriend and that he cheated on her with Jenn. In trying to defend himself, Louis reveals that their condoms broke during sex, but that he thought Jenn knew and was okay with it. Jenn is devastated by the possibility that the child may not be Matt's after all. Her boss, upon learning that her brother cheated on his girlfriend again with Jenn, angrily asks her to take a leave of absence from the yoga studio.  While attending Matt's birthday party, Jenn hesitantly reveals that the child might be Louis's, which devastates Matt. He asks Jenn to return his apartment key and refuses to speak to her. Falling into a depression, Jenn is visited by Kelly, who tells her that her adoption process failed. She instead offers to raise Jenn's baby, arguing that Jenn is not fit—either in lifestyle or career—to raise a child on her own, and will block the trust fund if necessary. Jenn is taken aback and exclaims that she will be able to raise the child and give it a great life, even if Matt never forgives her and she is forced to raise it alone. Satisfied that Jenn has what it takes, Kelly reveals that the adoption went through and that her offer was a ruse to bolster her sister's conviction.  Jenn returns to work and offers to buy into the yoga studio with some of her trust fund money, securing her future with the studio and furthering her career. Enticed by the opportunity to split the responsibility of studio ownership with someone and seeing that Jenn's "warm" yoga has become an immense hit, her boss accepts, and they both agree to restart their friendship.  Nelson reads over Matt's comic and convinces him that it is worth submitting to a publisher. Matt finds closure with Tom by finally speaking with him and asking him if he would pass his proposal up to one of his superiors. Tom happily agrees, stating that he is pleased to see Matt is doing better. Though he is excited about this development, Matt is still depressed that the child may not be his. Nelson tells him that even if the child isn't his biologically, it is still his child because he and Jenn wanted to have it together. That it has a loving family is what's most important.  Jenn arrives at the comic book store to ask for Matt's forgiveness, and offers to raise the child with him one last time. Though silent at first, Matt relents and the two make up, preparing for the baby's arrival.  One year later, Matt's comic book is a success and he has furthered his relationship with Scott, who enthusiastically helps care for the baby. Jenn has begun a relationship with one of Matt's straight co-workers and stops by Matt and Scott's place to give them the night off of baby-duty. It is then that Scott tells Jenn of his plan to secretly propose to Matt that evening. After Matt and Scott leave, Jenn cuddles with the baby and says, "You sure do look like your father," leaving the true identity of the baby's father unknown.

Get the Gringo
 The film opens with a getaway driver ([[Mel Gibson]]) and a wounded accomplice dressed as clowns fleeing from American police toward the Mexican border. The driver crashes through the border fence, whereupon he is arrested by corrupt Mexican police officers Vasquez (Mario Zaragoza) and Romero (Gerardo Teracena). When they find over $2 million in the car, they incarcerate him in [[La Mesa Prison|El Pueblito prison]] under false charges, keep the cash for themselves, and cremate the accomplice, who by then has died. As one of the only American incarcerated there, the driver becomes known as "the Gringo". El Pueblito proves surprising, operating more like a small ghetto than a prison. The Gringo quickly manages to work out the prison's criminal hierarchy and engages in petty thefts and robberies from some of the prison's less reputable businesses. One of these thefts is witnessed by an unnamed kid (Kevin Hernandez) who is living with his incarcerated mother ([[Dolores Heredia]]) and is protected by the prison's criminals. Curious, the Gringo presses him to explain why the criminals protect him, but the Kid refuses.  Later, the Gringo stops the Kid from an ill-fated assassination attempt on Javi ([[Daniel Giménez Cacho]]), leader of the crime family that runs El Pueblito. After an argument, he learns why the Kid is protected: Javi has a failing liver, and the Kid is the only viable match; Javi has already killed the Kid's father and harvested his liver. The Gringo vows to stop the transplant from happening and to help kill Javi. Meanwhile, the Gringo attracts the attention of an American Embassy employee ([[Peter Gerety]]), who easily identifies him as a career criminal. Unconcerned, the Gringo and the Kid work towards bringing down Javi, and the Gringo grows closer to the Kid's mother. The Gringo ingratiates himself to Javi by saving Javi's brother, Caracas ([[Jesús Ochoa (actor)|Jesús Ochoa]]) and revealing the money stolen by Vasquez and Romero. Thugs working for criminal boss Frank ([[Peter Stormare]]) have already located Vasquez and Romero and are torturing them to find the location of an additional $2 million. Javi's men kill everyone and take the money, enraging Frank. With the aid of the Embassy guy, Frank sends assassins into El Pueblito to kill Javi and the Gringo.  The resulting shootout results in the Mexican authorities planning a raid on the prison. Knowing time is short, Javi hires the Gringo to kill Frank and sets up an immediate transplant operation. In the US, the Gringo lures Frank out of hiding by arranging a meeting between him and shipping magnate Warren Kaufmann ([[Bob Gunton]]). The Gringo sets up his ex-partner, Reginald T. Barnes, who had betrayed him, and kills Frank. When the Gringo ambushes the Embassy employee, he learns about the transplant operation and rushes to save the Kid, who has unsuccessfully attempted to stab himself in the liver. Using the Embassy guy's credentials, the Gringo infiltrates the raid on the prison and interrupts Javi's liver transplant surgery. Threatening to kill Javi, the Gringo forces Caracas to retrieve the kid's mother, who Javi has tortured. Caracas returns with two thugs, but the Gringo kills them all. A nurse helps the Gringo by pretending to capture him. When Caracas relaxes, the Gringo shoots him. They grab the money, and the nurse helps them escape from the prison in an ambulance. In the epilogue, the Gringo recovers the missing $2 million hidden in the escape car held in the impound lot, and the Gringo, the Kid, and his mother retire to an idyllic beach.

So with the help of Charles, Katie, and Nick, they retrieve Levi's car, and try to help him get his car back to school to show Ms. Bradford before school ends. Levi confronts his father about his wish to not play tennis and asks for his help, but he refuses.   Levi leaves, arrives at school and asks Ms. Bradford to look at his project, and after his father, who has had a change of heart, talks to her she agrees to look at the car.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance
  In [[Romania]], a French priest named Moreau warns the monks of a monastery about an impending attack by the devil's forces to obtain a boy named Danny. The monastery falls under attack; Moreau tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and flees with her son. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He believes that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy. He finds the Rider and seeks his help.  Eight years have passed since [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] became the [[Ghost Rider]] – a [[Vengeful ghost|vengeful, fiery spirit]] who feeds on the evil of his victims and consumes the souls of sinners. No matter how big or small the infraction — anything from [[genocide]] to a [[white lie]] — the Rider does not differentiate. This drives Blaze into hiding, fighting the evil spirit within him. Moreau finds him and convinces him to save the boy in exchange for his priesthood's ability to restore Johnny's soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse. Meanwhile, pursuers force Nadya and Danny from the road and bring them to their leader: her former boyfriend Ray Carrigan. Carrigan has Danny tied up and is about to execute Nadya when the Ghost Rider appears; the Ghost Rider kills several of Carrigan's men and then moves in on Danny. Nadya distracts the Ghost Rider, who then is shot with grenades into submission.  Johnny awakens in a hospital. On the way out, he convinces Nadya not to trust him, but to accept his help to find Danny. Carrigan tells [[Mephisto (comics)|Roarke]] about the Rider, and Roarke speaks an incantation to Danny via phone, which effectively puts up a "firewall" preventing the Rider from sensing Danny's whereabouts. He warns Carrigan it will not shield him from being sensed and gives him instructions to deliver Danny. Nadya later tells Blaze that as she lay dying, she made a deal with Roarke: her life in return for him impregnating her with Danny, making Danny a direct vessel for Roarke and the potential for him to have unlimited power on the surface world. Roarke lacks this power so far from [[Hell]]. Danny nearly escapes, but breaks his ankle and is recaptured. That night, Nadya and Johnny interrogate a known contact of Carrigan's. Johnny takes off ahead of Nadya to deal with Carrigan. Nadya saves Danny as the Rider converts a mining machine (a [[Bagger 288]]<ref name=InterviewNeveldineTaylor></ref>) into a massive fiery machine, destroying their hideout complex and mortally wounding Carrigan. When Ghost Rider catches up to Nadya and starts to use his Penance Stare on her, Danny is able to stop the Rider with a word, exercising his hidden power. [[File:Bagger-garzweiler.jpg|thumb|290px| A special prop: The [[Bagger 288]], the heaviest land vehicle in the world from 1978–1995]]  Moreau catches up with the group as they ride off. Roarke is not done with Carrigan; using his power, he turns Carrigan into a demon called [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] capable of instantly decaying anything he touches while shrouded in darkness. Johnny and Nadya bring Danny to Moreau's monastery with warm reception. Moreau explains that the Ghost Rider is the twisted incarnation of the Spirit of Justice, [[Zarathos]], after being captured and tortured to madness while in Hell. Moreau tells Johnny that he can exorcise the spirit from him if Johnny tells a secret that only he knows of. Johnny confesses that his deal with Roarke was really a selfish one: his stepfather had accepted his [[cancer]] and was ready to die; Johnny was the one who did not want him to go. With this confession, Moreau exorcises Johnny of the spirit and Johnny becomes human again. The head monk Methodius proclaims that Danny will never be safe from the influence of evil and says he must die, taking Johnny, Moreau, and Nadya captive in order to execute the boy. Carrigan intervenes, killing the monks and taking Danny captive again to deliver to Roarke. The others follow, with Johnny not wanting to desert Danny after having promised to protect him. With the ritual to transfer Roarke's spirit and power into Danny underway, the three infiltrate the compound to save him. Carrigan kills Moreau, but Danny (who Roarke states has the same powers as he does) gives Johnny back the power of the Ghost Rider. Roarke manages to escape with Danny and the Ghost Rider and Nadya give pursuit. After a vehicular struggle, Ghost Rider manages to defeat Carrigan and causes the SUV carrying Roarke and Danny to crash. The Ghost Rider sends Roarke back into Hell while Danny, who had died in the accident, is returned to his mother. Channeling the blue flame of Zarathos, Johnny manages to revive Danny and assures him of his safety.  As the film closes, the angelic blue flaming Ghost Rider rides off on his motorcycle, saying: "My name is Johnny Blaze. I'm the Ghost Rider."

The Girl and Death
 The Girl and Death is a love story of Nicolai and Elise (a courtesan). Their love is obstructed by materialism, wealth, and death. The film, based on an original script by Jos Stelling and Bert Rijkelijkhuizen, tells the story of the Russian physician Nicolai, who returns to an old hotel, the place where he first met his great love half a century ago and relives his romantic tragedy.  A large part of the film is set in the late nineteenth century, and the action takes place in an abandoned hotel/sanatorium in [[Tannenfeld]][https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTannenfeld&act=url ^], [[Thuringia]] where most of the film was also shot. The hotel still bears the traces of past glory.  Eventually, it becomes clear why Nicolai has really returned.  
Ginger & Rosa
 In 1945, teenager Nat is giving birth in a hospital bed. Whilst she is in labour, Anoushka—the pregnant woman in the next bed—reaches out and takes her hand, beginning a lifelong friendship. Nat's daughter, Ginger, and Anoushka's daughter, Rosa, grow up and become close friends. Rosa's father leaves whilst she's still a child, profoundly affecting her view of relationships.  By 1962, 17-year-old Ginger and Rosa are spending all their time together, and even dressing the same. Rosa begins drinking and behaving promiscuously. Nat disapproves of their friendship, as she thinks Rosa is a bad influence. Ginger's father, Roland, takes the opposite view to Nat and encourages his daughter's wildness and independence. Roland and Nat are having trouble in their marriage and have broken up often in the past. Roland is an attractive, free-spirited professor who is implied to have been unfaithful several times. Meanwhile, Nat gave up a possible career as a painter to raise Ginger, and often feels resentful and bored.  Rosa and Ginger attend different schools, due to Rosa failing the 11-plus exam, which Ginger passed. However, they often skip school to spend time together, and Ginger's grades suffer as a result. Ginger, who dreams of being a poet, starts to become interested in the anti-nuclear movement and attends rally meetings. Despite her wild behaviour, Rosa is a practising Catholic, and she takes Ginger to church so they can pray for the world together. During this time, Ginger is supported emotionally by her two godfathers, who are both named "Mark". She also befriends an older woman named Bella who encourages her anti-nuclear sympathies.    Soon after this, Ginger's parents break up after an argument over dinner. Roland moves out and enjoys his independent, bohemian lifestyle more. Nat visits Ginger's school and suggests that the school ought to offer more "Domestic Science" classes, which one of the teachers informs Ginger of. Nat believes that her daughter will eventually become a housewife, and she wants Ginger to be better prepared than she herself was. Ginger and Nat argue over this, and Ginger moves in with her father.  Rosa begins spending more time with Roland after a boat trip the three take together, following which she writes him a letter telling him she understands his pain. After Ginger has moved in with him, Rosa begins a relationship with him. Ginger is disturbed by the romance between her father and best friend. She is tempted to leave Roland's home and move back in with her mother, but she changes her mind after seeing Nat is happy and has begun painting again. Roland knows his behaviour is making his daughter unhappy, but while he sympathises with her sadness, he does not stop the affair. Rosa believes that she and Roland will have everlasting love, but Ginger tells her she will end up like Nat, with Roland leaving her when she gets old. Rosa tells Ginger that she thinks she's pregnant. Ginger is devastated and runs off to a protest rally, where she is arrested. In the prison, a psychiatrist comes in to talk with her, but she won't speak. He tells the two Marks and Bella that he believes her protest activity is a cover, and that he believes she has a severe mental illness. Mark II says that on the contrary, she is quite sane.  Roland and Nat and their family friends confront Ginger, who reveals that she has a terrible fear that the world is going to end. In reality, Ginger's growing worries about the world are masking her greater fear of what's happening between Roland and Rosa. As Ginger blurts out the truth of the affair, Nat is devastated. Ginger's two godfathers confront Roland and accuse him of acting irresponsibly towards his daughter, but he replies that Ginger is an independent adult. They try to show Roland that Ginger still needs a responsible father figure.  Rosa and her mother then arrive at the house, where Nat confronts Rosa. Seeing Rosa clutch her stomach, Nat deduces that she's pregnant and runs upstairs. Ginger and Mark follow her, but she has locked the door. They call Roland, who breaks the door in, and they find that Nat, though still conscious, has taken an overdose, she is then rushed to hospital. Rosa asks Ginger to forgive her, but Ginger doesn't answer, simply walking off instead.  As Roland and Ginger wait for news of Nat in the hospital, Ginger writes a letter to Rosa, in the form of a poem. In it, she discusses their friendship and differing outlooks, pointing out that Rosa dreams of "everlasting love", whilst Ginger "loves this world". The poem ends on a hopeful note: Ginger tells Rosa that if everything works out, then there will be nothing to forgive, but she'll forgive her anyway. Roland awakens from his slumber on the bench next to Ginger's one and apologises to her saying he is sorry. Ginger turns away from him and continues writing her poem to Rosa.

Girl vs. Monster
 The movie begins on the day before Halloween with Skylar, a fearless 15-year-old teenager with a powerful singing voice, prepares for the ultimate [[costume party|Halloween bash]] with her best friends, Henry and Sadie. The plan is for Skylar to sing at the party, with rock band member Ryan Dean. Skylar is crushed when the next afternoon, her parents make her stay home and even activate an alarm system to keep her in. She attempts to sneak out of the house by cutting the power so the alarm system won't work. That unfortunately unleashes a monster named Deimata (that was contained in her parents' monster containment unit) who is determined to feed the fear on Skylar and her family forever. As Skylar’s world is turned upside down, she learns that her parents have been keeping a big secret – that she comes from a long line of monster hunters. She is the 5th generation. Now, it’s up to Skylar and her friends to channel their inner strength and conquer more than just this monster. Every person has their own personal monster, which feeds on their fear.  Now that Deimata is loose, Skylar experiences all the fear she never had before and tries to deny what is happening.  She, Sadie and Henry go, armed with Skylar's parents' monster-hunting tools, to the party at the McQuarry Mansion. But Henry becomes frozen in fear, after being scared by his monster. Cobb, her parents' assistant, comes and takes him back home to fix him. Meanwhile, Deimata lures Skylar's parents into a trap by pretending that Skylar is in trouble. After this, Myra, Skylar's rival, who is at home with a broken neck, is eating ice cream. Soon, the red smoke comes out and it transforms into Deimata. She then controls Myra and goes to the party where she publicly insults Skylar of being nervous to sing at Ryan's party and Sadie comforts Skylar after she runs out, embarrassed. A possessed Myra sings in Skylar's place and turns to Theodosia and Bob (Sadie and Henry's monsters). Myra falls downstairs after Deimata leaves Myra's body as Skylar and Sadie find her. Myra informs them about Deimata and how she can possess people- like she did with her. Skylar thanks her, and she and Sadie rush to save the people upstairs.    During a confrontation with his personal monster, a fixed and armed Henry learns that letting go of his fears will cause the monsters to disintegrate into nothing. He goes to the mansion to inform Skylar of this. So, she grabs the microphone and tells Ryan to grab his guitar and meet her outside. But, Deimata possesses Ryan to better discourage Skylar from facing her fears, but he manages to break free by facing his greatest fear: asking Skylar out. Skylar faces her fears and sings in front of everybody, while Ryan and his band performs as well. While Skylar sings, all the monsters vanish and Sadie also gathers the courage to stand up to Theodosia by spelling things she couldn't when she was a little girl. When all the monsters are all vanquished, Deimata comes and reveals she cannot be destroyed that way. She then  reminds Skylar that she still has Skylar's parents in captivity, and Skylar rushes off to find them, with Sadie and Henry following behind with everybody especially Ryan and Myra watches them from a distance.    Skylar and her friends try to fight off Deimata, but she doesn't seem able to be stopped. Although Skylar has overcome her fear, she soon realizes Deimata is still feeding off of her parents' fears—about Skylar's safety.  Once Skylar gets her parents to trust her, Deimata is weakened and the three friends defeat her and capture her. At the end of the movie, Henry and Sadie are shown having no fear by doing what they are scared about doing the most. Later that day, Skylar and Ryan sing at Ryan's party in his basement. Myra becomes friends with Skylar. However, in a [[post-credits scene]], Deimata blows on the glass in the hunting unit, cracking it and we hear it break as Deimata's laugh is heard one last time, hinting at a sequel.

  College student Shae ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) blows off going to a party with her friend Karen (Reyna de Courcy) to go to [[The Hamptons]] for the weekend with her boyfriend Terry ([[Andrew Howard]]), an older man who is separated from his wife. That evening, Terry comes to her apartment. He apologizes and says that they can't see each other anymore - he and his wife have decided to reconcile, for the sake of their young daughter. The next day, Shae goes shopping at a market and sees Terry with his wife and daughter. She follows them to their house and he notices her. They don't speak, and she leaves after he closes the door. That night, she goes to the bar where she works. During her shift, she goes to the cloak-room and starts crying. Her colleague Lu ([[Nicole LaLiberte]]) comforts her and invites her out for a drink over her break-up with Terry.  Shae and Lu go out to another bar where they meet Simon ([[Michael Stahl-David]]), Eric (Carmine DiBenedetto) and Duncan (Will Brill). They drink and dance with them and then go back to Eric and Duncan's apartment. Shae kisses Simon and then goes to the bathroom, where she passed out, drunk. Feeling unwell again, Shae decides to go home. Simon offers to take her home, saying that he is about to leave anyway. They get a taxi together and are dropped off outside her apartment building. He asks if he can come up, but she tells him she has a boyfriend. He persists, asking first for her number and then for a kiss goodnight. She tells him to leave, but he violently grabs her neck and forcibly kisses her. She hits him and runs upstairs. Before she can unlock her door, he catches her, pushes her onto the floor and rapes her.  Later, in her apartment, Shae tries to call her mom and Karen, but can only reach their voicemails. With no one to talk to, she goes to Terry's house. He takes her home, furious that she has turned up at his house unannounced. They go into her apartment and Shae hugs him, not having told him that she was raped. He misunderstands and starts kissing her. She tells him to stop but he goes on. She shouts at him to get off her and starts crying. He leaves, telling her that he doesn't know what she wants from him.  The next day, Shae and Lu go to a police station to report the crime. There, the hostile and skeptical Officer Daniels (Matthew Rauch) gives Shae paperwork to fill in and sends her to the waiting area. Shae files her report with an unsympathetic detective (Kelvin Hale) and Lu notices Daniels looking at her. She flirts with him and asks him if he wants to go somewhere to have sex. They go to a local hotel where Lu cuffs him to the bed and shoots him with his gun.  Lu goes to Shae's apartment and tells her that they need to deal with the situation themselves. They go back to Eric and Duncan's apartment and probe Duncan for Simon's address. He doesn't know it, and when he mocks them about how Eric told them he and Shae had sex, Lu shoots him dead. When Eric comes back, he tells them Simon's address, and Lu shoots him too. They go to Simon's workshop and find him working alone. Shae knocks him unconscious and they tie him to a table. When he wakes up, they torture and kill him by dismembering him.  Next, they ambush Terry, holding him at gunpoint and driving him off in his own car. They drive to a secluded part of the woods and take him out of the car. Shae points the gun at him and he begs for her mercy. She can't bring herself to kill him and he starts to run away, but Lu takes the gun and shoots him. They stay in a motel that night and when Shae starts crying, Lu gets into bed with her and holds her. The next morning, they talk about what they did and while Shae says that killing all those men who wronged her did not make her feel any better, Lu says that she enjoys killing and hurting people. They go home and return to their normal lives.  After class, Shae is invited out by her classmate Tyler ([[Liam Aiken]]) and they go to the fair. She goes back to her apartment that evening and finds Lu waiting for her, annoyed that she is back so late because she had expected to surprise her with a dinner.  Shae goes to a Halloween party with Tyler. Lu secretly arrives. When Shae is in the bathroom and everyone else is watching fireworks on the roof, Lu kills Tyler with a sword. Shae sees his body and returns home, finding Lu's sword on a table. Lu steps out of the shower stark-naked and tells Shae that she did it "for us" and to "protect" her. Shae takes the sword and kills Lu.  Sometime later, Shae returns to work at the bar. During a break, she is interrupted by a crying co-worker (Makenzie Leigh). Shae asks her: "Is it a guy?", and the woman replies that it is. As the two sit together, a vision of Lu appears behind Shae.  
Girlfriend in a Coma (film)
  The documentary, using the eyes of an English outsider directed by a passionate, but exiled, Italian insider, exposes the dire situation of Italian politics and the process of economic and social decline the country has suffered during the last two decades, treating the decline as a warning of what might happen elsewhere in the West. The decline has occurred amid a collapse of moral values and the victory of "Mala Italia" over "Buona Italia". Critical of  [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the former Prime Minister, for some of the actions his government undertook or failed to undertake, and for his inappropriate use of his media companies to influence the Italian electorate, the documentary also does not spare criticism of the Left.  Overall, the film identifies "ignavia", the sin of lack of moral courage denounced by [[Dante Alighieri]] in his [[Divine Comedy]] (1321), as one of the crucial issues behind Italians’ failure to act when faced with their country’s constant decline over the past 20 years.  ===Features=== The documentary features interviews with [[Mario Monti]], Prime Minister of Italy in 2011–12, [[Elsa Fornero]], a member of his Cabinet, [[Umberto Eco]], philosopher and novelist, [[Nanni Moretti]], movie director, [[:it:Lorella Zanardo|Lorella Zanardo]], activist and filmmaker, [[Toni Servillo]], one of today’s top Italian actors,  [[John Elkann]], Chairman of [[FIAT]], [[Sergio Marchionne]], CEO of [[FIAT]], [[Carlo Petrini]], founder of [[Slow Food]], [[Roberto Saviano]], the author of [[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]], [[Giovanni Ferrero]], CEO of [[Ferrero]], [[Emma Bonino]], former European Commissioner and Italian foreign minister in 2013, [[Susanna Camusso]], trade union leader, [[Nicola Gratteri]], anti-mafia magistrate, but also many unsung heroes from civil society such as Don Giacomo Panizza, a priest who founded the "Progetto Sud" against organised crime in Calabria.

Vijay doesn't want to go, but a local pizza restaurateur convinces Vijay and his friends that the village is one big brothel. In reality, Bhamapura is a sacred village and the restaurateur had purposefully deceived Vijay and his friends. Divya ([[Soundarya Jayamala]]) and her classmates also visit the village. They come for their social activity course to improve the village's health and hygiene. A large building is reserved for him and the girls are asked to stay in the poor families' houses. Vijay and his friends arrive and start to woo the girls, whom they mistake for Bhamapura's prostitutes. When Divya discovers their plan, she and her friends decide to teach Vijay and his friends a lesson.  Vijay and his friends are wooed by Divya and the other girls. They are led to separate rooms where the girls inject a serum that makes them itch all over. They leave, screaming and scratching. Vijay tells Divya to leave her profession and offers to save her honour by marrying her in the village temple the next day. Divya doesn't come, but Vijay and his friends happen to see her leaving on a bus bearing the name of the girls' college, revealing that they have been duped. When Vijay returns home, Shivsagar discovers that his son has fallen in love. With his influence, Vijay and Divya get engaged. Later, Vijay goes to Divya's house in a drunken state. Her family prevent him from talking to her. This eventually leads to a fight. Vijay then goes to Divya's cousin's house to meet Divya and apologise for his behaviour but suddenly attempts to rape Divya's cousin. Then on the same day at night, Vijay tries to kill Shivasagar, but is luckily stopped by Ko Thanda ([[Ramesh Bhat]]) and is stabbed by Vijay. Disappointed with Vijay's behaviour, Shivasagar sends Vijay to a therapist.  Here enters Ajay (Upendra's third role), Vijay's twin. Assuming Vijay's identity, he had taken money from the bank, got drunk and went to Divya's place and attempted to rape Divya's cousin. Ajay hates Shivasagar for leaving him and his mentally-challenged mother ([[Catherine Tresa]]). Later, Divya manages to sneak into Vijay's room in the hospital and believes his explanation that he is innocent. She leaves and shortly afterwards, Ajay appears, smuggles and dumps Vijay out of the hospital, takes over his identity and goes to kill Shivasagar. The father notices that it's not his son and gets out of his wheelchair to defend himself. Vijay arrives at the scene, surprised that his father is able to walk and demands an explanation.  Shivasagar tells him that he was a dancer who behaved effeminately due to dancing. His mother had arranged for Shivasagar to marry her friend's daughter (Ajay's mother). He agreed but the girl rejected Shivasagar for being too feminine and insults him in front of the wedding crowd. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Shivasagar's mother died on the spot. Shivasagar, enraged, raped the girl, a deed that resulted in her becoming pregnant. The doctor refused to give her an abortion and so Vijay was born. Shivasagar takes his child from her mother saying the child would be the only hope of his life. Shivasagar says he is ignorant of Ajay's existence and the reason for his resemblance to them.  Ajay escapes and threatens Vijay and Divya's wedding. Shivasagar attempts to stop him when Ajay's grandmother arrives and explains that Ajay is also Shivasagar's son and Vijay's twin and that Ajay's mother went mad when Ajay was about to get hit by a lorry. Ajay realises his mistake. He wants Shivasagar to shoot him, but the police misunderstand and think that Ajay is pointing a gun at Shivasagar and they fire at Ajay. Shivasagar intervenes and is shot instead. Ajay accepts Shivasagar's apology and is then arrested. Ajay's mother does not accept food from anyone, until Vijay comes dressed up as Ajay and feeds her. The film ends with Vijay stating that Shivasagar is the [[godparent|godfather]] of the family.

God Loves Caviar
 The film is based upon the true story of [[Ioannis Varvakis]], a Greek [[caviar]] merchant and eventual benefactor from [[Psara]] who was formerly a pirate.  He was born in [[Psara]], and from an early age he learned to navigate the seas, an occupation revered and steeped in tradition on the island where he grew up. At the age of 17 he built his own ship, which he would later offer to the [[Russians]] during the [[Orlov Revolt]]. Ultimately, his ship was destroyed, and he turned to [[Saint Petersburg]] to ask for an audience with [[Catherine the Great]]. He was given compensation for the loss of his ship and granted authorization to fish freely in the [[Caspian Sea]]. Due to his superb navigational skills and excellent seamanship abilities, he dominated the [[Caspian Sea]] and soon became substantially wealthy. When he initially discovered the superior [[caviar]] of the Beluga Sturgeon, he quickly discerned that there could be an incredible market trading for this product. From the [[caviar]] trade he eventually became a millionaire and later donated part of his fortune for important works that improved the life of Russians and Greeks on the [[Black Sea]] coasts. In his later years, he became a member of the [[Filiki Eteria]], which would contribute to the overthrow of the Ottoman rule of Greece. He died in 1825 in [[Zante]], during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. After his death, his entire estate went to the Ioannis Varvakis Foundation which would offer up important grants throughout Greece. The script follows the entire life of Varvakis, but the film's narration begins with his final moments in Zante.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  
Goat Story 2
 The Goat leaves old [[Prague]] for fairy cheese kingdom. She must save parents of her new friends.  
The Golden Temple (film)
 In the years leading up to the 2012 Olympics, [[East London]], the eventual site of the Olympic park, is transformed into a construction site. Indeed, one of the factors that was instrumental in leading the Olympic committee to choose London as the location for the 2012 games was the promise to reinvigorate this area, which was considered to be one of the poorest in [[Great Britain]].<ref>[https://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/1E506FE2-3179-439C-81F2-B43D0B97D058/0/CGT_NetRaising_8Olympicpresentation.pdf "Why was London chosen to hold the 2012 Olympiad"], (study, retrieved 15.01.2016),</ref>  The film shows the mood of the area at the time to be one of hope and expectation, by interviewing inhabitants and workers in order to explore the urban and social changes brought about by the imminent arrival of the great sporting event. The theme of the clash between large-scale events and the daily lives of ordinary people is explored through the use of symbolism: three ‘temples’ are examined – hence the title of the film, ‘The Golden Temple.’ First we see the [[stadium]], a veritable temple of games and entertainment: we hear in one witness’s account, however, that it was built over radioactive waste. The second symbolic temple – this time, a shrine to consumerism – is [[Westfield Stratford City]], one of the biggest [[shopping centre]]s in Europe.  It was constructed in such a way that all Olympic spectators had to pass through it to reach the stadium. The third symbolic temple is not, unlike the others, a real construction, but is instead represented by numerous religious communities in the area seeking new followers, and more specifically by the plans to build a new [[mosque]] in the area at around the same time, which were eventually scrapped.  Among these metaphorical temples, we meet various people who talk of their hopes and eventual delusions regarding the regeneration of the area. Among them are Mike, a photo journalist who lives on a house boat on the canal; John, a businessman; Sue, one of the Olympic Games tourist guides; and the apostle Ben, so-called ‘General of God,’ a Ghanaian evangelist who preaches in a military uniform. The English author [[Iain Sinclair]] also appears in the film. He criticises the militarisation of the city of London under the pretext of the Olympic Games, an argument which he explores further in his book ‘Ghost Milk.’  
God's Neighbors
 A band of violent [[Hasidim]] patrol their [[Bat Yam]] neighborhood and terrorize Arabs and the non-observant.<ref></ref>  
Goltzius and the Pelican Company
 The film is based on the life of [[Hendrik Goltzius]], a late 16th-century Dutch printer and engraver of erotic prints. He seduces the Margrave of [[Alsace]] into paying for a printing press to make and publish illustrated books. Goltzius promises him an extraordinary book of pictures of the [[Old Testament]] Biblical stories.

Good Deeds
 The film opens with Wesley Deeds ([[Tyler Perry]]), head of the family-owned Deeds Corporation, dressing for work. His fiancée, Natalie ([[Gabrielle Union]]), fixes breakfast for him, noting his predictable routine. Before work, Wesley picks up his delinquent younger brother, Walter ([[Brian J. White]]), who lost his driver's license after a string of DUIs. They have lunch with their mother, the respectable Wilimena Deeds ([[Phylicia Rashad]]). After lunch, Wilimena meets Natalie, Natalie's mother, and Natalie's best friend at the bridal shop. The two mothers urge Natalie to think about her future with Wesley.  On the impoverished side of town, Lindsey Wakefield ([[Thandie Newton]]), a single mother and cleaner for the Deeds Corporation, finds out she will be evicted if she doesn't pay her bills soon. Lindsey rushes to pick up her check from work and ends up parking in Wesley's reserved spot, leaving her six-year-old daughter, Ariel ([[Jordenn Thompson]]), in the car. Wesley and Walter find Ariel. Lindsey returns to find her car towed and argues with the two men. Lindsey takes Ariel to school, while Wesley has a meeting with his coworker and best friend, John ([[Eddie Cibrian]]), over acquiring a company Wesley's father has been competing against for years.  After work, Lindsey discovers she has been evicted. Taking her belongings, she picks up Ariel from school and works another shift. Ariel stays in a broom closet during the shift. They then begin to live in their van. Wesley sees them and decides to watch over them until Lindsey's "boyfriend" comes for them. Wesley takes Lindsey and Ariel out for pizza; the trio bonds.  Ariel's teacher finds out Lindsey and Ariel are homeless and threatens to call child services.

Wilimena hints to Lindsey that Wesley would not stay with someone poorer for long. Natalie, Wesley, Walter, Wilimena, and Lindsey become trapped in an elevator after Wesley and Walter fight. Natalie and Wilimena notice Lindsey reaching for Wesley's hand, which was injured in the fight.  Wesley visits Lindsey that night, but she rejects him.

Gone (2012 film)
  Jillian "Jill" Conway ([[Amanda Seyfried]]) lives in [[Portland, Oregon]] with her sister Molly ([[Emily Wickersham]]), a college student. Much earlier, Jill was kidnapped by a brutal [[serial killer]] who put her in a deep vertical hole somewhere in Portland's 5,100-acre [[Forest Park (Portland, Oregon)|Forest Park]]. Jill found human remains, used one of the bones to stab her abductor, and escaped from the hole, using his rope ladder. When the Portland police are unable to find the hole, and discover that Jill had been committed to a psychiatric institution after her parents' death, they believe the abduction only happened in Jill's head, and sent Jill back to a psychiatric facility.  A year later, Jill now works as a waitress in a local diner on the [[Shift work#Graveyard shift|graveyard shift]]. She and her friend Sharon Ames ([[Jennifer Carpenter]]) are generously tipped by a regular customer. Returning home from the shift, Jill is shocked to discover Molly is missing, as she was to take an exam the next day and wanted Jill to wake her early. Molly's boyfriend, Billy ([[Sebastian Stan]]), tells her that he hasn't heard from Molly, and later that she didn't show up for the exam. Jill is then convinced the serial killer who took her has now taken Molly.  Police Lt. Ray Bozeman ([[Michael Paré]]), Sergeant Powers ([[Daniel Sunjata]]), and Detective Erica Lonsdale ([[Katherine Moennig]]) dismiss her claims, trying to look for any other excuse for Molly to be missing, believing that it's all in Jill's head. The department's newest homicide detective, Peter Hood ([[Wes Bentley]]), tells her that he believes her, giving Jill his card in case she needs any help about the case.  Jill interrogates her neighbors and learns that a van with a locksmith company's name on it parked in front of her house in the middle of the night. Jill finds the company it belongs to and talks to owner Henry Massey (Ted Rooney) and the van's driver, Massey's son Nick ([[Joel David Moore]]). When Nick denies any knowledge, Jill breaks into the van, where she finds a receipt from a hardware store for things that the killer would use. Jill holds Nick at gunpoint and forces him to reveal that he allowed a stranger named "Digger" to rent the van during the night.  Nick reports Jill's gun-waving behavior to the police, who then want to arrest Jill, as her time in the psychiatric facility means she can not legally possess a weapon. Jill goes to the hardware store, and learns that Digger's real name is Jim LaPointe ([[Socratis Otto]]) and that he's staying at a rundown hotel. After narrowly eluding the police, Jill heads to the hotel, and breaks into LaPointe's room, where she finds duct tape, pet food like that which she was given by her kidnapper, and matches from the diner where she works.  Jill visits Sharon, and learns that LaPointe is the generous tipper from the diner. Sharon gives her LaPointe's phone number and against Sharon's judgment, Jill leaves with the phone number. Jill is spotted by the police who pursue her through Portland, but she escapes back to Sharon's house. Jill borrows Sharon's car to avoid the police and save Molly. Jill then calls LaPointe, who gives her directions to a location in Forest Park. Jill locates a small campsite and finds pictures of LaPointe's prior victims, and at the same time, Molly breaks the duct tape off of her hands, and escapes, only to discover she has been concealed under her house all along. Powers and Lonsdale are shocked when they hear Molly's story, finally believing what they have heard from Jill. They also learn Jill is to meet the kidnapper, but they don't know where that is to happen.  Jill finds the hole where LaPointe held her captive. LaPointe emerges from an alcove from within the hole and grabs Jill, pulling her into the hole. He intends to kill her with the same piece of bone that Jill stabbed him with in her initial escape. Jill kicks LaPointe to keep him away, then grabs her revolver and shoots him. She starts climbing up the rope ladder to get away, but LaPointe grabs her foot and attempts to pull her back down. Desperate, Jill kicks LaPointe to break his hold and shoots him again. She then manages to climb away and extracts the rope ladder, trapping LaPointe in the hole. After shooting LaPointe a third time in the leg so that he cannot stand, Jill demands he tell her where Molly is, on a promise of not shooting him again. LaPointe admits that Molly has been bound and gagged under their house the whole time, and he only used Molly to lure Jill into the trap. Jill pours a can of kerosene into the hole. As LaPointe begs for his life, saying "You said you wouldn't kill me," she says "I lied," and drops in a lantern, burning LaPointe to cremate.  Jill disposes of the revolver and returns home, finding Molly okay, along with Powers, Lonsdale, and Hood. As Molly is terrified at the ordeal, Jill whispers to her that LaPointe is dead. When Powers asks about the man she was to meet, Jill (with deadpan sarcasm) tells the police, "It was all in my head." Then she and Molly go into the house and close the door, leaving the police and Billy frustrated.  Some time later, Bozeman, in his office, receives an anonymous package. Inside are the pictures LaPointe had taken of each of his victims, bound and gagged, including Jill herself. An included map indicates the spot in Forest Park where the police can find the hole. Realizing how wrong he was about Jill, Bozeman calls Powers into his office to investigate the new leads.

The Gospel of Us
  A group of people are filming a home movie on the beach when they are interrupted by two men in the background. The Stranger ([[Nigel Barrett]]) becomes violent towards The Teacher ([[Michael Sheen]]) and chases him away. He then runs towards the camera and grabs it, screaming, 'Forty days!' into it.  A young girl watches a news broadcast where a woman ([[Di Botcher]]) is showing photographs of her missing son, The Teacher. On the beach at dawn, people gather at the water's edge. The Stranger walks into the water and waits there. From the sand dunes The Teacher, dressed in bedraggled clothing, appears and walks to the water. He removes his clothes and walks into the sea towards The Stranger, who pushes him under the water. When The Teacher emerges, he cries and is carried to shore where he is wrapped in a cloth and carried away while the people sing, 'He is come.'  Later that day there is a gathering at the beach, where the council await a visit from ICU, a company who has worked closely with the town for years. Entertainers perform for the crowds but are interrupted by The Stranger, who digs a door out of the sand. He stands the door up and from behind it appears a young boy with the likeness of The Teacher. As soon as it begins, the event is over and the celebrations continue until the Company Man ([[Hywel Simons]]) arrives by boat, accompanied by his Security Chief ([[Gerald Tyler]]) and full security team. The Company Man begins addressing the people of the town but is interrupted when a woman ([[Francine Morgan]]) strapped with explosives emerges from the crowd. A masked man who has hijacked the tannoy system ([[Jordan Bernarde]]) threatens to detonate the bomb if the company do not leave the town. Before anything happens, The Teacher appears at the waves and walks to the woman, talking to her. He discovers that her name is Joanna and asks her to tell him her story. He removes the bomb and the two embrace, but before any of the security or police can speak with them, they are gone. The bomber is arrested and taken away.  Later that day ICU holds a conference at the town hall to discuss their plans for the town. The Company man speaks to the Mayor (Ken Tucker) about why he can't tell the people of the town that they will all be moved on, and that he must lie to them. The Company Man takes to the mic and explains to the people of the town that in addition to the M4 motorway that runs through the town, the company will be adding a new road, entitled the Passover Project. He explains that families whose houses stand in the way will be rehomed. The people of the town start to revolt, until one woman is shot by the Security Chief. The Teacher appears and cradles her. When questioned by the Company Man about what he wants, he replies, 'I came here to listen!'  The teacher gathers more followers: a fisherman, Peter ([[David Rees Talbot]]), Alfie ([[Darren Lawrence]]), a man who is haunted by the ghosts of people who used to live in his street, homeless twins with no name whom he calls Legion ([[John-Paul Macleod]], [[Matthew Aubrey]]), his brother whom he doesn't recognise, Kyle ([[Kyle Rees]]) and a musician, Simon ([[Matt Woodyatt]]). At the shopping centre, his mother finds him, but he doesn't recognise her.  Later that night, The Teacher and his friends celebrate at Peter's local club. The Teacher is volunteered to draw the raffle, and his mother approaches him again. She gives him a photograph of him and his daughter, whom he doesn't remember. The encounter visibly moves him, and he calls Joanne into a back room. There he asks her to give him up to ICU's security, and she reluctantly agrees. The friends stumble outside drunkenly, and there The Teacher sees visions of three women: his daughter, his wife and his mother-in-law. He then sees a vision of the Security Chief, covered in blood and adorned with antlers. He asks him to tell him his story, but the vision replies, 'I have no story. I am.'  The visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips ([[Kristian Phillips]]). He is taken to the back of a flat-bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof.  The following day The Teacher and the bomber from the beach, Barry Absalum, are tried. Barry is set free and The Teacher is found guilty by the Company Man. Peter tries to stop the events happening by declaring that he does know The Teacher, but it is too late. He is dragged into the town centre and is beaten by the security team. They dress him in a nighty and place a crown of barbed wire upon his head to humiliate him. Sgt Phillips and the rest of the local police refuse to participate. The Teacher is bundled into a van and driven to a local stonemasons, where he is handed a cross. He then follows Simon's drum, and a procession of all the people in the town begin to walk. The Teacher collapses and is carried into the town centre, where his mother bathes his wounds and replaces his crown with one of roses. The procession continues until they reach the beach, where a podium built of all of the doors of the people of the town stands. The Teacher is stripped and nailed to the cross and raised above the town.  As he hangs, a picture of his daughter comes alive in his mind and suddenly he remembers. We cut to The Teacher's video diary of his forty missing days, where he flees to the hills surrounding the town due to pressure in his life. He lives happily in the hills, free from his troubles, remarking about the M4 motorway that scars the town. He states that 'Nobody stops in Port Talbot'. On the fortieth day, when journeying into the town for food, he gets lost and begins to forget who he is. It is at this moment that he stumbles down to the beach where he is held under the water by The Stranger. With his memory restored, The Teacher begins to cry out about all of the memories of the town until the skyline is lit with a burst of light and all of the town is brought back to life with old memories.  After he dies, his followers wrap him in cloth and lower him gently, where his mother cradles his body and sings to him. Joanne approaches to remove the cloth to show the town their hero one last time, but when she does, his body is gone and in his place are hundreds of flowers. The Stranger appears on the podium, exclaiming, 'It is finished, it has begun!' and pulls back his hood to reveal himself as The Teacher.

Goodbye Promise
  When Matt moved to [[Hollywood]] he made a pact with himself that if he wasn't a working actor in exactly seven years he'd quit the business and move back to [[Washington, DC]]. As the film opens Matt finds himself seven days shy of his self-prescribed deadline, and he's just as anonymous as the day he arrived into town. After an afternoon of soul searching in the [[Hollywood Hills|mountains]] he decides to honor his deadline, and plans to spend his final week in Hollywood visiting friends to tell them he's leaving for good and that he'll have a going away party to cap it all off. With a couple days left before his going away party and tension mounting, Matt visits his eclectic mix of friends and people who have affected him over the years. Despite intending to tell them he's quitting the business, he chickens out, not quite being able to bring himself to tell them.  On the night of the going away party he starts to think he's been stood up by everyone he thought he cared about and thought cared about him. But finally Dylan shows, then Robert, Amanda, JR - even Mylo, which means a great deal to Matt - and before long all the people he's visited over the past week are at the party. Amid drinks and music each friend stands up and gives their "goodbye Matt" speeches, making it clear that even though Matt's leaving he'll never be forgotten; he may be giving up on his dreams but he's been a good friend and helped a lot of people. In the middle of Matt's going away speech Sara pops in, looking beautiful, and Matt becomes so shocked and tongue-tied that he has to cut his speech short and take Sara out back alone. It is here that Matt asks her bluntly: "If I stay in Hollywood would you be with me?" She shakes her head. This is the final straw. There's officially nothing keeping him in Los Angeles. Matt is emasculated, and now more inspired than ever to leave Los Angeles in his rear view mirror. He heads back into the party to say his final goodbyes.  During the goodbyes Matt notices he has a phone message. He excuses himself and checks it in a quiet back room. The message is from his agent, who has gotten him a big audition for a new [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] [[Television pilot|pilot]]. But they want Matt on the same day he's set to drive back to DC. He's made up his mind, though. He's leaving for good. He finishes his goodbyes, goes home and packs his car for an early morning exit.  In the wee hours of the morning Matt gases up at a gas station and drives to a red light right before the freeway. He waits for the traffic light to turn green, and when it does, he just sits there, idling. The cars behind him honk and screech around him, but Matt refuses to budge at that green light. After a minute or so the light is still green, and he's still there, stone-faced. A satisfied smirk forms on his lips. Cut to black.  
Grabbers
 [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] Ciarán O'Shea ([[Richard Coyle]]), an [[alcoholic]], initially resents his new partner, Garda Lisa Nolan ([[Ruth Bradley]]), a workaholic seeking to impress her superiors by volunteering for temporary duty in a remote Irish island. After discovering mutilated whale corpses, the quiet community slowly comes to realise that they're under attack by bloodsucking tentacled aliens of various sizes that came from a ball of green light that fell from the sky, dubbing them "Grabbers". When Paddy (Lalor Roddy), the town drunk, inexplicably survives an attack, the local marine ecologist, Dr. Smith ([[Russell Tovey]]), theorizes that his high [[blood alcohol content]] proved toxic to the Grabbers, who survive on blood and water. O'Shea contacts the mainland, but an oncoming storm prevents any escape or help. The group also realizes the rain will allow the remaining large male Grabber to move about the island freely. Seeking to keep calm in the town, Nolan and O'Shea organize a party at the local pub, intending to keep the island's residents safe but unaware of the danger. Initially hesitant to join in a celebration when no good reason can be offered, the people enthusiastically agree when Brian Maher (David Pearse), the pub owner, offers free drinks. O'Shea volunteers to stay sober so that he can coordinate the towns defenses, and everyone else becomes drunk.  In a drunken stupor, Nolan reveals that she has come to the island to escape the shadow of her more-favoured sister. When they are alone in a squad car, Nolan confesses to O'Shea that she has feelings for him despite turning down his advances earlier. Smith wanders outside the pub and tries to get a picture of the beast, reasoning that his inebriated state will protect him from being eaten. Instead, the monster throws him into the air and kills him. Nolan and O'Shea escape to the pub, where they try to protect the townspeople. Nolan drunkenly reveals the danger they are in while trying to reassure everyone that nothing is trying to kill them. Panicked, they retreat to the second level of the pub, and baby grabbers take over the first floor. Nolan accidentally sets the pub on fire while trying to sneak out, but she and O'Shea manage to draw the attention of the adult.  O'Shea and Nolan drive to a construction site, and the monster follows them. There, they hope to strand the monster on dry land, as it needs water to survive. Before they can successfully set a trap, the monster arrives and attacks O'Shea. Although wounded, he survives the attack, and Nolan uses the heavy construction equipment to mount a counter-attack, pinning it at the base of a pit. The monster grabs O'Shea, but before it can eat him he dumps a bottle of Paddy's [[poitín]] into its mouth, sickening it and causing it to release him. Nolan then ignites nearby explosives with a flare gun, killing the Grabber. As the storm clears up, they return to the town and O'Shea throws away his flask. The film ends with a shot of more Grabber eggs hatching.

Grave Encounters 2
 Film student Alex Wright and his friends Jennifer Parker, Trevor Thompson, Tessa Hamill, and Jared Lee all decide to produce a documentary about the original ''[[Grave Encounters]]'' film, which the entire public aside from Alex believes to be fake. Alex posts an online plea for any information about the film and receives a message from someone named "DeathAwaits6". The message leads him to the mother of Sean Rogerson, the actor who played Lance in ''Grave Encounters''. She believes that Sean is still alive but they discover from her caretaker that she has severe [[dementia]] and does not realize that her son is actually dead.  Alex realizes the cast and crew from the first film are all missing or have died (except for the directors, The Vicious Brothers, who we learn are actually interns of the first film's producer, Jerry Hartfield, and were not directly involved thus sparing their lives). He receives a mysterious message leading him to Hartfield, who confesses that the film was actual found footage. Discovering that the Collingwood Mental Hospital from the film is actually an abandoned asylum in [[Canada]], Alex and his friends travel to there to meet DeathAwaits6, where they discover a [[Ouija|Ouija board]]. Using it to communicate with spirits, they realize that their online contact is not a person, but a paranormal entity, which turns violent and forces the group to flee. Alex decides the group should leave but not until they gather all the cameras.  The group unsuccessfully tries to escape, resulting in the deaths of Jared (violently hurled out of the room with the cursed window and falls to his death) and Tessa ([[spinal cord]] severed). The survivors also witness the death of the asylum's security guard by electrocution. Fleeing from one of the spirits, the group manages to escape the hospital and return back to the hotel, at which point they decide to abandon the project and flee.  However, to their dismay, the hotel's elevator leads the group back to the tunnels beneath the hospital. There, they meet the actor Sean Rogerson and discover that he has been trapped inside for over nine years, [[lobotomized]] and driven insane. Rogerson explains that the reason the hospital is like this is due to Dr. Arthur Friedkin's [[Satanism|satanic]] experiments and rituals which merged the spirit world and the real world. He then shows them a red door in one of the rooms and tells them it is the only way out, but it is wrapped in chains that require a chain cutter to remove that is lost (the instrument is in a tool bag left behind by Trevor in one of the rooms) and eventually retrieved.  While the group sleeps for the night, Rogerson, compelled by Dr. Friedkin's demonic voice, kills Trevor, then steals the team's equipment to cut the chains on the red door. He goes through it, only to realize that the door leads nowhere. In a mental frenzy, he begins talking to the entities, who instruct Rogerson to continue killing.  Having woken up and realizing Rogerson and their equipment are missing, Alex and Jennifer explore and stumble upon Friedkin's satanic altar as he performs a lobotomy, then the [[Human sacrifice| sacrifice of an infant]]. The couple flees and encounters Rogerson, who demands them to hand over their tapes in order to "finish" the film, which is the only way to escape the hospital. Alex refuses and Rogerson tries to kill him.  During the struggle, a void opens up on the wall and sucks Rogerson in. Realizing that Rogerson was being honest in how to escape, Alex kills Jennifer thus completing the film. He then exits the hospital through the red door, which leads him to the outskirts of [[Los Angeles]]. He is soon arrested while walking down the street at night. The last scene shows that the footage has been made into a film, with Alex and producer Jerry Hartfield claiming that everything the public sees has been staged and that it is "just a movie". However, Alex tells the interviewers not to go anywhere near the hospital because "it's not worth it".  The film ends, cutting to a black screen with the numbers "49, 14, 122, 48" appearing on screen for a split second, which, if Google searched, comes up as [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]], the hospital where the film was filmed.

The film is set when Raja, a young man of twenty-five years, reintegrates into society. The film's main character is determined to secure employment inside a large mansion, a mysterious aspiration that becomes clear as the narrative progresses.  Raja proceeds to impress the owner of the residence, Mihir Das (Mihir Samantray), as well as his wife, Tulasi (Priya Choudhury). He is subsequently employed as the couple's driver, having gradually won the pair over. Due to circumstance, Raja is compelled to inform Tulasi about his commitment to his dead mother and, from that point forward, Raja perceives Tulasi as a maternal figure. The film then becomes increasingly suspenseful, as a photo of Raja's mother is revealed and the audience is shown that Tulasi appears identical to the deceased woman.  The narrative also explores the concept of the "good" boy or man. Mihir Das is a character with a respectable status in terms of social perception, possessing wealth and fame. However, the film questions the basis of such social status, as it is revealed that Das has employed criminal measures in order to attain his privileged position.

Guns, Girls and Gambling
 John Smith ([[Christian Slater]]) is down on his luck. His girlfriend left him for a doctor. He headed to an Indian Reservation casino only to have his wallet stolen by a hooker. His money was in a security wallet though, so he enters an Elvis Impersonation contest and loses but then proceeds to play cards with four other Elvis impersonators: The Winner Elvis ([[Gary Oldman]]), Gay Elvis ([[Chris Kattan]]), Little Person Elvis ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]), and Asian Elvis ([[Anthony Brandon Wong]]). They beat him at cards enough times to bankrupt him and then he dozes off. He is later awakened by casino security guards who think he stole a priceless ancient Native American mask.  It turns out that the owner of the casino "The Chief" had the ancient Native mask in a saferoom and now it's gone and witnesses saw an Elvis impersonator steal it, so John becomes the prime suspect. The two Native security guards ([[Michael Spears|Michael]] and [[Eddie Spears]]) figure John didn't take it but they still decide to kill him while they hunt for the real culprit, presumably Winner Elvis. The Chief says he will pay $1,000,000 for its return. The last thing John sees is them opening the trunk of his car, then writing down Elvis's address, then they knock him out.  Meanwhile, we get introduced to a hitwoman known as "The Blonde" who quotes [[Edgar Allan Poe]] before killing her victims. She confronts Gay Elvis and asks where the mask is. He tells her he doesn't have it. She kills him and leaves one of John Smith's credit cards on his corpse (apparently she is allied with John's wallet thief).  John regains consciousness and is still in the trunk of the car. He escapes and finds the Native security guards shot dead.  He gets Winner Elvis's address and goes to his house. When he gets there, he meets Elvis's neighbor Cindy ([[Megan Park]]). They realize the mask isn't there, but they find Asian Elvis's address and decide to go to his house. Before they leave, they are almost shot to death by another hitman "The Cowboy" ([[Jeff Fahey]]) and his sidekick Mo.  As they escape, John suggests calling the sheriff only to have Cindy explain that there are two sheriffs and both are corrupt. One is on The Chief's payroll and the other is on The Rancher's payroll.  They also encounter "The Rancher" ([[Powers Boothe]]). He explains that he hired the Elvises to steal the mask because he used to have it. It is revealed through a flashback that back in the 1980s, a family consisting of a father, mother, and son were working for the rancher and transporting the mask. They reached a train station only to get ambushed by Natives who killed the family and took back the mask. Now he wants it back and will pay $1,000,000 to whoever gets it.  They leave and go to Asian Elvis's house. He tries to kill them before getting [[tomahawk]]ed to death by another hitman "The Indian". They escape and head back to Elvis's house only to have Little Man Elvis show up with a gun asking them where the mask is. Before he can shoot them, The Blonde shows up and kills Little Man Elvis. As they are leaving, they run into The Sheriffs who arrest John for Little Man Elvis's murder. However, Cindy posts bail and he is released. But the Sheriffs know that John knows more than he's letting on so they follow him.  Meanwhile, Winner Elvis is on the way to delivering the mask only to have his car break down. He hikes a long way and gets to a bus stop. As he boards the bus, The Blonde enters and shoots him. As he is dying he whispers something to The Blonde and she smiles broadly. The bus driver is on the phone with someone and The Blonde deduces that he is in cahoots with The Rancher and The Chief playing both sides. She kills him as well.  Later, John, Cindy, and The Sheriffs make it to the bus. They see Elvis and the bus driver's bodies inside the bus and written on them is "Bring the mask and John Smith to Station 12". Station 12 is the same station where the family was killed in the 80s. As they're leaving, The Cowboy and Mo show up and reveal that The Cowboy is a fast sharpshooter who killed the two Indian security guards earlier in the film.  As The Sheriffs are drawing their guns, The Cowboy kills them both. Then The Indian shows up and tomahawks The Cowboy and Mo before they can get a shot off. The Indian accompanies them to Station 12.  As they show up, The Rancher and The Chief also show up each holding a briefcase with $1,000,000. At this point, Cindy reveals that she is The Rancher's daughter and was following John to make sure he would find the mask for her father. The Blonde comes out and instructs them to hand their briefcases to John and he enters the station alone. The Indian has a better idea and runs in with his tomahawk to kill The Blonde. The Indian then tries to attack The Blonde, but she blocks all of his attacks. She then kicks him several times, knocking him out. Then The Blonde shoots The Indian and kills him. She re-emerges and repeats her instructions promising more deaths if they don't comply.  John takes the briefcases and enters the station. As he enters, he and The Blonde embrace. They are scamming everybody.  It turns out that the family that was killed in the 1980s were John Smith's parents. They had an Indian servant who hid John in the floorboard of the station and told the Indians that he was dead too. The servant was part of a rival Native tribe "The Hopi". The mask really belonged to her tribe and The Chief stole it from her.  The Blonde is the girlfriend who left John Smith at the beginning of the movie because she realized she liked women. However, she knew what happened to John's family so she stuck around long enough to assist him. Also, when John told her she would get one of the briefcases, that enticed her further.  John and The Blonde emerge from the station and tell The Rancher and The Chief why they are doing this. Also, she tells them that Elvis destroyed the mask when he realized he wouldn't be able to sell it. That was what he said to her before dying.  John tells The Rancher and The Chief that he's keeping one briefcase because of what they did to his family. The Blonde tells them she will return and kill them if they try to retaliate. Then she leaves with the other briefcase on a motorcycle driven by the woman who stole John's wallet. She is actually the doctor that The Blonde left him for posing as a hooker.  At this point, he finds Elvis's car and repairs it and drives it. It only broke down before because he sabotaged it in a way that could be repaired. Also, he actually tried to steal the mask earlier in the film, but Elvis caught him doing it and knocked him out and took it for himself.  It turns out the Indian servant was in on the scam too. The mask wasn't really destroyed. John returns it to her since her tribe rightfully owns it. Elvis actually told The Blonde "Elvis has left the building" before dying. She just lied about his last words.  And finally, it is revealed that his name isn't even John Smith. Someone he bumped into at the beginning of the movie is really John Smith and he pickpocketed him.  
The Guilt Trip (film)
 Andy Brewster ([[Seth Rogen]]) is a [[UCLA]]-graduate [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] and inventor. He is attempting to get his environmentally friendly cleaning product, ScieoClean, in a major retail store. However, each retail store he visits dismisses him before he can end his pitch. After a disappointing sales pitch to [[K-Mart]], he visits his mother, Joyce Brewster ([[Barbra Streisand]]), in [[New Jersey]] before leaving on a cross-country trip to [[Las Vegas]], lying to her that his pitch ended well so she won't worry about him. While there she reveals to him that he was named after a boy she fell in love with in Florida named Andrew Margolis, whom she hoped would object to her marriage with Andy's father. However, he never did and she felt that she never mattered to him afterwards. After a little research, he finds Andrew Margolis is still alive and unmarried living in [[San Francisco]]. He invites his unknowing mother on the trip, claiming he wants to spend some time with her.  The road trip quickly becomes hard for Andy as his mother continues to intervene in his life. After their car breaks down in [[Tennessee]], Joyce calls Andy's ex-girlfriend Jessica ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), whom Joyce insists Andy should get back together with, to pick them up. At a pregnant and married Jessica's house she reveals that Andy proposed to her before college and she turned him down, shocking Joyce, who believed Andy had trouble proposing to women. Andy is glum afterward and Joyce apologizes for calling Jessica, which Andy half-heartedly accepts. In [[Texas]], Andy has a meeting with [[Costco]] executive Ryan McFeer ([[Brandon Keener]]) however Joyce stays at the meeting and criticizes the products bottling and name along with Ryan to the point that Andy snaps at him. At the motel that night a depressed Andy begins drinking and Joyce attempts to make up with him however Andy snaps at her, only to have Joyce snap back and leave for a nearby bar. Later Andy attempts to retrieve his mother but gets in a fight with a bar patron who attempts to stop her from leaving, receiving a black eye in the process.  At a steak restaurant the next day the two exchange apologies and Andy reveals that he is failing at selling ScieoClean. Joyce enters a steak eating challenge where she is noticed by cowboy-styled businessman Ben Graw ([[Brett Cullen]]), who gives her tips on eating and helps her finish the challenge. Afterwards he reveals he does a lot of business in New Jersey and asks her to dinner. Joyce, who has never been in a relationship after Andy's dad died when he was eight, balks at the offer so Ben merely leaves his number and asks her to call if she reconsiders.  Andy and Joyce begin to genuinely enjoy each other's company after, taking time out of their trip to visit the [[Grand Canyon]] (which Joyce has always wanted to visit) and having many other adventures.  At Las Vegas, Joyce has such a good time that she asks Andy to leave her while he visits San Francisco, forcing him to reveal that there is no sales pitch in San Francisco and he only invited her to get her to meet Andrew Margolis. Joyce is very distraught as she believed Andy invited her because he actually wanted to spend time with her. He goes to make his pitch at the [[Home Shopping Network]] but finds that his science-fact based pitch bores the network's executives and makes them uninterested. He then sees Joyce in the filming crew and takes her advice by appealing to the Network's host family safety and drinking his own product, proving that it is organic and safe for children. Afterwards the Network CEO approaches him and shows genuine interest in selling ScieoClean on the Network. Later, a jubilant Andy and Joyce decide to visit Andrew Margolis's house.  However, when they arrive they are informed by Andrew's son, Andrew Margolis Jr. ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]) (whom Andy mistakenly researched instead of the father) that his father died five years ago. After seeing Joyce's grief he invites them inside, where he learns that his father and Joyce were close. She asks if Andrew's father ever mentioned her, but he says he never did as he only confided personal information to their mother, who is away. However he then introduces his sister ([[Ari Graynor]]), who is named Joyce after Andy's mom. Joyce is overjoyed by this as she had previously stated her belief that you name your children after someone you cherished and want to remember. This shatters her belief that she didn't matter to Andrew and makes her overjoyed.  Afterwards they part ways at the [[San Francisco Airport]]; Andy to make his next sales pitch and Joyce back to New Jersey, where she arranges a date with Ben Graw. The two leave content and much closer than they had been.  
The Guillotines
 During the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-ruled [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] established a secret assassination squad known as the '[[Flying guillotine|Guillotines]]' to eliminate all who posed a threat to him. Once heavily favored by the emperor, the Guillotines are deemed expendable once the [[Qianlong Emperor]] ascends to the throne and adopts Western ideas and technology. To consolidate his power under a new regime, the Qianlong Emperor continues to use the Guillotines to persecute the conquered [[Han Chinese]] in a reign of terror and oppression. The current guillotine squad is led by master fighter Leng and it consists of six young warriors: Musen, Houjia Shisan, Chen Tai, Hutu, Su and Buka. Serving the Qing court unquestioningly, they have never failed in 348 missions to eliminate their targets. However, their most recent mission would make it their last.  The Hans have been oppressed by their Manchurian-ruled government, causing social unrest and internal conflicts. Tian-Lang (Wolf), is the charismatic prophetic Han rebel leader of a group known as the Herders. Wolf was captured alive by Leng and Wolf tells him that Leng is destined to kill him, but not at this place and time. Wolf was scheduled for execution the following day, however, Wolf's gang ambushes the execution parade and fends off both the Guillotines and the Green Army; it allowed Wolf to escape, but Bai-Lan (Herders member) was captured. In the chaos of fighting, Wolf takes Musen (the only female member of the Guillotines) hostage in hopes to exchange back Bai-Lan. However, the Guillotines were dispatched to recover both Musen and finish off Wolf.  With reports that Wolf has fled to the outer frontiers, the squad tracks the Herders to a remote village outpost, heavily occupied by Han and smallpox-diseased inhabitants. Added to the mission, the Qianlong Emperor (who favors advanced weaponry over antiquated assassins) has sent his most trusted agent, Haidu (secret sworn brother to Leng and right-hand man to the emperor) for the same mission. Unknown to the Guillotines, the emperor wants to absolve his legacy and the Guillotines is a living taint to his rule; they must be erased. Although Leng knew of the emperor's intentions and also wanted to help end the Guillotines, the group has become a family to him and he couldn't eliminate them. Therefore, Haidu was also sent there to finish a job Leng didn't have the heart to do; the definitive moment would help during their exchange.  At the exchange site, the Han and the Herders appeared in a display of unity and force, there to complete the exchange of prisoners when Haidu dispatched his rifle attack squadron on both the Guillotines and the Herders; Bai-Lan was killed in the attack. Shocked at the attack on his own teammates, Leng resisted Haidu in open defiance to the emperor's will, making him an enemy target as well; both the Guillotines and Herders survived the attack and escaped to safety. Confused as to what has happened, it was then Leng revealed his real identity to the Guillotines. The team was furious and wanted to know is Leng here to finish them off, however, he told his team to scatter and survive. Unfortunately, the Guillotines wouldn't live long.  The government had officially decreed the Guillotines as wanted criminals in league with the Herders. Publicly forsaken by their own emperor and given a huge bounty upon their heads, the Guillotines were cruelly killed off one by one. Saddened and enraged, Leng confronted Haidu and called Haidu a "lap dog," infuriating him to shove Leng down a cliff; Leng survived and was nursed back to health by Wolf in a peaceful secluded village. Confused as to why he was saved, Wolf did it out of mercy; to Leng's surprise, he found Musen as part of the village. Musen no longer wanted to be a Guillotine (after learning the cruelty the Guillotines had caused to Wolf's family) and only lived there as a villager. After talking with Wolf, Leng finally admits he's secretly Han Chinese. Leng tells Wolf that it was the former emperor that chose him to be the right-hand man for Qianlong and his Han identity was replaced with a Manchurian one. Although Leng is now on Wolf's side, Wolf prophesied that Leng will kill him very soon.  The final battle is near ready. It was anticipated that Haidu would find them with a large attack force to destroy them and the village was evacuated ahead of time; only volunteers chose to remain to defend the village. Unfortunately, the attack force used mainly guns and cannons; the village defenses were useless against the might of ballistics. Musen volunteered to defend the escaping villagers, unfortunately, she was gunned down before she could even use her weapon to stop anyone. Leng sadly found Musen dying and mourned for her passing. Haidu had completely decimated the Han village and finds Leng on a mountain edge with Wolf. Believing his time had come, Wolf asked Leng to relay a message of peace to the emperor and welcomed Leng to end his life. With the death of Wolf by Leng's hands, Haidu could now return Leng to the palace with honor.  Back at the palace, Wolf's head was displayed as proof of the rebellion's defeat; both Leng and Haidu received praises from their emperor, believing his golden age shall come. However, Leng uncharacteristically spoke up and told his lord that the reason there is rebellion is because there's neither prosperity nor happiness with the public; the emperor's vision of a golden age would be hindered. Heeding the emperor, Leng told his lord must make peace and relieve the suffering of the people to sustain his vision. When asked would Leng be there when it arrives, Leng pointed out the emperor wishes to erase the shameful past legacies and that would mean his life as well, since he's the last Guillotine. Despite his earlier actions, Haidu immediately tried to stop Leng from choosing death, but Leng remains insistent. With a sad reluctance, the emperor had Leng executed; the epilogue reveals that Qianlong was one of the longest running rulers and held peace between the Manchurian and Han, but there was no historic mention of the Guillotines during his reign.

Meanwhile, two rebels go to a cinema to exchange messages, but a witty Japanese colonel, Kōnosuke Toriyama (Keiichi Yamasaki), kills one and captures the other. Xiao Dongbei is given leniency and spends only two days in jail. Sharing a cell with him is the captured rebel, who gives him his clothes as a gift.  Xiao Dongbei goes back to his destitute home where he lives with his old and ailing father ([[Guo Tao (actor)|Guo Tao]]), a veteran of the Boxer Rebellion. He has difficulty paying the rent. He cuts open the shoe and finds a hidden message saying that a shipment of gold is bound for the central bank. The rebels kidnap him and bring him to their base, which is a film studio, since the rebel group is composed of people in the film industry. Dongbei is promised a share of the gold and relays the message. As they are going home, they are chased by Japanese soldiers coming out of a bar, but with the help of the thief, who hides them in the earlier cathedral, they evade the soldiers.  To find out the convoy route, one rebel ([[Tao Hong (actress, born 1972)|Tao Hong]]), a well known actress, uses her fame to attend a party at the central-bank president's house. She goes to the president's study and tries to copy the map, but her plan is ruined after Xiao Dongbei's father causes a disturbance. Now shunned by the rebels, Xiao Dongbei tries to beg for money. By luck, he runs into Gu Xixi (Cheng Yuanyuan), the daughter of the bank's president. He saves her from an air raid while being injured himself. In gratitude, Gu Xixi takes him into the bank president's home and nurses him, where he is able to draw a copy of that map, leading to his re-acceptance into the rebel group.

However, he is killed by a stray bullet.  The rebels and Xiao Dongbei attend another party to murder both Colonel Toriyama and the Italian Minister of Finance. The shootout fails and all the rebels are killed, with Xiao Dongbei being captured. The police captain decides to execute Xiao Dongbei informally by shooting him and throwing him into a river, but he ends up being rescued by the priest. He feels immense guilt over the rebels' deaths and refuses an offer by Gu Xixi to flee the city and marry her. Xiao Dongbei does a final operation, this time consisting of charging into the bank in a truck while shooting a sub-machine gun at the Italian Minister of Finance, and then pouring a container of acid into the vault to force the gold to dissolve. The earlier bandits assist him in killing the soldiers sent to stop him, inspired by his suicidal courage. Unfortunately, Colonel Toriyama kills Gu Xixi in retribution before being Xiao Dongbei kills him and throws his body into the acid. The police arrive but could not find Xiao Dongbei, and call off operations.  Heavily changed by all of these events, Xiao Dongbei goes on to give up crime. As he watches a movie in a theater, he grieves over Gu Xixi's death. A butterfly flies out of the theater, and lands on the bouquet of stolen spoons that Xiao Dongbei had made for Gu Xixi, causing it to transform into real roses.

Hannah Arendt (film)
 As the film opens Eichmann has been captured in South America. It is revealed that he escaped there via the "rat line" and with forged papers. Arendt, now a professor in New York, volunteers to write about the trial for ''The New Yorker'' and is given the assignment. Observing the trial, she is impressed by how ordinary and mediocre Eichmann appears. She had expected someone scary, a monster, and he does not seem to be that. In a cafe conversation in which the [[Faust]] story is raised it is mentioned that Eichmann is not in any way a [[Mephistopheles|Mephisto]] (the devil). Returning to New York, Arendt has massive piles of transcripts to go through. Her husband has a brain aneurysm, almost dying, and causing her further delay. She continues to struggle with how Eichmann rationalized his behavior through platitudes about bureaucratic loyalty, and that he was just doing his job. When her material is finally published, it immediately creates enormous controversy, resulting in angry phone calls and a falling out with her old friend, [[Hans Jonas]].  In a night out on the town with her friend, novelist [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], she insists that she is being misunderstood, and her critics who accuse her of "defending" Eichmann have not read her work. McCarthy broaches the subject of Arendt's love relationship many years ago with philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] who had collaborated with the Nazis. Arendt finds herself shunned by many colleagues and former friends. The film closes with a final speech she gives before a group of students, in which she says this trial was about a new type of crime which did not previously exist. A court had to define Eichmann as a man on trial for his deeds. It was not a system or an ideology that was on trial, only a man. But Eichmann was a man who renounced all qualities of personhood, thus showing that great evil is committed by "nobodies" without motives or intentions. This is what she calls "the banality of evil".  The film, which captures Arendt at one of the pivotal moments of her life and career, also features portrayals of other prominent intellectuals, including philosopher Martin Heidegger, novelist Mary McCarthy and ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' editor [[William Shawn]].

Seth refuses because she does not want to be held accountable by her ex-husband Val ([[Mark Gil]]) and his wife Bles ([[Carmi Martin]]) in case anything goes wrong. Jed pleads very intensely and Seth eventually agrees to give them the address under the condition that they do not tell anyone that she gave it to them.  One evening, Seth arrives home and sees that there's a party. She's extremely disappointed to see that Odong, who has much improved health, has gone back to his old drinking and even "womanizing" habits.

Due to Seth's pleading, Manang Elsa eventually cures all of them. On the way home, Seth crosses paths with Jed and Cookie, who are now secretly going to the faith healer.  The following day, everyone except Cookie is healed. She is taken to a hospital due to a high fever. Seth is then confronted by Val and grows angry. Days pass and Cookie is finally healed. One night, Seth invites Chona to go to Ding's wedding reception, but Chona just smiled and went home, which confuses Seth and the others. When everyone went home, they were terrified after Chona is found dead after slashing her own neck with a knife after stabbing a man passing by. At her wake, Rex tells Seth that Chona had seen a crow in her dream before she died. The batch of people who were healed speak out about having had the same dream. Seth saw Dodi ([[Chinggoy Alonzo]]), a man they met at Manang Elsa's house, walk past her.  The following day, during a breaking news bulletin, they found out that Dodi murdered men at the gym and held his partner hostage. Dodi, looking insane, kills his partner and himself with a piece of broken glass. Seth and her neighbors discussed if there's a pattern of deaths. Ruben annoys his wife Greta that she's going to die next, much to Greta's anger.  During a blackout that night, Seth was shocked to see Greta in her home. When Greta was walking away, Seth called her, but Greta suddenly looked back at her by stretching her neck backwards. Greta, who suddenly looked insane and is at home, stabs Ruben. Ruben then asked people passing by to help him, but the people were horrified when they saw Greta holding a huge machete while walking towards Ruben. Seth and Alma heard the screams of the people so they went out. Greta then decapitates Ruben before going back to the house to almost kill their sons. Seth and Alma followed Greta, but were horrified when Greta hanged herself. The next day Ding, who is on a raid at a sex den, kills the tenants and his teammates before his remaining teammates shoot him dead. Seth, worried about Cookie, explain to Jed on her behavioral changes and urges him to protect her. It turns out that the mysterious people who were healed that Seth saw were actually [[Doppelgänger|doppelgangers]], who [[Demonic possession|demonized]] the images of the people who were healed before their deaths. Seth is confused as to why her father has not suffered the same fate. She asks him if had seen a crow in his dreams, but instead tells her he had a wet dream, which annoys her. Seth, along with Cita, decides to confront Manang Elsa about the chain of deaths, only to be informed by Melchor, that she, along with his wife, had been killed by Dario, the man who much earlier, was thought to have only fainted but who had actually died from a heart attack. Melchor reveals the curse's real dark history that Manang Elsa unknowingly "cured" the dead, and now the life that was used to revitalize him was the lives of the following  murdered patients that Manang Elsa "cured" after him. Melchor tells her that the best way to destroy the curse is to kill Dario again.  Seth sets out to warn the others. While stuck in traffic, she sees Alma's doppelganger walk down the street towards Alma's dormitory. Seth calls Alma to warn her that her doppelganger is on its way to possess her. When Alma refuses to believe her, Seth sneaks into her apartment to find her but is too late. Alma, who has already been possessed by her doppelganger, murdered her dorm mates by throwing them off the balcony and sets herself on fire. Afraid for her daughter's life, Cita brings Cacai to a Chinese temple to be guarded by their relative monks. Inevitably, Seth sees Cacai's image and warns Cita. However, Cita is distracted by a dragon dance and loses Cacai who is then controlled by her doppelganger. Cacai massacres the praying monks and kills herself by jumping from the roof and getting impaled on a flagpole. Seth is haunted by the spirits of her dead friends, who blame her for their deaths because Seth is the key to the healer. Seth then goes to Cita who is watching her daughter get embalmed. Seth apologizes for not saving Cacai, but Cita tells her that there's still a chance to end the terror: Cookie.  Determined to save Cookie, Seth and Jed (who finally knows everything and resolved the mystery about the curse) takes her to a secluded house and installs CCTV cameras to monitor her. To avert the curse and the brutal killings and suicides, Seth goes to jail to see Dario ([[Jhong Hilario]]) and bring him food that she has poisoned. Dario reveals to her that he is no longer Dario but a different entity. He warns her that those who have been cured by Manang Elsa will be [[demonic possession|possessed]] by their own alter-egos and their souls shall be offered to him. He then tells her that the best way to end the bloodshed and the continuous spread of the curse is to kill him. Seth discards the plan of poisoning him as she cannot kill anyone. When she returns to the house where Cookie and Jed are hiding, she is attacked by Cookie's doppelganger who has yet to possess the real one, and manages to get rid of her by electrocuting her with a toaster. At the hospital, Val and Bles apologize to a confined Seth. Seth then watches a news report about a suicide bomber that implanted a bomb on a bus, killing him and some other passenger. The bomber was also healed by Manang Elsa.  After a few days, Cookie is chased by her doppelganger and is possessed. Jed found this out because of the CCTV camera showing Cookie's doppelganger chasing her. At her father's birthday party, Seth is visited by Cookie, who appears to be normal. When Seth is about to answer Jed's telephone call, Cookie then stabs her. While running away from the possessed Cookie, Seth finds Boni, her houseboy, dead with his neck twisted by Cookie. Jed arrives and stops the possessed Cookie from killing Seth.  As the fight rages, Cookie's doppelganger touches Jed's head, creating another doppelganger in Jed's image who then tries to stab Seth. At the prison, Dario is anticipating the new life that will be transported to him, but Melchor shows up at the prison and shoots him dead. A crow falls from the sky, showing the curse has ended. The doppelgangers disappear, the bloodshed ceases, and Melchor is pinned down by police officers. Seth and Jed, who are now free from the curse , shake the unconscious Cookie, who suddenly wakes up.

However, when Mun-ho returns to the car, Seon-yeong has disappeared and is not reachable on her mobile phone. All he can find is a hairpin in the rest stop's toilet. From the mess at her flat in [[Seoul]], it looks as if there has been a break-in.

Investigating her debt history, Mun-ho finds she had been using someone else's name and identity.

Hemlock Society (film)
 The movie is a very strong insight into psychological dilemma about the primal existence of life. It reiterates the fact that you can 'shock someone by letting her know that death is impending and inescapable.’  It is a dark comedy which successfully evokes an awareness of life. The comic element is used dexterously to bring out the fear of death. The protagonist Meghna (Koel Mallick),  misses her mother, hums the songs of her favorite Sidhartha Roy numbers, blames the new lady in her father’s life, shaken by the dejection by her fiancé. Yet, as an escape route from the world of pain and suffering she goes to her father doctor to get prescribed sleeping pills. Ananda Kar  ([[Parambrata Chatterjee|Parambrata]]) as the name suggests ‘make merry’ refrains her from ending her life. He comes with an unusual proposal of imparting her technical know how about committing suicide. He adds 'the training will save you from embarrassment if suicide becomes a vain attempt'. Ananda Kar is the founder of the Hemlock Society,  that  teaches aspirants how to successfully commit suicide. The names of the professors are also significant of the tricks they will teach to execute the end. The society is a film studio. Meghna assembles with all other suicide aspirants being addressed by the over-enthusiastic professors, ''trainlet, jhulan, dhamani, raktim, shikha'',  all specialists in different suicide methods. Meghna goes with him, leaving a goodbye message for her parents at her apartment door. Dr. Basu comes in search of his daughter, finds the note and shatters in grievance. Dr. Basu and Niharika start their search for Meghna and almost leave no stone unturned. Meanwhile, at Hemlock Society, Meghna encounters with miscellaneous experiences related to humans lives and death. The three-day workshop at the society makes her understand the importance of life and what difference her loss would mean to her near and dear ones. The metamorphosis of Meghna occurs when she realizes the miseries of other inmates and considers herself lucky. On the final day, Meghna confesses to Ananda that she wants to live and a vital reason which worked behind her changing of mind is that she had fallen in love with Ananda. Ananda informs her that he is suffering from 'Lymphocytopenia' a medical condition for which he would survive only for two more years.  Meghna leaves Hemlock Society, sobbing and returns to her father. The very thought that someone near the cradle of death can ‘drink life to the lees’ in spite of complain and regret, surprises her. She learns from Ananda, that Hemlock society is an institute that refrains people from ending their life by making them aware of the importance of life.  Six months later, Meghna reconciles with Ananda while he is on a nursing home bed, after having a blood-transfusion. The film ends with a witty note where Meghna’s fiancé ([[Saheb Chatterjee]]), now a dejected soul and undoubtedly suicide aspirant,  being taken to 'Hemlock Society'.<ref name="toi 2432012"/>  
Here Comes the Boom
 Former [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Collegiate wrestling|collegiate wrestler]] Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned [[biology]] teacher at the failing Quincy High School.  Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being [[Layoff|laid off]].  Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the $48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive.  He [[:wikt:moonlighting#Noun|moonlights]] as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring.  When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter.  While watching the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only $750 to the loser.  Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his $48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gaining higher amounts of money for the school.  Scott has been pursuing the school nurse, Bella Flores, and they share moments [[flirting|revealing affection]] for each other, while also rekindling Scott's passion for teaching. He begins to engage the class and earns the respect of his students. Scott is within $6,000 of his goal, when Mark tells him that Niko turned down a sanctioned UFC fight offered by [[Joe Rogan]], with the certainty of earning $10,000 for a loss. Scott confronts Niko, who apologizes and admits he turned it down because he was jealous &ndash; Niko was once asked to fight at the UFC but suffered a neck injury while training for it, ending his career. Scott and Niko accept the offer, with Scott and his crew soon travelling to the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] for the fight. Once he arrives, he learns that school administrator Elkins has been [[embezzling]] from the winnings and the school, meaning all Scott's efforts have been in vain. Scott decides he must win the fight and the $50,000 purse.  The publicity of Scott's slow rise to fame has grown, and the school's band appears in the stands to play his theme song, thanks to Bella contacting Rogan.  During the fight, Marty reminds the losing Scott that even if he does not win, he has inspired the students, which is their real purpose as teachers. Scott has no answer to his dangerous opponent, Ken Dietrich, who is angered that his original opponent cancelled and that he is stuck with a man that "does not deserve" to be fighting at the UFC. After finding inspiration from the students, Scott manages to win the fight, earning $50,000 and Dietrich's respect. Scott and Bella kiss through the chain link fence of the ring.  A subplot involves student Malia, her father, and Scott's brother Eric, who is unhappily self-employed as a house painter. Eric has a large family and both he and his wife have low paying jobs; Eric enjoys cooking.  Malia's father has a restaurant that is failing since his chef quit. Malia's father wants her to stop music and focus less on school so that she can help with the restaurant, but she has a passion for music. Scott encourages Malia to pursue her musical talent, which drives hostility from her father to Scott for "telling his daughter to disobey him". Eric becomes the chef for her father's restaurant, which improves the business, so Malia's father is thankful to Scott. Once Malia sings Scott's theme song at the UFC fight, shown on TV, her father tearfully accepts that music is her true passion.  In the closing scene, Niko and all of the students in Scott's citizenship class attend their American citizenship ceremony.  
The Helpers
 The film opens with a scene of newspapers and news broadcasts describing an orphanage which was burned down, resulting in several deaths. It then turns to seven friends as they start out on a road trip to Las Vegas, with Phil ([[JoJo Wright]]) recording the trip for his girlfriend Julia. The group hits a road block en route to their destination, prompting them to take a detour that results in several flat tires. The group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. The men eventually come across a rest-stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant Brad and the shop owner Steve (Braxton Davis) and Norah (Dallas Lovato). Steve offers to not only fix the truck and pick up the girls, but to provide free alcoholic drinks, in addition to letting the group stay at the neighboring motel for the night. One of the group members, Todd (Dustin Harnish), is originally hesitant about the proposition, but eventually agrees to it. After a wild night of drinking and partying, the group falls asleep in the motel.  The group eventually wakes up the next morning/afternoon. At first everything appears normal, but it soon becomes clear that Steve and his cohorts are nowhere to be found on the premises. None of the friends remembers much about what happened the previous night. And four of the friends (Jordan, Brandy, Ryan, Andy) wake up realizing they're tied up or otherwise physically incapacitated. Jordan is tied up to a chair in the bathroom next to the bathtub, with a bucket on his arm and an electric wire tied to his hand. Brandy is tied up in the bathtub. Ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and Anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. At first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when Todd and Claire witness Phil being intentionally decapitated by Brad, it becomes clear that Steve, Brad, Norah and Chloe are actually cruel, sadistic [[sociopaths]], (who call themselves "the helpers") intent on torturing and murdering the group. Claire (Kristen Quintrall) and Todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one. The helpers go into Anna and Ryan's room and reveal that each end of Anna's body is chained to a car, and they will drive the cars and rip her body in half. They do so, while Ryan is tied up and unable to stop them. They then go into Jordan and Brandy's room and explain that the wire attached to Jordan's arm will be lowered into the water in the bathtub by placing rocks in the bucket hanging from his arm, electrocuting Brandy. Brandy is killed from being electrocuted four times, while Jordan's arm with the wire was forcibly placed in the water. The men remove Brandy from the tub and leave Jordan with Norah. Norah taunts Jordan, who then pushes Norah into the tub and electrocutes her with the wire, killing her. Todd and Claire also manage to successfully escape from their room. However, Todd and Claire are caught while attempting to flee and are brought back to the complex. The helpers bring out Ryan (still tied to the chair) and shoot him dead in front of the others, and then chain Claire to the cars as they did to Anna, threatening to rip her body in half, unless she admits that her father was the abusive owner of an orphanage. She admits that her father was indeed the owner of an orphanage. It's eventually revealed that the three murderers used to live in an orphanage run by Claire's father where they were terribly abused and beaten, with the murderers intentionally setting the group up to come by the motel. They found the motel/gas station, killed the employees, and took it over. Then they placed road detour signs on the road, and placed sharp objects to puncture the cars tires. It is also revealed that before they left the orphanage, they burned it down, as the news described in the opening scene of the movie. Hence, the murderers main motive for their barbarism is revenge against Claire's father. They knew that the group was going on a road trip because Phil's girlfriend, Julia, was one of them. Jordan, Todd, and Claire manage to escape. The film ends with a scene "six months later" where "the helpers" are working at another gas station, asking their customers if they need any help.<ref></ref>

Here Comes the Devil

Years later, on an afternoon family outing at the same hill, adolescent siblings Adolfo (Alan Martinez) and Sara (Michele Garcia) enter a cave and do not return. Their parents, Felix ([[Francisco Barreiro]]) and Sol ([[Laura Caro]]), are distraught. A local gas station attendant says the hill is cursed and that night there is an unusual earthquake but the next morning the children are found by the police and the family is reunited.  Returning home, the children start behaving strangely. Consultations with a doctor and a psychologist reveal the possibility of sexual abuse. Felix and Sol suspect Lucio, the local weirdo, assaulted Sara that afternoon on the hill. They confront and kill him, though later discoveries will convince Sol of his innocence. Police suspect the parents of the murder but never indict or arrest them.  One night, abnormal events occur in the house: noises, flickering lights, slamming doors, and the children having unnatural seizures. Sol suspects something out of the ordinary while Felix clings to mundane explanations. Their differences lead Sol to do subsequent investigations independent of her husband and without always disclosing her motives or findings. Felix gets a gun for protection.  Sol is told that Adolfo and Sara are skipping school and discovers that, dressed in their school uniforms, they are taking the bus back to the hill. She follows them up to the mouth of the cave where they disappeared but does not go in.  The night of Lucio's killing, Sol's friend, Marcia (ignorant of the murderous plan), babysat the kids. The next morning Marcia was inexplicably gone and has been unreachable since. Sol now goes to see her and asks what happened that night. Marcia describes the children as being "lifeless," says she was supernaturally assaulted by the devil, and witnessed Adolfo and Sara commit incest.  Early in the morning, Sol returns to the hill and enters the cave where Adolfo and Sara disappeared. She finds their dead bodies, dressed as they were the afternoon they vanished. Staggering outside, she phones Felix who states definitively that he dropped the children off at school a mere fifteen minutes ago.  Deeply shaken, Sol speaks to the gas station attendant who reveals that his daughter was the victim of the serial killer in the opening scene and that when the killer vanished on the hill there was an earthquake just like the night when Adolfo and Sara vanished. He says that "those who dwell there are in search of....people who can be possessed. To them, we're only a shell. They use us to do evil and then throw us away."  Sol poisons the versions of Adolfo and Sara that are in the house, dresses them in formal clothes, and leaves their bodies propped up at the breakfast table. She then calls Felix and tells him to meet her at the gas station.  Felix and Sol drive up the hill and go into the cave. When Felix sees the bodies of his children dressed as they were the day they disappeared, he shoots his wife then shoots himself. There is an earthquake.

A perplexed Annie returns home and tells Charlie of the job interview, upsetting him since Los Angeles is the area he lived in prior to enrolling in Witness Protection and can't return to.  Charlie insists Annie interview for the job for her own sake, even though he would be unable to follow her, but Annie instead returns to the college the next day to beg to keep her job.  While she is gone, Charlie decides he would return to L.A. after all, and picks up Annie in his souped-up, restored [[Lincoln Continental]], promising to take her to her interview.  Before they leave town Annie realizes that the teaching certificate she needs is at the home of her ex-boyfriend Gil Rathbinn ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]).  She had previously told Gil that Charlie is in Witness Protection, and he urges Annie not to go with Charlie, who he is certain is a criminal who will chop her up.  Annie blows him off and leaves with Charlie; Gil memorizes Charlie's license plate and asks his gay police officer brother Terry (Jess Rowland) to look up the plate, who finds that the vehicle is registered to "Yul Clint Perkins" — Charlie's real name.  Gil uses the name to look up Charlie's past, discovering he is a former [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] who testified in an ultimately unsuccessful bank robbery case against his accomplices, one of whom shot the bank guard.  Gil finds the [[Facebook]] page of one of the defendants, Alexander Dmitri ([[Bradley Cooper]]), and leaves a message saying he knows where Yul Perkins is for the next 24 hours.  Meanwhile, Randy calls Charlie after discovering he is not home.  Charlie tells him he is returning to L.A., and Randy insists on accompanying him per Marshals Service policy, leaving Milton in order to pursue Charlie.  A short time later Charlie and Annie discover Gil following them in his vehicle. Charlie pulls over, intending to beat up Gil, but instead tries to non-violently resolve the situation at Annie's insistence.  Gil is unmoved, and reveals that he both knows Charlie's real name and has Alex Dmitri as a "Facebook friend".  Charlie and Annie then flee from Gil in the Continental, in the process running Randy off the road as he arrives, but ultimately losing Gil.  Elsewhere, Alex sees Gil's Facebook message, gathers his fellow bank robbers Neve ([[Joy Bryant]]) and Alan ([[Ryan Hansen]]) and heads to meet Gil.  Annie and Charlie gas up the Continental, where the vehicle's engine is admired by a redneck named Sanders ([[David Koechner]]).  The two then make their way to a motel, where they are unknowingly followed by Sanders.  In the morning, Charlie tries to start the vehicle, only to discover that the engine has been stolen in the night.  Gil arrives shortly after, ambushing Charlie with a golf club, but Charlie distracts him and knocks him out, placing him in his vehicle.  He quickly discovers that Gil was also accompanied by Alex's crew, who are at the front desk.  Charlie grabs the VIN Number of a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] in the parking lot, makes a duplicate keyless entry for the vehicle using the former tools of his trade, and then leaves with Annie, Gil and Alex's crew in hot pursuit, with Randy joining the chase.  During the chase Annie and Charlie argue over his past, where he reveals that he was a getaway driver who participated in 13 bank robberies, and that Neve was once his fiancee.  The two ultimately escape their pursuers again.  Afterward, Annie demands Charlie pull over, where she confronts him for lying to her about his past.  She decides to proceed to L.A. without Charlie; Gil arrives shortly after, and agrees to take Annie the rest of the way.  A short time later they are run off the road by Alex, who takes Annie hostage and calls Charlie, telling him to meet at a nearby diner.  Charlie arrives and Alex demands money in exchange for Annie, then argues about Charlie's betrayal, cut short when Alex reveals that he was raped in jail and blames Charlie for it.  Charlie agrees to take him to a hidden stash of bank robbery money located at the home of his estranged father Clint ([[Beau Bridges]]).  While in transit he surreptitiously places a call to Randy, now in the company of Terry (who's attracted to Randy) and his partner Angela Roth (Carly Hatter), and gives Randy his father's address.  The three pick up Gil along the way.  At Clint's house, Charlie digs up a bag of money he hid in a pasture with his father, at the same time reconciling with him.  His father carefully mentions he owns a Class 1 Off-Road racing vehicle; shortly after he knocks Alex down with a shovel, then fights with Alan as Charlie and Annie make their escape.  The two get in the racer and flee just as Gil, Randy, Terry and Angela arrive.  Alex and Neve attempt to follow, but Randy manages to shoot Alex as the latter fires at Charlie, forcing them to stop and placing the two under arrest.  Two Marshals ([[Jason Bateman]] and Nate Tuck) later arrive and take Alex and his crew into custody, complimenting Randy and Terry on their work.  After their escape, Charlie tells Annie he is committed to getting her to the interview still, wanting to keep his word despite the fact that she no longer loves him.  Annie responds that she still loves him, and the two reconcile before continuing the trip.  Charlie makes it to the University of California campus in time for Annie to make her interview.  Before she leaves, Charlie offers to spend the rest of his life with her, which Annie accepts.  The final scene cuts some months in the future, showing Randy and Terry, now in a relationship, giving each other a brief pep talk before heading to take the Marshals' exam.  In a stinger segment, Annie makes her interview with Professor Sandy Osterman ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]), interrupting him as he is smoking from a [[bong]].  After a rough start due to Osterman's embarrassment at [[hotboxing]] his office and confusion at him not being a woman as Debbie had described, Osterman reveals that Debbie is his sister and she has jokingly called him a girl since he was 9.  Annie expresses sympathy for how this must make Sandy feel, earning his approval and an immediate job offer, which she accepts.  
Hitchcock (film)
 In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock opens his latest film, ''[[North by Northwest]]'', to considerable success, but is troubled by a reporter's insinuation that he should retire. Seeking to reclaim the artistic daring of his youth, Hitchcock turns down film proposals, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', in favor of a horror novel called ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]],  based on the real-life crimes of murderer [[Ed Gein]]. Gein appears in sequences throughout the film, in which he seems to prompt Hitchcock's imagination regarding the ''Psycho'' story, or act as some function of Hitchcock's subconscious mind (for instance, drawing Hitchcock's attention to sand on his bathroom floor, the quantity of which reveals how much time his wife Alma has been spending at the beachhouse with Whitfield Cook).  Hitchcock's wife and artistic collaborator, Alma, is no more enthusiastic about the idea than his colleagues, especially since she is being lobbied by their writer friend, [[Whitfield Cook]], to look at his own screenplay. However, she warms to Hitchcock's proposal, suggesting the innovative plot turn of killing the female lead early in the film. The studio heads at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] prove more difficult to persuade, forcing Hitchcock to finance the film personally and use his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television crew (over at competitor Revue/Universal) to shoot the film, his last with Paramount.  However, the pressures of the production, such as dealing with Geoffrey Shurlock of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and Hitchcock's lecherous habits, such as when they confer with the female lead, [[Janet Leigh]], annoy Alma. She begins a personal writing collaboration with Whitfield Cook on his screenplay at his beach house without Hitchcock's knowledge. Hitchcock eventually discovers what she has been doing and suspects her of having an affair.  This concern affects Hitchcock's work on ''Psycho''. Hitchcock eventually confronts Alma and asks her if she is having an affair. Alma angrily denies it.  Alma temporarily takes over production of the film when Hitchcock is bedridden after collapsing from overwork, but this sequence, which included a complicated [[Rear projection effect|process shot]] showing Detective Arbogast's demise, with Alma's specification of a 35mm lens, instead of the 50mm lens preferred by Hitchcock for this film, proved to be the least effective in the film.  Meanwhile, Hitchcock expresses his disappointment to [[Vera Miles]] at how she didn't follow through on his plan to make her the next biggest star after [[Grace Kelly]], but Miles says she is happy with her family life.  Hitchcock's cut of ''Psycho'' is poorly received by the studio executives, while Alma discovers Whitfield having sex with a younger woman at his beach house. Hitchcock and Alma reconcile and set to work on improving the film. Their renewed collaboration yields results, culminating in Alma convincing Hitchcock to accept their composer's suggestion for adding [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s harsh strings score to the shower scene.  After maneuvering Shurlock into leaving the film's content largely intact, Hitchcock learns the studio is only going to open the film in two theaters. Hitchcock arranges for special theater instructions to pique the public's interest such as forbidding admittance after the film begins. At the film's premiere, Hitchcock first views the audience from the projection booth, looking out through its small window at them. Hitchcock then waits in the lobby for the audience's reaction, conducting slashing motions to their reactions as they scream on cue. The film is rewarded with an enthusiastic reception.  With the film's screening so well received, Hitchcock publicly thanks his wife for helping make it possible and they affirm their love and partnership. At the conclusion at his home, Hitchcock addresses the audience noting ''Psycho'' proved a major high point of his career and he is currently pondering his next project. A [[The Birds (film)|raven]] lands on his shoulder, before he turns to meet with his wife.  The final title cards say that Hitchcock directed six more films after ''Psycho'', none of which would eclipse its commercial success, and although he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], the [[American Film Institute]] awarded him its Life Achievement Award in 1979: an award that he claimed he shared, as he had his life, with his wife, Alma.  
A Hijacking
 Mikkel Hartmann, the cook on board the Danish merchant ship ''Rozen'', is anxious to return to his wife and child in Denmark. Jan Sørensen, the ship's engineer, asks him to take a letter home to his family. Back in Denmark, shipping company representative Lars Vestergaard, unable to close a difficult deal, requests help from CEO Peter Ludvigsen, who concludes the deal with the Japanese businessmen. Ludvigsen suddenly learns that pirates in the Indian Ocean have hijacked the ''Rozen''. On the ship, the crew is separated into two groups, and Hartmann is forced at gunpoint to cook a meal. Automatic gunfire punctuates the night, frightening the hostages and keeping the atmosphere tense.  Ludvigsen hires Connor Julian, an Australian hostage negotiator who has experience with pirates. Julian's first suggestion is to use a neutral third party to handle negotiations, but Ludvigsen insists on running negotiations himself. Their first communication with the pirates comes when Omar, a Somali who says that he is a translator taken hostage by the pirates, asks Hartmann to contact Ludvigsen.  Ludvigsen, however, refuses to negotiate through Hartmann and hangs up. Omar himself then calls and relays the pirates' demands.  Ludvigsen's counter-offer, an unrealistic [[low-ball]] number, opens the negotiation process. Julian explains that if they give in too quickly or easily, the pirates will only renege on the deal.  As the weeks roll on, the pirates allow the hostages a few limited privileges, such as use of the bathrooms.  Hartmann and Sørensen attempt to befriend one of the pirates, who humiliates Sørensen as a prank.  When Hartmann becomes agitated over the dwindling supplies, Omar refuses to restock the vessel and forces Hartmann to call Ludvigsen.  Ludvigsen again refuses to communicate through Hartmann and hangs up.  Negotiations slowly continue, and Omar reacts incredulously to Ludvigsen's continued low-ball offers, which he says will result in the deaths of himself and the crew unless Ludvigsen makes a realistic offer. The situation takes a toll on Ludvigsen, culminating in his yelling at his worried girlfriend.  The pirates allow the hostages on the deck, and Hartmann catches a large fish; both the hostages and pirates celebrate together and later sing [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]].  Hartmann reveals that it is his daughter's birthday, and all sing "Happy Birthday to You".  Omar later allows Hartmann to call his wife, but a pirate cuts the conversation short.  Omar demands that Maria put pressure on Ludvigsen to pay.  Against Julian's advice, Ludvigsen makes a higher offer and loses his cool.  Insulted by the offer, Omar insists that the pirates will soon begin to kill people, and a gunshot is heard as the connection goes dead.  Stunned, Ludvigsen begins to wonder if he is responsible for Hartmann's death.  The board begins to grow impatient with Ludvigsen's protracted negotiations, and they threaten to replace him with a hired negotiator if he can not close a deal by the end of the month.  After a period of silence, Ludvigsen receives a fax from the pirates.  Ludvigsen requests proof that Hartmann is still alive, which Sørensen provides.  However, Hartmann is subject to poor treatment and psychological abuse that leaves him an emotional wreck.  As negotiations restart, Ludvigsen offers $2.8 million.  Omar rejects the offer, and Vestergaard suggests that Ludvigsen pretend to add $500,000 of his own money.  Tired of negotiating and convinced that the company can not offer any more than this amount, Omar accepts.  On the ship, Omar herds the hostages on to the deck, where the two separated groups see each other again for the first time.  An airplane circles several times and drops a package.  The pirates react joyously as they retrieve it.  Thankful that the ordeal has finally come to an end, Hartmann retrieves his wedding ring, which he earlier hid when the pirates boarded the vessel, and wears it publicly again.  As the pirates disembark, one grabs Hartmann's ring.  When Hartmann protests, the captain intervenes and takes back the ring from the pirate.  Angry, the pirate shoots and kills the captain.  Omar strikes the pirate and chastises him, while Sørensen is crying over the captain. Ludvigsen delivers the bad news to the captain's wife. Shocked by his traumatic experiences, Hartmann does not show much emotion when he finally is re-united with his family.

Hip Hop Eh
 The plot is an attempt to educate the Canadian public or any viewer about the hip-hop scene in Canada- do we have one? What is it? The director meets with a lot of famous Canadian hip-hop artists, as well as public in the street and asks them questions about the hip-hop scene in Canada. He asks questions such as: “what is the Canadian identity” and “what is hip-hop”, which he receives a variety of different responses from those he interviews. The artists he interviews explain how hard it is to make it in the music industry in Canada, being the country in the shadow of the USA when it comes to music, artists explain the obstacles they have to overcome in order to be a famous Canadian hip-hop artist today. One artist says that first your music must be sent to the USA, then approved in the USA, and finally it’ll be played in Canada, which makes it harder to be famous in Canada. One artist expressed, “you [as the artist] have to work 10x harder than anybody else”, although now is the right time to do it because hip-hop is very popular.  The director goes on the street to ask random people in public what they think of the Canadian hip-hop scene. One woman on the street says, “I don’t know much about the Canadian hip-hop scene”, whereas one guy on the street believed “we have the biggest underground hip-hop scene on the face of the earth right now”.  Many of the artists had different point of views on how they exert their music. Some of the artists expressed they want free music, others do not care about the radio, and others do care about radio because they are out to make a lot of money. The interaction between Canada and its hip-hop scene is small- only 3 radios play hip-hop music and it’s more popular in bigger cities in Canada making it harder for Canadian artists to get out there. This film proves that Canadian artists still manage to get out there and make a different in the hip-hop scene.<ref>Klymkiw, Joe, director. Hip Hop Eh Trailer .

Holy Motors
 After waking up one morning, a man called "The Sleeper" locates and opens a secret door in his apartment. He enters, wandering into a packed movie house, while a young child and a giant dog wander up and down the aisles.  Meanwhile, a man called Oscar rides to work in a white limousine, driven by his close friend and associate Céline. Oscar's job involves using makeup, elaborate costumes and props to carry out a number of complex and unusual "appointments", sometimes for the service of others, and at other times for seemingly no reason at all. The rest of the film is set in Paris. At his first appointment, Oscar masquerades as an old woman beggar in the street. At the next, Oscar wears a [[motion capture]] suit and performs an action sequence and simulated sex with an actress on a soundstage while being directed by an unseen man. At Oscar's third appointment, he plays the role of  [[Tokyo!#.22Merde.22|Monsieur Merde]], an eccentric and violent red-haired man who kidnaps a beautiful model from her photo-shoot in a cemetery. The next scene finds Oscar as a father picking up his daughter from a party in an old red car. The two argue when the daughter reveals that she had spent the party crying in the bathroom instead of socializing. Céline continues to drive Oscar to his appointments.  In a little interlude, Oscar performs a short musical piece on accordion with a group of other musicians in a church. In the fifth scene he assumes the role of a Chinese gangster assigned to murder a man who looks identical to him. After he has stabbed the man in the neck and carved scars into his face that match his own, the victim suddenly stabs the gangster in the neck as well. Oscar manages to limp his way back to the limousine, seemingly injured before being seen sitting comfortably inside the limo removing his makeup. A man with a port-wine stain on one side of his face is sitting in the limo and discusses Oscar's work with him, informing Oscar that others believe he is getting "tired". Oscar admits that his business is changing, and that he misses the days when he was aware of cameras. He remains in his profession, though, for "the beauty of the act". Later, in what turns out to be the sixth sequence, Oscar abruptly runs from the limo, dons a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]], and shoots a banker (who looks identical to Oscar when he left for his first appointment in the morning) eating at a cafe before he is gunned down by the banker's bodyguards. Céline rushes to him, urging him towards his next appointment, and again Oscar returns to the limo unharmed.  In the seventh sequence, Oscar's character is an old man on his deathbed. A young woman named Léa referring to Oscar as "uncle" keeps him company, and the two talk about their lives. Oscar then pretends to die as Léa cries, before he leaves the bed and excuses himself to go to another appointment. Léa reveals her real name to be Élise, and she tells Oscar that she too has another appointment. When Céline stops the limousine beside an identical limo in what turns out to be the eighth sequence, Oscar recognizes the woman inside and asks if they can talk. The woman, Eva, tells Oscar that she has an appointment as an air hostess who spends her last night at a vacant building, and that they have twenty years to catch up on. As the two ascend the interior of the building, Eva sings "Who Were We", its lyrics suggesting that Oscar and Eva had a child together. When she concludes, Oscar says he should leave before her "partner" arrives, and on his way out he narrowly avoids him. When Oscar returns to his car, he sees that Eva and her mysterious partner have seemingly jumped to their deaths from the top of the building. He lets out an anguished cry as he runs past the two and enters his limo. Oscar finally heads to his ninth and final appointment in what seems to be an ordinary family man scenario. His dossier on the appointment refers to "your house", "your wife" and "your daughter". However, when Oscar enters the house, it is revealed that his "wife" and "child" are apparently both chimpanzees.  Céline drives the limo to the Holy Motors garage, a place filled with identical limousines. She parks the car, places a mask on her face and exits the premises. The moment she leaves the building, the limousines begin talking to one another, vocalizing their fears that they may be considered outdated and unwanted.  
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
  [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Approaching his 111th birthday]], the [[Hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] begins writing down the full story of his adventure 60 years earlier for the benefit of his nephew [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Long before Bilbo's involvement, the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] king [[Thrór]] brought an era of prosperity for his kin under the [[Lonely Mountain]] until the arrival of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]]. Destroying the nearby town of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]], Smaug drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thrór's grandson, [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]], sees [[Thranduil|King Thranduil]] and his [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]].  In the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] into hosting a party for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], [[Nori (Middle-earth)|Nori]], [[Ori (dwarf)|Ori]], [[Óin, son of Glóin|Óin]], [[Glóin]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur (Middle-earth)|Bombur]]. Gandalf's aim is to recruit Bilbo as the company's "burglar" to aid them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]], respectively; Gandalf also finds an [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Elven shortsword]], which he gives to Bilbo.  The wizard [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] finds Gandalf and the company, and recounts an encounter at [[Dol Guldur]] with the [[Sauron|Necromancer]], a sorcerer who has been corrupting [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]] with dark magic. Chased by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], Gandalf leads the company through a hidden passage to [[Rivendell]]. There, [[Elrond|Lord Elrond]] discloses a hidden indication of a secret door on the company's map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on [[Durin's Day]]. Gandalf later approaches the [[White Council]] — consisting of Elrond, [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] — and presents a [[Morgul blade]], a weapon of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of [[Sauron]]. While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.  The company journeys into the [[Misty Mountains]], where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between [[Giant (mythology)|Stone Giants]]. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]], who take them to their leader, the [[Great Goblin]]. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters [[Gollum]], who unknowingly drops a [[One Ring|golden ring]]. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realizes that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.  Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that [[Azog]], an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost his forearm to Thorin in [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|battle]] outside the Dwarven kingdom of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by Azog and his hunting party, and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and severely injures him with his [[Warg]]. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs just as the company is rescued by [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]]. They escape to the safety of the [[Carrock#Carrock|Carrock]] where Gandalf revives Thorin, who renounces his previous disdain for Bilbo after being saved by him. They see the Lonely Mountain in the distance, where a thrush knocks a snail against a stone, waking [[Smaug|a sleeping dragon]].

Hope Springs (2012 film)
 Although a devoted couple, empty nesters Kay and Arnold Soames ([[Meryl Streep]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]]) are in need of (in Kay's opinion) help to reignite the spark in their marriage. They have slept in separate rooms for years since their youngest child went off to college, and forgo any physical affection. One day Kay (who works as a Coldwater Creek employee) tells Arnold (a partner in an [[Omaha]] accounting firm) she has paid for them to undergo a week of intense marriage counseling with Dr. Bernie Feld ([[Steve Carell]]) in a coastal resort town in [[Maine]]. Arnold, a creature of plodding, unimaginative routine, denies their marriage is in trouble.  In sessions with Dr. Feld, a psychiatrist, they (mainly Kay) try to articulate their feelings, revitalize their relationship, and find the spark that caused them to fall in love in the first place. Dr. Feld counsels them, asking increasingly frank questions about their sex life and feelings. Arnold is angry and defensive, unwilling to see the depth of his wife's disappointment. Angry and crying, Kay goes alone to a bar where she has several glasses of wine, confides in the bartendress and learns that few others are having any sex, either. Arnold visits a nautical museum.  Back together, they spend the night in the same bed for the first time in years, and Kay awakes to find Arnold's arm around her. At this sign of progress, Dr. Feld urges new measures. They make halting attempts at intimacy on the bed of their budget motel and again in a movie theater, but this time with disastrous results.  In a one-on-one session, Dr. Feld explains to Arnold that couples seeking marriage counseling are doing so for a reason, and asks Arnold frankly, "Is this the best you can do?"  Arnold finally takes the initiative to arrange a romantic dinner and a night at a luxury inn, where they attempt to make love in front of a fireplace, but the grand design fails. At their final session, Dr. Feld tells them they've made much progress and should take up couples therapy back home.  Back in Omaha, old habits resume. Kay offers to pet-sit for a fellow employee and packs a bag to stay there, as a first step in a permanent break with Arnold. That night, both are shown in bed trying to sleep. Arnold enters his wife's bedroom and they tenderly embrace. The lovemaking that follows is warm, natural, and quietly passionate. The next morning it's clear that the marriage is in a whole new place.

Yachine (his real name is Tarek), his violent older brother Hamid, and Yachine's friends Nabil (son of Tamou, a local prostitute and singer), [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]]-smoking Fouad, and Khalil live in extreme poverty in [[Sidi Moumen]], a [[shanty town]] on the edge of [[Casablanca]] in [[Morocco]]. Hamid earns money by acting as a [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mule]]. The boys steal liquor from Khalil's father's wedding, and Hamid rapes a drunk Nabil in front of the others.  In 1999, the shanty town is significantly larger, and [[Hassan II of Morocco]] has just died. Yachine, Nabil, Fouad, and Khalil spend their time smoking pot, and Yachine is in love with Ghislaine, Fouad's sister. Hamid is now a major drug dealer, paying off the policeman known as "Pitbull" and forcing Yachine to stay out of the drug business. Religious zealots force Tamou to leave town. Hamid is given a two-year prison sentence after throwing a rock at Pitbull's car. Yachine is forced out of the marketplace in the [[Medina quarter|medina]], and Nabil gets him a job repairing engines for repairman Ba'Moussa.  The day after the [[September 11 attacks]], Hamid is released from prison, having given up drugs and embraced radical [[Islam]]. Yachine kills Ba'Moussa after the drunk man attempts to rape Nabil. Nabil gets Hamid, and he and his radical friends hide the body. Hamid gives the two refuge in an Islamic compound hidden within the shanty town, and Yachine and Nabil meet with Abou Zoubeir—who begins to recruit them into radical Islam. Nouceir, a former neighborhood enemy and now one of Hamid's close friends, intimidates Khalil and Fouad into joining the cell also. All four begin learning [[jujutsu]]. Yachine, feeling immense guilt over murdering Ba'Moussa, spends the night with Nabil. But he is also drawn to Zoubeir's message of forgiveness through adherence to radical Islam.  A year later, in November 2002, Tarek (having given up his nickname), Nabil, and Fouad have fully embraced radical Islam. Zoubeir tells Tarek, Nabil, and Fouad they are being admitted to the innermost councils of the cell, which leaves Hamid jealous and angry. An extensive [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] depicts the radicalization of the friends. Tarek learns that Ghislaine is going to marry a cousin.  In February 2003, the police raid a public meeting of radical Muslims, beating Tarek. Abou Zoubeir begins to preach martyrdom to the cell. Tamou attempts to see Nabil, but he refuses to see her or accept her gifts. An unidentified [[emir]] arrives and reinforces the message of martyrdom, telling Hamid, Tarek, Fouad, Nabil, and Nouceir, "Take care, children of Islam, never to become like those who cling to life down here and fear to become martyrs. Fly, horses of God, and the gates of paradise will open for you." He selects the four for a suicide mission, and Hamid's jealousy toward Tarek worsens.  9 May, the day of the attack, approaches. Abou Zoubeir flees as the police close in on the cell, and the attack is moved to 16 May. The five men drive into the foothills near Casablanca, which Tarek, Nabil, and Fouad have never seen before. They are amazed at the city's wealth, and surprised to see vast forests and rivers (unlike the desert they have lived in). They camp in the forest, waiting for the day of attack to arrive. Tarek hopes Ghislaine will think fondly of him, once he becomes a martyr. Hamid unsuccessfully attempts to convince Tarek not to go through with the attack. The men return to the shanty town on 15 May, where they meet with Abou Zoubeir and the 14 others in their cell. They prepare extensively for their mission by shaving, washing, setting watches, and receiving their bombs.  Hamid, Fouad, Tarek, and Nabil enter Casablanca on 16 May, spending the day wandering the city. That night, they approach the Casa de España restaurant. Hamid refuses to let Tarek go through with the attack, but Tarek pushes him away.  Fouad flees, not wanting to die. Tarek and Nabil stab and kill the doorman, and enter the club. Two minutes later, they see Hamid in the club as well. The three set off their bombs.  The film ends with children in Sidi Moumen playing football in the dark, and pausing to listen to the explosions in the city. [[Closing credits|End titles]] describe the 2003 Casablanca bombings, where they occurred, and how many people died.

Michael finally arrives with his duty partner Raphael at a tent in a forest for their eight-hour watch.

After [[Cannabis smoking|smoking cannabis]] with Raphael, Michael, who experiences a rush from the drug, attempts to kiss him. Raphael fends him off aggressively. After this, Michael takes his gun and walks away, first pointing it at Raphael, and then wanting to commit [[Suicide methods#Firearms|suicide]] by shooting himself because of the bullying by his fellow soldiers. A desperate Raphael demands that Michael put the gun down, and finally manages to get the weapon out of his hands. Michael then falls to the ground and starts to cry. The film ends with Raphael hugging him.  
Home Run Showdown
   
House Hunting
 Charlie Hays, his daughter Emmy, and his second wife Susan follow a lead on a foreclosed house Charlie wants to buy. It's a seemingly perfect and beautiful home on 70 acres of private land. He also wants to use this as an opportunity for Emmy and Susan to get along, as neither likes the other. Meanwhile, another family – Don Thomson, his wife Leslie, and their live-in son Jason, who has suffered a broken leg in a car accident – meets a man in a red hat who gives Don an advertisement for the same house the Hayses are interested in. Finding it too good to be true, they too make the trip out to the house. Once both families arrive, they find the house abandoned. Charlie and his family go to the road to retrieve the realtor's phone number and, on the way back, nearly strike a distraught girl named Hanna running across the road. She is severely traumatized, and her tongue has been cut out. The families decide to take her to the hospital, but to their shock find themselves coming back to the house again and again. Don refuses to give up, but by nightfall, his car runs out of gas. They decide to stay in the house, despite Hanna's pleading not to enter.  Once inside, they find firewood and cans of stew that account for each one of them: seven cans for seven people. Despite the arguments that ensue between Leslie and Susan, the families decide to stay and wait for help. They remain for one month, while recordings on the house tell them that only one family will claim the house. Cabin fever and close quarters have everyone on edge until Susan spurns a cheerful Leslie for being too happy. As the tension mounts, the house inexplicably begins providing only six cans. Reminded of her daughter Lizzy, who had previously died, Leslie falls into a deep depression and kills herself. After this, Susan learns that the house had been foreclosed on by Charlie himself, and Emmy begins seeing visions of a man who had killed his son. Soon after, Charlie and Emmy begin seeing visions of her mother, appearing before them with her throat slashed. Charlie confides in Emmy that her mother had left them long ago, but Susan seems to know more. Following clues by the mute girl Hanna and a puzzle, Emmy nearly makes it back to the road by walking backwards, but she is interrupted by Jason, who tries to rape her. Hanna strikes him with a log, and he impales himself on a branch; Don, who has slowly begun to fall into madness, rescues him, but Jason begins to suffer shock from blood loss.  After being terrified by a vision, Jason admits that he killed a woman, later revealed to be an occupant of the house, in a hit and run accident nearby. Don leaves the Hayses bound and attempts to leave the property on his own. When he returns that night, he admits he found the road and starts to free them, but Susan, fearing him, attacks and kills him with an axe. Afterward, the house stops providing food for them, and Charlie becomes erratic. At the house, the ghost of the woman Jason killed attacks him and chokes him to death. Charlie snaps after a vision of himself lies to him about how Susan told Emmy about his responsibility for her mother's murder. After suspecting Susan of stealing their dwindling food supplies, he attacks and kills her. He chases Emmy and Hanna, saying that he believes that murdering Hanna will set them free. Charlie kills Hanna, but he is in turn killed by Emmy. Running to the road, Emmy comes across another family. They bring her into the car and drive back to the house. Emmy panics when she sees the family chase after the ghosts that had haunted her own family, but she is pulled into the car and her tongue is cut out, which starts the cycle again.  
Hotel Transylvania
 In 1895, in the aftermath of the death of his [[Brides of Dracula|wife]] Martha ([[Jackie Sandler]]) at the hands of an [[Mobbing|angry human mob]], [[Count Dracula]] ([[Adam Sandler]]) commissions and builds a massive five-star, monsters-only [[hotel]] in [[Transylvania]] in which he raises his [[Hotel Transylvania characters#Mavis|daughter Mavis]] ([[Selena Gomez]]) and to serve as a safe-place getaway for the world's monsters from fear of human persecution. Famous monsters such as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frank]] ([[Kevin James]]) and his wife [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Eunice]] ([[Fran Drescher]]), Wayne and Wanda [[Werewolf]] ([[Steve Buscemi]] and [[Molly Shannon]]) and their massive immediate family, [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin The Invisible Man]] ([[David Spade]]), and Murray the [[Mummy (monster)|Mummy]] ([[CeeLo Green]]) often come to stay at the hotel.  In the present day, on Mavis's 118th birthday, Dracula allows his daughter to leave the castle in order to explore the human world, but he sets up an [[Potemkin village|elaborate plan]] using his [[zombie]] [[bellhop]]s disguised as humans to make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works, but the zombies inadvertently lead a 21-year-old<ref name="Deadline1" /> human Jonathan Loughran ([[Andy Samberg]]) back to the hotel. Dracula frantically disguises him as a Frankensteinesque Monster and passes him off as Frank's cousin "Johnnystein". Johnny soon encounters Mavis and the two "Zing", in a form of romantic attraction. Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Dracula quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this disgusts and worries Dracula greatly. Dracula orders Johnny to leave, but Johnny is brought back by Mavis. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance.  Meanwhile, the hotel chef [[Quasimodo]] ([[Jon Lovitz]]) with the help of his pet [[rat]] Esmeralda learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him in order to cook him. Dracula intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Dracula leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Dracula built the hotel and became overprotective of Mavis. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Dracula convinces him to stay for the time-being to avoid ruining Mavis's birthday.  The party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Dracula overreacts, and, in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|Mr. Fly]] ([[Chris Parnell]]) reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Dracula. The guests are outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny feigns disinterest in Mavis and rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel.  Mavis flies onto the roof with her mother's present, and Dracula follows her in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how Martha and Dracula "Zinged" and fell in love. Dracula realizes he no longer knows humankind's true tolerance of monsters, and manages to convince Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Wayne's daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight to the United States. The four head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way. Admiring the group, the humans agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provide Dracula shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Dracula arrives to see Johnny's plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnny's attention, Dracula makes his way to the front of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]] ([[Brian Stack]]) to help him apologize, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Jonathan accepts his apology, and Dracula manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport.  Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their 'Zing' was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Mavis's party, impressing the hotel guests.

House at the End of the Street
 A newly divorced medical doctor Sarah Cassidy ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) move to a small, upscale town. They are disturbed to discover the house they are moving into is on the same street as a house in which a family used to live before they were massacred. The story of the massacre is told to them by the neighbors. Four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Anne Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan ([[Max Thieriot]]) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver ([[Gil Bellows]]), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter.  The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts seeing Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Anne by allowing her to fall from a [[Swing (seat)|swing]] when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting [[brain damage]] from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder.  Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Anne (Eva Link) in a hidden room. Carrie-Anne manages to escape and approaches a young couple in a car while brandishing a kitchen knife. Ryan catches up to her before she can reach the couple but accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to a diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy ([[Jordan Hayes (actress)|Jordan Hayes]]).  Later, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started. She finds tampons in the kitchen garbage and explores the house with suspicion until she finds the secret room and is attacked by Carrie-Anne, who is revealed to actually be Peggy. Ryan restrains "Carrie-Anne" while frantically screaming at Elissa to leave. Elissa finds blue contact lenses and Peggy Jones's wallet in the kitchen. Ryan has kidnapped the waitress and attempted to make her look like Carrie-Anne. Elissa tells Ryan she has to go home but Ryan hits her, knocking her unconscious.   Elissa wakes to find herself tightly tied to a chair. Ryan reveals that Carrie-Anne actually died during the swing accident. He says his parents blamed him for it, and reveals that he was the one who killed them. He explains that he wants Elissa, but that he needs Carrie-Anne and cannot have both. Officer Weaver goes to Ryan's house to look for Elissa, but Ryan stabs him to death. Elissa frees herself and tries to escape in Ryan's car, but Ryan knocks her out with [[chloroform]] and traps her in his car trunk with Peggy's body. Sarah arrives and is also stabbed by Ryan. Elissa struggles out of the car and ultimately shoots Ryan with Weaver's gun. When she approaches him, he suddenly wakes up and grabs her wrist. When Ryan attempts to stab Elissa with the knife, Sarah strikes him in the head with the hammer.   Elissa and Sarah move out; Ryan is placed in a psychiatric ward (behavior hospital). A flashback shows young Ryan in girl's clothing about to blow out birthday candles. His mother calls him "Carrie-Anne" and when Ryan protests that his name is Ryan, not Carrie-Anne, she slaps him violently; it is revealed that Ryan was an only child and that Carrie-Anne is not real.  
HOUBA! On the Trail of the Marsupilami
 Dan Geraldo, a reporter who needs a scoop, arrives in Chiquito, [[Palombia]], but he does not think that he is going to discover anything significant, other than an interview with the Paya; the indigenous tribes of Palombia. However, accompanied by the eccentric and poor vet and tour guide, Pablito, whose children dislike him and deem him a liar, Dan is told the myth of the [[Marsupilami]], a mythical and extremely rare creature that is believed to inhabit the Palombian rainforest and to be a real species.  Meanwhile, 80-year-old botanist Hermoso discovers a beautiful but rare orchid, in which the Marsupilami uses to cradle its eggs, manages to condense it into a liquid and drinks it, turning him to an early adult age. With the help of Caporal, a Palombian Army officer, he performs a coup d'état and imprisons General Pochero, the current dictator with a love for [[Celine Dion]], while he plans to capture the Marsupilami, which had earlier stolen Hermoso's samples and is planned to be trained to take more orchids for Hermoso to stay young.  Dan and Pablito, after tracking in the jungle, are captured by the Paya. In their temple, they meet the beautiful Queen Paya, who gives a prophecy of the Marsupilami (seen as the Guardian of the Jungle) being threatened by "the man with two faces". They are released, but after Dan insults Pablito and reveals that he isn't paying him, the two get into an argument and separate.  Pablito soon meets the Marsupilami and discovers that it had a mate and a nest of eggs. Suddenly, the nest is torn down by the Palombian soldiers and the Marsupilami is struck by a tranquilizer dart by Caporal. Hermoso, who has given himself the title General, finds more orchids, but also discovers the eggs. Pablito tries to stop them, but Dan bumps into him and they are both knocked out. He places both in an incubator at his presidential palace and gives the Marsupilami to Caporal, seeing no use for it anymore.  Back in prison, the two find General Pochero, who manages to give in and escapes using a secret exit, arriving at the palace. Because Pochero enjoys hearing Celine Dion's "I'm Alive", he disguises himself as a woman, using the costumes of his mannequins, and distracts the Palombian soldiers, giving Pablito and Dan the chance to steal the orchids, eggs and a limousine before returning to Chiquito. Caporal is knocked out by the Marsupilami and it escapes after the eggs. Hermoso discovers that the orchids and eggs were stolen, and furiously takes off in a military jeep after the trio.  Dan makes it to TV Palombia, and begins the show by explaining the Marsupilami's existence. Pablito comes to his aid, after his video tape is missing, but realizes that he had accidentally erased the video; the Marsupilami arrives to take its eggs, revealing itself on TV. Suddenly, Hermoso runs through the room with the jeep and nearly kills the Marsupilami for its eggs, but the potion wears off and Hermoso shifts to an infant. Pablito was forgiven by his children, and the Marsupilami is securely returned to its home in the jungle, with the now-hatched babies with its new parents.

The dead man, who had drugs in his system, has a large dog-bite on his thigh but no fingerprints. The police discover the immolation was not suicide but was triggered by a timer in the victim's trouser belt. Sang-gil traces the sex club the victim had visited but bawls out Eun-young when she makes an amateurish error during a fight. Against protocol, Sang-gil omits to file reports on the progress of the case, as he wants to earn all the kudos himself and thereby a promotion. His boss finds out, just as a second victim, Nam Sang-hun, is found bitten to death by a large dog or wolf. After talking to dog-trainers, the police learn the man they need to see is Min Tae-shik, a retired police dog trainer who lives with his drug addict daughter; during a raid on his house, Min escapes and a wolf-dog subsequently kills a woman in the backstreets. Eun-young starts questioning police-dog trainers, as well as investigating those missing or dead, and comes up with the name of Kang Myung-ho, who supposedly committed suicide a while ago. She sets off to investigate on her own.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

Hypothermia (film)
 On an icy lake, Ray Pelletier scouts out a good ice fishing spot for his family. He spots something bloody on the ice near a hole, walks toward it and falls through when the ice breaks. Back at the cabin, his wife Helen, son David and his son's girlfriend Gina are waiting for him. Ray has been struggling for hours to get out of the hole. Helen asks David and Gina what their plans are after college, and they mention that they will be joining the Peace Corps and going to Uganda following graduation.   Meanwhile, something in the water watches Ray as he struggles. He finally gets out of the water as his family goes out searching for him. The creature follows David as he walks on the ice. David finds Ray passed out from exhaustion. They return to the cabin, where Gina examines him. Ray assures everyone he is fine. The creature watches the family from a window.  The next day, the family drills through the ice as the creature watches from underneath. They wonder why it is taking so long for the first bite of the day. They see a truck arrive on the ice, towing a trailer. Steve Cote and his son Steven Jr. set up for ice fishing. Ray eventually gets annoyed at their loud music and asks the Cotes to turn it down, which they do. The Cotes then drive away in the truck, leaving their trailer.   Soon after, the Cotes return on snowmobiles, chasing the creature under the ice. The creature and the men head straight for the family. The creature snags all of their lines and their rods break. The Cotes are frustrated that they did not catch the creature. The two groups socialize and the men offer to fish with them, but the Pelletiers decline. Steve then shows the family their trailer. While walking back to their fishing hole, the family spots the creature heading straight for the men. Steven Jr. attempts to reel it in, but it pulls him down. Steve grabs his ankles, and Ray grabs Steve and they all pull Steven Jr. up. They notice that he has a huge gash on his arm. Steve takes him inside for "a hot shower and a cold beer".  The Cotes discuss the creature. They believe it can sense vibrations and is eating everything in the lake. Steve invites the Pelletier family to dinner and they reluctantly accept, since they have nothing, having planned to eat whatever they had caught. During dinner, Steven Jr. begins to feel disoriented, and his wound squirts blood onto Gina. They examine the wound, which looks infected. Gina wraps it up. Steven Jr. insists the creature is not a fish because it had legs. The family urges Steve to take him to the hospital, but Steve angrily refuses, implying his son is too tough to need a doctor.  Later that night, Ray, Steve and David are out on the ice, running a motor to disorient the creature's senses. Steven Jr. comes out from the trailer and collapses as soon as the others see him. They hear a noise and the creature attacks, grabbing Steven Jr. and pulling him into the water. Steve jumps in after him, but sees that his son is dead. Ray jumps in and retrieves Steve.  When Steve wakes up, they decide to leave as soon as he is ready. They also tell Steve that he was cut by the creature. When Steve tries to get up, his cut oozes as if infected. Gina doesn't understand why, as she had treated it with disinfectant. Steve yells about wanting to hunt down the creature that killed his son. The family calms him down and they agree to leave in the morning.  As they rest, Ray hears Steve starting the snowmobiles to attract the creature. As Steve argues with Ray, he begins to experience the same disorientation that his son felt earlier. The creature attacks after David comes out to see what is going on, and takes Steve with it. When it returns, David and Ray get into the trailer, but David now has a cut on his face. Helen panics and sucks out the venom. They stay in the trailer to hide from the creature. They decide to wait for an opportunity to leave. As David lies on the floor, the creature's hand pushes through the lid in the floor and claws at David, cutting his throat and killing him.  In the morning, Gina reveals she and David had planned to get married before going into the Peace Corps, and that they were going to announce it last night at dinner, but never got a chance with all that happened. Ray grabs one of Steve's guns and the family goes outside. Gina views Steve's remains with horror. Ray attempts to attract the creature by starting the snowmobiles, but they will not start. They walk toward the cabin carefully. They hear a sound, and look back to see that Steve's body is gone. The creature is eating the body under the water. As they continue walking, they see the shadow of the creature swimming under the ice beneath them. Ray urges Helen and Gina to get to the shore while he fights the creature off. The creature rams the ice under Ray so that it cracks and breaks under his weight. Ray is killed. The creature stalks Helen and Gina. When it catches them, it stares them down as Helen talks to it. It leaves them and the women calmly walk toward the cabin.  
The Hunger Games (film)
  As punishment for a past rebellion, the 12 districts of the nation of Panem are forced by the Capitol to select two tributes, one boy and one girl between  12 and 18, to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one survivor. In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are escorted to the Capitol by chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, a past victor. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the "Careers" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.  At the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Twelve tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Katniss cuts the branch holding the nest; it falls on the sleeping Careers. Glimmer is killed, but the others get away. Katniss is disoriented from being stung herself; Peeta returns and tells her to flee.  Rue helps Katniss recover, and the two become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers have stockpiled by detonating the mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss finds and frees Rue from a net, but Marvel impales Rue with a spear thrown at Katniss; Katniss kills him with an arrow. Katniss comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. Afterward, she makes a three-finger salute to the cameras. This triggers a riot in District 11. Snow warns Crane about the unrest caused by the Games.  Haymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss searches for and finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's strong opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but is ambushed and overpowered by Clove. When Clove gloats about Rue's death, [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, appears and kills her. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine fully heals Peeta.  While hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signaling a death. She races to Peeta and finds he has unknowingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover Foxface, District 5's female tribute, dead from eating the berries she assumed were edible from watching Peeta.  Crane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and chase Katniss, Peeta and Cato onto the Cornucopia's roof. There the last survivors fight to a stalemate. Cato holds Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below, who tear at him until Katniss shoots him with an arrow.  However, the rule change about two victors is suddenly revoked. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily names them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies with her acts of defiance. Crane is then locked in a room with nightlock berries.

 Rock Polotan (Concepcion) and Tracy Fuentebella (Dos Santos) are teenage sweethearts and both [[nursing]] students in a university in [[Manila]], they  are in love and full of dreams. A youthful indiscretion leads them to early parenthood, a situation they face squarely, and quite maturely, by planning to get married. They shortly realize, however, that the problem behind their wedding plans has less to do with themselves than with their own parents.  Rock’s parents are an oddball couple with odd professions.  Pol Polotan (Ogie Alcasid) is a one-hit-wonder composer now reduced to teaching guitar lessons to neighborhood kids.  His sassy wife (Eugene Domingo) has the entrepreneurial smarts to be a caterer, even if it means her clientele are bereaved families at funeral parlors.  Always struggling to rise above life’s hard knocks, the Polotans (like your average Filipino family) manage to get by somehow through their keen sense of humor, resilience and resourcefulness.  At the other end of the social spectrum is Tracy’s family, the Fuentebellas. A landowner son of a retired general, Tracy’s father, Nick Fuentebella (Gary Valenciano), is a stuffed-shirt husband with more skills as a businessman than as a family man.  Alienated by his passiveness and lack of ardor, his wife Elaine (Zsa Zsa Padilla) and daughter Tracy are mostly left to fend for themselves, when it comes to their own needs and problems. It also doesn’t help that Nick’s military father (Jaime Fabregas) is a closed-minded conservative with no allowances for human frailties.  When the families finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, a scenario that turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation.<ref>[http://www.pep.ph/guide/guide/9974/ogie-alcasid-excited-to-do-love-scene-with-eugene-domingo-for-i-do-bidoo-bidoo Ogie Alcasid, excited to do love scene with Eugene Domingo for I Do Bidoo Bidoo] ''PEP.ph''.

Ice Age: Continental Drift
 While Scrat inadvertently causes the break up of [[Pangaea]], Manny and Ellie are forced to deal with the trials and tribulations of their teenage daughter Peaches, who has trouble fitting in with her peers. Ellie tries to support her daughter, but Manny becomes exceedingly over-protective. Meanwhile, Sid's family returns, but only long enough to drop off the elderly Granny before abandoning them both. Shortly after, a sudden continental break-up separates Manny from The Herd. Trapped on a moving chunk of ice with Sid, Granny, and Diego, Manny has no choice but to ride out the current. Meanwhile, a giant land shift encroaches on Ellie, Peaches, and those remaining on land, causing them to make their way towards a [[land bridge]].  Meanwhile, Scrat, in a subplot, finds an acorn that has a [[treasure map]] on it that directs him towards an island. After violent weather pushes them further away from land, Manny's group is captured by a band of [[pirates]] sailing on a floating [[iceberg]] led by a [[Gigantopithecus]], Captain Gutt, who attempts to press them into his crew. When they refuse, Gutt tries to execute them, leading to their escape, which inadvertently cause the ship and food supplies to sink. Gutt's [[first mate]], a female [[saber-toothed cat|sabretooth]] named Shira, joins them after she is left for dead.  The Herd washes ashore on Switchback Cove, which gives a current back to their home. Manny coordinates a plan using a group of [[hyrax]] to steal a new iceberg ship that Gutt is planning to use, and they are able to escape using the ship. Just before that, Diego, who has fallen in love with Shira, tries to convince her to leave the pirates and join The Herd so she can have a better life, but Shira, while initially accepting, instead stays behind and slows Gutt down so The Herd can escape. Gutt then forms another ship and plans to seek revenge on Manny.  After narrowly escaping a pack of [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny return home only to find the land bridge destroyed and that Gutt has beaten them and taken Ellie, Peaches, and the rest of The Herd hostage. A fight ensues, as Granny's pet whale, Precious, arrives and fends off Gutt's crew. Manny defeats Gutt in a final duel on an ice floe and reunites with his family and friends. Gutt subsequently encounters a siren that assumes the shape of a female Gigantopithecus, and is eaten alive. With their home destroyed, Precious takes the entire Herd (including Shira, who becomes a couple with Diego) to a lush island where the hyraxes from earlier have already started rebuilding their civilization.  In the film's [[epilogue]], Scrat discovers the island on the map, known as Scratlantis (a parody of [[Atlantis]]), but his uncontrollable urge to hunt acorns in the acorn-rich city inadvertently causes the entire island to sink when he unplugs an acorn drain holder; Scrat is then ejected into a newly created desert landscape, through which he screams as his tears boil from the heat.  
The Iceman (film)
 In the 1960s, [[Richard Kuklinski]] ([[Michael Shannon]]) marries Deborah ([[Winona Ryder]]) and the couple have two daughters. Kuklinski keeps secrets from his family. He works dubbing pornographic films, which he then supplies to a mob operated syndicate, but he tells his family that he dubs Disney cartoons. Kuklinski is also deeply troubled. As a boy he was the subject of brutal beatings from his immigrant Polish father, shaping Kuklinski into an emotionally disturbed and intensely violent man. A man insults him after a game of pool so Kuklinski follows the man to his car and murders him by quickly slashing his throat.  Another secret Kuklinski keeps is that his younger brother Joseph ([[Stephen Dorff]]) is serving a life sentence for raping and murdering a twelve-year-old girl. [[Roy DeMeo]] ([[Ray Liotta]]), a powerful mob boss, shuts down the pornographic film business in which Kuklinski was involved and brings him on board to work as a contract killer after Kuklinski passes an impromptu audition: killing a homeless man with Roy's gun.  During the killing of Marty Freeman ([[James Franco]]) due to his knowledge of Josh Rosenthols' ([[David Schwimmer]]) whereabouts (who had been using DeMeo's name too freely in his business dealings), Kuklinski meets [[Robert Pronge]] ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), another hitman for the mob. After DeMeo puts Kuklinski on suspension for allowing a teenage girl to live after witnessing a hit (Kuklinski reveals that he never kills children), he teams up with Pronge, who is a freelancer, and splits the contract payments with him in return for helping him on contract assassinations for DeMeo's boss Leo Marks ([[Robert Davi]]).  During his suspension, Kuklinski begins to show more of his anger and rage, to the extent of destroying his own kitchen while having an argument with Deborah. Kuklinski also shows paranoia when he looks at a moving ice cream truck and instantly thinks of Pronge. While distracted, Kuklinski bumps his car into another vehicle, the man he hit gets out of his car and insults Kuklinski and his family.

Imaginaerum (film)
 Thomas Whitman is a 75-year-old former musician who has lapsed into a coma after years of suffering from [[Vascular dementia|multi-infarct dementia]]. As he is clinging to his life while his estranged daughter Gem ponders on signing a [[do not resuscitate]] order, Thomas' mind enters a fantasy world where he relives his life as a ten-year-old orphan. After meeting a girl named Ann at the orphanage and acquiring a [[snow globe]] containing a dancing figurine named "Arabesque", young Thomas befriends a snowman named "Mr. White", who takes him on a flight to the skies. But while chasing his father Theodore's airplane, Thomas loses his balance and falls into a surreal world bordered by a run-down roller coaster track, which represents his mind and memories. As pieces of the track fall apart, a mechanic, symbolic of Thomas' doctor in the real world, complains about how futile it is to try to repair the track. The doctor looks to a younger Gem for advice who says they should just let it fall apart; this coincides with Gem agreeing to the DNR order in the real world. Thomas meets a younger version of Gem and a 72-year-old Ann, who warn him about Mr. White. He runs to a "dollhouse", where he sees himself and Ann in their 30s, as members of his band Whitman. The elderly Ann once again appears in front of him, warning him that the snowman is evil and is responsible for the loss of his memories.  As he travels to other parts of his past, young Thomas witnesses the simultaneous events of both his father and his older self lamenting the deaths of their wives. Suddenly, Theodore pulls a gun and shoots himself through his head while the older Thomas smashes the Arabesque globe against the wall, resulting in Thomas distancing himself from his daughter. He chases after Gem throughout the dream world as they both age to the present day.  Back in the real world, Gem arrives at Thomas' home, where she encounters Ann. It is revealed that when Thomas and Ann toured together with their band, Thomas' wife was killed in a car accident when Gem was a child. Because Thomas was not around during her childhood, Gem grew up resenting him throughout her life. Ann informs her that the night that Thomas' wife died, Thomas was with her, as he had stopped her from overdosing on drugs at the time, which reminded him too much of his father's suicide. Later, Ann opens a safe in Thomas' study, only to find sheets of paper containing incomprehensible writing. Ann makes Gem realize that in time Thomas grew as bitter as his own father due to their similar pasts. As a result, he pushed her away in order not to hurt her as his father did. Gem realizes that the notes are all of Thomas' memories when he found out about his dementia and that he did care for her after all. She spends the night piecing the sheets together to form a pattern on the floor. When the house experiences a power failure and Gem's cell phone dies, Ann drives Gem to the hospital.  Meanwhile, in his dream world, Thomas rediscovers his memories with Gem and is determined to hold on to them. He confronts Mr. White, who reveals himself as the manifestation of Theodore. During the ensuing roller coaster ride, Thomas relinquishes his grip on his father. In turn, he lets go of his last memories of Theodore, and holds onto those of Gem. He reaches the end of the roller coaster ride and awakens from his coma with Gem and Ann by his bedside. With his last breath, Thomas reconciles with his daughter before passing away.  Gem returns to her father's home to play the grand piano. When she notices a key not playing right, she opens the lid and discovers a brass name plate lodged between the wires, removing it and placing it on the repaired snow globe. The name plate reads "G Em", revealing Gem's name as the keys [[G major|G]] and [[E minor]]. Thomas mentions throughout the film that the two chords are key to his memories and all he wants is to hear them one last time. He told her that when the chords are played correctly, the Arabesque in the globe will spin. After Gem realizes Thomas really loved her, she plays the chord and the Arabesque spins, symbolizing their reconciliation.

Inshallah, Kashmir
 The film opens with ex-militants describing the torture they underwent when captured by the army. A [[Hindu]] describes his sentiment on being a part of the minority in the region at the height of militancy, when his grandfather was shot dead by militants. A politician and her husband describe the horror of being kidnapped and in captivity for over a month – and despite that, forming a human bond with the militants, and helping them escape when the army closed in on them. One understands from this section that militancy was not binary in nature. It was a dynamic and complex, resulting from various socio-political, economic and religious issues.  Disappearances and fake encounters led to the creation of mass graves, hidden away in sensitive border areas that civilians and journalists are not permitted to access in the name of national security. Human rights lawyer and activist Parvez Imroz reveals to us the presence of almost a thousand such graves in the valley. Rape victims from [[Kunan Poshpora]] describe the trauma they went through at the hands of the army and the stigma that they still face due to the incident.  The film also narrates how the minority Hindu Kashmiri Pandits were effectively cleansed from the valley as the majority of them fled the Islamic Terrorists. At several points in the movie, Kashmiri Muslims describe how the males are picked up and taken to Pakistan to be trained as terrorists. One former terrorist describes how his job will not be completed until Islam is spread through India and the World. He is prepared to die as he is firmly convinced he will go to heaven – though he cannot describe his concept of heaven. One Kashmiri woman openly admits that she sympathises with Pakistani Militants as they are Muslim. There are no interviews with the Indian Military in the movie.    The film then leads us to 'normalcy' or the social ramifications the last twenty years of devastation brought to the valley. Militancy in Kashmir resulted in the Government of India deploying tens of thousands of armed troops in the region. We hear the story of one boy who lost his leg because he was caught in crossfire. The film ends on a poignant note with a young artist saying 'I need my space.'

 On 27 April 1940, a [[Luftwaffe]] [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber (1H+CT)  is shot down near [[Grotli]] by a [[Fleet Air Arm]] [[Blackburn Skua]] (L2940) fighter. Three of the German crew are survivors: pilot Leutnant Horst Schopis (Florian Lukas), Unteroffizier Josef Schwartz (David Kross) and Feldwebel Wolfgang Strunk (Stig Henrik Hoff), who set off looking for shelter. Two British survivors from the aircraft that shot them down have also crash-landed near the same location.  When Capt. Charles P. Davenport (Lachlan Nieboer) and his air gunner Robert Smith (Rupert Grint) meet up with the German crew, they find out that they can all share the same abandoned Norwegian cabin, despite an uneasy armed standoff. In order to survive the harsh Norwegian winter, the German and British crew members have to learn to cooperate and an unlikely friendship blossoms between the survivors.  When the snowstorm which hindered them from trying to find civilization finally ends, Norwegian soldiers set out for a patrol to look for the downed German airmen. They first encounter Smith and Strunk skiing downhill to look for civilization. A Norwegian sniper fatally shoots Strunk and captures Smith, who then leads the patrol to the others.   During interrogation of the survivors by a Norwegian officer, he explains to the British airmen that they may be classified as collaborators. Davenport angrily tells his summary of the events, which then silences the Norwegian officer.  Shopis and Schwartz are sent as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to Canada while Smith and Davenport are sent back to the UK for another mission.

While in a pawnshop a young man ([[Eoin Macken]]) pawns his ring for cash, offered €50 he demands €200, and eventually accepts €75 and a second hand camcorder. He discovers a tape still inside, sits in a cafe, plays back the footage on the camera and watches the film.  In the footage, a group of girls; Sienna ([[Kellie Blaise]]), Cara ([[Tereza Srbova]]), Louise (Vanessa Fahy) and Sian ([[Natalia Kostrzewa]]) are heading out for the 21st birthday of Corina (Siobhan Cullen). As a gift, Sienna and Cara have bought Corina a video camera, with which they plan to record the evening's events. They blindfold Corina and instead of going to a club they break into an disused, abandoned and ramshackled warehouse on a secluded back street, much to Sian's disapproval. Once there, they start drinking, Corina's boyfriend Barry (Sean Stewart) arrives, and they reminisce and share secrets. After Barry leads Sian to a toilet, the remaining girls complain and back-stab about Sian. Louise then takes the camera and discovers Barry having sex with Sian.  Then three vagrant, violent men; Eamo ([[Brian Fortune]]), Scat (Karl Argue) and Hughie ([[Emmett Scanlan]]) break in and gatecrash the party. They terrorise, verbally torment, abuse, and physically and sexually assault the women, and the women scream and wail in fear and despair. Sienna tries to confront them only to be head-butted by Hughie. When Barry tries to intervene, Hughie beats him to death and instigates a game of spin the bottle to rape the women. Whilst Sian is being raped by Eamo, the lights go out, odd sounds emanate from the building, old televisions switch themselves on and a baby's haunting cries are heard. Moments later, Eamo is yanked from Sian by an unseen force, quickly followed by Sian herself.  The negative energy from the brutality of the vagrants awakens a dormant, malevolent, demonic, supernatural force with a thirst for flesh and souls within the building. A brave Cara and hysterical Louise take the camcorder around the building, and try and escape using the narrow beam of the camera's built-in light via the labyrinthine, brick basements with decrepit corridors. They are approached by a Scat who is hysterical about something he has seen and begs them not to leave him alone. After shutting the door behind him, they find a dead Corina with her eyes gouged out. They then notice arches and ominous, arcane symbols and shapes signs on the walls in the dark. Louise enters a trance and is approached by a shambling, ghoulish, gore-covered, malign, emaciated naked figure (Patrick Moynan).  A distressed Cara runs away and finds Sienna, they continue trying to find a way out from room to room but are trapped in the building. They are found by Hughie and shortly followed by The Creature. They break through a door leaving them behind, Sienna picks another lock, then Cara also enters a trance and is taken by The Creature. Sienna runs off through decrepit brick basements to a catacomb in an effort to evade The Creature, she discovers a dead workman and hides from The Creature before being followed and stalked by it, she then runs back, escapes from the warehouse and abandons the camcorder.  After finishing watching the video, The Man uses the footage as a guide to retrace the steps to where the events occurred. The man tracks down the warehouse and makes his way into the basement. He walks into the aftermath and finds Sian and Louise. Sian cries for help as The Creature approaches, The Man tells her to be quiet and hides, she is then attacked and consumed by The Creature.

IRL (film)
 Elias (''Valter Skarsgård'') is a high school junior struggling with constant bullying and torment from his fellow students, especially his neighbour, Agnes (''Alba August''). Increasingly distant from his divorced father, Stefan, younger brother, Jonas, and his best friend, Adam, he finds solace in the online game ''[[The Secret World]]'', where he befriends the avatar ''Sc4rlet''.  After yet another incident at his school where he is stripped down and videotaped, and ridiculingly edited footage uploaded to ''[[YouTube]]'', Elias becomes increasingly angry and depressed, contemplating [[suicide]]. Later that night, Sc4rlet sends him her photo and an invitation to meet at the central station of their hometown, [[Stockholm]], but after his phone is stolen by Agnes and destroyed, their meeting is ruined as Elias cannot find her. Spotting her on the train home, he is afraid of talking to her, and steps of train with the intention of jumping on the tracks. He is narrowly saved by Sc4rlet, who suspected the boy of being him, and they soon become friends.  As things progress, Sc4rlet begins pressuring Elias to stand up for himself, helping him plan his revenge on his tormentors. They decide to go after Agnes, the leader of the gang, hoping that it will cause the others to stop. They soon make a plan to strip her naked and post photos of her on the internet, mirroring what she did to Elias earlier, and later steal drugs from the local hospital for him to use. The following day, Elias attacks her during an outdoors gymnastics class, but she managed to fight him off, and he left alone in the forest after she injects him with the drugs intended for her. Hallucinating from the injection, Elias begins seeing Sc4rlet, who leads him to the roof of the building next door to his apartment, where she tells him that they will "die together, like he wants to". Meanwhile, Elias' father, Stefan, finds the stolen drugs in his sons bedroom, alongside an unedited video of the earlier incident at school, given to him by Adam. Stefan then spots Elias alone on the next door roof, and comes to his rescue just in time.  Elias wakes up in the hospital, where Stefan angrily berates him for not telling him about the bullying and the drugs. Stefan asks Elias what he can do to help, and Elias asks him that there's only one thing he wants to do. After being discharged from the hospital, Elias records a suicide letter on video and says goodbye to his friends and family. That night, ''Sc4rlet'' appears in his room, and we realize that she never stepped off the train in the beginning, and that Elias has been envisioning her to help him. She spends the night, comforting him. The next day, he boards the ferry to [[Åland]], where Sc4rlet appears once again, asking if he is sure about what he is doing. He sets up his camera to record, and jumps off the ferry in the middle of the sea.  Three days later, Stefan is watching a news report about his sons disappearance and suspected suicide. The next day a memorial is held at his school, where the students mourn Elias. As the principal takes the stage to give a speech, Adam cuts into the projector feed, playing Elias' suicide note to the entire school, who watch in shock as he exposes Agnes and her friends, before cutting to the unedited video of incident, revealing Agnes and her friends as they truly are. As the students struggle to grasp with what they have seen, Elias appears on the gallery behind them, alive and well. A quick flashback reveals that Elias had jumped to a deck below, where his father caught him. They then faked the disappearance and suicide, with the faked suicide video as "evidence", in order to bring attention to the bulluying.  Some time later, Stefan, Elias and Jonas, a family once again, is watching an interview with Stefan on television, where he is questioned about the ethics of Elias faking his death like he did. Stefan then responds that bullying is never taken seriously, "not until someone dies. We needed someone to die, so that the world could see the truth." A vision of Sc4rlet appears once again, smiling to Elias, who, for the first time, can smile again. He decides to find her; and using the number she texted him from earlier in the film, tracks her down, learning that her real name is ''Scarlet Friedmann''. The film then ends with Elias finally meeting Scarlet, who recognizes him from the train and tells him that she waited for him at the station and was sad when he never showed up, but is glad that he finally had the courage to meet her.

Iron Sky
  The film opens in 2018 with an American manned landing mission to the [[Moon]]. The lander carries two astronauts, one of them an [[African American]] male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] in her re-election (various "Black to the Moon" word-play posters are seen in the film, extolling the new Moon landing).  Upon landing on the [[far side of the Moon]], they encounter the descendants of Nazis who escaped to the Moon in 1945 (self-styled the "[[Fourth Reich]]" in dialogue). Washington is taken captive after the other astronaut is killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter examines Washington and obtains his [[smartphone]], which he later recognizes as having more computing power than the 1940s style computers of the Fourth Reich, enabling its use as a control unit to complete their giant space battleship ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''.  When Richter strives to demonstrate his [[Wunderwaffe]] to the current [[Führer]], Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone's battery is quickly exhausted. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, chosen for genetic reasons to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter (Doktor Richter's daughter), embarks in a [[flying saucer]] to collect more such computers on Earth. He takes with him Washington, who has been "[[Aryan race|Aryanized]]" by Doktor Richter using an "[[albinism|albinizing]]" drug.  Upon landing in [[New York City]], they discover that Renate has stowed away with them. They abandon Washington after he connects them with the President's campaign adviser, Vivian Wagner. Adler and Renate energize the President's re-election campaign using [[Nazi propaganda|Nazi-style rhetoric]]. Renate is unaware of Adler's ambition to replace Kortzfleisch and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is killed by Adler and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new Führer before returning to orbit in Kortzfleisch's flying saucer, deserting Vivian but taking her [[tablet computer]].  Concurrently, Renate is persuaded by the homeless Washington that Adler intends global genocide. Shortly afterwards, the Moon Nazis launch a mass attack on the Earth with a fleet of giant [[Zeppelin]]-like spacecraft called Siegfrieds which tow asteroids as missiles and launch countless flying saucers at [[New York City]], where they destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]] and blitz the city. The U.S. Air Force engage the flying saucers with some success.  The [[United Nations]] assembles to discuss the Moon Nazi threat. The President appoints Vivian as commander of the secretly [[Militarisation of space|militarised]] spacecraft USS ''George W. Bush'', which carries nuclear and directed-energy weapons, only to discover that most of the other nations (except Finland) have secretly armed their spacecraft. They dispatch them against the Nazi fleet and wipe out the Siegfrieds.  Adler arrives in Kortzfleisch's flying saucer with the tablet computer to activate the ''Götterdämmerung''. Renate and Washington travel in Adler's flying saucer to the ''Götterdämmerung'', where Washington goes to disable the engines while Renate seeks out Adler. Meanwhile, the international space fleet damage the Nazis' Moon base and approach the ''Götterdämmerung'' which dwarfs them all. Commanding the ''Götterdämmerung'', Adler destroys parts of the Moon to expose Earth to his line-of-fire. During the battle, Washington disconnects Vivian's tablet from the control panel of the ''Götterdämmerung'', while Renate kills Adler before he can fire at Earth. Renate and Washington separately escape as the ''Götterdämmerung'' crashes into the Moon.  The U.S. President congratulates Vivian from the UN session; whereupon Vivian discloses the presence of large tanks of [[helium-3]] on the Moon, of which the President immediately assumes sole claim on grounds that its possession ensures a millennium-long supply of energy. This enrages the other UN members, who engage in a brawl, while the international fleet turn on each other.  At the damaged Moon base, Renate reunites with Washington, who has reverted his pigmentation back to normal. They kiss before a confused group of Nazi survivors, whom Renate assures, "[they] have a lotta work cut out for [them]". The final moments of the film show the Earth apparently during an international nuclear war. At the very end of the credits, the planet [[Mars]] is revealed with an [[artificial satellite]] in orbit.  Most of the names in the movie have a symbolic and often ironic meaning. The plot refers to several motifs that originate in post-war [[Esoteric Nazism]], such as the symbol of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] and [[Nazi UFOs]].  
The Iron Lady (film)
 In flashbacks, the audience is shown a young Margaret Roberts working at the family grocer's shop in [[Grantham]], listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolized it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife and announcing that she has won a place at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[University of Oxford]]. She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Conservative Party and find a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], along with businessman [[Denis Thatcher]]'s marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a "Lady Member" of the House, and as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] in [[Edward Heath]]'s Cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with [[Airey Neave]], her decision to stand for Leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and eventual victory, and her voice coaching and image change.  Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], after winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget (over the misgivings of "wet" members of her Cabinet – [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]], [[Francis Pym, Baron Pym|Francis Pym]], [[Michael Heseltine]], and [[James Prior, Baron Prior|Jim Prior]]), the [[1981 Brixton riot]], the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|1984–1985 UK miners' strike]], and the [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing in Brighton]] of the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] during the 1984 [[Conservative Party Conference]], when she and her husband were almost killed. We also see (slightly out of chronological sequence) her decision to [[Falklands War|retake the Falkland Islands]] following the islands' invasion by [[Argentina]] in 1982, the sinking of the [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] and Britain's subsequent victory in the [[Falklands War]], her friendship with [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late-1980s.  By 1990, Thatcher is shown as an imperious but ageing figure, ranting aggressively at her cabinet, refusing to accept that the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|"Poll Tax"]] is unjust, even while it is causing riots, and fiercely opposed to [[European Integration]]. Her deputy, [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigns after being humiliated by her in a cabinet meeting, Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership, and her loss of support from her cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but reluctantly to resign as Prime Minister after eleven years in office. A teary-eyed Thatcher exits [[10 Downing Street]] for the last time as Prime Minister with Denis comforting her. She is shown as still disheartened about it almost twenty years later.  Eventually, Thatcher is shown packing up her late husband's belongings, and telling him it's time for him to go. Denis' ghost leaves her as she cries that she actually is not yet ready to lose him, to which he replies "You're going to be fine on your own... you always have been" before leaving forever. Having finally overcome her grief, she contentedly washes a teacup alone in her kitchen despite saying it was a role she would never accept.

Ishaqzaade
 The Chauhans and the Qureshis are two political families whose rivalry and mutual hatred for one another goes back generations. Parma ([[Arjun Kapoor]]) is a good-for-nothing local thug, grandson of the patriarch chauvinist, Grandfather Chauhan. His grandfather often takes digs at Parma for being the useless son of his widowed daughter-in-law, and this makes Parma try to prove himself worthy.  Zoya ([[Parineeti Chopra]]), a practising [[Muslim]] who offers [[Salat]] five times a day, is the trigger-happy, hot-tempered, only daughter in a traditional Muslim house full of brothers, along with her parents. She desires to go into politics like her father, but this dream is constantly laughed at by her family since she is a woman.  When the local elections take place, Parma and Zoya's canvassing efforts lead to a clash between them, which results in Parma being slapped across the face by Zoya. While Parma is enamored by Zoya's fearlessness, Zoya is intrigued by his charm (including his inability to properly pronounce her name, calling her "Joya" instead of the proper "Zoya"). They fall in love after a series of incidents bring them together, and [[elope]]; Parma [[converts to Islam]] and changes his name to Pervez. After [[Nikah|marriage]], Parma and Zoya consummate the marriage by having sex in an empty train. Afterwards, Parma reveals that he tricked Zoya - the wedding ceremony was fake and they are not married. He perpetrated the sham wedding to get her to have sex with him, which would bring shame upon her family. He therefore took revenge against her clan, and repaid the humiliation of her slapping him earlier on. Zoya is left heartbroken and devastated, as Parma joins his family in a celebration of "becoming a man". Zoya attempts to invade the celebration in order to shoot Parma, but is intercepted by his mother, Parvati, who urges her to calm down. Parvati tells Parma that he must honour his marriage vows regardless of whether he meant them, and do right by Zoya. Parma's family come to know of Zoya's presence in their home and in the heat of the moment, Grandfather Chauhan shoots Parma's mother when she tries to defend her son and daughter-in-law from the bloodthirsty gang. Parma realizes his mistake and protects Zoya from being murdered by his family.  Parma and Zoya go on the run from their families and take refuge in a [[brothel]]. At first, Zoya is still furious with Parma for his deception and even believes that he was trying to sell her to the brothel. She attacks him with a piece of broken glass, cutting his arm badly. The brothel madame, Chand Bibi ([[Gauhar Khan]]), allows them to stay while Parma recovers and Zoya begrudgingly nurses him. He asks her for forgiveness and though she refuses to grant it, she shows that she still loves him through little actions of affection. However, their mutual grief soon brings them together, giving their love a second chance. The two exchange marriage vows in a legitimate ceremony at the brothel. Zoya decides to try reconciling with her family, and takes Parma to her home to win over her father. They are instead met with hostility and gunshots when Zoya's father puts a gun to her head, threatening to kill his own daughter.  The couple flee as Zoya's father sends his men after them. Zoya and Parma prepare to run away to [[Jaipur]], but when Parma leaves the safety of the bus to get water, their pursuers spot him and seize Zoya. She breaks free as Parma furiously fights to save her. They are reunited briefly, but quickly are found by Parma's former friends and run to the local college, which is closed for Eid. The two rival families decide that Parma and Zoya's marriage is a stab to their respective religious communities and political careers, and they try to kill the couple by joining forces.  Parma and Zoya take refuge on a terrace, engaging in a gunfire battle. With only a few bullets left, Zoya realises that they are outnumbered. She asks Parma to shoot her so that their love can win and they can die in the victory of their love, rather than be riddled with bullets by their own families, and allow hatred to win. The two shoot each other in the [[abdomen]] willingly and die in each other's arms, smiling. The goons check if they are dead and go inform the two families, who leave satisfied.  The movie ends with Parma and Zoya's bodies lying on the terrace, and an on-screen message that explains how thousands of lovers like them are killed every year only because of falling in love outside their caste and/or religion.

Throughout the hunt, revelations of affairs between both hosts and two guests, Buck and Lexi, are made, as are rejected sexual advances by the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] couple toward the nervous newcomer.  Through a shower radio, they hear an [[Emergency Alert System|automated public advisory]] that the bombs contained the [[VX (nerve agent)|VX nerve poison]]. The chemistry teacher Hedy in the group understands that, because the attacks were [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] and not [[Radiological warfare|radiological]], only hours remain before a gruesome death for them all. After going into a [[trance]]like shock, she breaks her silence by asking for [[Scotch whiskey|Scotch]]. She later mixes up a batch of "hillbilly [[MDMA|ecstasy]]" from what she raided from a [[medicine cabinet]], has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and calls off her six-year engagement to Shane. Her spirits lifted, she champions a musical session/"dance party" in the living room, accompanied by Lexi and Buck.  Her now-former [[fiance]] is a [[comic book]] trader and bases his survival strategy on what he's learned from [[zombie]] films like ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''. After hearing of the bombs, he becomes highly suspicious of outsiders (including the new guy) and suggests others watch for bite marks or odd behavior, and they find weapons (like crowbars and chainsaws). He becomes concerned by the lack of life immediately outside the front window, so he questions the doctor guest about how quickly "[[mutation]]s" should appear and spread. She explains how [[genetic mutation]] really works, with some disdain, but later agrees to not let the late fifth couple into the house when they finally arrive, with the pair visibly sick with something. While he seems more concerned by the woman's vague and rushed description of the situation outside, her decision to leave them is also partly punishment for always being late and for a past grievance between the two women over a man at a New Year's party.  The recently dumped trader decides the best option is to leave the house and drive blindly till he either reaches fellow survivors or runs out of gas, having at least died trying. He asks if anyone's coming with him, and they all load into his SUV. However, the battery had been drained after leaving the vehicle on while listening to [[satellite radio]], so it doesn't start.  The group eventually decides to stay home and have their meal as planned, enjoying what time they have. The newcomer goes to the cellar to fetch wine, and is discovered by his date adding [[rat poison]], [[hypnotic| sleeping pills]], and [[muscle relaxant| muscle relaxants]] to it. He explains that he's a firm believer in [[The Last Judgment]], this is likely that and he wants to save his new "non-believer" friends from experiencing the worst of the [[Great Tribulation]]. Convinced he's crazy, she goes upstairs and tells the others, who express their doubt in his craziness and their belief in her tendency to overreact, after the wine is poured, but before they drink. He calmly admits it, and gives his reasons. They're unconvinced, until the chemist agrees their deaths would be easier this way, without the VX symptoms she details.  After some debate, they all agree to drink the poison together on the count of three. After one count, everyone only pretends to drink, even the "true believer", who says he figured that might happen. They again ready themselves and finally tip the glasses back in unison. Again, they all fake it. Their fate is left unknown.  
Isn't Anyone Alive?
 The film follows 18 individuals in separate but sometimes related groups on the campus of a Japanese university hospital.  These groups include a mother and father of an unborn child; a group of friends during a dance rehearsal; staff at the university hospital and a team of students researching [[urban legends]].  Ostensibly, the plot is concerned with a mysterious outbreak resembling a viral [[pandemic]] which causes the film's protagonists to suddenly die one-by-one.  It is suggested during the film that this is due to secret experiments being conducted by the [[United States Armed Forces]] in the hospital. However, rather than attempting to resolve the mystery of the outbreak, the focus of the film is largely devoted to the relationships between the characters and their reactions to their own and each other's impending deaths. Ishii has stated the film is made to show the absurdity of the characters not knowing when or why their deaths will occur and highlights the importance of drama and dialogue within the film, in contrast to his previous works.<ref></ref>

It's Such a Beautiful Day (film)
 Bill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.  Bill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.  The film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the "special" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and "a brain as misshapen as his legs". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one—his great-great-uncle—was outcast from town and "died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon."  A few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child.   Bill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.  Bill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been confabulated. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.  Bill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.  Going to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, "It's such a beautiful day." The screen cuts to black.  The Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him. Bill outlives the human race, surpassing the next inhabitants of the Earth who revere him as a god. He continues living until the Earth is destroyed by the Sun, continuing even when that has gone as well. Floating in space, Bill observes the stars going out, until the screen cuts to black.

Jack Reacher (film)
  In [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], a man drives a van into a parking garage across the [[Allegheny River]] from [[PNC Park]] and, after dropping a quarter into the meter, readies a [[sniper rifle]]. He takes aim and kills five people on the river's North Shore Trail from long range before fleeing in the van.  The police soon arrive at the scene of the murder, headed by Detective Emerson ([[David Oyelowo]]), and discover a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr ([[Joseph Sikora]]), a former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[sniper]]. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed.  During an interrogation by Emerson and the [[District Attorney]], Alex Rodin ([[Richard Jenkins]]), Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed [[death row]], as Rodin has never lost a conviction. Thinking Barr is going to confess when he takes the notepad, they are bewildered when he instead writes "Get Jack Reacher". [[Jack Reacher]] ([[Tom Cruise]]) is a drifter and former U.S. Army [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]] officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher's request to view the evidence but agree to let him see the suspect. Barr, as it turns out, was brutally attacked by fellow inmates while in police custody and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr's [[defense attorney]], counselor Helen Rodin ([[Rosamund Pike]]), the District Attorney's daughter, who has been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the [[death penalty]].  Helen says she can arrange for Reacher to see the evidence if he will become her lead investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a [[Spree killer|killing spree]] during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten. Reacher vowed that if Barr tried anything like this again, he would take him down.  Reacher agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims' families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies about this location, thinking that a trained shooter would have done the killings from the cover of the van on the nearby [[Fort Duquesne Bridge]]. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company was the intended victim, while the other victims served as a cover-up.  After an apparently spurious bar fight, Reacher realizes that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. Reacher is later framed for the murder of the young woman ([[Alexia Fast]]) who was paid to instigate the bar-room brawl, but this only motivates him further. Reacher eventually follows up a lead at a shooting range in the neighboring state of Ohio, owned by former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Martin Cash ([[Robert Duvall]]), who will talk only if Reacher will demonstrate his U.S. Army sniping skills.  The real perpetrators are gang members masquerading as legitimate businessmen. The gang's elderly leader ([[Werner Herzog]]) spent much of his life in a Soviet [[Gulag]] and is known only as the Zec (prisoner). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. After he steals Helen's [[Mercedes-Benz]], Reacher outwits the mob guards, killing them with Cash's help, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy. Zec points out that Reacher has killed most of the witnesses against him and doubts that he would be convicted. Reacher shoots the Zec in the head on the spot.  Reacher and Cash flee the scene with confidence that Helen will clear Reacher's name. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no recent memory but believes that he must be guilty of the shootings. Barr's mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings confirms that Reacher's theory was correct from the beginning. Still unaware of all these developments, Barr is willing to confess and accept his punishment, fearing that Reacher will mete out justice if the law does not.

John Carter (film)
  The film begins after the sudden death of [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a former [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate Army]] captain. His nephew, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], attends the funeral. As per Carter's instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney hands over Carter's personal journal for Burroughs to read, in the hope of finding clues explaining Carter's cause of death.  The anecdote recounts back to the [[Arizona Territory]], where [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Colonel Powell arrests Carter. Powell, knowing about Carter's military background, seeks his help in fighting the [[Apache]].  Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they take to hiding in a cave that turns out to be the object of Carter's earlier searching, the 'Spider Cave of Gold'. A [[Barsoom#Therns|Thern]] appears in the cave at that moment; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, [[Barsoom]]. Because of his different bone density and the planet's low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Green Martian [[Tharks]] and their [[Emperor|Jeddak]] [[Tars Tarkas]].  Elsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, [[Dejah Thoris]]. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter. Carter, Dejah, and Tarkas' daughter Sola, embark on a quest to get to the end of a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back home. They obtain information about the "ninth ray", a means of utilizing infinite energy and also the key to understanding how the medallion works. But they are later attacked by Shang's minions, the Green Martians of Warhoon. After the attack, Carter is captured and taken back with Dejah while Sola is able to escape. The demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than, then gives Carter his medallion and tells him to go back to Earth. Carter decides to stay and is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different planets. Carter is able to make an escape as he and Sola go back to the Tharks requesting their help. There they discover Tarkas has been overthrown by Tal Hajus. Tarkas, Carter, and Sola are put on trial in a colosseum battle with two enormous vicious creatures, the four-armed Great White-Apes. After defeating them and killing Hajus, Carter becomes the leader of the Tharks.  The Thark army charges on Helium and defeats the Zodangan army by killing Sab Than, while Shang escapes. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay forever on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang banishes him back to Earth. Carter then embarks in a long quest, looking for clues of the Therns' presence on Earth and hoping to find one of their medallions; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements—consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state. He makes Burroughs his protector, giving him clues about how to open the tomb.  The story reverts to the present, where Burroughs runs back to Carter's tomb and opens it, only to find it empty. A Thern suddenly appears, having followed Burroughs. But as the Thern prepares to kill Burroughs, Carter appears and kills the Thern. Carter then tells Burroughs that he never found a medallion. Instead, he devised a scheme to lure one of the Therns into revealing himself. Carter takes his medallion, whispers the code, and is then transported back to Barsoom.

John Dies at the End (film)
 David Wong, a slacker, recalls confronting a zombie [[White power skinhead|skinhead]] whom he beheaded one year prior and wonders whether an [[Ship of Theseus|axe that had its handle and head replaced over time is still the same axe]]. In the present day, he meets with small time reporter, Arnie Blondestone, to recount the supernatural events that plagued the small, undisclosed city David lives in.  Some time ago, David is at a party with his friend John, with acquaintances Fred Chu, Justin White, along with high school classmate Amy Sullivan, who has an [[amputee|amputated]] hand. David learns that Amy's dog, Bark Lee, has gone missing after biting Robert Marley, a drug dealer who pretends to be Jamaican. As he leaves the party, David sees Bark next to his car.  A frantic, incoherent John calls Dave, demanding he come over at once. At John's apartment, David finds a syringe containing a black-colored drug, oblivious to a bizarre creature only John can see. John tells David that the drug, "Soy Sauce", given to him by Marley, grants inhuman knowledge when taken, along with dumping the user in alternate dimensions and timestreams, as demonstrated by a past version of John calling present Dave.  As they drive off, David is bitten by the suddenly animate syringe, propelling him through alternate dimensions. Returning to the present, a strange man, Roger North, appears in the backseat, attempting to offer Dave advice on the strange events, but disappears when Dave threatens him.  Detective Lawrence Appleton questions the two at a police station about the party. Appleton reveals that John and White were the only survivors of a drug-fueled afterparty thrown by Robert Marley - everyone else either disappeared, or suffered grisly, bizarre deaths.  In the present, an incredulous Arnie tries to leave, but Dave convinces him to stay after showing him a strange monster.  During questioning, John apparently dies. Despite this, John telepathically contacts Dave, helping him escape from the police station and a ghost that appears as a cop, and guides him to Marley's house. Marley's Soy Sauce knocks Dave unconscious. He wakes up to see Appleton preparing to burn down the trailer, who tells him John's body disappeared, and that the Soy Sauce is letting in some kind of evil force. Appleton shoots David, who survives by time-traveling and tampering with the round he was shot with. Bark, controlled by John, drives David's car through the wall, allowing him to escape. In his house, David is subdued by a possessed White.  White kidnaps David, Fred, Amy, Bark and John, taking them to an abandoned mall, hoping to use a ghostly door inside to travel to another dimension. John manipulates White into going outside, where Appleton kills him. Appleton then explodes into a swarm of demonic insects, who possess Fred. David reluctantly kills him. Amy opens the ghost door with her [[phantom limb]], allowing John and Dave passage. They meet North and Albert Marconi, a celebrity psychic and exorcist. They have teamed up against Korrok, an eldritch biological supercomputer that has turned into a genocidal god, who uses the Soy Sauce to open up new dimensions to conquer. Marconi gives David and John a LSD-laced nuclear bomb to incapacitate Korrok with.  The two step through a portal to an alternate Earth. Disciples of Korrok greet them as "chosen ones" and present a brutal [[utilitarian]] society, where dissenters are horribly maimed by Korrok's monsters. The duo are brought before Korrok, who plans to devour them, absorb their knowledge to conquer their dimension. John tries to activate the bomb, but fumbles. Bark Lee, who followed the two, grabs the bomb and flings himself into Korrok, detonating it and destroying the two of them.  Upon escaping, David and John meet Marconi and learn that Bark was meant to defeat Korrok all along - after biting a Soy Sauce-addled Marley, it linked him to Marconi and North. Amy becomes David's girlfriend. David and John become exorcists and demon hunters, with Marconi's assistance.  In the present, Arnie reluctantly decides to publish the story, despite fears of damaging his career. Dave realizes Arnie is a ghost, noticing inconsistencies in his background - the real Arnie is dead in the trunk, killed by an unknown force. Seeing this, Arnie vanishes.  Later, John and Dave play basketball, and inadvertently wind up in a post-apocalyptic dimension. A paramilitary organization informs them they are chosen ones who will restore the world, but an annoyed John and Dave walk off.

Jism 2
 At the beginning, Izna, a porn star ([[Sunny Leone]]), is lying dead in the grass, but she says that she wants to ask forgiveness from somebody for her sins. The story flashes back six months.  Izna is hired by an intelligence officer Aayan Thakur ([[Arunoday Singh]]) and Security Chief Guru Saldanah ([[Arif Zakaria]]) to become a 'honey-trap' and help them retrieve critical information from a dreaded assassin, Kabir Wilson ([[Randeep Hooda]]). During this mission, Aayan gets to know about Izna's previous relationships with Kabir when Kabir himself used to work for the intelligence. During one of his missions where Izna was being used for drug-peddling in a pub, which she was unaware of, Kabir arrested the guilty drug-peddlers, and Izna explained that she was innocent. Kabir took a coin from her and explained how the coin saved her from an arrest. He had seen her pick it up from the street after she dropped it, something a person in a drug-cartel would not do. Izna started loving Kabir and followed him home, handing him a love letter written in her own blood. Both started loving each other but one day, Kabir disappeared without any word. Six years passed and Izna did not find him despite many efforts.  After Izna agrees to the mission, she is taken to a residential colony in [[Sri Lanka]] to live where Kabir also lived with an identity of a musician. Izna is asked to act as Aayan's fiancée and is given a story of how they both met each other. Izna then is asked to go to Kabir's house to introduce herself as his new neighbour, but he acts as if he does not recognise her. The very next day, he writes "Sorry" on her window in his blood but flees as soon as a phone call comes. Kabir attacks Guru Saldanah's team but Saldanah makes an escape and plans to stop the operation. Aayan plans to steal the data from Kabir while Izna takes Kabir out. Izna sends a letter to Kabir telling him that she wants to meet him, and Kabir leaves his house. Aayan moves to Kabir's house to steal the data. When he copies data from Kabir's laptop, it gives Kabir an alert to his phone, and Kabir runs towards his house. Aayan escapes with the data, but he later discovers that it had all been falsified. Izna says that she will never forgive Kabir and will bring him down.  Kabir, who still trusts Izna, had never had reason for suspicion of her; not so with his trusted friend Sumit, who suspects her and warns Kabir about her. Kabir proposes to marry her and asks Izna to shift to his house and leave Aayan. Izna agrees to this. But in the meantime, Aayan, who has fallen for Izna, is angered upon hearing this. She claims that she will only be able to steal the data once she gets into Kabir's house. She moves to his house and starts staying with Kabir. Kabir asks Sumit to arrange for a priest for the marriage, who accidentally reads an SMS to Aayan on Izna's phone, which proved she was a spy. Sumit goes to kill Aayan, but instead, he is himself killed in a gun battle. Aayan calls Izna for some urgent talk and expresses his fears that they can no longer play this risky game as when Kabir will find out that Sumit is killed, he will kill Izna. Aayan gives her poison and asks her to mix it into Kabir's drink.  When Izna is not at home, Kabir goes to Aayan's house and discovers Sumit's hearing aid. To find more about Sumit, Kabir searches the house and ends up discovering a book inside Izna's bag which has a similar story that Izna told to Kabir regarding her meeting Aayan. This confirms Sumit's suspicions, and Kabir waits for Izna. When she does return, she offers him coffee. However, she blends the poison Aayan had given her into the coffee she serves him. Kabir tells Izna that years ago, he had left Izna for a sting operation, only to discover, during the operation, that the country's own officers, security forces and politicians were corrupt. Therefore, he had shortlisted them and then he had them killed. According to Kabir, he was a patriot, not a terrorist.  Dumping out the poisoned coffee undrunk, Kabir tells Izna that the Guru Saldanah is a fraud, and his team impostors, who will kill Izna once they get the hard disk containing the original data. He asks Izna to escape and offers her a new passport, tickets, and access to an account maintained at a Swiss bank from which she can withdraw unlimited money. When Kabir kisses her before their separation, Izna shoots him in the stomach, upon which Kabir immediately dies. Running away with the hard disk containing the original data, she goes to Guru Saldanah and hands over the hard disk to him. However, she is soon surprised to know that Guru Saldanah is indeed a fraud, as Kabir had pointed out, and that after the task, she was supposed to have been killed. Aayan was given this responsibility, but he had changed his mind as he was in love with her. As Saldanah tried to kill Izna himself, Aayan tackled him and killed him instead.  Izna told Aayan that because of their fraudulent mission, she killed an innocent person, and that too, the love of her life who blindly trusted her. Izna says that she would prefer to die with Kabir than live with Aayan, and attempts to leave with the hard disk. Aayan threatens to shoot Izna if she leaves the house. Izna then leaves the house. Aayan follows her and then shoots her in the back. Aayan approaches her and turns her over. Still alive, Izna shoots Aayan twice and kills him. Then she is seen with Kabir after death, and she tells him that without him, Heaven is not a heaven, and with him, she has no reason to be afraid of Hell.

Journey 2: The Mysterious Island
   It has been four years since the events of the first movie. Seventeen-year-old Sean Anderson ([[Josh Hutcherson]]) is caught by the police after a brief chase on his [[Motorcycle|dirtbike]] which ends with him driving into a [[swimming pool]] while trying to evade them. Minutes later, his stepfather Hank ([[Dwayne Johnson]]) arrives when a [[police officer]] (Stephen Caudill), who is friends with Hank tells him that Sean has illegally broken into a remote satellite research center, and that he has talked Mr. and Mrs. McGillicutty (the owners of the swimming pool) out of pressing charges. Hank takes Sean home where his mother Elizabeth ([[Kristin Davis]]) is not pleased with his actions and the fact that he and Hank don't get along well.  Hank discovers that Sean trespassed in the satellite research center in order to boost the signal of a code Sean received from someone he suspects is Alexander Anderson, Sean's grandfather who had been missing for two years. Wanting to bond with his stepson, the next day Hank helps Sean decipher the code of [[Jules Verne]] characters which lead to three books: ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and Verne's own ''[[The Mysterious Island|Mysterious Island]]''. Using the books' individual island maps, Hank suspects they are books about the same island and uses a back light in order to make them all one completed land mass with the coordinates to its location. Hank manages to convince Liz to let both of them go in search of the island, in the slight hope of proving Sean wrong, that there is no so-called mysterious island there.  They arrive in [[Palau]] where they need transportation to travel to this dangerous part of the ocean. A Palauan [[helicopter]] tourism guide Gabato ([[Luis Guzman]]) and his daughter Kailani ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), whom Sean develops an immediate crush on, agree to fly them out to the island for $3,000, but the helicopter gets caught in a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] and they crash into the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], waking up on the island.  Moving into the island, they discover one of the laws of the Mysterious Island is that, traditionally small animals become large and large animals become small (inspired by [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]] from ''Gulliver's Travels''). The crew discover tiny [[elephant]]s and giant [[Butterfly|butterflies]], which are the first creatures they come across on the island. The group decides to explore further into the island.  After leaving that part of the island they come across an egg clutch belonging to a Giant [[Frilled Lizard]], they are then saved by Sean's grandfather Alexander ([[Michael Caine]]) who takes them to a large hut he'd built from the wreckage of the ship that brought him to the island, called the ''Blue-Eyed Lucy''. He has a working radio, but due to the positioning of the communications satellite it will be two weeks before they can call for help.  The next morning, Alexander leads the group to the lost city of [[Atlantis]], which is usually submerged in the ocean, and he also calculates that the island sinks once every 70 years. However, Hank discovers the sea water appearing from the ground is the evidence that Alexander's calculations are wrong, and that the island will sink in a couple of days. Their only means of salvation seems to be the legendary ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' ([[Captain Nemo]]'s submarine), hidden somewhere on the island.  Kailani enters Nemo's crypt and finds his journal, which shows the whereabouts of the ship in a cave at [[Poseidon]]'s Cliffs. They decide to go to that cave through the heart of the island.  They mount giant [[bee]]s in order to fly over a high ridge and make up time, but encounter large [[bird]]s that try to devour the bees. After saving Kailani's life, Sean crashes and dislocates his ankle. Hank and Alexander patch up Sean's ankle the best way they can. Afterward, they have a bonding moment when Hank sings his rendition of "[[What a Wonderful World]]" to ease Sean's pain.  The next morning, the water has risen greatly and Hank deduces that the island will sink in a matter of hours, not days. Gabato is missing, having gone toward the island's golden [[volcano]] (inspired by''Treasure Island'') in search of gold to give his daughter a better life. While Alexander and Kailani go after him, Sean and Hank head for Poseidon's Cliffs to look for the ''Nautilus''. Alexander also finally calls Hank by his preferred name, as up to that point he only called him "Henry" and the family makes up.  To deal with the rising water after finding the ''Nautilus'' cave underwater, Sean and Hank create makeshift oxygen tanks and dive down fifty feet in order to obtain the ''Nautilus'' and are nearly killed by a giant [[electric eel]]. They are unable to power the ship however, because the vessel's batteries have run down due to being 140 years old. They engineer a way to power the submarine from the electric eel's electricity.  Meanwhile, Kailani and Alexander find Gabato and convince him to escape with them instead of trying for the golden volcano. They head towards the shore as the island begins to suddenly and violently rip itself apart. The golden volcano starts to erupt violently, pouring lava all over the area. Highly flammable lava bombs are thrown from the golden volcano into the air and suddenly land on the sinking island's debris. Sean and Hank use a harpoon to get an electrical jump start from the electric eel swarming around them and they are able to power the machine, just in time to pick up the others who had fallen into the water. Gabato pilots the submarine out of harm's way while Hank and Sean fire torpedoes into the path of falling island debris. As they clear the dangers, Kailani finally kisses Sean for his bravery.  Six months later, Kailani and Gabato are well off. Gabato is now running the most popular tourist attraction on Palau providing tours aboard the ''Nautilus'' and Kailani is attending college. Kailani goes to visit Sean on his birthday. While they are celebrating, Alexander shows up with a book for Sean's birthday present. Sean opens it to find Jules Verne's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', Alexander's suggestion for a new adventure with the family, to which Liz protests. Hank replies "What could possibly go wrong? It's only the moon!"  During the credits, the mini-elephants from the earlier scene are swimming underwater over Atlantis.  
Joyful Noise (film)
 After the untimely death of a small-town church choir director ([[Kris Kristofferson]]) in Pacashau, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Vi Rose Hill ([[Queen Latifah|Latifah]]), a no-nonsense mother raising two teens alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale (Courtney B. Vance) approves of. However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow ([[Dolly Parton|Parton]]), the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur "Joyful Noise" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever.  Vi Rose has a son, Walter ([[Dexter Darden]]), who has [[Asperger syndrome]], and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia ([[Keke Palmer]]). But Olivia is not ready to date under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy ([[Jeremy Jordan (actor)|Jeremy Jordan]]). A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny (Paul Woolfolk). At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style.  Vi Rose's husband, Marcus (Jesse L. Martin), enlisted in the army after having trouble finding work at home, but his prolonged absence has saddened his family and causes additional tension between Vi Rose and Olivia. Meanwhile, a vivacious member of the choir who choreographs their routines, Earla (Angela Grovey), after a long dry stretch, finds passion first with Mr. Hsu (Francis Jue), whose weak heart gives way by morning, and later with Justin (Roy Huang). The town's tough times forces another choir member, Caleb (Andy Karl), and his family out of business. Vi Rose and G. G. come to blows in a confrontation, Olivia's frustration with her mother boils over, and G. G. threatens Pastor Dale with disendowing the church if the choir is not allowed to compete in the finals with the new arrangements.  During the movie Randy befriends Walter and begins to teach him how to play the piano. One day, while at the quarry Randy and Walter are hanging out as Manny arrives. Randy and Manny begin to fight over Olivia ending with Randy giving Manny a bloody nose. When returning home Walter brags to Vi Rose about the fight. Angered by the news, she throws out Randy and tells him to leave her family alone. Randy, however, is able to befriend Manny and convince him to help out the choir with his guitar skills.  The choir travels to [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] for the finals, feeling very unsettled. Vi Rose and Olivia have a fight and Vi Rose slaps Olivia.

Two years later Vidya Bagchi ([[Vidya Balan]]), a pregnant [[software engineer]], arrives in [[Kolkata]] from London during the [[Durga Puja]] festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki "Rana" Sinha ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]), offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.  Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji ([[Indraneil Sengupta]]), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas ([[Saswata Chatterjee]]), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. ([[Dhritiman Chatterjee]]) and his deputy Khan ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.  The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar (Shantilal Mukherjee), an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is run over by a car during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an [[IP address]] sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.  Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.  Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her [[hair stick]], after shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a [[USB flash drive|pen drive]] containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.  Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu ([[Abir Chatterjee]]), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee ([[Darshan Jariwala]]), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.

Key of Life
 The film begins by introducing its three principal characters: Kanae Mizushima is a mousy editor for a magazine that reviews all sorts of rare and luxury items, who announces her intention to marry despite not having found a husband; Takeshi Sakurai is an out-of-work and heavily indebted actor whose attempt to kill himself fails; Junitsu Kondo is a wealthy killer for hire who has just finished a job.   Their paths cross when Sakurai and Kondo go to the same bathhouse. Undressing near each other, Sakurai clearly envies Kondo's designer clothes and accessories, luxury car keys, and heavy wallet. When Kondo slips on a bar of soap and hits his head, knocking himself unconscious, Sakurai switches locker keys and uses Kondo's key to steal his clothes, car keys, wallet, and identity. His first action is to repay all of his debts. After doing so, Sakurai begins to feel guilty about stealing Kondo's identity and visit him in the hospital. There, Kondo wakes up, but it is clear that he has [[amnesia]]. Realizing that he can get away with what he did, Sakurai backs out of his plan to return what he stole to Kondo. He instead continues to live off of Kondo's wealth. The newly conscious Kondo, freshly discharged from the hospital, attempts to make sense of the life he assumes is his own but which is Sakurai's. On his way home from the hospital, Kondo meets Mizushima, who had been visiting her terminally ill father; she offers to give him a ride to his apartment, and they strike up a friendship. Eventually, despite having known him for a very brief amount of time, Mizushima asks Kondo to marry her, a request which he accepts confusedly.  Shortly after discovering that Kondo's luxury apartment has many secret storage areas filled with official-looking uniforms and other disguises, spy gadgets, and illegal weapons, Sakurai gets a call from a [[yakuza]] boss asking him to kill Ayako Inoue, the fiancée of the man whom Kondo killed in his first scene. After learning that almost no-one knows what Kondo looks like, and believing that he would be better off trying to refuse the job politely than simply hide from the yakuza, Sakurai agrees to meet the boss. The boss tells Sakurai that Ayako's fiancé stole a large amount of money from the yakuza syndicate and that he is sure that Ayako knows where it is hidden. She persists in pleading ignorance. Sakurai is appalled by the prospect of having to kill someone but is unable to refuse the contract. He plots to save Ayako from the mob boss somehow.  Meanwhile, Kondo and Mizushima attend the funeral of her father, who died before he could see his daughter married. While sorting through her father's possessions, Mizushima plays a [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] record. The sound of the music causes Kondo to spontaneously recollect his past life, and he seeks out Sakurai to call him to account for what he has done. Realizing, however, that the yakuza lieutenant Kudo is coming to punish Sakurai for failing to kill Ayako, he is forced to help Sakurai evade the mobsters pursuing him.   Kondo reveals that despite all appearances he is not really a contract killer &mdash; he fakes his targets' deaths and arranges for them to go into hiding and begin new lives. Kondo helped Ayako's fiancé get away and convinced him that it was necessary to give up the stolen money as part of taking on a new identity. Unfortunately, Kondo doesn't know what became of the money after that.  Making an educated guess, Kudo intercepts the group at Ayako's home. Before he can exact his retribution, Mizushima notices that the apparently mundane contents of the Inoue's house deserve a second glance, due to knowledge gained while working for her magazine. She reveals that the missing money is hidden right under their noses, giving off-the-cuff appraisals of assorted furnishings and belongings (such as a highly sought-after vintage dresser and a rare electric guitar). Ayako's facade as the unknowing innocent finally cracks when she rages at Mizushima for foiling her plan, convincing Kudo that selling the furniture and other items is a better option than taking their lives. After Kudo lets them leave, they call the police. Kudo and his men are arrested for burglary, being unable to explain why they are emptying the contents of a house that doesn't belong to them. Despite initial hesitance at returning to a man she doesn't really know, Mizushima makes up with Kondo, and they embrace.

Shortly after Basco leaves, the crew meet [[Battle Fever J#Team Battle Fever|Shiro Akebono]] and [[Denshi Sentai Denziman#Denziman|Daigoro Oume]], who know Retsu personally (other than the fact that all three men look alike). The two former Super Sentai warriors reveal that the Gokaigers can use the Battle Kenya and Denzi Blue Ranger Keys to open a portal to Makuu Space. Using the two keys, the crew travel to Makuu Space, where they break into Makuu Prison. There, they encounter [[Space Criminals Alienizer|two unnamed Alienizers]], [[Space Empire Zangyack#Action Commanders|Jerashid]], [[Barbaric Machine Clan Gaiark#Pollution Ministers|Kegaleshia, Yogostein and Kitaneidas]], [[Negative Syndicate#Dark Shadow|Shizuka of the Wind and Gekkou of Illusions]], [[Rin Jūken Akugata#Bae|Bae]], [[Abarangers#Allies|Yatsudenwani]] and [[Underground Hades Empire Infershia#Vancuria|Vancuria]], who have been locked up in the prison cells by the Zangyack Empire. The ruckus between the crew and the imprisoned former villains results in a platoon of Gormin Soldiers storming into the ground floor. Gokai Blue and Gokai Silver deal with the platoon while the other Gokaigers race to the top floor and the former villains are released from their cells. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Basco and Sally make their way toward the unguarded Gokai Galleon to steal the Gokai Treanger Box. However, Basco is confronted by an unfamiliar force claiming to be the 36th Super Sentai, [[Energy Management Center#Go-Busters|Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters]]. After a brief battle, Basco is too distracted by Sally fighting with a banana, and abandons his plans.  Ashurada has Gavan Bootleg activate Makuu City to slow down the Gokaigers' flight to the top floor by sending them to different dimensions. Gokai Yellow and Gokai Green battle and defeat [[Space Empire Zangyack#Action Commanders|Sneak Brothers Elder & Sister]], while Gokai Red and Gokai Pink fend off [[Universal Annihilation Army Warstar#Monsu Doreiku|Monsu Doreiku]], [[Earth Condemnation Group Yuumajuu#Kinggon|Kinggon]] and [[Machine Onslaught Empire Matrintis#Robogorg|Robogorg]] before Gokai Red reaches the top floor. There, he engages Gavan Bootleg into an intense sword and gun fight. During the fight, Captain Marvelous uses his Gokai Gun and Gavan Bootleg's Laser Z Beam to fire shots that ricochet off their swords and destroy the shackles on Retsu, freeing the Space Sheriff. After Gokai Red rescues Retsu, the Gokaigers shoot holes on the floors for them to drop back to the ground floor before using the Gokai Galleon Buster to destroy the prison and returning to Earth. Upon their return, they battle Ashurada, Gavan Bootleg and their Zangyack army. Gavan faces and destroys his [[doppelgänger]] with the Gavan Dynamic while the Gokaigers finish off Ashurada with the Gokai Blast and Slash Final Wave. Ashurada, however, resurrects himself as a giant, prompting the heroes to summon their mecha. Kanzen Gokaioh docks with [[Space Sheriff Gavan#Vehicles|Electronic Starbeast Dol]] and both mecha weaken Ashurada with the Dol Gokai Fire before Gavan and Gokai Red destroy him once and for all with the Gavan Marvelous Dynamic.  Before the crew and Retsu bid farewell to each other, Retsu is reunited with Shiro and Daigoro when a voice in the sky asks the three veteran heroes to demonstrate their transformation poses to the crew. With Shiro and Daigoro borrowing their respective Ranger Keys, the trio transform into their heroic forms, prompting Gai to run to them and ask for their autographs.<ref></ref>

Hari arranges the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl, Durga ([[Ketaki Mategaonkar]]), renamed as Uma after marriage. However, Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage. Hari performs death rituals ([[Śrāddha]]) for Mahadev but crows (symbolic of the spirit of the deceased in Hinduism) refuse to touch the offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings.  The Brahmin community in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved (a ritual). Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow. Hari stands behind Uma in all her difficulties which raise doubts about his intentions, including that by his wife, Tara. Years later, when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease, the now grown-up Uma (now played by [[Priya Bapat]]) takes charge of the household. Before Tara dies, she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses.  In the meantime, Hari gets his son Sankarshan ([[Saksham Kulkarni]]) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside the room of the newly married couple, listening to their playful banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him to find out the reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti ([[Manava Naik]]) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises more questions about her relation with Hari.  Uma decides to go on a [[Fasting#Hinduism|fast]] and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, explains his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.  He eventually accepts that he loves Uma and would marry her, breaking his vow. Knowing the truth, Uma forgives Hari and agrees to the proposal. Hari fetches [[Mangala sutra]] but finds out that Uma is dead. He realises that Uma has sacrificed her life for his love where she did not want Hari to break his vow.

Kalpana (2012 film)
 Raghava ([[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]]) is a typical jobless youth who spends his days playing cricket with friends. He suffers from an irrational fear of ghosts, and retreats to the safety of his home after sunset. So great is his fear, that he prefers to sleep with his mother ([[Umashri]]) and have her accompany him to the bathroom at night. This creates major annoyance in the household, including Raghava's brother ([[Achyuth Kumar]]), sister-in-law ([[Shruti (actress)|Shruti]]) and their children.  One day, Raghava and his friends are forced to abandon their usual cricket ground and find a new one; they unwittingly select an abandoned ground which is rumored to be haunted. A bizarre weather change scares them away. Raghava brings home his cricket stumps, which have been stained with blood from a buried corpse in the ground. He focuses on wooing Priya ([[Lakshmi Rai]]), the sister of his sister-in-law. In the following days, his mother and sister-in-law are witness to several paranormal phenomena at night; prominently a ghost haunting the hallways. On consulting a priest, they perform 3 rituals to ascertain if the house is haunted:  1. They keep a coconut on a rangoli and pray to [[Lord Shiva]]. The coconut rotates on its own.  2. They make a cow eat food. The cow runs out of the house without eating the food.  3. They leave a lit lamp and two drops of blood and leave the house. A ghost of a woman appears before them and licks the blood.  Scared senseless, Raghava's mother and sister-in-law hire two priests ([[Om Prakash Rao]] and [[Bullet Prakash]]) to rid their home of the ghost. The priests, however, are conmen, and escape with their lives. That night, the ghost possesses Raghava, who begins acting increasingly [[effeminate]], alienating himself from Priya and wearing women's clothes and jewellery. His family angrily confronts him, when it is revealed that there are actually three ghosts who have possessed him: a violent woman, a Hindi-speaking Muslim, and a mentally retarded boy. Raghava's family hires an [[exorcist]], who successfully drives the spirit away from Raghava's body. The ghost of the woman, trapped, reveals her story.  Kalpana ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]) is a [[transgender]] who was disowned by her parents. She is offered shelter by a kind Muslim Akbar Bai ([[Babu Antony]]), who has a mentally retarded son. Regretting that she couldn't become a doctor as she intended, she adopts another young transgender, Geetha, and works hard to support her financially. When Geetha leaves to study medicine abroad, Kalpana buys a plot of land where Geetha intended to construct a hospital for the poor. That ground is unlawfully taken by crooked [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] Shankar. Kalpana angrily confronts the MLA, who cunningly kills her. He also kills Babu Antony and his son. Before she died, she vowed to kill Shankar, his wife, and his henchmen. The bodies are then buried in Kalpana's own ground.  The exorcist sympathizes with her, but remains duty-bound and traps her. After hearing her story, Raghava is touched; risking the danger, he allows Kalpana to possess him once again. Raghava/Kalpana confronts the MLA, and disposes of his henchmen gruesomely. The MLA seeks refuge in a [[Narasimha]] temple which Kalpana is forbidden from; but she asks the deity for justice and manages to chase him inside the temple. The three spirits combined kill the MLA. A few years later, Raghava has constructed the hospital for Geetha as per Kalpana's wishes. The movie ends with Priya shouting "devva" (ghost in Kannada) and a terrified Raghava sitting on her hip.

  ===Introduction=== The movie begins with Phantoms [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Medusa|Medusa]] and [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Phoenix|Phoenix]] approaching some Gates who are trapped in a strange machine and Zatan, Eil and Gahra, a trio of monsters known as the Akumaizers appear before them, claiming that the machine makes use of the captives' mana to summon revived monsters endlessly as part of their plan to get revenge on the Human Race for banishing them to the underground thousands of years ago. Upon learning that the Phantoms were sent there by their leader [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Wiseman|Wiseman]] to assist them, Eil opens a time portal to travel to five years in the future.  ===''Kamen Rider Fourze''=== Five years later, [[Kamen Rider Meteor|Ryusei Sakuta]], now an [[Interpol]] agent, defeats a group of criminals with psychic powers in South America, assisted by Inga Blink, after learning that they work under Kageto Banba, a man with a Zodiarts Switch. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Kamen Rider Club at Amanogawa High School is reduced to one member, a student called Miyoko Ohki whose advisor is [[Kamen Rider Fourze (character)|Gentaro Kisaragi]], who now works there as a teacher. Yuki Jojima is now an astronaut and is about to return from the [[International Space Station]], but another of Gentaro's students, Saburo Kazeta, causes a ruckus with his psychic powers and runs away with three of his classmates. Gentaro runs after Saburo while fellow teacher Haruka Utsugi tries to contain the other three. However, Saburo transforms into the monster Sanagiman and overpowers Kamen Rider Fourze when Banba appears to give him a powerful device called "Zeber". Kamen Rider Fourze is rescued by Kamen Rider Meteor and they contact the rest of the original Kamen Rider Club to help them.  Some time later, Banba and Saburo assemble other youngsters with special powers to join their crusade to stop space exploration for the sake of focusing on Earth's problems. Banba instructs them to channel their energies to fully charge the Zeber while he meets Eil and it is revealed that he is in fact working for the Akumaizers. However, Gentaro and his friends arrive with evidence against Banba and the students are dissuaded by them, except for Saburo and his clique. While Kamen Rider Meteor confronts Banba and Saburo's friends are subdued by the rest of the team, Saburo claims that it is too late for him as he was shunned by his family because of his powers and had already turned into a monster while Gentaro is unlike him, a Kamen Rider. To win his trust, Gentaro destroys his Fourze Driver and claims that he just like him, who decided to give up being a Kamen Rider, Saburo also has the power to change himself into [[Inazuman|someone different]]. Miyoko appears to assist the others, just to be kidnapped by Banba who defeats Kamen Rider Meteor. The reformed Saburo transforms into Inazuman and defeats Banba, but Eil uses the Zeber to destroy Yuki's return module as she descends back to Earth. However, Yuki is saved in the nick of time by [[Kamen Rider × Kamen Rider Fourze & OOO: Movie War Mega Max#Kamen Rider Nadeshiko|Kamen Rider Nadeshiko]]. Eil then escapes back to the present and Gentaro travels back in time after him, accompanied by Ryusei and Nadeshiko. Before confronting the enemy, Gentaro meets his past self and borrows his Fourze Driver.  ===''Kamen Rider Wizard''=== Some monsters who emerged from the Akumaizers' machine are confronted and defeated by [[Kamen Rider Wizard (character)|Haruto Soma]], accompanied by his friends [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Koyomi|Koyomi]], [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Shunpei Nara|Shunpei Nara]] and [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Rinko Daimon|Rinko Daimon]]. However, the Akumaizers prove themselves too strong for Kamen Rider Wizard to defeat by himself and they leave to a Gate's Underworld taking the Zeber with them while instructing Phoenix and Medusa to stop Haruto and the others. However, instead of doing as asked, the Phantoms flee, claiming that they do not want to associate themselves with the Akumaizers. Haruto then dives to the Underworld after them but some monsters appear from the machine and Shunpei and Rinko accidentally enter the portal opened by Haruto, leaving Koyomi alone with the creatures. The three awake in what seem to be their own world, with no memories of what happened, but finds those around her, including some familiar faces, behaving strangely, as they only seem dedicated to arrange the birthday party for a person called "Poitrine".  While exploring the streets, Haruto finds some children attacked by monsters and just while Rinko and Shunpei leads them to safety, Haruto confronts the enemies until a young woman called [[List of Kamen Rider Wizard characters#Yu Kamimura|Yu Kamimura]] appears and transforms herself into "Belle Mask Poitrine" to defeat them. Some of the enemy monsters flee and Yu claims that they must not be pursued as they had quit the fight. While the children ask Rinko and Shunpei to remember the truth, Yu is brought by Haruto to the Antique Shop Omokagedō to celebrate her birthday with his friends. Haruto then awakens at the start of the same day and remembers the truth. When the monsters appear to attack the children, just like in the previous day, Haruto steps in and instead of waiting for Poitrine, finishes the enemies by himself. Both the passerby and Yu complain with Haruto for stopping the monsters instead of Poitrine and it is revealed that just like them, the four children are trapped in Yu's Underworld by the Akumaizers' machine. Haruto tries to dissuade Yu but Gahra appears to stop him and convinces her to have Haruto join the endless loop as well until Haruto and the children bring her to her senses. With Yu free from the Akumaizers' control, Kamen Rider Wizard and Poitrine join forces against Gahra until the Akumaizers reunite, fending off Kamen Rider Wizard and taking Poitrine away with them after throwing several monsters to deal with Haruto.  ===''Movie War Ultimatum''=== Left behind in the real world, Koyomi is about to be attacked by the monsters until Kamen Riders Fourze, Meteor, and Nadeshiko appear to protect her. Meanwhile, Wiseman reveals to Phoenix and Medusa that when the Akumaizers throw the fully charged Zeber into the ocean of magic beneath the Underworld, the outside world will be overflown with enough magic energy to kill all humans. Upon learning the situation from Koyomi, Gentaro makes use of a Magic Ring that somehow is in his possession to gain entry in Yu's Underworld with his companions, arriving in time to save Haruto from the monsters. Gentaro recognizes Haruto, who claims to not know him. However, the Akumaizers send a larger force to deal with the Kamen Riders as they escape with Poitrine and the Zeber. Koyomi is attacked by Ghouls that have emerged from the machine and is saved by Eiji Hino, who uses his powers to reach the children in the Underworld and grant them Magic Rings which they use to summon Kamen Riders [[Kamen Rider OOO (character)|OOO]], [[Kamen Rider Birth|Birth]], [[Kamen Rider Double (character)|Double]], and [[Kamen Rider Accel|Accel]].  After disposing of the enemies, the eight Kamen Riders rush to intercept the Akumaizers' vehicle and rescue Poitrine. Eil and Gahra are destroyed, but Zatan makes a last effort to take the Zeber to the ocean of magic and both Fourze and Wizard are powered up by their companions to finish Zatan and destroy the Zeber for good. Back from the Underworld, Gentaro instructs Haruto to return the Fourze Driver to his past self and is sent back to the future with the others. All the Gates are saved, but while the children do not remember what has happened, Yu, who is revealed to be the owner of the Doughnut Shop Hungry does, much to Haruto's chagrin. Back to his own time, Gentaro learns from Saburo that he and his friends will dedicate themselves to fight those who abuse their psychic powers and the Kamen Rider Club lends him their support, while the past Gentaro is approached by Haruto who returns his Fourze Driver and also gives him the same Magic Ring his future self used previously, claiming that he will eventually need it. After the credits, [[Kamen Rider Beast|a gold-colored Kamen Rider]] makes a brief appearance.

At a later date, the three are invited to a royal ball, to which Kim wears a large [[Romani people|gypsy]]-inspired pink dress. The masked figure approaches and proposes to Kim, who initially refuses because she thinks his mask is hiding a disfigurement. Disregarding Javier's protests, Julio unmasks himself, revealing a handsome face, blond hair hidden by a wig and his crooked teeth to be fake. The invited townspeople gasp as it becomes apparent from his appearance he is not the queen's son. Kim then accepts (stating that she's "done worse"), and the imminent royal wedding makes worldwide news.  The same night, a fire is noticed on one of the castle's [[turret]]s. Rushing inside, the royals, along with Kath, Kim and Sharon, discover that the queen has appeared and set the castle on fire from Kim and Sharon's bedroom using Kim's [[Hair straightening|hair straightener]]. However, the queen is suddenly killed by a falling chandelier and the fire is put out; Javier puts the girls' minds at ease when he explains that the queen was locked up because she was "crazy", jealous of his attraction to Kath and the source of the noises made around the castle.  Back in Australia, Kel is watching ''MasterChef'' with Brett when a news update from Papilloma about the royal wedding interrupts the show, and Brett realises it is Kim getting hitched. Javier is then shown grabbing Kath's backside, and Kel thinks she is having an affair. The pair decide to fly to Papilloma, but not before Kel receives [[hypnosis]] therapy from Marion to combat his fear of flying, which turns strangely sexual and programs him with the phrase "Tray tables up". While on the flight with Brett and Epponnee-Rae (Morghyne de Vries), now a [[Spoiled child|spoiled brat]] who participates in [[child beauty pageant]]s, Kel hears the phrase during the announcement that the flight will soon be touching down. In a trance, he makes his way to the toilet, where he undresses before later collecting his luggage, opens the sealed door (with the plane having just pulled into the airport), triggering the [[evacuation slide]] and leaves.  In Papilloma, Kath confronts Javier about being a [[Despotism|despot]], who rules Papilloma as an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Kel interrupts Javier attempting to put the moves on Kim, and the two engage in a sword [[duel]] for her affections; Kel wins and Javier flees. Kim and Sharon become lost before the wedding after exploring their shared bedroom's closet, with Kim having been sabotaged and attempted to be killed by maid Isabella ([[Jessica De Gouw]]), who loves Julio and earlier had been teased by Kim. After Kim and Sharon come across a [[Nightclub|disco]]-like chamber, it is revealed that Alain has kept all of the imprisoned townspeople and homosexuals there, and they are soon freed, as Kath and Kel, making their way to the wedding, discover the lost Kim and Sharon. Kim laments her messy hair, however Kath, in a [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] moment, practices her amateur [[Technical and further education|TAFE]]-learnt "[[wicca]]" on Kim, giving her a [[makeover]] (but not before turning her into [[Dame Edna Everage|Dame Edna]]).  With the four finally arriving at the wedding, Epponnee-Rae and Brett (who made their way to Papilloma with Prue and Trude, who are also in attendance) interrupt Kim and Julio's vows, and set off a heated argument in which it is revealed that Kim is not actually royalty, and that Julio (who had earlier revealed that his mother is [[Elle Macpherson]]) is not Javier's son, as he fathered no children. Gary Poole ([[Mick Molloy]], who earlier appeared in a flashback), Kath's ex-husband and Kim's father, is revealed to be an extradited royal descendant, therefore making Kath a queen and Kim a princess. Alain also confesses he was "forced" to make love to the queen, and fathered a daughter, the maid Isabella, who professes her love for Prince Julio.  Following the unsuccessful wedding, the royals (including Kath and Kim) along with Kel and Brett appear on a balcony above the town square, where the townspeople chant for food. Javier decides to relinquish some of his power (allowing Papilloma to become a [[democracy]]), and a party with plentiful food is later thrown, which the townspeople attend. At the party, Sharon passionately kisses Alain, who tells her he can't return her affections because she's gay (which had been hinted at throughout the film, referencing Szubanski's real-life [[coming out]]), leaving her confused and disheartened before she meets Stephanie ([[Tasneem Roc]]), who shares her interest in golf and netball. Kath and Kim later discuss returning to Australia after their eventful, [[fairy tale]]-like holiday.

Keith Lemon: The Film
 Keith Lemon ([[Leigh Francis]]) is an aspiring business entrepreneur from [[Leeds]], who is trying to secure investment for his invention, the Securipole (a metal pole put in the driveway to prevent car theft). He travels to [[London]] to present the Securipole at an inventor's convention, putting his friend Dougie ([[Kevin Bishop]]) in charge of his business while he is away. Keith's girlfriend Rosie ([[Laura Aikman]]) advises that he should start the Securipole business slowly and try to sell some poles in Leeds first, but Keith is too eager for the Securipole to be an overnight success and ignores her.  At the convention, Keith's demonstration of the Securipole fails to attract investors and leaves the public underwhelmed. Keith is devastated by his failure, but is approached by another entrepreneur named Kushvinder ([[Harish Patel]]), who offers to give him rights to his own unsuccessful invention, a touch-screen mobile phone without buttons, which Keith reluctantly accepts. In Leeds, a shipment of one million Securipoles arrives at Keith's office, to Rosie and Dougie's dismay. Before going to London, Keith had ordered the Securipoles (his [[dyscalculia]] leading him to believe that he had only ordered one thousand), from a benefactor named Evil Steve (Leigh Francis), who is notorious for torturing and even killing clients who fail to pay him. Rosie and Dougie are unable to pay for the poles or contact Keith, so Evil Steve kidnaps Rosie. Before she is taken away, she orders Dougie to travel to London and find Keith.  After Keith is attacked by a group of muggers, a talking [[satellite navigation]] app on Kushvinder's phone leads him to the office of Archimedes ([[Verne Troyer]]), an advice guru who tries to solve the problems of those in need. Archimedes hears out Keith's plight and manages to get him an appearance on a television chat show hosted by [[David Hasselhoff]] (playing an exaggerated version of himself). On the show, Keith tries to promote Kushvinder's phone, but the audience is uninterested. Thinking quickly, he sticks a lemon-shaped sweet on the phone, making it look like it has a lemon on the cover, which immediately impresses the audience. The "Lemon Phone" becomes an overnight success, and Keith is instantly propelled into the life he has always wanted. He becomes a household name, earns billions of [[Pound sterling|pounds]] from the Lemon Phone, and starts dating [[Kelly Brook]] (playing an exaggerated version of herself) who, unbeknownst to Keith, is only dating him so she can divorce him and take his money later. Despite Archimedes' advice however, Keith prefers his new celebrity lifestyle and decides not to return to Leeds, the Securipole business or Rosie.  Keith hosts a [[toga party]] at a luxury venue, but during the party he is confronted by Dougie, who tells him Evil Steve has kidnapped Rosie and is going to kill her unless he pays for the Securipoles. Refusing to listen and no longer caring about what he left behind in Leeds, Keith dismisses Dougie and throws him out. This angers Archimedes, who also leaves. Going back to Leeds, Dougie decides to rescue Rosie himself, dressing up as [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]] and storming into Evil Steve's warehouse lair, but his plan fails when he accidentally knocks himself out on a metal bar. Back at the party, as Keith and Kelly take to the stage to sing together, the Lemon Phone is suddenly revealed to have a major technical fault that causes the owner's mouth to sag, giving them a speech impediment. The mouths of everyone who was using the phone immediately sag, including those of Kelly and some of Keith's celebrity friends. Outraged, the crowd at the party turn on Keith and chase him on to the roof of the building. Realising the error of his ways, Keith finds Archimedes and begs for forgiveness, but Kelly and the angry mob force him over the balcony. As he falls to the ground, he is saved by Archimedes, who reveals that he is a [[guardian angel]], and explains that he put Keith through this experience to teach him not to ignore his friends and loved ones in the pursuit of success.  Archimedes flies Keith back to Leeds, dropping him over Evil Steve's lair and proceeding to Heaven. Keith falls through the roof, causing rubble to fall on top of Evil Steve, and rescues Rosie from being lowered into a vat of liquid hot metal. He apologises to his friends for ignoring them, and proposes to Rosie. At first, Rosie is angered by Keith's actions and refuses to forgive him (especially when Keith off-handedly confesses that Kelly Brook was the superior girlfriend), but she soon accepts both his apology and proposal, and with their relationship repaired, Keith, Rosie and Dougie leave the warehouse. During the end credits, Keith explains through a voice-over that he settled down and had a family with Rosie, and converted the Securipoles into water pumps for countries in the "[[Third World|Fourth World]]".

Keep Smiling (2012 film)
 A group of ten very different women are selected for the televised Georgian Mothers Contest, a thinly veiled beauty pageant incorporating a talent round, cooking skills, and even a bikini contest.  All are there with mixed agendas. Five of them, living in virtual poverty are eyeing the prize; USD$25,000 and a family apartment. Elene has been living in a hospital for many years with her family; the option of winning finally being a much needed way out. Feuding neighbours Inga and Gvantsa also are eager to escape their bare surroundings but for Gvantsa it's more of a chance to reignite her failed violinist career and leave behind the gossip of her past. Unfortunately, Gvantsa and fellow contestant Tamuna share a mutual friend that complicates rivalries even further.  Baya, a trophy wife, is the most glamorous of the contestants but also the most dubious entry, living in luxury with her adopted children almost as uninterested in the contest prize as Lizi, participating at the insistence of her mother who is determined to thrust her daughter into the limelight. The only thing they share in common is their reluctance and dismay at the tacky turns the contest takes as at what at first seems hopeful, gradually loses the glitter and the gold under the slow realization that the competition is an exploitative farce with its cold controlling director Otar keen to exploit anything that secures lucrative ratings. Tragic tales of war and poverty are woven in to entertain the audience using the very real tragedies that have befallen the contestants with also the paparazzi and sexual favors entering the mix as well. As conflicts heighten, the competition gradually turns sour behind the scenes with Otar eager to maintain complete control by bullying and humiliating anyone failing to fall in line.  With the stage set for the televised live grand finale, it's all big happy smiles and a chance to finally shine but none are prepared for the bizarre and tragic turns ahead as tensions finally reach breaking point while an eager all cheering audience bear witness.

Frightened, she runs away and goes home. Arriving home, Marvin shows her how to [[Hypnotism|hypnotize]] a chicken, wanting to show her with what is [[unconditional love]]. But Annie replies that the animals just love him because he gives them food.  The next day Annie returns to the well, bringing Esther sandwiches, [[Capri Sun]], toilet paper and a [[walkie-talkie]].

Killing Them Softly
 In the fall of 2008, during both the [[American financial crisis]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential election campaign]], an older man named Johnny "Squirrel" Amato plans to rob an illegal poker game. He enlists two younger men to do the robbery: Frankie, a former business associate, and Russell, a heroin-addicted Australian expatriate who is stealing purebred dogs for money. They decide to target a game run by Markie Trattman, who is known to have previously orchestrated an inside job by paying two men to rob his own illegal poker room. Squirrel anticipates that the Mafia will automatically blame Markie for the heist because of this, and that once they have their local enforcer Dillon kill him the matter will be considered closed.  Frankie and Russell, although obviously amateurs, do the holdup and leave with the money. Afterwards, an emissary for the Mob named Driver hires a  hitman and mob enforcer named Jackie Cogan to deal with the situation. Although Jackie correctly intuits that Markie was uninvolved in the recent heist, he believes Markie still needs to die in order to show people that the Mob will not tolerate their games' being robbed.  Upon completing the crime, Russell travels to Florida to sell the dogs. While in Florida, he inadvertently informs a man named Kenny Gill of his involvement in the heist while trying to recruit him as a drug dealer. Kenny informs Jackie, who deduces that Russell, Frankie, and Squirrel are the perpetrators.  Jackie carries out the hit on Markie himself but brings in another hitman named Mickey Fallon, who is on parole in New York, to kill Squirrel. Jackie explains to Driver how he prefers "killing them softly"—shooting his victims from a distance, without warning, giving them no opportunity to experience fear or despair—and that his acquaintance with Squirrel risks complicating this approach.  Mickey postpones going through with his assigned hit, and instead indulges in drunkenness and sex with prostitutes in a hotel room. During conversation with Jackie, Mickey reveals that he has violated his parole, and doesn't seem to either care about nor really comprehend the consequences; instead he goes off on drunken tangents. It becomes clear to Jackie that the respected hitman has lost his nerve and ability to do his job. Jackie eventually decides to carry out the hit on Squirrel himself. He convinces Driver to arrange Mickey's arrest before the job has been completed.  Russell is arrested on a drug possession charge and deported; meanwhile, Jackie confronts Frankie and convinces him to trade Squirrel's whereabouts for his life. Jackie has Frankie drive him to Squirrel; upon reaching Squirrel's apartment complex, he kills Squirrel with a shotgun. After confirming Squirrel is dead, Jackie has Frankie drive him to get his car several hours away. Frankie becomes very nervous and begins speeding. Unable to get Frankie to slow down, Jackie takes over driving. Once they arrive at the parking garage, Jackie shoots Frankie in the head without warning. Jackie then wipes down any fingerprints he might have left and leaves the scene.  On the night of the presidential election, Jackie meets with Driver to collect his fee for the three hits. On the TV in the bar, Barack Obama is giving his election victory speech. Jackie sees that he has been paid $30,000. He alleges that at $10,000 each, Driver has underpaid him for the jobs—on the argument that it would have cost $15,000 to have Mickey kill Squirrel. Driver responds that Dillon charges ten, and tells Jackie to take it up with Dillon. Jackie tells Driver that Dillon died that morning. Referring to Obama's speech, Jackie says angrily, "This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community? Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in America, you're on your own.

However, Swami was able to suffocate him before pushing him into the [[Yamuna]] river. The next day, the bodies of Kishore, Dr. Sudarshan, and Dr. Emma are all found in the river and riverside.

After Killjoy is summoned, the Bailiff appears and chokes Killjoy out. Killjoy wakes up in an [[electric chair]] and is [[torture]]d while being asked if he pleads innocent or guilty. Meanwhile, on Earth, it's been three years since the events of the previous film, and Sandie is still locked up in the [[Mental asylum|Essex County Mental Asylum]] and is still questioned by Detective Grimley and Detective Ericson about the missing bodies of Zilla, the Professor, Rojer and Erica. She only responds with laughter, and Dr. Simmons informs the detectives that her brain is always in the stage of laughter, and cannot figure out what is causing her to do this, but from the evidence in the Professor's house, and his relationship with Michael from the first film, Detective Ericson believes that the legend of Killjoy might be real after all. Meanwhile, the Bailiff takes Killjoy into an [[elevator]] down to [[Hell]], where the courtroom is under [[Beelzebub]]'s control. Killjoy is on trial for the crime of being too soft and not scary, as he let his last victim, Sandie, escape from his realm. The accuser is Jezabeth, the Devil's Advocate, who was once in a relationship with Killjoy a while ago before he dumped her.  Killjoy is found guilty and is stripped of his malice buffoon and his powers. In [[Dungeon|Hell Jail]], he meets Skid Mark, a human [[Evil clown|demonic clown]] who idolizes Killjoy, but has a secret agenda to take his position. He offers to become Killjoy's attorney, and with what little left of human blood he has left, conjures up Punchy, Freakshow who is missing his little brother, and Batty Boop, who still has a grudge at Killjoy for vaporizing her. She recognizes Skid Mark, but can't remember him. In the first court hearing, the trio are brought to the stands and questioned by Jezabeth, but everything goes to Hell as Punchy only speaks [[polari]], Freakshow's a mime, and Batty Boop gets Killjoy to apologize to her in front of everyone, not to mention Skid Mark's failure as an attorney. Because of this, nearly half of Killjoy's fifty-three names are crossed out by Scribe, the court's stenographer, which makes Killjoy weaker and erases them from existence. Back on earth, Detective Ericson and Dr. Simmons begin to notice that the Professor's evidence on Killjoy is disappearing, and they can't remember them either. They decide to meet up with Detective Grimley and Sandie back at the Asylum to discuss what's going on.  Meanwhile, in Hell, Punchy begins to organize a revolt against the court with the rest of the demonic clowns to help Killjoy, and Freakshow goes to the Old Hag's to find materials for a new bionic brother when he notices she has a magic mirror, but is only granted access to it unless he sleeps with her. He brings the materials back to Batty Boop, who conjoins him a new brother and tells her about the mirror, and Batty Boop decides to help Killjoy by entering the mirror to Earth and bringing Sandie to Hell prove Killjoy guilty. Batty tracks down Sandie's location and she and Freakshow enter the mirror and end up in the asylum, where Freakshow kills the Security Guard, Jim, and Batty kills Det. Grimley. Sandie tries to escape but Batty catches her and pushes her into the mirror. Dr. Simmons finds Jim dead along with Sandie's straight jacket and thinks she did it. Freakshow is about to kill Det. Ericson, but is summoned back to Hell, leaving Ericson behind scared and wounded. Back in Hell, Beelzebub takes Killjoy to the elevator and takes him to Oblivion, the Final Circle of Hell, an area of nothing, to show him where he'll be for the rest of eternity if he loses. He also leaves out a box on the desk in the courtroom for Killjoy, which he claims is insurance.  The next court hearing, Killjoy fires Skid Mark out of anger and decides to represent himself. Batty brings Sandie to the stands, in clown mode, and Sandie recaps the events to Jezabeth. Killjoy asks Sandie how she felt afterwards, and goes into vivid detail on what Killjoy did, convincing Beelzebub that he is in fact evil. The only thing left to convince him is the Trial of Combat, where Killjoy has to fight to the death with an opponent, which is Skid Mark. Batty Boop recognizes Skid Mark as one of her victims, who roofied her and raped her, leaving behind only one 'love bite' on him: an infection. Skid Mark turns into a monster, and claims whoever wins gets to keep Batty. An unnamed Clown Observer hands Killjoy a bag of tricks, compliments of Punchy and the clowns, which is ineffective. Batty tells Sandie if Killjoy loses, she won't be able to get out of Hell, so Sandie hands Killjoy his malice and crushes Skid Mark's head off. The Clowns revolt in the courtroom, where Batty kills Jezabeth and Punchy kills Bailiff. Beelzebub, in a fit of anger, incinerates everyone but Punchy, Freakshow, Sandie, Batty and Killjoy before disappearing. Killjoy opens the box, and presses a button, which will [[self-destruct]] Hell in a minute. The group escapes in the elevator up to Earth, where the clown posse pursue Sandie in the streets.

 The film is the dramatized story of Thor Heyerdahl and his [[Kon-Tiki]] expedition of 1947.  While the prevailing theories of the time held that Polynesia had been settled by peoples [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|migrating from the west]], Heyerdahl, an experimental [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] and adventurer, sets out to prove his theory that people from South America settled the islands in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] times.  Noting similarities between statues found in South America and the Polynesian [[moai]], Heyerdahl's theory about the origin of the Polynesian people is bolstered by Polynesian folklore that tells of an ancient tribe called the [[Hanau epe]] that are said to have once inhabited [[Easter Island]]. While most experts hold that such a voyage across the vast ocean is unlikely to have ever been successful, in order to illustrate that there were no technological limitations that would have inhibited the ancient peoples from making the journey, Heyerdahl puts his theory to the test and builds a [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsawood]] raft using the same techniques that would have been utilized 1,500 years ago by the indigenous peoples of the region. Though he himself cannot swim or sail, he sets out on the treacherous 4,300 [[nautical mile]]–journey across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] from Peru to Polynesia aboard the small raft, along with his crew of five men (and a [[blue-and-yellow macaw|macaw]] named Lorita).  During the three months aboard the primitive vessel named after Inca god of sun and storm, [[Viracocha|Kon-Tiki]], the crew's scientific reenactment of the legendary voyage from the coast of Peru to the Polynesian islands is met with setbacks in the form of storms, sharks, and other perils of the open sea.

Lesson of the Evil
 An English teacher named Seiji Hasumi ([[Hideaki Itō]]) is loved by his students and respected by his peers. He graduates from [[Harvard University]] with an MBA, and works at Morgenstern, a European investment bank, for two years. Hasumi returns to Japan to pursue high school teaching. However, his [[outward charm]] masks his true nature. In reality, Hasumi is a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] who is unable to feel [[empathy]] for other human beings. Specifically, he has a severe [[antisocial personality disorder]]. Having killed both of his parents and his former tutor at the age of fourteen, Hasumi turns into a fiendishly clever killer. During his time in the States, Hasumi meets a partner in crime, an American named Dave, who thinks he shares the same "hobby" as Hasumi – killing people for fun. The two can be seen carrying buckets full of human blood, bones, and organs somewhere, giving off the notion that they committed numerous murders while working together. Hasumi eventually kills his partner by knocking him out and burning him alive inside a barrel, stating that while Dave enjoys killing for fun, Hasumi does not.  Back in Japan, Hasumi chooses to deal with problems like bullying and student sexual harassment, starting by dealing with the school cheating issue. Upon collecting all of the students' cell phones prior to their exams, Hasumi secretly uses a [[cell phone jammer]] to completely prevent any cheating during the test. The group of students that had cheated on previous exams became suspicious after none of the group's cell phones have service during the test and immediately suspect the adviser of the Radio Club, Tsurii – a loner [[physics]] teacher. They are then confronted by Tsurii himself who clarifies that he was not responsible for the jamming. A man who regularly meets with the school to complain about students bullying his daughter, Rina, is murdered. Someone has replaced the bottles of water he kept around his house to scare off cats with kerosene, as the man is a [[chainsmoker]] the bottles soon catch fire and explode. Tsurii soon meets with the intelligent ringleader of the cheating group, Keisuke, revealing his suspicions of Hasumi. Tsurii explains he has dug into Hasumi's past and found strange details, such as at another school where Hasumi started his teaching career that later had four student suicides. During this time, however, Hasumi had bugged the room and learned of Tsurii's suspicion, and confronts him on a train, murdering him and making his death appear as a [[hanging suicide]]. Hasumi then confronts Keisuke after the announcement of Tsurii's suicide causes him to panic. Hasumi knocks Keisuke out and ties him up until the end of school, after which Hasumi tortures him into admitting that he and his friends were indeed cheating. Hasumi checks that Keisuke didn't tell others of Tsurii's suspicions, before killing him and hiding his body.  During the same time period, Hasumi is brought to the attention of a [[blackmail]] case from one of his students. A store owner, Meka, caught a female student, Miya, shoplifting but swears not to charge her for it. However, PE teacher Shibahara blackmails Miya, as he has recorded her admission of shoplifting, into giving him sexual favors or risk being charged. Hasumi, assures Miya that a blackmail and [[statutory rape]] case is more serious than shoplifting and affirms to her that she is safe from the law and no longer needs to succumb to the blackmail. Miya later meets Hasumi on the school roof, she thanks him with a hug that advances into a kiss and the two become lovers. In the meantime, Hasumi finds out about art teacher Kume's sexual relationship with a male student; he blackmails Kume into lending him his luxury apartment. Hasumi later takes Miya to the apartment and the two have sex. Hasumi presses Miya into giving him access to an online private discussion board that his students use, anonymously making claims about the murder of Rina's father, accusing delinquent student Tadenuma, who had targeted Rina online previously. After a fight breaks out at the school, Hasumi invites Tadenuma out for a drink and murders him; the students later assume that Tadenuma ran away from home.  Events have passed until Hasumi's homeroom students are staying overnight in the school, preparing an elaborate [[haunted house]] for the school cultural festival. Hasumi lures Miya to the rooftop, knocking her out and throwing her off the roof to fake her suicide; as she had grown suspicious of Tadenuma's disappearance. When another student comes to the roof looking for Miya, she finds the suicide note forged by Hasumi; he quickly kills her too. As Hasumi has no method of masking his murder of the second student, he quickly comes up with a plan. Hasumi decides to start a [[school massacre]] of his students for which he will frame Kume, who frequents a shooting range, by wearing his shoes throughout the killings. Throughout the massacre, Hasumi's shotgun can be seen possessed by ex-partner in crime Dave, talking to him. As the students hear the bangs of the shotgun, Hasumi tricks most of the students by using the intercom to warn them of "an intruder with a shotgun" and orders the students to proceed to the roof - which he had locked access to beforehand - and wait until help arrives. With some of the students proceeding to the stairs to the roof, another group hide inside the art room, closing it off with fire shutters and barricading the entry points. One of the students, skilled [[Archery|archer]] Kakeru, manages to escape the school far enough with his archery gear to find a man who is able to call the police. He later runs back to the school to rescue his crush Satomi, who is found trying to escape by roping out of a window of the art room and slips, breaking her ankles. Kakeru screams out her name, alerting Hasumi to their presence, who then proceeds to aim out of a window at the two students. The Kakeru readies an arrow and fires at Hasumi, but Hasumi fires as well, deflecting the arrow off-course, slaying Kakeru, and then Satomi. With the group of students still in the art room thinking they are safe, they are unaware that they did not untie the rope that Satomi had used to rappel down out of. Hasumi climbs the rope and proceeds to slay the group.  The massacre nears its end with two students who survive by dressing up two of their dead peers in their clothing and hiding inside the school as they toss the corpses down an emergency escape chute, tricking Hasumi into thinking the bodies are the last two students on his checklist attempting to escape. After the massacre at the school, Hasumi attempts to cover up his actions by making it seem like he had been handcuffed and knocked out by Kume and making it look like he committed suicide afterwards with Hasumi's shotgun, but his plans are foiled due to one of the two surviving students pointing out to the police that the school's training [[defibrillator]] records audio and contains evidence of one of the murdered students speaking his murderer's name prior to being slain by Hasumi. However, Hasumi plans to use his recently learned knowledge of [[Norse mythology]] as his legal defence by suggesting his acts to be "the will of God." The surviving student who pointed out the defibrillator exclaims that Hasumi is crazy, but the other surviving student says Hasumi is "starting the next game." It is then revealed that Miya survived after Hasumi tossed her off the school's roof and calls out Hasumi's name, ending the movie with "[[to be continued]]."

The Legend of Mor'du
 The story begins with the witch inviting a guest into her cottage. Her crow assumes the guest wants the bear spell, so she tells the story of a man who became the demon bear Mor'du. The man had been the eldest of four sons of a wise and much-beloved king in an ancient kingdom, each of whom had his own gift. Of the younger three, the youngest was wise, the third was compassionate, and the second was just. The king's eldest was strong, but he mistook strength for character. When the king died one autumn, rather than giving the eldest all the inheritance, he divided the kingdom among all of his sons equally, believing their gifts combined would form the pillars on which the peace of an even greater kingdom rested. However, feeling disgraced and filled with greed and arrogance, the eldest son refused to accept this, proving his claim as the sole heir in front of his brothers by using one of his axes to break his image away from their family stone. His words turned to war, forever changing the kingdom's fate.  Even though the prince had a powerful army under his command, the brothers constantly fought to a stalemate. In looking for a way to change his fate, the prince came across a menhir ring within the woods. From there, the will-o'-the-wisps guided him to the edge of a dark loch, the witch's cottage standing far from the shore. Hoping to turn the tide of the war to his favor, the prince persuaded the witch to make a spell that would give him the strength of ten men by offering her his signet ring, and she gave him the spell in a drinking horn but, having seen darkness in his heart, warns him of making a choice: either to fulfill his dark wish or heal the family bonds he had broken. When the prince brought his brothers before him by staging up a false truce, he again claimed his kingdom. When his brothers protested, the prince in response drank the spell, which immediately took effect, giving him strength tenfold but to his surprise, in the form of a great black bear. While he would have broken the spell if he chose to "mend the bond torn by pride", the prince instead accepted his new form and [[Fratricide|brought his brothers down]]. He then tried to get his army to rule the kingdom, but they saw him as a wild beast and turned against him. Enraged, he attacked his former men, slaying a great many. The few survivors of the fractured armies of the brothers fled the kingdom in terror, leading to its collapse. Doomed to this bestial form in desiring power over the bonds of family, the prince -now known as the "Great Black", "Mor'du"- wandered the land endlessly, killing and instilling terror wherever he roamed, his once human consciousness and intelligence now overwritten by animalistic bloodlust.  The witch ends the story here, and she offers the spell in the form of a cake to the guest, who turns out to be Wee Dingwall. He panics, says he only stopped by for water, and runs out of the cottage.

Life Is Beautiful (2012 film)
 Srinu ([[Abijeet Duddala|Abhijeet Duddala]]) is a college student who has two sisters, Satya (Rashmi Shastry) and Chinni (Kavya). Srinu’s widowed mother ([[Amala (actress)|Amala]]) asks her children to move to their uncle’s house in Hyderabad as she got a job transfer. Amma promises to Chinni that she will return in exactly one year. The area in which Srinu’s uncle lives is divided into two areas: the luxurious Gold-phase and the lower class B-phase. Srinu’s uncle lives in B-phase along with Srinu’s Aunt, brother-in-law and sister-in-law, grandfather and grandmother.  B-phase is filled with love and humble people including Nagaraj (Sudhakar Komakula), the B-phase “gang” leader, Abhi (Kaushik Darbha), the small-sized geek, Lakshmi (Zara Shah), who is new to B-phase, and Paddu (Gurshagun Kaur), who is also Srinu’s 2nd-cousin. Paddu’s parents, however, are wealthy and her mother ([[Surekha Vani]]) is arrogant. Nagaraj’s father is frustrated with his son as he has no job and always roams around B-phase. Gold-phase is filled with arrogant rich people who have no compassion towards the lower class B-phase. Some of them are Rakesh (Naveen Polisetty), Gold-phase “gang” leader, short tempered Suresh (Sanjeev), and Ajay ([[Vijay Deverakonda|Vijay Devarakonda]]). Paru ([[Shriya Saran]]), the belle and Suresh’s girlfriend, is also part of Gold-phase, but unlike her neighbors, she is sympathetic towards B-phase.  Srinu soon faces the Gold-phase rogues and gets into a brawl with them. At this juncture, it is revealed that Abhi is attracted to Paru, which angers Suresh. Chinni and her grandfather are insulted when a prestigious private school denies Chinni admission, citing her inability to speak English. Her grandfather challenges the school officials and motivates Chinni to learn English. Over time, Srinu and Paddu get close while Nagaraj tries to get close to Lakshmi.  Meanwhile, Maya madam ([[Anjala Zaveri]]), the B-phase belle, is being harassed by an anonymous caller. Srinu, Nagaraj, and Abhi find out who he is and catch him. After Maya madam beats the caller, he reveals that he is from Gold-phase. At this juncture, Maya madam thanks the boys and acquaints with them. Meanwhile, the caller brings the Gold-phase gang along and a fight starts, which Maya madam breaks up.  Annoyed with Maya madam, the Gold-phase gang tries to get pictures of her in the bathroom with a camera fitted toy drone but fail to do so. However, while fiddling around with it, they discover Srinu’s brother-in-law, Ashok, and Rakesh’s sister, Sony (Srimukhi), together. They confront the B-phase gang about it and warn them to get Ashok to back-off. However, Ashok brings Sony to his house, intending to marry her. The next morning, Rakesh, his father, and the Gold-phase gang come with the police to Ashok’s house to have Ashok arrested. But Srinu’s uncle (Ashok’s father), who is a lawyer, settles the matter citing Sony’s consent.  Despite the struggle, Ashok’s and Sony’s marriage is conducted in a simple manner at Ashok’s house. From Gold-phase, only Paru shows up to the marriage reception and becomes acquainted with Abhi, which annoys Suresh. She also reveals that she is competing in the Miss India contest. At the reception, Ajay, who came with Suresh and Paru, sees Lakshmi and is immediately attracted to her. Ajay offers Lakshmi a job through Nagaraj, which she accepts as she needs money to pay for her engineering entrance exams. In order to provide a room for the married couple, Srinu is asked to move to Paddu’s family’s outhouse, which helps Srinu and Paddu spend more time together. Angry at Ashok’s and Sony’s marriage, Rakesh vows to retaliate.  Meanwhile, the parents of Gold-phase rogues plan to usurp the local lake, which geographically belongs to B-phase, after finding out that B-phase people have been using the lake, which connects B-phase to Gold-phase, to sneak into Gold-phase. Rakesh starts retaliating by temporarily cutting power supply and water supply to B-phase. This only brings the B-phase families closer, as the families start sharing food and water and spend more time with each other.  Meanwhile, Abhi’s dog wanders off into Gold-phase as it is attracted to Paru’s dog. The Gold-phase rogues trap Abhi’s dog and unleash their dogs onto Abhi’s dog. When Srinu and Abhi go to retrieve Abhi’s dog they are beaten up by the Gold-phase rogues. This again turns in B-phase’s favor when Paru visits Abhi to apologize. Paru also asks Abhi to teach her magic so that she can it show off as her talent at the Miss India prelims. Jealous over Paru’s closeness with Abhi, Suresh talks to Rakesh, who then starts his next revenge.  Rakesh reveals to Paru’s parents about her closeness with Abhi. Eventually things get worse when one of Satya’s classmates, Manish (Charan Akula), makes a move on her and gives her a phone, seemingly planned by Rakesh. Ajay also starts moving closer with Lakshmi, which troubles Nagaraj. Chinni starts showing signs of missing her mother. When Gold-phase starts taking over the lake, B-phase manages to get a stay order through Srinu’s uncle. Following this, Srinu states that Gold-phase is harassing them only because they appear vulnerable. Srinu proposes that they compete in every way possible with Gold-phase and the friends decide that Paddu will participate in the Miss India prelims.  Paddu’s mother, who is keeping a close watch over her after finding about her closeness with Srinu, initially refuses to let her participate but agrees when Paddu agrees to see prospective grooms. Srinu finds about this and, distraught, distances himself from Paddu, which troubles Paddu. Nagaraj is also frustrated that Ajay is moving closer to Lakshmi. He also attempts to learn English through Chinni.  Paru invites Abhi to the beauty contest and during the journey, Paru and Abhi share each other’s feelings. The rest of the B-phase friends also go to the contest as Paddu’s guests. At the contest, Paddu feels overwhelmed and leaves the contest. She confides in Srinu that she is sad because he has been ignoring her and proposes to him, which he accepts. Paru inadvertently reveals her feelings for Abhi through one of her magic acts in front of everyone and goes on to win the prelims.  While returning, Suresh and Rakesh confront Paru about her feelings for Abhi and state that rich should only use the poor and not acquaint with them. Disgusted, Paru leaves them and returns along with the B-phase friends. However, upon returning, Paru’s father asks her not to see Abhi anymore and she reluctantly obeys.  Later, Nagaraj proposes to Lakshmi but she refuses saying that he is unambitious and irresponsible while she aspires to become an engineer. She again starts addressing Nagaraj formally in order to suppress his feelings for her. Dejected, Nagaraj confides in Srinu and Abhi. Abhi also explains that Paru has not been in contact for a while and convinces Srinu and Nagaraj to help him talk to Paru. That night the trio sneaks over to Gold-phase and Abhi manages to talk to Paru. She explains that she is not confident enough to spend a lifetime with him and is not ready to marry him. But when Abhi asks if her affection towards Abhi was just a Gold-phase plan to hurt Abhi, she slaps him, indicating that she truly loved him.  Tensions between the two areas worsen on Lakshmi’s birthday when Ajay proposes to Lakshmi and accidentally hurts her when she refuses. Furious, Nagaraj starts to beat up Ajay when everyone in the Gold-phase gang and the B-phase gang get involved. The police arrive and break up the fight. Rakesh files an attempt to murder case on Nagaraj, Srinu, and Abhi and bribes the police. However, Maya madam comes to their rescue with Lakshmi and files an attempt to rape case on Ajay. The police convince Rakesh to drop the charges in order to keep everyone out of trouble.  While returning home, Srinu inquires Lakshmi about Satya, who apparently said was going to Lakshmi’s birthday party. When Lakshmi denies any knowledge Srinu asks Paddu to check on Satya. Paddu confirms Satya is home safe. While a confused Srinu is talking to Paddu about why Satya would lie to him, Paddu’s mother discovers them and furiously throws Srinu out of her house. As Srinu returns to his uncle’s house, he finds Satya talking on the phone with Manish.  The next morning, Srinu, along with Nagaraj, Abhi, and the rest of the B-phase gang, confront Manish and beat him up. Satya intervenes and sends Manish away. In a heated argument with Srinu, she confesses that she doesn’t want to continue her studies as she feels overwhelmed. After Abhi escorts Satya away, Srinu confides in his uncle about everything that has happened and decides to visit Amma to tell her about everything that’s been going on.  Srinu, his uncle, Satya, Abhi, and Nagaraj leave in Nagaraj’s dad’s car to visit Amma. Srinu’s uncle takes them to a hospital where they find out that Amma has cancer. Doctors inform them that Amma stopped her treatment worried that the expenditure will eat into the money saved for her children’s studies but that the treatment could cure Amma. The group decides not to tell Amma of the events and leave after having an emotional talk with Amma.  Upon returning, Srinu and Satya hide the truth from Chinni and focus on their education. Abhi’s love towards his mother grows and he lets her pinch his cheeks (which he actually hates). Nagaraj’s father, however, is angry that Nagaraj took his car without telling him, which has left him without any earnings (as he uses it as a taxi), and kicks Nagaraj out of the house, and gives him an ultimatum to return only if he finds a way of earning money. Nagaraj has always been interested in starting his own small business, which proves difficult as he can’t figure out what he should do and can do.  Paddu’s and Srinu’s relationship seems to be falling apart as Srinu wants to focus more on his education and his sisters. Nagaraj also has been distancing himself from Lakshmi, which is difficult for her to cope with.

Life of Pi (film)
 In Canada, novelist [[Yann Martel]] meets Pi Patel; Martel has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells his story to Yann:  Pi's father names him Piscine Molitor after [[Piscine Molitor|the swimming pool in France]]. In secondary school in [[Pondicherry]], he adopts the name "[[Pi]]" (the Greek letter, ) to avoid the [[Homophone|sound-alike]] nickname "Pissing Patel". He is raised in a [[Hindu]] family, but at 12 years old, is introduced to [[Catholic Christianity|Christianity]] and then [[Islam]], and decides to follow all three religions as he "just wants to love God". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi's family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a [[Bengal tiger]] named [[Life of Pi#Richard Parker|Richard Parker]]. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.  When Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship [[Shipwrecking|founders]] while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. A freed [[zebra]] jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the [[Mariana Trench]] drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.  After the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra, and is joined by a resourceful [[orangutan]]. A [[spotted hyena]] emerges from under a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.  Pi fashions a small tethered raft from flotation vests which he retreats to for safety from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger as well. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then comes threateningly towards Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a [[humpback whale]] breaches near the boat, destroying the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is also helping keep himself alive.  Weeks later they encounter a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, fresh water pools and a large population of [[meerkat]]s, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn [[acidic]], digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is [[carnivorous]] after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.  Pi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching the coast of [[Mexico]]. Pi is saddened that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. He is rescued and brought to a hospital. [[Insurance agent]]s for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by human survivors: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutish cook for the hyena. In this story, the cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He also kills Pi's mother after which Pi kills him with a knife and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but they leave without questioning Pi further.  Yann recognizes the parallels between the two stories, noting that in the second one, Pi fills the role of the tiger. Pi asks which story the writer prefers, and Yann chooses the first, to which Pi replies, "and so it goes with God". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, Yann sees that the agents also chose the first story.  
Lincoln (film)
   In January 1865, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] expects the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to end soon, with the defeat of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]. He is concerned that his 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] may be discarded by the courts after the war, and the proposed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] will be defeated by the returning [[slave states]]. He feels it imperative to pass the amendment beforehand, to remove any possibility that freed slaves might be re-enslaved.  The [[Radical Republicans]] fear the amendment will be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; support from Republicans in the border states is not yet assured.  The amendment also requires the support of several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressmen to pass. With dozens of Democrats being [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]s after losing their [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1864|re-election campaigns in the fall of 1864]], some of Lincoln's advisors believe he should wait for a new Republican-heavy [[38th United States Congress|Congress]]. Lincoln remains adamant about having the amendment in place before the war is concluded and the southern states readmitted.  Lincoln's hopes rely upon the support of [[Francis Preston Blair]], a founder of the Republican Party whose influence could win over members of the western and border state conservative faction. With Union victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] highly likely, but not yet secured, and with two sons serving in the Union Army, Blair is keen to end hostilities. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him immediately to engage the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government in peace negotiations. Yet Lincoln knows that significant support for the amendment comes from Radical Republicans, for whom negotiated peace is unacceptable.  Unable to proceed without Blair's support, Lincoln reluctantly authorizes Blair's mission.  In the meantime, Lincoln and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] work to secure Democratic votes for the amendment. Lincoln suggests they concentrate on the lame duck Democrats, as they will feel freer to vote as they choose, and will also soon need employment; Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term. Though Lincoln and Seward are unwilling to offer monetary [[bribe]]s to the Democrats, they authorize agents to contact Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their support.  At a key moment in the debate, racial-equality advocate [[Thaddeus Stevens]] agrees to moderate his position and argue that the amendment represents only ''legal'' equality, not a declaration of ''actual'' equality. Meanwhile, Confederate envoys are ready to meet with Lincoln to discuss terms for peace, but he instructs they be kept out of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor. Rumor of their mission circulates, prompting both Democrats and conservative Republicans to advocate postponing the vote. But in a carefully worded statement, Lincoln denies there are envoys ''in Washington'', and the vote proceeds, passing by a margin of just two votes. Black visitors to the gallery celebrate, and Stevens returns home to [[Lydia Hamilton Smith|his "housekeeper" and lover]], a black woman.  When Lincoln [[Hampton Roads Conference|meets with the Confederates]], he tells them slavery cannot be restored, as the North is united for ratification of the amendment, and several of the southern states' reconstructed legislatures would also vote to ratify. On April 3, Lincoln visits [[Petersburg National Battlefield|the battlefield]] at [[Petersburg, Virginia]], where he exchanges a few words with Lieutenant General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Six days later, Grant receives General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Courthouse]].  On April 14, Lincoln is meeting members of his cabinet to discuss future measures to [[enfranchisement|enfranchise]] blacks, when he is reminded that First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] is waiting to take them to [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|their evening at Ford's Theatre]]. That night, while Lincoln's son [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]] is watching ''[[Aladdin|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' at [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Grover's Theatre]], the manager suddenly stops the play to announce that the President has been shot. The next morning Lincoln dies; [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]] declares, "Now he belongs to the ages".

Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and [[espionage]]. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary ''MS One'', where prisoners are kept in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] for the length of their sentence. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden.  Meanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on ''MS One'' to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop [[mental instability]]. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a [[siege]]. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on ''MS One'' and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but it goes bad and Snow is forced to infiltrate ''MS One''. Alex realizes that Emilie is the President's daughter and secures her, but she escapes with her bodyguard Hock and they hide in a secure room. A problem with the [[oxygen]] supply brings Hock to sacrifice his life by [[suicide]] in order to stop himself from using up oxygen so as to buy Emilie more time.  Snow breaks into the secure room and rescues Emilie after administering first aid for her wounds. Snow then changes Emilie's hair & clothing to conceal her gender, allowing them to walk through the prison population without being noticed.

With no one at the helm, the prison falls out of orbit and crashes into the [[International Space Station]]. The collision causes a hull breach, killing Mace. Snow brings Emilie to the escape pod, but discovers it has only one seat.

Snow and Emilie discover evidence that the prisoners were being illegally used as test subjects. Alex finds and captures Emilie; he also shoots Snow, leaving him for dead. Alex learns that Hydell has killed all of the hostages; he contacts the President, threatening to let Hydell and the prisoners [[rape]] Emilie if they are not released. The President refuses to allow a siege and risk Emilie, causing Langral to temporarily relieve him of his command. Langral orders the destruction of ''MS One''. Hydell tries to rape Emilie as promised, but is stopped by Alex. Hydell and Alex fight, resulting in Alex's death. Hydell then tries to stab Emilie, but Snow arrives and knocks him out. Snow and Emilie flee from Hydell and the remaining prisoners. Meanwhile, Langral's men plant a bomb on the prison. Snow and Emilie use space suits and jump from ''MS One'' as it detonates. Using their suits, Snow and Emilie re-enter Earth's atmosphere and land safely in [[New York City]], where Snow is arrested.  Emilie later realizes that Mace's incoherent rambling was actually a code revealing the location of Frank's briefcase. Snow gives the briefcase to Shaw, who unlocks it but is shocked to find it empty. Snow notes that he had not given Shaw the unlocking code, and Shaw is revealed to be the mole and arrested. Snow is released and his possessions returned, including a lighter given to him by Frank before his death. Examining the lighter, Snow finds a [[memory card]] containing the real secret information hidden inside. Emilie meets Snow and teases him after discovering his first name is Marion; the pair walk away together.  
Lobos de Arga
 In 1910, in Arga, a small village from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the Mariño family are [[curse]]d by a [[gypsy (term)|gypsy]] woman as punishment for the excesses of the Marquise de Mariño. Upon reaching the age of ten, her son becomes a [[werewolf]].  A hundred years later, Tomás ([[Gorka Otxoa]]), a struggling novelist and the last descendent of the Mariño family, returns to the village on invitation from its mayor to both participate in a ceremony and to seek inspiration within his childhood home: a large and abandoned mansion.  In his exploration of the village on the days that follow, he reunites with his childhood friend Calisto ([[Carlos Areces]]) and with his uncle Evaristo ([[Manuel Manquiña]]), the latter of whom has been elected both the town's priest and mayor.  Despite being touted as the guest of honor, Tomás feels concerned over the fact that he is virtually unknown among the locals.  Further adding to his dismay is the sudden appearance of Mario ([[Secun de la Rosa]]), his shady publisher on the run from the law.  On the night of the ceremony, Tomás and Mario are brutally abducted by the villagers and taken to an reinforced barn on the village's outskirts.  There, upon cryptic prophecies told by Evaristo, the both of them are dropped into a dark labyrinth beneath the village.  In their search for a way out, they inadvertently awaken the werewolf of legend, who proceeds to give chase.  Meanwhile, Calisto locates a secret way to the labyrinth and pulls Tomás and Mario out, leaving the werewolf behind.  The group takes shelter into Calisto's house, and he goes on to explain that the village was seeking to end a century-old curse by feeding a descendant of the Mariño family, lest another greater curse take effect.  Furthermore, the villagers have blocked the ways out of the town and disabled Tomás car.  Tomás attempts to call his grandmother for help but his cellphone's reception is too poor for his pleas to go through, and the call drops after a short time.  Under suspicion from the village and in light of gruesome deaths having happened the night before, Calisto is sent down into the labyrinth to kill the werewolf as the curse is presumed to have remained in effect.  Instead, he finds a young boy, whom he covertly takes into his home.  Hoping to end the curse, he and Mario feed one of Tomás fingers to the presumed wolf-child.  The group wanders out at sundown to escape the village by foot, but are caught by Evaristo and his mob.  As the confrontation escalates, the sun sets and the second curse takes effect, transforming all the villagers into werewolves - except for Calisto whom despite being a local, was actually born outside of the village.  Tomás grandmother, Rosa ([[Mabel Rivera]]), arrives at the same moment, taking the group into her car and escaping to the family mansion.  Meanwhile, two policemen arrive into the village upon a tip from Rosa, suspicious after Tomás' earlier call.  While one of them panics and runs to his death, the other ([[Luis Zahera]]) escapes by shooting himself in the head.  Tomás and the group are forced to leave the mansion after the werewolves invade it, but are rescued by the policeman revealed to have faked his suicide by letting the bullet only graze his scalp.  Retreating to the village's church, they fend off another werewolf attack at the cost of Rosa's death, narrowly escaping into the underground labyrinths before destroying the church and most of the werewolves with a stack of dynamite.  As they take their distance from the village center, the child's age briskly catches up with him, and he dies after turning into an old man before Tomás' eyes.  The church's explosion and Luis' lack of radio response has attracted the police's attention, and rescue teams arrive at daybreak to find the mass of dead werewolves.  Suspicious that Calisto and Mario might have been bitten by the werewolves and infected, Tomás' chains them to a piece of furniture in his home and stands guard with a shotgun in case they turn.  Unexpectedly however, it is Tomás who transforms, and the film ends as he prepares to take revenge on the two for his missing fingers.

Since future [[tracking system]]s have made it near-impossible to dispose of bodies, the syndicate uses [[time travel]], invented thirty years later and outlawed instantly. Managed by a future man named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of face-concealed victims, and are paid with [[Silver as an investment|silver bars]] strapped to the target. To prevent connections to the syndicate, a looper's final victim will be their retired future self (identified by [[gold bar]]s strapped to them instead of silver), ending the contract and "closing the loop".  Joe's friend Seth, part of a minority that manifest low-level [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] (or TK), confides that his old self has escaped, after warning him of a person in the future called the Rainmaker who will overthrow the five major [[Boss (crime)|bosses]] and close all loops. Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment's floor safe, but is taken to Abe by Kid Blue, one of Abe's elite "Gat Men". Joe reveals Seth's location instead of forfeiting half his silver and Abe's men cut an address into younger Seth's arm, then begin severing body parts.

Kid Blue and several other Gat Men arrive at the diner and a gunfight ensues. Young Joe collects a corner of Old Joe's map as both escape.  Young Joe follows the map to a farm where a woman Sara and her son Cid live. Sara recognizes a number on the map as Cid's birthday and hospital code. Young Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three children born on the same day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker, so he stays at the farm to wait for Old Joe.  Jesse, another Gat Man, comes looking for both Joes at the farm, but Cid and Young Joe hide in an underground tunnel. Later that night, Sara and Young Joe have sex and Sara reveals she has TK powers. Cid's powers are revealed to be even stronger, with Sara hiding in a safe when he has a tantrum. In the morning, Young Joe wakes to find Jesse holding Sara at gunpoint in the living room. Frightened, Cid falls down the stairs and telekinetically kills Jesse. Young Joe realizes that Cid is the Rainmaker and that Old Joe will know this from his memories.  Kid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe. Old Joe breaks free and kills Abe and his henchmen, then travels to Sara's farm. While Young Joe kills Kid Blue, Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid. Cid's face is grazed by a bullet and he creates a telekinetic blast, but is calmed by Sara before he can kill them. Telling Cid to run into the cane field, Sara stands between Old Joe and her son. Realizing that Sara's death will turn Cid into the Rainmaker, Young Joe [[Suicide|commits suicide]], erasing Old Joe's existence, saving Sara and preventing Cid from becoming the Rainmaker.

Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his next trip, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled [[oxygen]] ("fresh air") to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that trees produce oxygen free of charge, and therefore, he considers them and/or people talking about them to be a threat to his business. After revealing that he has "security camera eyes" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight with his grandmother's encouragement and learns more of the trees' history.  Over Ted's various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business. The Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula tree in a lush Truffula tree forest valley. The Lorax urges the Once-ler to leave the forest, but the Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts. Then, the young businessman's Thneed invention becomes a major success and the Once-ler's family arrives to participate in the business. At first keeping his promise, the Once-ler continues Thneed production by harvesting the Truffula tree tufts in a slow, but sustainable manner. However, his greedy and lazy relatives soon convince him to resume chopping down the trees. Overtime, the Once-ler's deforestation spirals into a mass overproduction. Flushed with wealth, the Once-ler rationalizes his short-sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness, and the Lorax's helpless protests do not stop him. The Once-ler pollutes the sky, river, and landscape, until the very last Truffula tree falls. With no further chance of business, he is left broken and his money-broke mother disowns him. With the region uninhabitable because of the pollution and deforestation from the Once-ler's business, the Lorax sends the animals off to find a new place to live before the Once-ler sees him depart into the sky, leaving only a stone-cut word: "Unless". Distraught and ruined, the Once-ler becomes a [[recluse]].  After he finishes telling his story, the Once-ler finally understands the meaning behind the Lorax's last message, and gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes that he can use it to regrow the forest and make others care about real trees once more. Ted's desire to impress Audrey therefore becomes a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. O'Hare, still determined not to have trees undercut his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audrey's nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler, and forcibly searching Ted's room for the seed, which has begun to grow after coming into contact with some water from Ted's falling bottle. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed. O'Hare and his two henchmen pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. When Ted finally attempts to plant the seed, he is interrupted by O'Hare, who rallies the population to stop them by telling the people that trees are extremely dangerous and filthy. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the [[Wall|city wall]] to reveal the environmental destruction outside, thereby showing them what O'Hare is encouraging. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Ted's conviction (as though a part of the Lorax is within him), the crowd turns against O'Hare when they discover his true nature, with his own henchmen expelling him from the town with his [[jet pack]]-like helmet, and the seed is finally planted. Time passes and the land starts to recover; new trees sprout, the animals begin to return, and the redeemed, now-mustached Once-ler happily reunites with the Lorax.  
The Lords of Salem (film)
 In [[Salem, Massachusetts]], Heidi ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]), a recovering drug addict, works as a [[DJ]] at a hard rock station with her co-workers Whitey ([[Jeff Daniel Phillips]]) and Herman ([[Ken Foree]]). She receives a strange wooden box containing an album by a band named The Lords. At her home, a downtown apartment house, she and Whitey listen to the record, which is a series of string and woodwind instruments playing several notes, then repeating itself. Heidi has a vision of women who worship [[Satan]], at an unspecified time in the past, ritually birthing a baby then damning the child. The vision stops once Whitey turns the record off.  The next day, Heidi interviews Francis Matthias ([[Bruce Davison]]), who has written a book about the [[Salem witch trials]]. The station then plays the Lords' record, which causes all of the women in Salem (other than Heidi) to enter a trance. After the show is over, Matthias tells his wife ([[María Conchita Alonso]]) that the band's name, The Lords, bothers him. That night, Heidi's landlord, Lacy ([[Judy Geeson]]), insists that Heidi split a bottle of wine with her and her sisters, Sonny ([[Dee Wallace]]) and Megan ([[Patricia Quinn]]). Megan, a palm reader, tells Heidi that she is fated to succumb to her dark sexual desires: "the only reason you exist". Disturbed, Heidi leaves the party. Later, Heidi notices her dog is acting strangely. She enters the supposedly vacant Apartment 5 and experiences visions of a demon and a nude witch that demands that she "bleed us a king". Heidi wakes up in bed and assumes the events in Apartment 5 were a vivid nightmare.  Troubled, Heidi visits a church and falls asleep, dreaming that she is sexually assaulted by the priest present. Heidi flees the church but is faced with a ghostly entity who tells her that he has been waiting for her. Meanwhile, Matthias researches the Lords. He discovers some music in a book and, after asking his wife to play the notes on their piano, confirms that it is the same music heard on the record. Matthias tracks down the author, who tells him that in the seventeenth century one Reverend Hawthorne ([[Andrew Prine]]) accused a coven of Satan worshippers of creating the music to control the women of Salem. As a result, Hawthorne had the women executed, but not before their leader, Margaret Morgan ([[Meg Foster]]), put a curse on both the Salem women and Hawthorne's descendants, calling his bloodline "the vessel by which the devil's child would inherit the earth". Further research demonstrates that Heidi is a descendant of Reverend Hawthorne.  Heidi's radio station announces they will be giving away tickets to the upcoming Lords of Salem concert (though this concert never eventuates on-screen). The record is played once again, which causes Heidi to have more strange visions that disturb her. Upset, she spends the night at Whitey's home, but experiences more disturbing visions before waking up in her own apartment. Heidi begins using drugs again. While she is under the influence of drugs, Lacy, Sonny, and Megan take Heidi to Apartment 5. Inside, there appears to be a huge opera house with a demon seated on a throne at the top of a staircase. She approaches him as he screams and embraces her with tentacle-like appendages, but later she finds her way back to her bedroom.  The next day, Matthias tries to tell Heidi the truth about the Lords and her lineage. Instead, Lacy and her sisters kill him. Heidi hears his murder taking place, but does nothing. Later at the concert, Heidi joins Lacy, Sonny, Megan, and the ghosts of Margaret and her coven in a satanic ritual. The Lords' music causes the female audience members to strip off their clothing. In the midst of surreal visions, Heidi blissfully gives birth to [[Antichrist|a strange creature]] which looks akin to a crawfish, atop the corpses of the naked audience members. The next day, Heidi's station reports on a mass suicide at a rock concert, as well as the disappearance of Heidi.

Lore (film)
  The return of the [[Nazi]] officer father towards the end of [[World War II]] upsets the family household in [[Southern Germany]]. They pack in a rush, kill the family dog and flee their stately home to hide-out in a secluded cabin in a clearing in the woods in the [[Black Forest]]. Lore's mother carefully wraps a [[Hummel figurines|porcelain figurine]] of a deer to take with them.  Lore's father leaves for destinations unknown and with the news of the [[death of Adolf Hitler]], her mother is aware of the fact she will be arrested too and goes off to a camp voluntarily, abandoning her five children and leaving Lore in charge with instructions to go to her grandmother Omi's house in [[Husum]] near [[Hamburg]]. Before leaving, Lore's mother gives her all of her jewellery and some money for the train tickets. After the neighbors are no longer willing to sell them any food, Günther is caught stealing so Lore decides it's time to leave. Unfortunately the trains are no longer running so they have to leave all their belongings behind and start their journey on foot.  The children arrive at the ruins of an abandoned house and Lore discovers the dead body of a woman. She goes into the house to look for her brother Günther and stumbles upon a young man sleeping. The next day they arrive at a church and Lore pays a woman to breast-feed her baby brother Peter. They again run into the young man from the day before. News and photos of the atrocities committed at the [[Nazi concentration camps]] are posted on a wall in the center of the nearby village for all to see.  Lore looks at the photos intently and recognizes her father in Nazi officer's uniform.   That evening, they move on to stay the night in a school.  They encounter the same young man on his own who later makes a sexual advance on Lore but is rebuffed. The next day he follows them out of the town as they continue on their journey. Arriving at a farm, Lore gives a gold bracelet and her mother's gold ring to an old woman in exchange for food. Lore finds the body of a dead man who shot himself and steals his watch. The old woman begs Lore to leave the baby behind so others will give them food but she refuses and they leave.  While walking, Lore again runs into the same man. She keeps on walking and he follows them. A truck with American soldiers drives up and stops. When asked for identification, the young man says his name is "Thomas" and shows the soldiers his Jewish identification papers and says he is Lore's brother. We see he has a serial number from a concentration camp tattooed on the inside of his forearm. The Americans give them a lift. The next day Lore falls ill and Thomas provides food for all of them. While bathing, Liesel questions why Lore doesn't like Thomas. Later Lore approaches Thomas, takes his hand and has him fondle her.  When he lays his head against her legs she pushes him away.   The following day while walking in the forest, Lore buries the picture of her father and the picture of him at the concentration camp.  They continue walking and reach a river they cannot cross.  Thomas offers to go across with Peter.  Lore says he'll go across and leave the rest of them. Lore goes down a hill and finds a man with a row-boat.  She asks him for help but he is not interested. She then sees Thomas on the road behind the man, so she allows the man to make sexual advances on her to distract him. Thomas hits the man over the head with a rock and kills him. Lore is visibly shaken. They take the man's boat and cross the river but while climbing the river bank Lore is guilt-stricken and backs into the river with Peter in her arms. Thomas pulls them both out and takes Peter from Lore's arms and hands him to Liesel.  Upon reaching the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British sector]], they are denied passage and must remain in the Russian sector. Lore asks Thomas if he told the soldiers what they did and he pulls her back from the guards. They decide they will cross into the British sector at night so they can catch one of the trains that are running there. After walking at night in the forest they pitch camp. When they smell somebody cooking, Thomas tells them to stay put and goes off to investigate. A restless Günther sees a man returning and believing it to be Thomas, runs towards him but is shot and killed by Russians. Thomas then threatens he will leave them behind unless they keep moving on with him.  During an argument with Lore, Thomas says he can't help them any more and that they can take the train and reach their destination safely. Lore is afraid he will leave them and in her anger and frustration calls him a filthy Jew. She cries and breaks down, so he decides to stay. They manage to board a train but are stopped by soldiers that ask for their papers. Thomas finds he is missing his wallet with his identity papers so he steps off the train to avoid getting caught.  During the final leg of the trip along the muddy [[tidal plain]]s of the western coast of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], Jürgen confesses that he actually stole Thomas' wallet so he wouldn't abandon them and that the papers weren't his anyway, but belonged to someone else called Thomas Weil, who Thomas had been impersonating.  The four remaining siblings finally arrive at Omi's house. She takes them in, feeds them and lectures them to not ever be ashamed of their parents. She mistakes Jürgen for Günther, and they tell her Günther died in the Russian sector.  Lore goes to her bedroom, which was her mother's when she was a child, and places her mother's porcelain figurine of the deer on the dresser, next to a collection of similar figurines.  Lore finds it difficult to adjust and refuses to cheerfully dance to American music with Liesel in the kitchen. She goes for a walk in the woods and looks at the identity papers and family pictures of Thomas Weil in Thomas's wallet.  Back at the house, they are sitting at the dining table when Jürgen impulsively grabs a piece of bread. Omi scolds him for not waiting to be served by the housekeeper and asks him whether he has ever learned anything at all. Lore is angered by her grandmother's [[authoritarianism]] so, siding with her brother, she also grabs a piece of bread without asking, bites into it and intentionally knocks over her glass of milk, pushes the milk off the table into the palm of her hand and drinks the milk. Omi excuses her from the table. Lore goes back to her room, throws the porcelain figurines off the dresser onto the floor and crushes them one by one with her heel.

The following morning, he finds a picture of a young woman on the ground just before a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attack destroys where he had been sitting, killing many around him. Unsuccessful at finding the photo's owner, Logan keeps it. Logan's squad-mate declares the woman in the picture as Logan's "guardian angel,” just before an explosion destroys their [[Humvee]].  Logan returns to [[Colorado]] to live with his sister's family, who have been looking after his dog, Zeus. Suffering from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]] and [[survivor guilt]], he decides it is best to leave, and departs to search for the woman in the photo. Logan and Zeus walk to [[Louisiana]], where a lighthouse in the picture has provided a clue. He shows the photo around town and a local resident tells him that the woman used to be married to a friend of his, a local deputy sheriff.  Logan finds the woman, Beth Green ([[Taylor Schilling]]), but has difficulty explaining why he is there. She assumes he wants to apply for a job, and her grandmother, Ellie ([[Blythe Danner]]) hires him. At first, Beth is irritated by Logan's presence, but she begins to warm to him as Logan's calm presence, willingness to work, and competence in repairing machinery are demonstrated. Logan develops a supportive relationship with Beth's son, Ben, who is without positive male influence since the death of Beth's brother, Drake.  Beth's former husband, [[Sheriff|Sheriff's Deputy]] Keith Clayton—the son of the town's judge—is immediately suspicious of Logan. He is brusque and overbearing with the former Marine. He discourages Ben from playing the violin around him, leading to Ben practising in his [[tree house]]. When Ben returns bloodied from a charity baseball game, Beth and Keith have an argument, and Keith threatens to use his connections to take full custody of Ben. Beth is anxious over Keith's short temper, and is fearful of losing her son to him.  On the anniversary of Drake's death, Beth becomes distraught and Logan comforts her. Keith tries to stop the budding relationship between Beth and Logan, but Beth stands up to Keith, showing that she is not intimidated by him any more. Keith learns that Logan was asking about her when he first arrived in town and steals the photo, telling Beth that Logan has been stalking her. Her trust destroyed, Beth is distraught and sends Logan away. Ellie tries to soften Beth, explaining to her that it isn't Logan's fault he survived and Drake did not.  An intoxicated Keith sees Logan walking with his dog and angrily confronts him, drawing his gun while people on the street begin to panic and run. Logan disarms Keith, turning the weapon over to another officer. He then heads home to pack and finds a photo of Beth's brother, Drake, inside a book that Ben had given him. The tattoo on Drake's forearm says "Aces" and realizes that Drake was the sergeant from the night raid. He returns to Beth's house to tell her what he knows of how Drake died.  At Judge Clayton's, Keith is shocked and embarrassed over what he did though his father tells Keith it will all blow over before the election. Keith walks out into a gathering storm, leaving his badge behind, and goes to Beth to plead for a reconciliation. When Beth gently but firmly refuses, Keith threatens to take Ben away. Ben overhears this and runs out into the storm, followed by Keith and Beth, just as Logan arrives. Ellie urges Logan to follow. Ben is en route to the tree house, but the [[rope bridge]] gives way and he falls into the river along with his father, just as Beth and Logan arrive. Keith, caught in the rope of the bridge, calls to Logan who grabs Ben and hands him to Beth. Before Logan can return for Keith, the tree house falls on Keith and he is swept away in the raging river to his death.  Back home, Beth thanks Logan for saving her son. Logan explains that Drake died saving one of his own men. He starts to leave, but Beth runs after him and says that he belongs with them. Later, Logan, Beth, Zeus and Ben celebrate Ben's 9th birthday together.

Lovely Molly
 The film opens with a video recording of Molly apologizing for her actions and attempting to slit her throat with a knife. The date is October 16, 2011, and much of the movie is revealed in flashback via video. The film proceeds with the events during the wedding of Tim ([[Johnny Lewis]]) and Molly (Gretchen Lodge), after which the couple move into Molly's childhood home with the help of Molly's sister, Hannah ([[Alexandra Holden]]).   Not long after the wedding, the couple are startled in their sleep when the alarm system buzzes. They call the police but the officer finds no evidence of forced entry. Shortly afterwards, Tim, a truck driver, must leave town for a few days, leaving Molly, a recovering [[heroin]] addict, alone. The film is then interspersed by images from a video camera where someone, most likely Molly, wanders the house, and reveals a hidden underground [[shrine]] in the shed. While in her childhood room, she hears something in her closet, although it is not revealed who is inside. Upon his return, Tim discovers Molly naked and staring blankly into one corner of her bedroom. She seems delusional and later cannot remember telling him "he is alive."   Molly begins to record a little girl and her mother who live not far from her house. One night, Molly hears a noise from the backdoor and tries to lock it, but is suddenly pushed back by an unknown force. Shortly afterwards, at work, Molly hears someone whispering her name. A man begins to quietly sing the traditional song "Lovely Molly", accompanied by the sound of hooves. The next day, Molly is summoned by her boss, who shows Molly the surveillance camera footage, which seems to show Molly being sexually assaulted by an unknown force. Molly becomes hysterical and is sent home with her sister.   Molly's condition turns worse, filming and talking to a dead deer, and attempting to seduce the local pastor. Fearing for her safety, Tim takes Molly to the doctor, but is advised she is healthy physically. That night, Molly attacks Tim and bites his lips, nearly pulling them off before fleeing. Terrified, Tim calls Hannah, who urges him to seek medical care. In the basement, Hannah finds that Molly has been keeping a rotting deer, which she stabs repeatedly, screaming that their father told her how Hannah killed him. Hannah replies that she was protecting herself and the young Molly from their father, and begs her to come stay with her and her son Peter. Molly refuses and then begins giggling, saying that if she does, her father will gut Peter 'from belly to throat.'   More video is shown, spying on the young girl's family. The video pans and a distraught Tim sits with the mother on the couch. It is clear they are familiar, and the mother begins oral sex on Tim. A car pulls up the drive and it is revealed to be Pastor Bobby: Molly emerges from the house naked and the two embrace. Shortly afterwards, Pastor Bobby is seen in the bathtub, dead and covered in blood and bites. Tim goes back to the house and finds the video camera left playing on the bed, showing a recording of himself with the neighbour. Molly strikes him across the head with a bat, drags him downstairs, and kills him by stabbing him in the head with a screwdriver, the same way Pastor Bobby was killed. Another video edit shows the police in the woods digging, pulling away to reveal the body of the young girl. The mother sobs, and Molly slips away. Afterwards, Molly lies naked and sobbing on the floor until her attitude abruptly changes and she shows a half smile. She walks out of the backdoor naked towards a tall figure with glowing eyes, a horse head and body of a man (resembling the demon [[Orobas]]).  In the aftermath, the couple's house is up for sale. There is no clear answer as to Molly's whereabouts or her disappearance, but time has clearly passed. In their old bedroom, Hannah finds the family photo album on the floor. Flipping through the pages, she sees that their father's face has been covered with horse heads from his frame collection. Hearing a noise from the closet, she opens it and in a trance-like state reaches her arm towards something unseen, similar to Molly's discovery earlier.  
LUV (film)
 The film begins with Woody Watson (Michael Rainey Jr.) having a dream about him and his mother in the woods, but he then wakes up. Woody lives with his grandmother (Lonette McKee) in the inner city of Baltimore and longs to be reunited with his mother who is in rehab in North Carolina. His charismatic Uncle Vincent (Common) has recently returned home after eight years in prison determined to straighten out his life by opening a high-end crab shack. Vincent drops Woody off at school, but when Woody becomes embarrassed when a girl looks at him, Vincent decides to give the boy a tutorial on how to become a man.  After a trip to a tailor to get Woody a custom-fitted suit, the duo take a trip to see Cofield (Charles S. Dutton), Vincent's friend and old crime partner who now owns his own crab shack and informs Vincent that Mr. Fish (Dennis Haysbert), his old crime boss, is looking for him. The pair heads to the bank to sign off on the loan Vincent needs to fulfill his dreams. But his bank officer tells him that he needs $20,000 so Vincent can start his business. Vincent has no one to turn to for help but his former associates, including Baltimore crime boss Mr. Fish and his brother Arthur (Danny Glover). Vincent takes a desperate turn when Fish enlists Vincent for one more drug deal to demonstrate his loyalty.  The pair then start going around town to finish the deal. Vincent then teaches Woody how to drive, then how to fire a gun. The pair then go to Jamison's place to arrange a deal. Eventually,  Jamison and Vincent fight each other; Vincent tells Woody to fire his gun, but Woody freezes up, forcing Vincent to kill Jamison himself. Later while driving, Vincent, enraged at Woody, yells at him and the two get in an argument. During the argument, Vincent yells at Woody how his mother doesn't want him. This enrages Woody, which leads him to abandon the car. Woody runs to the train station to catch a ride to North Carolina, but is stopped by Vincent. Woody decides to go home, but Vincent tells him "we ain't got no home." Vincent then convinces Woody to help him with the deal and promises to take him to North Carolina one day.  Woody and Vincent then meet up with Cofield again at the lake. The pair have to go to a drug dealer, Enoch, next, but Cofield believes it's too risky. But Woody comes up with a plan about Enoch not noticing them. The pair then go to Enoch. Enoch's henchman surround the pair, but the deal goes out as planned and the pair leave. The pair then go to visit Beverly (Meagan Good), Vincent's old girlfriend who is pregnant and has a new boyfriend. Enraged by this, Vincent beats up her boyfriend and drives off with Woody.  The pair then meet Fish and Arthur at their mansion for dinner. However, later on, things take a turn for the worse. Vincent becomes mad at Fish due to the fact that his last drug deal got Vincent locked up. Vincent then pulls out his gun, hits Arthur with it, and aims it at Fish. Fish then reveals that Vincent was the one that got Woody's mother on drugs. This angers Woody, who pulls out a gun and aims it at Vincent. Arthur then grabs a rifle and shoots Vincent, who counteracts by shooting and killing Arthur. Woody grabs his backpack and runs outside just as Vincent kills Fish.  Woody runs into the woods with a critically wounded Vincent right behind him; Woody then discovers him. As the two walk off, Vincent falls over and dies in Woody's arms. Woody cries just as the police arrives. Woody is taken into custody by Detectives Holloway and Pratt (Michael K. Williams & Russell Hornsby) where Woody finds himself involved in a triple homicide, but won't be charged. As Holloway drives Woody home, he tells Woody that he will be brought in for questioning along with his grandmother at 10:00 tomorrow morning.  The next morning before 10:00, Woody takes a cab to the crime scene. He makes his way into the woods, where a flashback reveals that he buried some money made from the drug deal under a tree. Woody takes the money and drives off in Vincent's car, symbolizing that Woody has decided to become his own man. Back at home, his grandmother walks into the kitchen where she finds money left by Woody in her Bible. As Woody drives off (presumably to North Carolina), in voice-over form, Woody says "My Uncle Vincent said that they are two types of people: owners and renters. But the real question is, what will you own?" As Woody has another vision of him and his mother in the woods, the movie ends with Woody becoming emotional.

Maattrraan
 Ramachandran ([[Sachin Khedekar]]) is a [[genetics]] scientist who does not get due credit and funds for his research. He tries creating a human with several talents through baby designing, which leads to the birth of his sons, who are [[Conjoined twins|conjoined]] together above the waist. Since they share a common heart, doctors suggest a sacrificial surgery, to which their mother Sudha ([[Tara (Kannada actress)|Tara]]) objects. They begin raising their children, Vimalan and Akhilan (both played by [[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]]). In the following years, Ramachandran makes it big with Sudha's help. His company, Locus Lacto Products, makes huge profit through their product 'Energion', the top-selling children’s powdered milk energy drink in the market.  Vimalan and Akhilan are poles apart in character, the former being decent, intellectual, and good at studies; while the latter is happy-go-lucky, socializing, and poor at studies. Anjali ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]) joins their company as a translator. Both Vimalan and Akhilan are smitten by her. She, along with her [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] friend Volga (Irina Maleeva), a journalist, spend their time with the brothers. Meanwhile, Anjali falls for Vimalan. Akhilan is jealous yet feels happy for them. Volga is then revealed to be a spy who seemingly tries to steal Energion's trade secrets. She is exposed and sent out by Ramachandran. She then takes the brothers to their cattle farm under the pretext of an interview where she takes pictures and even collects a milk sample from their farm. When Vimalan questions her, she warns him that Energion is an [[Adulterated food|adulterated]] product and can lead to the death of thousands of children. She also exposes their father of killing the head of their R&D department and setting the lab on fire, thereby destroying evidence. Consequently, she is murdered, but she swallows a [[USB flash drive|pen-drive]] containing evidences of the foul play before dying. Anjali acquires it from the person who performs Volga’s [[autopsy]]. She hands the pen-drive over to Vimalan. Following this, Vimalan and Akhilan are confronted by goons who try to get the pen-drive from him. Akhilan is convinced that the attack was only meant for robbing them. During this fight, Vimalan suffers a huge blow on the head.  Vimalan is declared brain dead, and his heart is transplanted into Akhilan. After the twins are separated through a surgery that results in Vimalan’s death, Akhilan and Anjali are depressed. But Anjali moves on and falls for Akhilan. Sudha is warned that Energion is adulterated, and she confronts her husband who asks the food safety department to raid their company. But to her surprise, Energion is declared safe and hygienic. Meanwhile, Akhilan discovers that his father is behind Vimalan’s death by tracking his assistant Dinesh ([[Ravi Prakash (Telugu actor)|Ravi Prakash]]). He gets hold of the pen-drive that contains several photos, where ingredients used as cattle feed at their farm are declared as no feed (very unsafe to eat). The beginning of the scheme is traced back to the European republic of Ukvania.  Accompanied by Anjali, Akhilan sets out to solve the mystery. They get her friend Ashok’s help, but he is subsequently killed. The photos are revealed to be athletes who were competing as ''Unified team'' under the Olympic flag in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. The athletes were declared dead in a plane crash. The investigation leads them to the army medical research center. The truth is then revealed that Energion was originally an undetectable [[steroid]] invented by Ramachandran to improve the performance of the athletes at the world games. Though the country performed well, some athletes began suffering from similar health problems leading to their deaths, and that their death from a plane crash was [[Faked death|faked]] to avoid national shame. They also learn that the adulterant in Energion could be detected only with the addition of [[ionization]] enhancer. After being assaulted by a local mafia led by Dinesh, Akhilan manages to kill him and takes the remedial ingredients back to India.  Once they are in India, Ramachandran is exposed and is about to be arrested. Akhilan requests his father to surrender, but he discovers his father’s ugly side and finds out that he and his brother are just a result of their father’s failed experiment. Ramachandran also states that he used the whole society as his research lab through Energion. His leg is then crushed by a rock after being unsuccessful in killing his son. Heartbroken and angry, Akhilan leaves his father to die at the hands of rats which chew on his flesh.  Akhilan gets national recognition for bravery. He later marries Anjali, and the couple subsequently become parents to conjoined twins.

In Monte Carlo, the penguins and chimpanzees have been saving up their daily winnings from the casino to fly back to Africa and bring their friends home. Alex's interference to kidnap them leads to animal control, led by a vicious big-game hunter named [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Chantel DuBois|Chantel DuBois]], pursuing them around the city, with Alex and the gang barely escaping. With determination, DuBois vows to capture Alex and add his head to her collection of animals' heads she's captured.  In the skies of [[France]], the plane crashes as the authorities close in. They come across a [[circus train]] consisting of [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Stefano|Stefano]] the [[New Zealand sea lion|sea lion]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Gia|Gia]] the [[North American jaguar|jaguar]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Vitaly|Vitaly]] the [[Siberian tiger|tiger]], and manage to gain entry, claiming that they are circus animals themselves. The team soon learn from Stefano that they are performing in [[Rome]] and [[London]], where they plan to impress a promoter to get them on their first American tour. Before the zoo animals' claim is discredited, the penguins suddenly appear with a deal to purchase the circus themselves; however, the circus animals' show in Rome proves to be a failure.  In route to London, Stefano soon reveals to Alex that Vitaly was the biggest star of them all, but quit due to an accident in one of his stunts; therefore, the friends lost faith in the circus. At a stop in the [[Alps]], Alex convinces the circus to continue pursuing the circus. Marty finds a new passion in being shot out of a cannon along with Stefano, while Melman and Gloria decide to dance on a tightrope. Gia persuades Alex to teach her Trapeze Americano.  In the process, they grow closer.  Meanwhile, DuBois is arrested in Rome while chasing the animals, but escapes and discovers that Alex was the missing lion from the zoo in New York. Once free, DuBois personally reassembles her injured men and they head toward the Alps, forcing the animals to proceed to London despite incomplete rehearsals. Alex finds Vitaly preparing to leave and convinces him to stay by reminding him of how he enjoys performing the impossible. He suggests that he uses [[hair conditioner]] as a safer lubricant to perform his flaming ring jump as well as fix his damaged fur. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly and the show is a spectacular success. After the impressed promoter arranges for an American tour, DuBois shows up with a paper showing that Alex was missing. Though the penguins are able to foil Dubois' plan, Alex is forced to confess that the four of them are just zoo animals trying to get home, disappointing the others who feel used and lied to.  The zoo animals and circus go their separate ways but arrive in New York City at the same time. Realizing how much their adventures have changed them, the zoo animals find that their true home was with the circus. Before they can go back, however, DuBois tranquilizes and captures them, before being discovered by the zoo staff, who believe she is responsible for returning the missing animals. King Julien and the penguins manage to get to the circus and convince the circus animals to rescue their friends.  Back at the zoo, Alex awakens to find that he along with his friends are trapped in larger fence enclosures. DuBois, who was honored by the zoo guards, secretly loads a poison-filled dart into a gun that she hides inside a foam finger in preparation for publicly executing Alex. The circus animals arrive led by Skipper and are able to defeat DuBois and her henchmen. Alex and his friends eventually decide to permanently join the circus to pursue their adventures, while DuBois and her henchmen are sent off in crates bound for Madagascar (just like the zoo animals themselves were in the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]) thanks to the penguins.

The Needlemans' first meeting with Madea and Joe is awkward and bodes poorly for how everyone will get along. However, over time, Madea helps Kate and Cindy relate better to each other and to other family members, while Joe and Kate help George become more confident, more in touch with his surroundings and people around him, and more effective in channeling his emotions. Barbara displays dual sensibilities about "colored people". On one hand, she mistakes Madea for a [[Domestic help|domestic]] named Sadie, treats "Sadie" imperiously, and threatens to get her fired. On the other hand, she recognizes Joe as a man she slept with years ago (and George's biological father), and relates to him seductively; she also enjoys [[Negro spiritual]]s and repeatedly asks to be taken to the African American church down the street from Madea's house.  Pastor Nelson's sermon inspires George to recognize a pattern in his company's records that explains where 10% of the stolen funds have been stashed. After church, watching [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s Oda Mae Brown character in ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' inspires George to involve Madea in a plan to redivert funds from the "stashed" accounts back to the charities whose investments were stolen in the Ponzi scheme. The plan requires George (who disguises himself as a Frenchman to avoid detection by the Malone mob "family"), Jake, and Madea (who assumes the identity of an upscale woman named Precious Jackson) to travel to New York City, and for "Precious" to meet with a bank manager to transfer funds from the laundered accounts to the legitimate charities. Madea successfully accomplishes her mission, although she improvises both an expansion of her assumed identity (by pretending to be the oldest [[Jackson family|Jackson]] sister) and of the accounts to which "Precious's" funds are transferred by having some money sent to her real bank account, unbeknownst to George and Jake.  When George and Jake begin to share their plan with Brian (Perry), he cuts them off and advises them it's illegal. However, after they pull off the caper, Brian informs George that his cooperation with the authorities and his successful efforts to return the charities' funds have given Brian leverage to dismiss the charges against George. Kate points out to George that the situation has strengthened their relationship and their family, and that it is a blessing in disguise. Upon leaving Madea's house, Cindy and Howie ask if they can come back to visit but both Madea and Joe immediately decline (though Madea does so in a sweet demeanor).  Before returning to New York, the Needlemans visit Pastor Nelson's church one last time. The Pastor and Jake burn the mortgage papers and the entire congregation celebrates the mortgage's being paid off, and the Needlemans enjoy the Negro spirituals. Madea also enjoys the spiritual music from her front porch, celebrating her new wealth.

Despite his on-and-off relationship with a woman named Joanna ([[Olivia Munn]]), Mike finds himself attracted to Brooke and promises to look after Adam.  Adam falls further into the excessive lifestyle of the Xquisite dancers, using drugs and having sexual encounters with many clients. When Dallas announces he has a plan to move their act to [[Miami]], Mike confides in Brooke that he is tiring of the lifestyle and wants to get a small business loan to pursue his dream of opening a custom furniture business. The bank declines his loan application and Mike realizes that he has to stay in the business to continue to pay his bills. Mike later attends a [[hurricane party]] at Dallas' house, where Adam becomes part of a scheme created by Tobias ([[Gabriel Iglesias]]), Xquisite's DJ, to sell drugs to Xquisite's clients, and is eventually given a package of ecstasy. Adam begins using drugs regularly, and Mike notices more of Adam's reckless behavior, to the chagrin of Brooke, who is relying on Mike to protect him.  A few days later, Mike and Adam perform for a private party at a sorority house where Adam brings the package of drugs with him. At the party, Adam gives a young woman an ecstasy pill, causing a brawl between Adam and the woman's boyfriend. Mike and Adam are forced to flee without the drugs, which Adam says were worth $1,000. They also do not collect their payment, which infuriates Dallas. After the next night's show, Mike and Adam take drugs and go to a club. Adam vomits and passes out; Brooke finds him on Mike's floor the next morning. Brooke angrily confronts Mike about his lifestyle, and ends her friendship with him. Tobias and his suppliers break into Mike's house looking for Adam, revealing that the drugs were actually worth $10,000. Mike gives up most of his life savings to pay Adam's debt in full.  Later, before the dancers' final performance at Xquisite, Mike decides he has had enough. Knowing that Dallas has no loyalty to any of them and is driven by greed, Mike leaves the club through the back. After realizing Mike is not coming back, Dallas promotes Adam to replace Mike as lead dancer. Mike drives to Brooke's apartment and tells her he has quit stripping. She has learned what he did for Adam, and she invites him to join her for breakfast. She playfully asks what they can do until morning, and then kisses him.

Maharana Pratap: The First Freedom Fighter
 The story of Maharana Pratap starts from the narrator ramanbhai who narrates the epic of Maharana Pratap and initiates the history of Mewar kingdom. When Vallabhi (Gujarat) was attacked by the Maan Mori in a battle attempt, Rawal Mahendra-II died and his queen Pushpawati somehow escaped from that attack and went to Nagda area (near Udaipur). Later she died, giving her child to a Brahmin family. The son of the queen Pushpawati grew young and was popularly known as Bappa Rawal (Kalbhoj). One day Bappa Rawal met Maharshi Harti Rashi (a sage) and by the profound blessings of the sage Harit Rashi, Bappa established the Great kingdom of Mewar. Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas proceeds further in the story as- Rana Ratan Singh's wife queen Padmini, who was an iconic paramount of beauty in historical times, faced bad consequences due to Allauddin Khilji intrigue and deception of forceful control over Chittorgarh as well as over queen Padmini. At the end the conflict between Padmini and Allauddhin Khilji led the last queen Padmini to sacrifice herself for the self-respect and honour of the dynasty by jumping alive in the heap of fire inside the palace at fort Chittor (the activity is popularly known as 'Saka/'[[Jauhar]]').  Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas's pen stops at the incident of king Udai Singh's feeding mother Panna Gurjari. The maid's son Banveer (dasi's son) who killed Rana Vikramaditya, was intending to kill Udai Singh in his childhood as well. Pannadhay then sacrificed her own son who was at the same age of Udai Singh and Banveer killed her son by having an impression that sleeping child is Udai Singh. She saw her own son dying in front of her eyes. This sacrifice of Pannadhay is remembered in the history, which ultimately saved the dynasty of Mewar.  As the story goes further. Maharana Udai Singh, father of Maharana Pratap was compelled to depart the fort of [[Chittorgarh]]. On the other hand, queen Jaiwnti bai who was the first wife of Maharana Udai Singh was facing ignoring attitude by Udai Singh. The Maharana Udai Singh was immensely fascinated towards queen Bhattiyani. The diplomatic queen Bhattiyani passionately devised a plan to establish Jagmal (her son) on the throne of Mewar so as to make him the king. After the death of Udai Singh, the elder son Pratap was not offered the royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar. In the meantime all the noble heads came to know about Jagamal being made the heir. Apparently ministers within the kingdom discussed the dismissal of Jagmal. Rawat Krishna Das and Rawat Sanga suggested that "pratap is the eldest son, and worthy also, hence, he should be the Maharana." After completing the last rites, the noble chieftains helped Pratap to occupy the Royal Throne and spoke to Jagamal – "In your capacity as the younger brother, your seat is in front of the Royal Throne". Thus, on 28 February 1572 Pratap's coronation was performed at Gogunda (place near [[Udaipur]]) just after the funeral of Udai Singh. Pratap's coronation was held at Rana Bawari and he was enthroned on royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar unanimously in 1572.  Maharana Pratap was leading forward with his knighthood, chivalry and art of battling; at the same time emperor Jalal ud-Din Muhammad [[Akbar]] of Mughal dynasty (who persecuted king Udai Singh from Chittor) was now ready to tackle the conflict in the form of a battle. However, as a diplomat, his strategy was to avoid the battle and motivate other kings to surrender in front of him, but Maharana Pratap was an exception.  Pratap won the battle of Gorwar. Akbar with his kingdom oriented strategies sent many proposals to Mewar as Akbar was of the opinion that Mewar is the biggest hurdle in the path of expanding the domain of his kingdom. A special delegation was sent by Akbar thrice to persuade and convince Maharana Pratap that he shall accept the Mughal rule and Mewar should work under Akbar's imperial kingdom. The special delegation consisted of Rana Bhagwandas, Todermal and [[Man Singh]]. They requested Maharna Pratap to accept Akbar's proposal. When Kunwar [[Man Singh]] of Amber came to Udaipur. There was a grand dinner organised at the bank of lake Udaisagar. But Maharana Pratap decided not to attend that dinner. Pratap sent his son Kunwar Amar Singh to dine with Kunwar Man Singh, which ultimately led to an argument between Dodhia Bhim and Man Singh. This incident precipitated the Mughal-Mewar conflict. Aftermath of this argumentation was the battle of Haldighati.  <big>'''Battle of Haldighati'''</big>  The Mughals marched south towards the village of Haldighati where a pass accessed the terrain of Pratap Singh and his temporary capital of Kumbhalgarh. Emperor Akbar decided to fight a battle and invaded Mewar. Emperor Akbar sent Man Singh as a Chief of his Imperial army and this incident is popularly known as the battle of Haldighati. It took place on 18 June 1576. In the month of June with boiling temperature, battle started in the narrow path of valley. Pratap attacked on Man Singh but he hid himself under the shelter of seating stands on elephant rider, thereby only rider was killed. In this battle Hakim Khan Suri, Rawat Netsingh, Jhala Maan, Jhala Bida, Gwalior's king Raamshah Tanwar, Nalwahan, Shaliwahan were killed as martyrs. Here Pratap was surrounded by Mughal imperial army, at the same time Jhala Maan traded the crown with Pratap. Jhala Maan set a unique example of loyalty, bravery and courage by sacrificing his life to save the life of Pratap. Jhala Maan holding royal insignia urged Pratap to leave the battlefield. Pratap's horse Chetak was wounded by the sword, which was hidden in the trunk of Man Singh's elephant. Ultimately Chetak died while crossing the terrain. Chetak equally shares the respect that has been given to the legendary warrior Maharana Pratap in the history. In the textbooks the battle ends within three hours of a short span, but the fact is that the battle of Haldighati which started on 18 June 1576, actually carried about a month long and ended at Gogunda. The battle was truly a symbol of the raw courage, an epitome towards nation's love, spirit of sacrifice and loyalty of the Rajputs towards the defence of their motherland.  It was one of the toughest times for Mughal army as they were compelled to eat unripe mangoes and horse's meat and were forced to leave [[Mewar]] at last. Maharana Pratap displayed indomitable courage and bravery in the battle of Haldighati, he won the battle of Haldighati finally displaying the apocalyptic and splendiferous attitude of a true knight. Akbar invaded the land of Mewar many times but Rana Kika (Pratap) never surrendered in front of him.  Under the leadership of [[Shahbaz Khan Kamboh|Shahbaz Khan]], Mewar was invaded umpteen number of times but Pratap escaped from every attempt of Mughals. In the Diwer valley, enormous battle took place between Mughals and Mewar. Maharana Pratap confronted 40 Mughal's cantonment and Mughal army faced extreme defeat. At the end Maharana Pratap established the capital of Mewar named 'Chawand' in Mewar area and promoted agriculture, music and art. Further leading towards success in his serene, sublime and peaceful kingdom. There came an immense tragic and disheartening day in the life of Pratap when while tightening the string of a bow with arrow, a muscle contracted in the intestine causing internal bleeding. Pratap fell down on the surface and died in Chawand.

The crowd below calls the police, with Dante Marcus ([[Titus Welliver]]) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty ([[Edward Burns]]) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), who is on a leave of absence, after failing to save a suicidal policeman. Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the $40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander ([[Ed Harris]]). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the [[Sing Sing|Sing Sing Correctional Facility]] one month earlier, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond.  Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey ([[Jamie Bell]]), and Joey's girlfriend, Angie ([[Genesis Rodriguez]]), break into Englander's vault across the street, to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry store's security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them but do not find the diamond. They set off the alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him, stealing the diamond at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-partner, Mike Ackerman ([[Anthony Mackie]]), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room. Lydia does not trust him, and Dougherty backs her up. Ackerman claims he has found bomb schematics in a storage unit Nick rented and is convinced that he will detonate an explosive somewhere. While the crowd is evacuated by the [[bomb squad]], Lydia, believing in Nick's innocence, calls [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] and discovers that three of the cops employed by Englander were suspected of being corrupt: Ackerman, Marcus, and a deceased officer called Walker.  Joey and Angie enter the hotel and hand the bag containing the diamond to the hotel concierge ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]). The concierge pockets the diamond. Englander calls Marcus, one of the men who helped him frame Nick, and has him capture Joey and Angie. Nick begins to make his escape through the hotel, at one point being aided by the concierge who tells him "everyone is rooting for you, kid," while handing him a disguise (and the diamond). Marcus chases Nick to the roof, where he has Lydia arrested for [[obstruction of justice|obstruction]]. Englander brings Joey and Angie, threatening to throw Joey off the roof, if Nick does not give him the diamond. Nick turns it over, and Englander leaves. Meanwhile, Lydia escapes custody and rushes back to the roof. Marcus attempts to force Nick to jump off the roof, but Ackerman arrives and shoots Marcus, who wounds Ackerman. Nick rushes to Ackerman's side, who apologizes and reveals that he had no idea that Englander would frame Nick for stealing the diamond. Marcus survives, as he is wearing a bulletproof vest, and is preparing to kill Nick, when Lydia shoots him, but does not kill him. Nick jumps from the roof onto an airbag set up earlier by the police, catches up to Englander, beats him, and pulls the diamond he had only just recently given him from his jacket, proving Nick's innocence in front of both the police and public, resulting in Englander being arrested.  Later, Nick is cleared of all charges and released from custody and meets Joey, Angie, and Lydia at a bar. There it is revealed that the hotel concierge is in fact Nick and Joey's father, Frank Cassidy, who had faked his own death in order to help Nick break out of prison and prove his innocence. Joey proposes to Angie with a diamond ring presumably stolen from Englander's vault. She accepts and they all celebrate together.  
The Man with the Iron Fists
 In [[19 century|nineteenth century]] China, Jungle Village is home to several warring clans. The village [[blacksmith]] creates deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk, and leave the village. The region's governor tasks the Lion Clan's leader, Gold Lion, with protecting a large shipment of gold that must pass through the village. Gold is betrayed by his lieutenants Silver Lion and Bronze Lion, who plan to steal the gold. They use the chaos ensuing from a fight with the Hyena Clan to allow their co-conspirator Poison Dagger—the governor's aide—to assassinate Gold, after which Silver becomes the Lions' leader. Gold's son Zen-Yi learns of his father's murder and sets off to the village to seek revenge.  The [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] Emperor's undercover emissary Jack Knife arrives in the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body arrives in the village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.  Meanwhile, the gold shipment arrives in the village, accompanied by two skilled warriors, the Geminis. The Lions soon confront the Geminis and their men, and in the ensuing fight, Poison Dagger assassinates the Geminis and the Lions capture the gold. Jack later arrives to investigate the incident and learns that the Geminis were poisoned with mercury-tipped weapons, leading him to the blacksmith. The Lions' theft prompts the governor to send his Jackal troops to recover the shipment or destroy the village. Zen-Yi asks the blacksmith to craft him a new suit of weaponized armor. The Lions suspect that the blacksmith is helping Zen-Yi and have him tortured for information. The blacksmith refuses to talk, and Brass cuts off  his forearms. Jack, who had been following the blacksmith, saves him from bleeding to death. While the blacksmith recovers, he tells Jack of his past as an emancipated American slave who accidentally killed a white man who refused to let him go. He fled America by boat and went to China, where monks trained him to use his body's energy to perform superhuman feats. Jack with the aid of the blacksmith crafts his greatest weapon: a pair of iron forearms that he can animate using this energy.  Zen-Yi recovers and joins Jack and the blacksmith. Meanwhile, Blossom offers to let Silver hide the gold in a secret tomb beneath the brothel in return for payment. The gold is stored in a coffin which is raised up to the rafters. That night, Blossom has her girls serve the Lions, and Silk serves Brass. At Blossom's signal, the girls use weapons hidden in their mouths to poison many of the Lions, and they join with Blossom as the Black Widows. When Silk tries to poison Brass, his skin protects him, and he beats and almost kills her. Zen-Yi, Jack, and the blacksmith arrive and join with the Black Widows to fight the remaining Lions while Blossom and Bronze fight and kill each other. While fighting Jack, Poison Dagger is crushed between large moving gears. Silver and Zen-Yi fight in the tomb; Zen-Yi cuts the coffin free, and it crushes Silver. The blacksmith finds Silk, who dies in his arms. He confronts Brass, and his iron fists prove capable of inflicting damage on Brass' seemingly invincible body. While Brass is in metal form, a powerful punch from the blacksmith shatters him to pieces. Jack runs outside in time to stop the soldiers from decimating the building with Gatling guns.  Ultimately, Jack leaves the village to accompany the gold, and Zen-Yi tells the blacksmith that he has gained a brother. With the clans destroyed and the village safe, the blacksmith vows to keep it that way and destroys the sign pointing to his weapon shop. During the credits, Zen-Yi's pregnant fiancee is kidnapped by a bird clan, prompting Zen-Yi to seek the blacksmith's aid.

Frank joins a [[dating site]], where he gets a date with a woman named Lucie. The two go out to dinner and return to Lucie's apartment, where she attempts to seduce the virginal Frank, mistaking his increasing panic for nervousness. Frank strangles Lucie, scalps her and takes her hair back to his apartment, where he attaches it to another mannequin.  One morning, Frank awakens to find a photographer named Anna taking photos of the mannequins in his storefront. Frank invites her into his store, where she is taken with his work restoring antique department store mannequins. The two develop a friendship, with Frank agreeing to help Anna put together an art exhibit using his mannequins. Frank falls in love with her, and starts taking medication to control his violent urges. Frank nevertheless kills again, stabbing a young dancer to death and attaching her scalp to another mannequin.  At the opening of the exhibit, Frank meets Anna's boyfriend Jason, as well as art director and Anna's mentor Rita. Both mock him for his interest in mannequins, questioning his sexual orientation. Frank later follows Rita home, subdues her in the bathtub and [[hogtie bondage|hog-ties]] her on her bed. Identifying Rita with his mother, Frank voices his resentment and sense of abandonment, finally scalping Rita alive in a fit of rage.  The next day, Frank calls Anna, who tearfully tells him of Rita's murder and of her recent breakup with Jason. Frank comes to Anna's apartment to comfort her, but inadvertently reveals his guilt by mentioning things that only the killer would know. Realizing that Frank is the killer, Anna stabs Frank through the hand with a knife before locking herself in her bedroom. Anna's neighbor, Martin, breaks into the apartment to save her, only for Frank to kill him with a meat cleaver, breaking down Anna's bathroom door, Frank puts her into a choke hold and knocks her unconscious. Frank loads Anna's body into his van and drives home, but as he opens the doors Anna regains consciousness and stabs him in the stomach with a piece of rebar attached to a mannequin hand. Anna flees and is picked up by a passing car, who panics at the sight of Frank who has blood all over him and runs him down in his car, who hits Frank, and crashes flinging Anna through the windshield. Bloodied, Frank hobbles to the mortally injured Anna and scalps her as she dies.  Frank returns to his apartment, attaching Anna's hair to a mannequin dressed in a bridal gown. As he succumbs to his injuries, Frank suffers hallucinations of the mannequins transforming into his victims and begin to tear his body apart, finally ripping off his face to reveal a mannequin head. Before he dies, Frank sees Anna, clad in a wedding dress, lower her veil and turn her back on him. Later that day, a [[SWAT]] team breaks into Frank's apartment, only to find Frank's corpse in his closet, alongside with his collection of scalps.

As the group returns to the colony, they spot an invading Collector ship.  The Collector ship deploys Seeker Swarms to incapacitate Fehl Prime's colonists, including Captain Toni.

Delta Squad also discovers a possible antidote for the Seeker Swarms' paralyzing agent, as well as Brood, who had been kept in a tank as a test subject in the labs. Without warning, the door to the labs is then torn open by a Praetorian with Kamille's body incorporated into it.

However, Messner kills Brood, leading to Delta Squad's capture.  Now in orbit, the Collector ship incinerates the remains of the colony to cover their tracks. Deep within the ship, Messner explains to Treeya that he was the one who planted the alien device in order to lure the Collectors and capture their technology for Cerberus's benefit. He takes Treeya with him to another part of the ship, leaving Vega, Essex, and Milque locked in pods. Unbeknownst to Messner or the Collectors,a drink Vega had given everyone earlier had been spiked with the Seeker Swarm antidote, and the three are able to escape and kill their guards.

Treeya witnesses footage of the Protheans' last stand against the Reapers, their transformation into the Collectors, and the Collectors' construction of a human-shaped Reaper at their homeworld. Messner records this information on his bracelet, only to be double-crossed by the Collectors. When Messner tries to bargain with the Collectors, Treeya steals the bracelet before escaping in a containment pod.   Vega and Essex fight the Collectors, killing them and damaging the Collector ship's controls. Essex is impaled by the claw of the ship's pilot and uses his biotics to fling them both into a chasm, where they fall to their deaths. Messner fires on Vega, but Vega disarms and stabs him. Vega demands Messner's intel on the Collectors and learns of Treeya's possession of it. Left between the choice of evacuating the colonists on a now-pilotless ship or saving Treeya and the Collector intel, Vega chooses the latter. As Treeya's pod is retrieved, the Collector ship crashes into Fehl Prime's surface and explodes, killing Captain Toni and the colonists.  On the Citadel, Vega is commended by David Anderson and Admiral Hackett, who inform him that the intel he saved was not needed, and that Commander Shepard ended the Collector threat.

Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the [[space-time continuum]]. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K.  Back in 1969, J goes to [[Coney Island]], knowing from the Agency's records that in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who takes him to MiB Headquarters and prepares to neuralyze him, but decides at the last minute to investigate J's claims that he has traveled from the future to protect him. K and J follow clues, leading them to a [[bowling alley]], and then to [[The Factory]], where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and escapes, but not before promising to give them the ArcNet the next time they meet. Boris later captures Griffin. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives, and they team up.  Upon learning that they must go to [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]] and attach the ArcNet to the [[Apollo 11]] rocket so it can be deployed in space, J reveals the real purpose of his mission to K, who initially takes the news badly. J, K, and Griffin fly there using jetpacks, but are stopped by the military. Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, convincing him of the importance of their mission, and the officer assists them in reaching the launch site. As the agents climb up the rocket's launch tower, they are attacked by both 1969 Boris and 2012 Boris. Using his time-travel device, J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off 1969 Boris's left arm, knocking him off the tower as well. The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches, with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rocket's exhaust, killing him. 1969 Boris attacks K on a beach, but the colonel saves K by sacrificing himself. K kills Boris instead of arresting him as he originally did. The colonel's young son arrives and inquires about his father, but rather than tell him the truth, K neuralyzes him and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that the young boy is himself, the colonel was his father, that K has actually been watching over him all his life, and was there when the timeline changed, thus explaining why he was the only one who remembered K in the alternate 2012.  His mission complete, J returns to 2012, where he finds K, and thanks him.

Mental (2012 film)
  Shirley Moochmoore ([[Rebecca Gibney]]) is a sweet misfit and mother of five daughters who are all convinced they suffer from various mental illnesses. Living in the Australian coastal suburb of Dolphin Heads and married to the often absent local politician Barry ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]), Shirley retreats into a fantasy world of her favourite musical, ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. After she manically orders a huge amount of furniture, telling neighbours her husband won it on a TV game show, she's packed off to a mental institution; Barry instructs his daughters to say she's "on holiday in [[Wollongong]]".  Barry enlists a mysterious, surly hitchhiker named Shaz ([[Toni Collette]]) to care for his family. Shaz terrifies the girls into obedience with her [[ocker]] accent, her dog Ripper and the knife she keeps in her cowboy boot, but she also encourages them to stand up to local bullies including their smarmy Aunt Doris ([[Caroline Goodall]]), their snobbish, house-proud neighbour Nancy ([[Kerry Fox]]) and the two mean girls who run the local coffee shop and who had forced Shirley to eat unwanted donuts. Shaz's philosophy is that the 'normal' world is insane, and so-called 'crazy' people are the normal ones. She leads the Moochmore girls on a dawn climb of a nearby mountain. From its peak, they each select a stone to symbolise their newfound ability to overcome adversity.  Shaz also encourages eldest daughter Coral ([[Lily Sullivan]]) to pursue a romance with Trout ([[Sam Clark]]), a hunky, guitar-strumming lifeguard at the aquatic theme park where Coral works for an eccentric shark hunter named Trevor Blundell ([[Liev Schreiber]]). Trevor had earlier disrupted Trout clumsily kissing Coral in the shark exhibit; but thanks to the confidence Shaz instils in Coral, Trout genuinely falls for her, and the pair spend a romantic evening together riding waterslides in the nude after the park has closed.  After forcing Barry to eat a home-cooked meal with his family, and to seek treatment for his daughter Michelle's (Malorie O'Neill) genuine [[schizophrenia]], Shaz reunites the Moochmore family at the mental institution. Shirley tells Barry that she knows of his habitual infidelities and will no longer support his political career. Barry begs her to appear at his campaign launch.  Trevor reveals that Shaz is actually his mentally disturbed ex-wife. He tells Coral that Shaz is convinced the spirit of their daughter, who died in a boating accident, is trapped inside the giant preserved shark in Trevor's exhibit. Trevor is trying to move on with his life, but Shaz has repeatedly refused psychiatric treatment and instead has followed Trevor to several new towns, working her way into the trust of locals each time. Barry calls the police to have Shaz arrested, and she is confined to the same mental institution Shirley had been.  Before the Moochmore family perform a triumphant, Von Trapp-style onstage singalong of '[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]' at Barry's campaign launch, the girls decide to break Shaz out of the mental institution. They tie up Trevor and help Shaz steal his pickled shark. Tortured by the gentle guitar songs of his guard, Trout, Trevor manages to escape just in time to intercept and reason with Shaz as she attempts to free the shark from its tank and 'release' it into the ocean. The shark tank plunges into the water, its attached rope entangling Trevor's legs, and Shaz dives after it, ostensibly to save him. Neither of them surfaces.  The girls' aunt Doris, whose hobby is making elaborate costumes for porcelain dolls, has a final confrontation with Shaz in her doll display room. "I lived!" Shaz screams, then pulls down her jeans and lights a fart with her cigarette lighter, setting fire to the room and the entire house. Then she races out the front door, kicking over a garbage bin, which has left her able to win in triumph.

Meteora (film)
 [[File:Meteora_Agios_Triadas_IMG_7632.jpg|thumb|The monastery at Meteora]]  All action takes place at, or near, the [[Monastery of the Holy Trinity, Meteora]]. A young Greek monk falls in love with a Russian nun. The story looks at the struggle between religious devotion, temptations of the flesh, the yearning of the human heart, and the role of the individual within the community of believers. The two communicate with each other across the valley using mirrors to flash a [[morse code]] signal, with lights dancing on the wall of her cell in the Agios Stefano Convent, also set on a rock pinnacle.  The film  is set in Central Greece, where medieval monasteries perch on the apex of hugely dramatic sandstone pinnacles, and the main access is to be hauled up in a net tied to a rope. A steep set of steps also access from one side. Views are breath-taking, and often in extreme long-shot, with human figures appearing as small black dots on the screen.  The monks and nuns obey the rituals of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in this austere environment, remote from modern human life in every sense with the strong rhythm of prayer and asceticism.  Basic food (bread and milk) is delivered to the monks by the nuns, and winched up using the same net and rope system used for the monks themselves. There is no electricity, and lighting is by means of oil lamps. Music in the monastery is limited to rhythmic hammering on a suspended wooden board and a few bells.  The film is interspersed with animation, based on ancient Greek icons.  "Meteora" means "lifted into heights" or "afloat", as is the case of the two lovers whose emotions are  in such a state - in limbo between their belief and their desire.

Queen Clementianna notices them dancing and orders her manservant Brighton ([[Nathan Lane]]) to take the princess into the forest and feed her to the Beast ([[Frank Welker]]) that lives there.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/02/mirror-mirror-review "Mirror Mirror – review "]. ''The Guardian'',  Peter Bradshaw, 2 Apr 2012 </ref> Brighton takes Snow White to the forest, but he releases her. Snow White flees the Beast and collapses at the door to the [[Seven Dwarves]]' house. She wakes up to find the dwarves Grimm ([[Danny Woodburn]]), Butcher ([[Martin Klebba]]), Wolf (Sebastian Saraceno), Napoleon ([[Jordan Prentice]]), Half Pint ([[Mark Povinelli]]), Grub (Joe Gnoffo), and Chuck (Ronald Lee Clark).  Queen Clementianna levies another tax on the townfolk to pay for the parties she throws for Prince Alcott. Brighton collects the taxes, but, on the way back to the palace, the dwarves rob him. Snow White sneaks away to return the money. The townspeople and the Town [[Magistrate]] (Alex Ivanovici) are overjoyed to have their money back and Snow White lets the Dwarves take credit for it, earning them the people's loyalty.  Clementianna informs Alcott that Snow White is dead. When the Prince finds out that the bandits have robbed Brighton, he goes after them, unaware of the awful things the Queen has done. In the forest, Alcott discovers that Snow White is alive and in league with the bandits. Each believing the other to be in the wrong, Snow White and Alcott duel. Alcott returns to the Palace defeated and informs the Queen that Snow White is alive.  Clementianna goes to her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Mirror House]], within which lives her reflection, the Mirror Queen ([[Lisa Roberts Gillan]]). Clementianna has the Mirror Queen temporarily turn Brighton into a cockroach, and requests a love potion so she can make the prince fall in love with her. The potion turns out to be a 'puppy love' potion and the prince becomes devoted to her like a puppy dog. Under this spell, the prince agrees to marry her. She then uses dark magic to create two giant wooden [[puppet]]s in the forest and uses them to attack Snow White and the Dwarves. Snow White cuts the strings of the puppets and breaks the spell.  Snow White and the Dwarves crash the royal wedding and capture the Prince before Clementianna and Brighton arrive. When Queen Clementianna arrives, the Baron and the other Aristocrats had their clothes stolen, because of her inability to handle bandits and for lying about Snow White's death, they demanded that Clementianna be deposed. Back in the forest, the still-cursed Prince wishes to return to the Queen. Snow White kisses Alcott and the spell is broken.  Snow White encounters Clementianna, who sends the Beast after her. Prince Alcott tries to save Snow White, but the Beast captures her. However, the Beast hesitates in killing her and Snow White sees that it wears a necklace with a moon charm on it similar to the one the Queen wears, (which the princess noticed just before she was taken to be eaten by the Beast). She cuts the chain with her father's dagger and the Beast suddenly becomes engulfed in light. Clementianna begins to age, and the Mirror Queen says this is her punishment for using dark magic. The Beast turns out to be Snow White's father, who has no memory of the last ten years.  Grateful to Alcott for his assistance, the king agrees to let him marry Snow White as Brighton starts a relationship with Margaret. After Snow White accepts the Magistrate's gift, a [[crone]] in a hooded robe appears and offers Snow White an apple as a wedding gift. At first, Snow White accepts the gift. As she is about to bite it, she realizes that the crone is Clementianna. Snow White pulls out her knife and cuts a piece from the apple and gives it to Clementianna, who reluctantly accepts it. The Mirror House declares that it was Snow White's story along, and shatters. The Dwarves, meanwhile, all live "happily ever after".  During the credits, the cast, led by Snow White, engage in a [[Bollywood]]-style musical number.

They find blood on the van's fender and assume that they hit an animal the previous night. Upon returning to the house, the group collectively agrees to stay one more day to wait for the owners of the house. Over the day, Rose has fits and visions of her friends in various stages of death and injury.  While exploring the mines again, TJ and Lex discover three dead bodies that appear identical to theirs and Guy's. They inform the others, and the group reluctantly agrees that something supernatural is occurring. TJ and Lex return to the mine in search of answers and find a traumatized Claire locked inside a cell; she claims that it is Michael's doing. TJ and Lex refuse to save her, knowing that "their" Claire is still in the house, a decision that Claire later supports. Despite Lyla's protests, the others debate whether Michael needs to be locked up overnight for their protection.  Unnerved by his passive acceptance of his fate, they put him inside one of the mine's cells.   Michael escapes from the cell, which leads to a chase inside the mines, during which Michael causes TJ's and Lex's deaths and locks Claire up inside a cell, where she meets the alternate version of herself. Inside the house, Rose succumbs to poisoning and dies. Guy and Lyla agree to flee, leaving behind in the house a written note for "TJ, Lex, Claire" to wait there for them. Upon reaching the main road, Guy tries to wave down an oncoming van, causing it to swerve and hit Lyla. Guy recognizes the occupants of the van as "them" from the night before and realizes that they are inside a [[Predestination paradox|causality loop]]. He promises the seriously injured Lyla that he will break the cycle.  Guy rushes back to the house to warn the others but is stopped by Michael, who kills him. Michael continues the cycle by warning his past self that his friends will try to kill him, and that when they lock him inside a cell for the second time, he has to defend himself. Michael gives his past self the key to the cell and forces his past self to burn his anti-psychotic medication.   The cycle restarts as the group's van arrives at the gas station at the beginning of the film. However this time Lyla from the previous cycle is still alive, and she hobbles towards her counterpart in the hopes of warning her and breaking the cycle.

Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure
 Cameron asserts that such a key is manifest in the [[National Monument to the Forefathers]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], which is a large 1889 statue commemorating the [[Mayflower]] [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]. Co-writer Marshall Foster ascribes to this statue the contextual validity of ''Monumental's'' message, based on the [[Symbolism (arts)|statue's symbolism]] and [[Engraving|engraved]] [[dedication]]. According to Foster, "The monument depicts Faith, and Faith is pointing to God and has an open [[Geneva Bible]] in the right hand and a [[Pentagram#European occultism|star of wisdom]]".<ref></ref>

The Mooring

Ten years later, counselor Nancy ([[Hallie Todd]]) speaks with eight young girls who have been brought to her due to their addiction to cell phones and technology: text message addict Margot, [[online gambling|online gambler]] Remi, [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] Natalie, [[cyber bully]] Justine, online addicts Madison and Holly, [[online dating|online dater]] Claire, and Ashley, a girl who caused a six-car accident due to talking on her cell phone. The purpose of the retreat is for the girls to learn to interact with each other without the use of technology.  Along with Nancy's aide, Dawn, the girls board a houseboat where they learn how to communicate with each other. During a writing exercise, Ashley breaks down while writing to the mother of a boy she injured in the six-car pile up she caused. Later, while the girls play board games, Nancy notices something wrong with the boat's engine. She decides to moor the boat to land and stay overnight. The girls set up camp. Later that night, the girls bond at the campfire, and Nancy allows the girls to listen to music. Soon after, they hear the engine of another boat, and a man and a woman's voices. Nancy advises the girls to get some sleep. Natalie, in a deep voice, tells the couple to keep it down. Over a loud speaker, the man's voice yells, "Shut up, bitch," and points the boat's light at the group for a brief moment. The girls quickly go to bed.  The next day, the girls are approached by the woman from the night before, Mickey. She asks them for coffee, while her boyfriend, Richard, watches from afar through his rifle scope. He keeps his focus on Margot, but quickly calls Mickey back to the boat so they can set off. Nancy, weary of the boat's engine, decides to drive it back to shore without the girls to get it checked, leaving Dawn in charge. Dawn shows the girls the basics of rappelling while Nancy drives the boat back. Suddenly, the boat dies out, leaving Nancy stranded. Richard's boat appears, and Mickey offers to tow Nancy back.  Meanwhile, Dawn is teaching Margot, Natalie, and Justine to quickly prepare themselves for rappelling. The girls soon see the couple's boat approaching them. Dawn notices through her binoculars that they have Nancy, whose arms, legs, and mouth are taped together, and an anchor tied to her ankles. Richard pushes her into the water, while Mickey drops the anchor. The boat circles around Holly, Claire, and Madison, who had been swimming. The girls race to shore and begin running through the forest, Richard and Mickey following close behind. Eventually, Holly and Ashley get separated from the group. After Ashley trips and hits her head on a rock, Richard shoots and kills her. Holly drops her inhaler, but keeps running. Soon, she runs out of breath, and hides by a log. Richard finds her and gives her the inhaler, allowing her to run off after she has caught her breath. Elsewhere, the girls find Nancy's boat. Dawn advises them to wait until nightfall to make their way to the boat.  At night, Holly finds her way back to the girls, who were using paddles to manually control the boat. The girls rest in the boat for a few moments, then hear the couples' boat's engine. While scurrying to get the poles out, Richard hooks Claire's back and drags her into the river, killing her. The girls panic as numerous gunshots bombard the boat's windows while the couple plays country music in the background. The girls quickly flee back to land, but the couple follows them. While they hide behind trees, Madison is caught by a [[Animal trapping|bear trap]]. Everyone but Dawn rush to her aid, allowing Richard to find and kill Dawn with his rifle. The couple departs back to their boat, where Richard attempts to have sex with Mickey. He chokes her when she refuses, then releases her before she blacks out. Later, Margot tells Justine they should leave Madison and come back for her, but Justine refuses.  At sunrise, the girls watch Mickey driving in a smaller boat. Holly, Remi, Justine, Margot, and Natalie carry Madison, suffering from shock, over their shoulders. Nearby, Richard stalks them and shoots at them with his pistol. The girls soon come to a cliff and realize they must rappel down. Natalie, Margot, and Holly make it down, but Remi decides she must carry Madison down with her. Justine supervises the pair as they descend, but Richard orders Mickey to stop them while he tries to make it to the three at the bottom. Mickey uses a [[machete]] to cut the line, and Remi and Madison fall to their deaths. While Richard chases down Holly, Margot, and Natalie, Mickey kills Justine with the machete in a panic. The girls find Richard's boat, but Holly rushes for Mickey's smaller boat and gets caught by Richard, who drowns her by holding her under the water. Margot and Natalie scramble to find the keys to the boat, but Natalie is shot and killed. Richard tries to console Margot, but she sobs until he throws her into a cabinet. Mickey returns, and after an insult, motions her machete at Richard's throat. She hears Margot's cries, and Richard comments, "Takes you back, huh?", causing Mickey to remember how she was abducted ten years earlier by Richard (as evidenced by the opening scene). Mickey swiftly slits his throat with the machete. She drives off in her boat, leaving Margot alive on their boat.

The relationship became romantic over the course of their correspondence and they made a secret pact to reunite and run away together. They hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island. Meanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned his position as a Khaki Scout. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam.  Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and try to capture them.

Together, they paddle to a neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben, an older relative of one of the Scouts. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Commander Pierce, who is Ward's superior. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. Ben performs a "wedding" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding before they leave. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat. Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scout Master Ward pursue them instead.  A violent hurricane and flash flood strike and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, Sharp decides to become Sam's legal guardian, allowing him to stay on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy.  At Summer's End, Sam is painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner. Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car and tells Suzy that he will see her the following day.

The Moron 5 are more than sure of their innocence but for the life of them, they can't find any single satisfactory argument on how to prove it especially when their opponent would do everything to punish them for whim. Spending three miserable years in prison trying different failed comedic attempts to get out, they finally figured a way to escape. They stalked Beckie and tried to understand why she's fighting so hard to have them imprisoned when it's clear as day that what happened three years ago was a nonsense frame-up. An opportunity came when Beckie's driver got fired for having an affair with her maid and Albert volunteered to apply to replace him. He infiltrated the Pamintuan Residence and together with his four crazily daft friends, they've gathered information about the curious family yet to them, it isn't making any sense at all especially Vecky's unexplained hatred to the five of them. Why is Beckie fighting so hard to have them suffer? The Moron 5 will try harder to know and hopefully understand what's really going on although little did they know that by doing so, everything that they hold dear might be at risk.<ref></ref>

Moving Day (2012 film)
 Clyde (Sasso), a mover, is unhappy with his job at Redmond's Furniture, and is dreaming of a career change.  Clyde, Cedric (Murphy), and AJ (Hogan) are movers who work for Redmond's Furniture and Moving, a [[moving company]]. Near the beginning of the film, while trying to move boxes out of a customers house, they drop several of them over the [[Handrail|railing]] of a staircase. To makeup for the damages, they settle on a $7500 cash reimbursement with the distressed customers.   Soon after, Clyde has a nightmare whereby he lifts the seat of a chair off of its legs and sees dozens of mice. In the nightmare, he also gets a job offer to work at Redmond's for the rest of his life; however, he implies that he would rather be a [[Construction worker|street construction worker]] for the rest of his life.  In the next scene, Clyde starts crying because he believes he is going to be fired. In the meantime, AJ has an affair with one of the customers they had moved, who is an older woman.  Clyde has a meeting with Wilf (Garber), his manager, in which Wilf puts Clyde on [[Probation (workplace)|probation]] for the incident that had taken place at their customer's house. Clyde then gets upset, and Wilf subsequently offers him a [[Turtles (chocolate)|Turtle.]] Wilf also asks Clyde if AJ has been drinking on the job, to which Clyde nervously responds by saying: "No." Wilf thinks Clyde is trying to protect AJ, and tells Clyde to take another Turtle if AJ has been drinking while working. Clyde takes another Turtle.  The Redmond's workers then go to another customer's building, and Denis, another mover at Redmond's, begins hitting on the female [[receptionist]]<nowiki/>s. In an attempt to be humorous and impress the ladies, Dennis puts a sign on Clydes back, saying: "Call me donks." After the ladies inform Clyde of the sign on his back, he gets upset with Dennis and pins him to a wall, insisting that Dennis deletes the video he had taken of the situation. Cedric then informs Dennis that Clyde is on probation, encouraging him to refrain from attempting to get Clyde fired. Denis and Clyde makeup.  AJ is called into a meeting with Wilf, whereby he is put on probation for drinking while working. In the meantime, Clyde takes apart old cardboard boxes and writes several encouraging quotes on them, as well as quotes from people he works with. He puts these quotes up on the walls around his home. The next day, Clyde slept in for work; therefore, Cedric, AJ and Dennis show up at his house. Dennis sees the pieces of cardboard boxes all over Clyde's walls and takes pictures of the quotes which say: "'I need you' - Wilf," and "Dennis is mean to people because he's hurt inside. He thinks he should be famous but he is not. He's unhappy. Poor Dennis." While at Clyde's, AJ drinks again, despite insisting that he has stopped drinking. Wilf calls him, and AJ lies in two ways: He says he is not drinking, and says that they are at a customers home, not Clyde's.  Wilf goes out for dinner with Linda and tells her that Redmond's could not afford [[insurance]] even though they continued to collect insurance premiums from their customers. They kept doing it because no one had yet noticed.  Cedric tells Clyde he only works at Redmond's because he feels like it is his only option, explaining that he cannot get another job because of the 6 years he spent in the [[penitentiary]] for knocking a man out while drunk. Linda goes to see Cedric, Dennis and Clyde at the office and encourages them to attend Wilf's birthday party that night. Wilf then gets Linda an expensive pen and promotes her to a managerial position.  Cedric wife's grandma passes away, and so he quits his job at Redmond's because he and his wife have inherited property in [[South Carolina]]. Wilf was not pleased that Cedric gave him such a short notice, but Cedric points out that he is not on contract since he is being paid under the table, and so he should not be upset.  AJ gets angry with Dennis for ratting him out for drinking, despite that it was actually Clyde who told Wilf. While driving, AJ and Clyde get into an argument, and then crash the Redmond's truck into another vehicle. The company called the police and said the truck was stolen by AJ, so that they would not have to pay for damage.  Later on, Clyde easily confesses that it was him, not Dennis, who ratted AJ out for drinking. He did not know that AJ had already gotten angry at Dennis.  Near the end of the film, the Redmond's workers went out to see a band perform, and planned to go for drinks afterwards. Clyde was upset, because since Dennis wanted to bring ladies with them to the bar after, there was not enough room for him to also join. He felt excluded, and ended up going back to Redmond's office. There, he had a hallucination, where Wilf's dog, Little Buddy, levitates and flies away, and Wilf floats into the room looking for him. Wilf begins to weep because Little Buddy is gone, and Cedric shows up, telling Clyde not to trust Wilf.  At the end of the film, Clyde says goodbye to Cedric as he leaves for his new home in South Carolina.

He tries to kill them and eventually they escape in the car opening the title. Then it turns to be that Ram enjoys a successful career in information technology. He is hit on by Radhi ([[Sindhu Lokanath|Yashika]]) as office romance. He turns down her interest and reveals he is in love with a girl who resides in [[Bangalore]] and he is going to visit her. Ram drives to Bangalore and meets Charu ([[Amala Paul]]) in her apartment. While sleeping, Ram wakes up goes to the streets, search and kills a person (one of them in the car in first scene). Eventually it is revealed that Charu is in some danger and Ram is safeguarding her by not letting her out of that apartment until he cleans up the city for her safety.  Ram's CEO Latha ([[Amala Paul]]) comes to India from the USA and is also engaged to a guy named Vicky. Latha begins to ask her PA Chandru ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]) to find out more about Ram. Charu then asks Chandru to convince Ram to give her lift home, which then Ram agrees to. As Ram and Latha are driving home, they are followed by a red lorry, which attempts to kill both Ram and Latha. Ram manages to push Latha off the car as well as saving himself. Ram is seriously hurt and is taken to the hospital by Latha. Latha then speaks to the doctor, her uncle ([[Jayaprakash]]). Latha explains the doctor that she knows Ram personally and doesn't understand why Ram doesn't recognize her. Ram being unconscious, begins to mutter Charu's name. While Ram and Charu's uncle are having a brief conversation, Latha listens in. It is revealed that Ram and Charu used to work together for a competition and Ram fell in love with Charu from the moment that he met her. It came to a situation where Charu goes to a club to meet a work friend after having found out that her laptop data had been corrupted and she is unable to reach her work. She goes to the club to get a USB backup of her laptop data, before having been teased by drunk guys. These two guys happen to be the two guys Ram tries to kill at the beginning of the film.  Charu goes to the police station to report the two guys who teased her, however, the guys did not take this well and threaten Charu. Ram witnesses this and assumes that there is a problem, however, Charu ensures Ram that he has nothing to worry about and that everything has been sorted.  On the day of the competition, Ram and Charu go through their presentation, to make sure that they have got everything that they need. Ram looks behind him and notices that he has forgotten something. He explains to Charu that he needs to go back, but will be back in time for the competition. Charu being hesitant at first eventually agrees. Ram went back to get the gift that he has bought Charu, so that he can give to her when he proposes his love for her, after the competition.  Ram then manages to go the competition venue on time, however, sees the two guys who teased Charu inside the venue. Ram jumps to the conclusion that the guys have come after Charu and are here to kill her. Ram tries to find them however fails. Ram then reaches the balcony where he witnesses Charu being taken into a car by two guys, which he assumes are the two teasers. Ram then runs after the car but then loses the car and is pushed on the side of the road, where he becomes delusional. He then goes home, and waits for Charu without changing his clothes or having a shower. He sits in one position for two days.  Charu then comes home safe and sound, and is revealed to the doctor that him and Charu have been together ever since.  The doctor comes out of the room to see a shocked Latha. Latha then reveals to her uncle (the doctor) that her family know her as Latha, but she introduced herself to Ram as Charu, as her name was indeed Charulatha. Latha then reveals what actually happen; Ram went to get the present, while she was left to handle the presentation herself, and ends up winning the whole competition, Her father was a main judge on the competition and was also revealed that this competition was built to see how Charu can handle a whole business and would take over from her father. It was then revealed that Ram would not get a position in this company at all, and with Charu feeling guilty, she calls after Ram, which Ram hears and sees. She was taken into the car by her father which made it look like she was being kidnapped to Ram.  The doctor then persuades Latha to act like the Charu that she was while living with him. At first she disagrees, however, after Ram gains his consciousness, Ram receives a call from a so-called 'Charu'. Latha goes back to Bangalore, where she visits the woman who is acting as Charu to Ram over the phone.  It is revealed that a blind woman acts as Charu, only because Ram keeps calling her and asking about her and refuses to believe that this isn't Charu's number. Latha then breaks into her old Bangalore home, and spies on Ram, with her uncle assisting her. Ram comes home and assumingly hugs a so-called Charu. We then realise that it isn't actually Charu he is hugging, but he is hugging nothing but an empty space.  Latha then asks her uncle what had happened to Ram. Ram is suffering from severe delusions and is imagining that Charu is still present with him, hence the reason why Ram didn't recognise her in the first place. The only way these delusions would go, is if Latha acts as if she was Charu, back in Banglore.  Latha then acts as Charu and begins falling in love with Ram. Ram then explains to her that they are going to get married soon. They then reach a temple, where Charu and Ram are meant to be getting married. Latha had planned with her uncle and Chandru a fake killing so that Ram's delusions can leave him, which fails. Latha is then genuinely kidnapped by two guys, who are her so known fiance's friends. It is revealed that her fiance Vicky, is in fact gay and his friends can not accept Vicky getting married to any girl who gets in his way which includes Latha. The two guys attempt on killing Latha but is defeated by Ram. Ram then attempts to save Latha by taking her to the hospital but is then hit on the head. Ram gains his consciousness and goes home and waits for Charu at home, sitting in a position for two days, waiting for Charu. The delusion he sees is Charu coming back to him, in tears and saying that she is alright. Ram bursts into tears and goes to have a shower so that he can relax and start over with Charu. Latha however is still in hospital with her father and uncle by her side. Her uncle reveals that it was him who hit Ram on the head, so that he can take Latha to the hospital to get her checked out, yet he explains to Charu that she better  of with Ram as he will keep her happy. Latha's father agrees and Latha insists that she goes to Ram.  Latha then goes home to Ram, who still believes that Charu has come home long before. The film ends with Latha raising her arms asking for a hug from Ram, which Ram smiles and gives her.  
Much Ado About Nothing (2012 film)
 The plot of the film is largely unchanged from that of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Much Ado About Nothing|original play]]. Differences include the modern-day setting, switching Conrade's gender, eliminating several minor roles and consolidating others into Leonato's aide, and expanding Ursula's role by giving her a number of Margaret's scenes.  In addition, the film attempts to add background to the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick by showing, in an opening scene, a morning after they apparently slept together. Benedick steals away quietly while Beatrice pretends to be asleep.  
Mud (2012 film)
 Two 14-year-old boys in the [[De Witt, Arkansas]] area, Ellis ([[Tye Sheridan]]) and Neckbone ([[Jacob Lofland]]), have found a boat stuck high in a tree on a small island in the [[Mississippi River]]. They want to claim it for themselves but discover someone is living in it. They meet him, a strange man named Mud ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), who claims to have grown up nearby. He tells the boys that he needs food and promises to give them the boat if they help him while he stays on the island.  The boys return with food and ask Mud why he is hiding out; he says he is waiting for his old girlfriend, Juniper ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), whom he describes as beautiful with bird tattoos on her hands. They later spot her grocery shopping in town. Ellis falls for an older high-school girl named May Pearl.  Ellis learns from his father that his parents are heading for divorce. This threatens their old river [[houseboat]]. Once no longer used as a residence by the owner, it will be removed.  Later, Ellis and his mother are stopped at a police roadblock. He then learns that Mud is a fugitive and tells the police that he has not seen that man. Ellis and Neckbone rush back to Mud and ask why the police are hunting him. Mud explains that he killed a man who had gotten Juniper pregnant and pushed her down a flight of stairs, causing her to lose the child. The boys decide to help Mud in exchange for his pistol.  Mud sends Ellis to Tom Blankenship ([[Sam Shepard]]), an older father figure from his childhood, for help. Tom lives across the river from Ellis and agrees to come talk to Mud but is disturbed to hear that Mud is in trouble over Juniper again and refuses to help.  After his plea for help is rejected by Tom, Mud gives the boys a note for Juniper. They find her motel room where another man (the brother of the man Mud killed) is abusing her. Ellis charges at the man but is quickly overpowered. Neckbone and Ellis tell Mud about the man. Mud realizes that the family of the man he killed has arrived to kill him.  King Carver ([[Joe Don Baker]]), the father of the man Mud murdered, and his surviving son ([[Paul Sparks]]) with a handful of bounty hunters talk about staking out Juniper's motel and have paid off the local and state police.  Stealing machine parts and an outboard motor from junkyards, the boys help Mud repair the boat. They also try to reunite Juniper with Mud, but she decides not to. Ellis suffers heartbreak when May Pearl rejects him in front of her friends.  Upon returning to the island, Ellis angrily calls Mud a liar, says he used the boys to do what he was afraid to do, and turned them into thieves. Running away, Ellis falls into a pit containing [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|water moccasins]] and is bitten. Mud jumps in and rescues Ellis. Mud races to get the unconscious Ellis to hospital on the mainland. Recognizing Mud as the wanted man, one of the hospital employees calls the police who, in turn, tip off Carver.  Mud manages to get back to the island where he and Neckbone get the repaired boat into the water. As they agreed before, Mud gives Neckbone a [[M1911 pistol|Colt .45 semi-automatic pistol]] but without bullets. Mud wants to say good-bye to Ellis, so Neckbone takes him to the houseboat where he is recovering. While Mud is in Ellis' room, the Carver son and his posse arrive and start shooting. Tom fires his old [[sniper rifle]], killing several attackers from across the river. Mud saves Ellis and tries to get away but is shot as he dives into the river. The police arrive and find all the posse members dead. One trooper calls King to tell him that his other son is now dead.  Ellis's parents separate. He and his mother move to an apartment in town and their houseboat is demolished, while his father gets a new job far away, before telling Ellis to take care of his mother and departs. Ellis sees some attractive older teenage girls there and smiles. He is uncertain of Mud's fate, but still believes he was protecting Juniper.  Mud is revealed to be alive and recovering on the repaired boat driven by Tom. Many days have passed, and the film ends with them looking ahead at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], and south of that, the Gulf of Mexico.

 Lee Jeok-yo ([[Park Hae-il]]) is a highly respected national poet in his 70s. His thirtysomething assistant Seo Ji-woo ([[Kim Mu-yeol]]) has recently published his first book, described as a [[genre fiction|genre novel]] with psychological insight, and it has shot to the top of the bestseller lists. Only later will it be clear how great his debt is to the poet laureate. On finding a young high school girl, Eun-gyo ([[Kim Go-eun]]), asleep on a chair on his porch, Jeok-yo is instantly enamored and rather than chastising her for breaking into his property, he subsequently agrees to give her a part-time job cleaning his home. As Jeok-yo spends more time in Eun-gyo's company, long-lost feelings are awakened within him, and her exuberance, lust for life, sense of fun and genuine warmth towards him quickly strip the years away in his mind: he increasingly sees himself as the young man he used to be—his love and need for her growing not only because he finds her incredibly beautiful but also as a direct result of how she makes him feel. Deeply smitten, Jeok-yo begins to write a short story about his imagined sexual relationship with the effervescent young woman. However, as the two get ever closer, Ji-woo finds it impossible to hold back from vocalizing his opposition to what he deems to be an inappropriate and wholly repugnant relationship and, on finding Jeok-yo's manuscript, his abhorrence (and jealousy of both Jeok-yo and Eun-gyo's relationship and the beauty of Jeok-yo's writing) boils over and he decides to steal the short story to publish under his own name.<ref></ref><ref name=herald></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

Museum Hours
 When a Vienna museum guard befriends an enigmatic visitor, the grand Kunsthistorisches Museum becomes a crossroads that sparks explorations of their lives, the city, and the ways art reflect and shape the world.  One Vienna winter, Johan, a guard at the grand [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] encounters Anne, a visitor called to Austria for a family medical emergency. Never having been to Austria and with little money, she wanders the city in limbo, taking the museum as her refuge. Johann, initially wary, offers help, and they're drawn into each other's worlds. Their meeting sparks an unexpected series of explorations – of their own lives and the life of the city, and of the way artwork can reflect and shape daily experience. The museum is seen not as an archaic institution of historical artifacts, but as an enigmatic crossroads in which, through the art, a discussion takes place across time with vital implications in the contemporary world. The "conversations" embodied in the museum's collection revolve around the matters that most concern us: death, sex, history, theology, materialism, and so on. It's through the regular lives of the guard and displaced visitor that these heady subjects are brought down to earth and made manifest.  Near the film's end, Johann and Anne are exploring on the fringe of the city when her ill cousin's condition reaches a crisis point.

While Venkat and Senthil are average students who come from a modern background, Pari is from a rich family. Venkat studies engineering as per his father's wishes, over his own wish – to become a [[Wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]], while Senthil, whose family is poor, studies engineering to improve his family's financial situation and get his sister married. Pari, however, studies engineering for his simple passion for machines and devices. He believes that one should follow excellence, not success, as success will take care of itself if excellence is followed. This approach to studies is sneered upon by the dean of the college, Professor Virumandi "Virus" Santhanam ([[Sathyaraj]]). Virus and the faculty favour Pari's classmate Srivatsan alias Silencer ([[Sathyan Sivakumar|Sathyan]]) who believes in mindless [[rote learning]] over understanding to reach his goals of corporate status. Pari constantly spars with Virus and Silencer due to their differences in their educational approaches.  Pari falls in love with Virus' daughter Ria ([[Ileana D'Cruz]]), a medical student when he, Venkat and Senthil accidentally gatecrash her elder sister Swetha's ([[Anuya Bhagvath]]) wedding reception to obtain a free meal. Ria is not impressed with Pari's antics and complains to her father about them. Virus becomes furious with Pari and his friends and tries to break their friendship by claiming that the "rich" Pari is a bad influence on the "less privileged" Venkat and Senthil. While Venkat refuses to break his friendship with Pari, Senthil believes Virus and distances himself from Pari, though they reconcile when Pari saves the life of Senthil's paralysed father, who had suffered a heart attack, by taking him to hospital on Ria's scooter when the ambulance had not arrived on time. Ria too appreciates Pari's practicality and concern for others and reciprocates Pari's feelings. In the yearly exam, Pari stands first in his class, while both Venkat and Senthil come last.  Three years later, during their final year, Pari, Venkat and Senthil break into Virus's house drunk one night to allow Pari to propose to Ria. Venkat and Senthil, who are both drunk, cause a ruckus and urinate on the front door before fleeing. Virus notices Senthil and the next day, he threatens to expel him unless he snitches on Pari. Not wanting to betray his friend or let down his family, Senthil attempts suicide by jumping from Virus' office window and ends up in a coma. However, Senthil soon recovers and following his recovery, he discards his fear of the future. His frankness impresses the interviewers from a company during a [[campus placement]] drive and they hire him. Meanwhile, Venkat successfully convinces his parents to allow him to pursue his wildlife photography dream.  Virus, enraged at Senthil's success, sets an extremely hard final exam to fail Senthil, as the job offer is contingent on graduation. When Ria learns of her father's plan, she helps Pari and Venkat to leak the question paper by providing them with the keys to her father's office. However, Virus catches them and expels them as well as Senthil on the spot. Ria angrily confronts her father, revealing that her late brother committed suicide because he was unable to get into IEC as his father had desired, despite having ambitions of becoming a writer. Meanwhile, Swetha, who is pregnant, goes into labour. A heavy thunderstorm cuts all power and floods the streets, making it impossible for the ambulance to reach Swetha. Pari, Venkat and Senthil deliver the baby using available equipment and an inverter developed by Pari, with Ria instructing him via [[voice over IP|VoIP]]. After the newborn baby is apparently [[Stillbirth|stillborn]], Pari manages to resuscitate the baby. Virus forgives Pari and his friends, and allows them to write their final exams. After the [[convocation]] however, Pari disappears and goes into seclusion.

They are joined by Silencer, who is now a wealthy and successful professional businessman, who is a vice president in his own company, while also being married and having kids in the United States, who is looking to seal a deal with Kosaksi Pasapugazh, a famous scientist and prospective business associate. Silencer's main intention in finding Pari is to see whether Pari is more successful than him; they had made a bet in their first year of engineering on who would be more successful with their study approaches. However, when they reach Pari's house in Ooty, they find a completely different man: the real Panchavan Parivendan ([[S. J. Surya]]).  Confronting Parivendan, Venkat and Senthil learn that their friend was actually a destitute servant boy nicknamed Pappu. Pappu, who worked in Parivendan's household, loved learning, while Parivendan disliked studies. After noticing the boy's intelligence, Parivendan's father ([[Ajay Rathnam]]) agreed to allow Pappu to study in his place instead of working as a servant. In return, Parivendan would pocket Pappu's qualifications and after graduating, Pappu should cease all contact with him and his family. Parivendan reveals that Pappu is now a schoolteacher in [[Dhanushkodi]]. Later, Venkat and Senthil discover that as "Pari" had disappeared, Ria had decided to marry her former boyfriend – a price obsessed banker whom she had dumped when "Pari" made her realise that he loves his expensive items more than her. Venkat and Senthil rescue Ria from her wedding in [[Coimbatore]] and they, along with Silencer, drive to Dhanushkodi.  At "Pari's" school, Venkat and Senthil reunite with their long-lost friend, Ria and "Pari" rekindle their romance, and Silencer mocks "Pari" for becoming a lowly schoolteacher. He asks him to sign a "Declaration of Defeat" document for losing the bet. On seeing "Pari"'s signature, Silencer realises that "Pari" is actually Kosaksi Pasupugazh, and he accepts defeat.

The Newest Pledge
 The morning after a night of binge drinking and patriotic partying, the Omega [[fraternity]] awaken to find a baby on their doorstep.<ref></ref> After little deliberation, the fraternity members, led by their president Hodges, decide to raise the baby and name him Kegston. In a short period of time raising a baby runs the fraternities finances dry, leading Hodges to seek advice from former Omega president, and current professor at the university Professor Street (played by [[Jason Mewes]]).  On the verge of losing their baby due to bankruptcy, Pledge, a freshman fraternity member, suggests that the Omega's throw a party to raise funds. Despite Phi Tau Tau, the rival fraternities best attempt to ruin the party, the Omega's raise the funds necessary to keep Kegston only to be hit with the news that no non-students can live in Greek housing. This leads Hodges, along with his fraternity brothers Night Train, 39, and Renato to visit President Dumervile (played by [[Mindy Sterling]]). Despite schmoozing the President to the best of their abilities, President Dumervile informs the Omega's that it is too late in the year for her to make any changes, and that "rules are rules".<ref></ref>  Days later, with hope dwindling, Night Train, the schools championship [[running back]] gets drafted into the [[NFL]] and decides to use his money to start a scholarship for babies. The school and President Dumervile then allow Kegston to be a student at the university, foiling Phi Tau Tau's second attempt to rid the Omega's of their newest member.  Later in the semester, at the Omega's Spring Formal, Hodges declares Pledge the candidate to succeed him as President of the Omegas. The Omega's hadn't lost a Greek Board election in almost a century, but Rico (played by [[Joseph Booton (actor)|Joseph Booton]]), the leader of the Phi Tau Tau's, creates a campaign slandering the Omega's, stating that they kidnapped the baby. Rico and Pledge's presidential contest culminates at the Greek Board debate where Pledge presents a paternity test to President Dumervile stating who the real father of the baby is.

Nema aviona za Zagreb
  As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when "anything was possible." He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not.  We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the [[carousel]] and sees the sights, including a "Fat Lady" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds.  From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote [[Communism]] and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day.  The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in [[Belgrade]]. The two decide to book a flight to [[Zagreb]] on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, ''Nema aviona za Zagreb'' ("There is no plane to Zagreb" in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. "What ''Nema'' expresses is good will and a great incapacity. ''Nema'' and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark." What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth.  He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use.   Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to [[Millbrook, New York]], to meet the LSD-advocate [[Timothy Leary]]. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master [[Meher Baba]] about LSD and the search for God.   First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.  From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an [[Opel]] automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. [[Marshall McLuhan]] introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer [[Mal Waldron]] about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poetry in English.   :''. . . I make up my mind'' :''Not knowing what my mind is.''  At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a [[flamenco]] singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, "a little angel of God."  At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film.  In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute.  The credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word "nema," as "[[Really and Sincerely]]" by the [[Bee Gees]] plays.  
Neelkanth (film)
 The movie begins with the heart touching montage "India, the country rich with the most ancient culture in the world. ShriRam, the Maryada Purushottam (The supreme human being with regard to observing the restrictions laid down by the society), and Yogeshwar (The God of Yoga) Shri Krushra took incarnation. The period from 1707 to 1858 was particularly difficult. Anarchy prevailed everywhere. Intrigued by the British policy to divide and rule the states are fighting with one another. Holy men have become pompous and hypocrite to serve their own ends. Unscrupulous people in the disguise of holy men roam everywhere to cheat and loot the people. It is the same land where women were elevated to the status of goddess but now they are subjected to heinous cruelty. In the blind desire to have a son, they drown the girl child in milk immediately after her birth. The evil practice of 'Sati' - a widowed woman immolating herself on the pyre of her deceased husband - has become deep rooted. Chaos and anarchy are all-pervading because of ignorance and lack of spiritual understanding. India awaits a reformer."  The film shows true life story of Swaminarayan from his birth, Ghanashyama's gracious-amiable Leela. After death of his parents, on June 29, 1792, Neelkanth begins his journey of awakening. Having resolved to embrace the challenges of nature, he leaves his home in the city of Ayodhya ath the age of 11.

Known articles include a loin cloth, "a rosary, a kerchief, a piece of cloth for filtering water, a small manuscript and inner courage, confidence and a silent spiritual strength.<ref></ref> At the Saryu River, Kaliddatt's fellows Kaushikdatt and other devils throw him in river. Neelkanth is swept away, leaving behind all that was familiar. He took an extraordinary spiritual - incredible journey across the India. He walked alone, barefoot and bare body continuously. This is story of struggle, determination, kindness, courage, compassion, austerity, adventure, faith, fearlessness and survival of child.

 Raju ([[Siddharth Bharathan]]) is the younger son from a wealthy family. Raju, who was in Germany to do [[space research]], was not informed of his mother's demise and has a nervous breakdown when he gets the news. He takes a couple of years to recover. After that he marries his childhood sweetheart Ashwathy ([[Rima Kallingal]]). She is the daughter of their former family chauffeur and the marriage took place much against her mother's wishes. Ashwathy barely has an idea as to what lies in store as Raju has had a history of mental unsteadiness. She has heard about his illness, that he has been mentally disturbed after his mother's death but now, she has to face the situation with virtually no support.  Raju lives in a world of his own, away from all the business deals and money, unlike his elder brother Vishwan ([[Jishnu (actor)|Jishnu]]). But his near and dear ones look at every action of his through the prism of his past illness, which frustrates him. It does not help that he has a rather short temper.

Vishwan has plans to build a resort catering to foreign clients. All this makes Raju very angry and violent, and people begin to think that his illness has resurfaced. Ashwathy is determined to get him back to life with her love. She almost succeeds, but the people around them were not so bothered about compassion, tender human emotions and selfless love.

Nightfall (2012 film)
 20 years ago, a 19-year-old Wong Yuen-yeung was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering an 18-year-old Eva. Now, after being released on [[parole]], he starts stalking Zoe, a young pianist who resembles Eva in appearance. Zoe's father, the famous musician Han Tsui, is very abusive and controlling towards her. He does not allow her to have any male friends and justifies his actions as protecting her from harm.  George Lam, a police inspector, is deeply troubled by his wife's suicide many years ago. He tries to distract himself by working long hours but ends up neglecting his daughter.  One day, Tsui is found dead near the beach with his face disfigured. While investigating, Lam comes across Eva's case and learns that Eva was actually Tsui's daughter. When he asks Zoe and Mrs Tsui about it, he is surprised to hear that Zoe's parents had never told her that she had an elder sister who was murdered. Lam tracks down Wong and questions him but receives only frosty responses. The police suspect that he is the murderer after finding out more about his background from people who knew him, and after he attacked Lam and his colleague. While his team are out on a manhunt for Wong, Lam carefully thinks through the case again and realises that Wong seems to be trying to draw the police's attention towards himself. He also notices that Mrs Tsui is always cleaning the same patch of ground outside her home every time they visit her. They comb the area and discover traces of blood.  When Lam questions her, Mrs Tsui tells him about her husband's abusive treatment of Zoe, and reveals that Zoe is actually the illegitimate daughter of Eva and Eva's lover. Han Tsui had treated Eva in the same way he treated Zoe, and he killed Eva in anger after discovering her secret affair. Eva's lover is none other than Wong, who became the scapegoat for Eva's murder. The police strongly believed that Wong had attempted to rape Eva and then killed her, so they beat him up during questioning to force him to confess. Lam, then a rookie cop, caught a glimpse of his seniors beating up Wong. Wong eventually succumbed to the beating and falsely admitted that he murdered Eva. While serving his sentence, Wong attempted suicide by piercing his throat with a pencil but failed and became mute as a result. The other prisoners scorned and ostracised him. He once beat up four prisoners who harassed him.  Han Tsui's death was actually an accident. He missed his step and fell off the balcony to his death when Zoe pushed him away in self-defence while he was hitting her. Wong took away his dead body and abandoned it at the beach after disfiguring his face so that no one would recognise him. Lam concludes that Wong's true purpose in doing everything he did so far is to divert the police's attention away from Zoe and make them think that he is the murderer.  In the meantime, the police have tracked down Wong and cornered him on a rooftop. Wong manages to convey the words – "Have you ever given your daughter a piggyback ride?" – to Lam before plunging to his death. Later, Lam receives a message sent to him by Wong before his death: Wong said he envied Lam because Lam had the privilege of watching his own daughter grow up, while Wong himself could not because he was in jail. Lam breaks down after reading Wong's message as he feels sorry for having neglected his daughter since his wife's death.  Zoe goes to the police station to turn herself in. When she asks Lam about the mysterious man who has been trying to protect her, he shows her Wong's photos. In a post-credits scene, Lam and his colleague exchange their views on the case and then go to Lam's house to celebrate.  
Night Across the Street
  ''La Noche de Enfrente'' or ''Night Across the Street'' is [[Raul Ruiz (director)|Raul Ruiz’s]] final film. As Ruiz knew his time on the earth was coming to an end, he created a film about the idea of death itself. In this film, there are three [[Dimension|dimensions]] of time that Ruiz plays with. Time as a dimension can be explained further here<ref></ref>  The film begins with the protagonist Don Celso ([[Sergio Hernández (actor)|Sergio Hernández]]) in a classroom taught by a famous French writer [[Jean Giono]] ([[Christian Vadim]]). In this session, Giono lectures about the use of language and how phrases used in different languages simply do not work. As everyone’s eyes are closed, an alarm goes off in Don Celso’s pocket which is a reminder for him to take his medicine. This is followed up by a discussion between Don Celso and Jean Giono outside of class. They both discuss how time stumbles along in life which is ultimately what happens in the entire film. They mention how time is like marbles in which Don Celso points out that these marbles can be worn as a necklace. This refers to the film when Don Celso explores different [[Fantasy|fantasies]] in his life as his current self or child-self shortly after. This entire sequence is an exploration of time that he has with himself.  Immediately after, the story takes place in what we believe to be his current time. He is working at an office where they write [[poetry]]. Don Celso is shown at his desk, away from everybody as he is in his own state of mind, moving his hands like puppets talking to one another. His coworker points out that he has never done this before, but with the previous sequence that we have seen, we can assume that he is moving his hands this way because he is reenacting his conversation that he just had with Jean Giono. This could mean that he is in another [[dimension]] of time until he is alerted by his boss. We later learn in this sequence that Don Celso is only days away from retirement and that he is going to have a retirement party the next day.   We are followed up by Don Celso in his third [[dimension]], as a young boy who calls himself Rhododendron Celso(Santiago Figueroa) or Rodo for short. In this sequence he is interacting with famous pirate, [[Long John Silver]] (Pedro Villagara) or Captain as he asks to be called. In this interaction, we see Celso’s perspective on who he believes Long John Silver to be which clearly dates back to several [[Century|centuries]] ago. Ruiz implements his style as he plays with [[fantasy]] and [[memory]] here as he is shown creating separate worlds for his characters at this early stage in the film which is.   The films then goes back to its first [[dimension]] with Jean Giono as Don Celso and Giono talk about both their lives. We learn here that Don Celso is waiting for the man that is going to kill him soon. This idea of being killed is the ultimate drive for Don Celso as the film continues. The film immediately follows back into the third dimension with Rodo. This stands out in the film because we eventually learn at the end of the film Rodo Celso is the one to kill Don Celso (This will be explained later). The transition from first [[dimension]] to third initially was because Don Celso is asked who his favorite [[historical figure]] is. Rodo responds with [[Beethoven]]. We are introduced to a time where Rodo actually travels into another [[dimension]] (yes there are a lot of time dimension travelling in this film) to speak to Beethoven (Sergio Schmied). In this world with Beethoven, he is not deaf and learns the many innovations and inventions of the 20th century (which brings the Ruizian comedy to play).  Somehow this [[dimension]] is connected with the second [[dimension]] in the form of a [[Narrative|story]]. Don Celso is shown actually reading the [[Narrative|stories]] that we see with Rodo on paper at a recording station.  In Rodo’s story, we learn that he is trying to get his low grade changed to a higher one from the teacher who gave it to him. Throughout parts of this time, Rodo is accompanied by Beethoven. There is a scene where Beethoven is at the cinema with Rodo and he asks him why do people go to the cinema if they don’t know what it’s even about and Rodo responds by saying that we just come to have fun, not learn anything. Though it doesn’t drive the plot anywhere, it is a humorous remark on Ruiz which makes fun of [[Hollywood cinema]]. Despite his journey of trying to improve his grade, we learn that Rodo is a very intelligent young boy who knows just about everything he is asked. After going home unable to change his grade, his parents attempt to whip him with a belt, but is saved by Rodo’s grandfather.   The film progresses back on to the second [[dimension]] with Don Celso. Here we are introduced to Rolo Pedro (Christian Gajardo) who comes into a boarding home to stay with the ultimate goal to kill Don Celso and take his money. Don Celso even knows he is going to kill him by saying it aloud; however, what is important here is when Don Celso and Rolo Pedro are first introduced, Don Celso repeats his name several times and eventually says Rhododendron because they sound very similar to him. This is significant because even though he thinks Rolo Pedro will kill him, it is actually Rhododendron that does.   The film begins to pick up as a few more cuts to different [[dimensions]] are made, but ultimately is carried through the second [[dimension]] with Don Celso. A mass murder happens at the boarding home that he lives at with all the characters that we have met in the film are dead and moved on into another world. Don Celso is the only one left in the boarding home. Ruiz then goes on to play with both the second and third [[Dimension|dimensions]] as he places both the young Rodo Celso and Don Celso in the same dimension in the same conversation. Rodo appears first, but then Don later appears shortly after. This signifies that they are indeed the same person and then makes us feel that the story in which we had originally believed to be the actual [[dimension]] of the real world, becomes questionable or better yet, a [[Narrative|story]]. Throughout the film, we believed Rodo Celso’s story to be the imaginative one, but with Long John Silver’s conversation with Don Celso, we are now unsure of that being the actual truth if there is any to begin with.   This puzzling sequence is followed up by Rodo Celso putting a gun to Don Celso’s head and shooting. As a result, Don Celso enters an entirely new [[dimension]] where the dead all seem to exist (they all have bullet wounds of how they died throughout the rest of the film indicating a change of dimension). Don Celso is shown trying to learn this new place that he finds himself in. As the films winds down to an end, don Celso finds three people at a time in different locations who are all in a state of speaking with the dead. After this moment, they get up with Don Celso and follow him onto the next room. This happens until all the significant characters reunite in one final setting. It is in its own way a funeral service for Don Celso. They all take a seat in the chair as they listen to three of Don Celso’s previous co-workers give speeches about remember Don Celso. This feels like almost a self-reflection of Ruiz and his entire work in [[Film|cinema]].  
A Night in the Woods
 The film follows Londoner Kerry (Anna Skellern) and her American boyfriend Brody (Scoot McNairy) as they travel to Dartmoor for a camping trip. Brody has decided to document their trip with his video camera. He grows irritated and jealous when Kerry invites her cousin Leo (Andrew Hawley), although Brody tries to hide this by acting friendly towards Leo. The trio stops by a pub, where they hear the story of a local legend called The Huntsman, who carves crosses into the foreheads of sinners before killing them.  Brody grows increasingly more jealous of Leo after seeing him and Kerry joking around, making him doubt Kerry’s claims that Leo is her cousin. Things grow more tense as he confronts Leo over footage of Leo sneaking into Kerry and Brody’s home. Brody attempts to catch Kerry and Leo by setting his camera up in the tent, which proves to be effective. It is revealed that not only are the two not related, but that they used to be lovers and Kerry lied to Brody in order to make things easier.  Left alone, Kerry and Leo begin to have a fling, which is cut short when Leo hurts Kerry. He tries to apologize, but is rejected when he suggests that Brody is trying to replace her recently dead father. Leo then leaves Kerry alone in the woods.  Strange things begin to happen around the now alone Kerry such as strange noises and nooses tied to tree branches. Kerry is then chased into the woods by an unseen force, who knocks her out and carves a cross on her forehead. She manages to regain consciousness and returns to the campsite, where she angrily discovers the camera that Brody had set up in the tent as well as footage he had been secretly recording of her. This is further exacerbated by footage of her experiencing a nightmare while sleeping as well as a clip of Brody discussing plans to abandon Kerry in the woods so she can experience a solitude that he once experienced in exactly the same woods 10 years earlier. This infuriates Kerry, who then turns to the camera and threatens to hurt Brody. Her anger is cut somewhat short when the tent is violently shaken and she discovers a devastated Leo, all bruised and cut. Kerry tries to help him, but he attacks her in a fit of rage and chases her into the woods. She runs into a bruised and bleeding Brody, who convinces her that Leo is not himself and that they are being hunted by an unknown force. They try to find a way out of the woods, but Kerry fights with Brody after discovering Leo’s bracelet on the ground and suspecting Brody of wrongdoing. She manages to fight Brody off, killing him in the process but leaving her alone and hunted in the woods.  Kerry then discovers Leo’s digital camera on the ground, where she views a clip of Brody being attacked and dragged away by an unseen assailant. Frightened, Kerry tries to find a way out but is attacked, causing the camera to cut to black.

No (2012 film)
 After fifteen years of military dictatorship and facing considerable international pressure, Chile's government asks the public of Chile to vote in the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|national plebiscite of 1988]] on whether General [[Augusto Pinochet]] should stay in power for another eight years, or whether there should be an open democratic presidential election the following year.  René Saavedra, a successful advertisement creator, is approached by the "No" side to consult on their proposed advertising. Behind the back of his politically conservative boss, Saavedra agrees to participate and finds that the advertising is a dourly unappealing litany of the regime's abuses created by an organization that has no confidence in its efforts. Enticed by the marketing challenge and his own loathing of Pinochet's tyranny, he proposes to the advertising subcommittee that they take a lighthearted, upbeat promotional approach stressing abstract concepts like "happiness" to challenge concerns that voting in a referendum under a notoriously brutal [[military junta]] would be politically meaningless and dangerous.  While the unorthodox marketing theme is dismissed by some "No" members as a facile dismissal of the regime's horrific abuses, the proposal is approved for the campaign. Saavedra, his son, and his comrades are eventually targeted and intimidated by the authorities. Eventually, Saavedra's boss Lucho finds out about his employee's activities, but when Saavedra refuses an offer to become a partner if he withdraws, Lucho goes to head the "Yes" campaign as a matter of survival.  The historic campaign took place in 27 nights of television advertisements, in which each side had 15 minutes per night to present its point of view. During that month, the "No" campaign, created by the majority of Chile's artistic community, proved effective with a series of entertaining and insightful presentations that had an irresistible cross-demographic appeal. By contrast, the "Yes" campaign's advertising, with only dry positive economic data in its favor and few creative personnel on call, was derided even by government officials as crass and heavy-handed.  Although the government tries to interfere with the "No" side with further intimidation and blatant censorship, Rene and his team use those tactics to their favor in their marketing, and public sympathy shifts to them. As the campaign heats up in the concluding days with international Hollywood celebrity spots and wildly popular street concert rallies of the "No" campaign, while the "Yes" side is reduced to desperately parodying the "No" ads.  On the day of the referendum, it momentarily appears that the "Yes" vote has the lead, but the final result turns out to be firmly on the "No" side. The final proof only comes when the troops surrounding the No headquarters withdraw, as the news of the Chilean senior military command forcing Pinochet to concede comes through. After the success, Saavedra and his boss resume their normal advertising business with a new Chile being born.  The film ends with historical footage of Pinochet handing over power to newly elected president [[Patricio Aylwin]].

No One Lives
 While traveling cross country, couple Betty ([[Laura Ramsey]]) and an unidentified man, referred to as "Driver," ([[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]]) encounter a gang of robbers led by dedicated criminal Hoag ([[Lee Tergesen]]), his daughter Amber ([[Lindsey Shaw]]), girlfriend Tamara ([[America Olivo]]), Amber's boyfriend Denny ([[Beau Knapp]]), and the psychopathic Flynn ([[Derek Magyar]]). Suspecting the couple to be wealthy and wanting to redeem himself for a robbery he botched, Flynn has them kidnapped and interrogated about accessing their money by Ethan ([[Brodus Clay]]) in a gas station. However, Betty commits suicide by cutting her throat on a knife Ethan had against her neck, which leads to the Driver breaking out of his handcuffs and killing Ethan.  Meanwhile, Flynn, having brought the Driver's car to the group's hideout, finds a girl in the trunk of the vehicle. Amber realizes the girl is Emma Ward ([[Adelaide Clemens]]), a wealthy heiress who disappeared after 14 of her friends were murdered at a party, and the kidnapped man is the one responsible for the massacre. Amber attempts to be kind toward Emma; however, Emma angrily spits in her face. Following Hoag's orders, Denny and Tamara head to the gas station to contact Ethan, only to find his and Betty's bodies and the Driver missing. They bring Ethan's corpse back to their hideout and inadvertently bring the Driver along with them, who had been hiding in Ethan's body.  The Driver begins his assault on the robbers by first destroying their van and capturing Hoag, whom he later kills by dropping him into a meat grinder. After the group argues over what to do next, Denny volunteers to get their old jeep working so they can escape. Though he succeeds, the Driver shoves him into the open car engine, badly mangling his face. The Driver then chases and injures Amber, but lets her live when he realizes the surviving gang members are leaving. Nevertheless, Flynn accidentally hits Amber with the jeep when she stumbles onto the road. Emma comments on how the only one of them with a soul was killed.  After dropping Denny off at the hospital, Flynn, Tamara, and Emma head to a motel to stay the night. When Flynn uses the Driver's credit card to pay for a room, he inadvertently causes Harris, the motel owner ([[Gary Grubbs]]), to call the police, as the Driver had previously checked himself into the same motel earlier in the day. The Driver himself also arrives at the motel and nearly strangles Tamara to death in the bathroom, but stops when he hears Flynn shoot the sheriff responding to Harris' call. Flynn and Emma find Tamara crucified by the shower-curtain, seemingly dead; Flynn accidentally shoots Tamara when she moves suddenly, which leads to Emma attempting to escape. Though Flynn manages to stop her, he is promptly run over by the Driver in a police car. Emma tries to shoot the Driver with a gun she got from Tamara but runs out of bullets and flees into a nearby junkyard.  When the Driver confronts Emma, she states she is done running and she beats him with a metal pipe until Flynn appears with a shotgun. The Driver notices the danger and throws Emma out of harm's way after which Flynn shoots the Driver in the chest. The Driver survives due to his Kevlar vest and the two engage in a brutal fight. Ultimately, Flynn manages to grab his weapon, but is knocked out by Emma before he can fire it. The Driver states his amazement over this turn but Emma explains she wants to be one who finally kills him and manages to aim the shotgun at him. The Driver then urges her to take the shot. However, because a new shell had not been pumped into the chamber, the firearm fails to operate. Impressed, the Driver cuts out a tracking device he placed inside her stomach and announces that she is free. He then finishes Flynn off with a shotgun blast to the face and also shoots Harris for knowing his real name.  The next day, the Driver murders Denny in his hospital bed with a clipboard while disguised as a doctor, and says "No One Lives", the last line of dialogue in the film. As he leaves, he notices Emma being wheeled into the hospital on a stretcher. He touches her arm before finally departing.

Not Fade Away (film)
 In 1960s suburban New Jersey, a group of friends form a rock band and try to make it big.  In his late teens, Douglas Damiano lives with: his father Pat, who suffers from psoriasis and is physically rough with Douglas; his mother Antoinette, who frequently grows hysterical and threatens suicide; and his sister Evelyn, the film's narrator. Douglas sees his friend Eugene Gaunt singing and playing lead guitar for a band in high school and resolves to join the band to earn the affections of a Grace Dietz. Douglas gets his chance when the band's drummer, Schindewulf, is drafted to go to Vietnam. In the wake of the "[[British Invasion]]", Gene is trying to remodel his band after [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], and he believes Douglas is suited to this style.  The band's membership fluctuate, with an awkward bass player losing his position. The core of the band is Douglas, Gene, and their friend Wells. Gene is the lead singer and guitarist, with Wells on rhythm guitar and Douglas on drums and backup vocals. At a party Gene accidentally swallows a [[marijuana|joint]] while trying to smoke it through a toilet paper roll and is unable to sing. Douglas takes over on lead vocals, and the band's members later agree that he is superior to Gene. Gene feels threatened by Douglas and tries to keep the spotlight on himself. During one concert he juggles firecrackers in protest of the war, but fumbles and burns his scalp, humiliating himself and the band. Douglas goes to Gene's house to formally kick him out of the band, and they end up fighting until Gene's father restrains him.  Douglas gets involved with Grace after a couple of heart-to-heart conversations. Their relationship suffers a blow when Wells reveals that Grace used to [[oral sex|blow]] him (and others) regularly. Douglas and Grace have an argument in which she wrongly accuses him of sleeping with her sister Joy. Joy, an eccentric deeply invested in the counter-culture movement, develops increasing friction with her father, who ultimately has her committed to a mental hospital. After this, Douglas and a grief-stricken Grace get back together.  Douglas initially tells his father that he intends to join the army and get an ROTC scholarship, but abandons these plans after the Vietnam War begins. He drops out of college to pursue his musical career full-time, which drives a rift between himself and Pat. Pat learns that his psoriasis is actually [[mycosis fungoides]] cancer, and he begins to mellow somewhat, sharing a dinner with his son and revealing a personal secret that involves Douglas' mother.  Meanwhile, two years after the band's inception, Douglas and Wells get the opportunity to audition for [[Jerry Ragovoy]]. They recruit Gene back into the band for the audition, though Gene tells them he wants a "featured" credit on their performance of an original song, "The St. Valentine's Day Massacre". Ragovoy sees potential in the band, but outlines a rigorous work schedule, described as "rock and roll boot camp", before he's ready to sign them to a contract. He states that great music is "ten percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration," a sentiment earlier expressed to Douglas by his father. The band members are disillusioned with this prospect, Douglas in particular.  While test-driving Gene's motorcycle, Wells swerves into a tree, breaking multiple limbs. This postpones their potential record deal for another year. Douglas, who is losing interest in the rock and roll lifestyle, decides to go to film school, which takes him and Grace to California. While at a party in Los Angeles, Douglas sees [[Charlie Watts]] leaving the house and hears a rumor that [[Mick Jagger]] is in the bathroom with several women, though nobody at the party actually sees Jagger.  Douglas tries to hitchhike home and is invited into the car of a strange woman wearing frightening face paint, who comments that he looks lonesome.  Unsettled, Douglas refuses the ride and walks home after briefly windowshopping at a music store. Looking around the downtown scene, he looks to the sky and witnesses again the illuminated clouds that so inspired him before. Smiling, Douglas walks down the street and off camera.  His sister Evelyn enters the scene and addresses the camera directly, commenting that she is writing an essay about America's two biggest innovations: nuclear weapons and rock 'n roll.  She speculates as to which one will win in the end, then dances to [[The Modern Lovers]]' song "Roadrunner", performed by [[The Sex Pistols]], in the middle of the street.

Not Suitable for Children
   Jonah ([[Ryan Kwanten]]) is a young man without a care in the world. At one of his parties, the power goes out because Jonah has not paid his electric bill, but it gets turned back on thanks to his neighbor. Jonah meets up with Becky ([[Kathryn Beck]]) and they retreat up to his room away from the party, only for Becky to find a lump in Jonah's testicle. Jonah goes to see a doctor, who reveals that Jonah has testicular cancer. He tells Jonah that they can remove it in time, but Jonah's upset that he won't be able to father children. The doctor suggests that Jonah uses a sperm bank in the event that he would like to have children after the operation.  Now at a sperm bank, Jonah is left in a room to privately produce his semen. After he is finished, he returns home to his best friends and fellow party hosts, Stevie ([[Sarah Snook]]) and Gus ([[Ryan Corr]]). When Stevie arrives home from work, Gus blurts out that Jonah has cancer, much to Jonah's dismay. Gus asks if he would still like to have the party scheduled for the coming Friday, and Jonah allows them to keep the date, not wanting to explain his condition to party-goers.  Jonah receives a call from the sperm bank and goes in for a meeting. The nurse explains that Jonah falls into a small percentage of men whose sperm cannot be frozen because of biological complications. Jonah asks what other options there are, now very worried that he will never have children. The nurse replies with, "Well, do you have a girlfriend?"  Jonah then begins the complicated journey of finding a woman to carry his child. He first approaches his ex-girlfriend Ava ([[Bojana Novakovic]]) who is disgusted with Jonah for even contacting her. He then tries Becky (or "Stalker Becky" as Gus calls her) who rejects him by claiming she never thought of her and Jonah as a couple. Jonah never tells the girls he asks that he has cancer. Jonah goes back to the doctor to ask for more time and moves his operation three weeks.  Meanwhile, Gus, Stevie, and Jonah realize that hosting parties could be their job. After the power went out in the earlier party and party-goers pitched in to help pay, Gus realizes that the three of them could make a weekly salary if they held a party once a week. Jonah's first "paycheck" is worth over $700.  Jonah then begins making lists of all the women he has ever dated or known and asks them if they would ever consider after his child. He is rejected by all the women he asks. Stevie suggests adoption and Jonah looks into it, but soon figures out that in order to be a candidate for adoption you must have a clean health record, and Jonah has "cancer" written all over his. After having no luck, Stevie suggests that Jonah try an "arrangement" with a woman. Stevie says she knows of a lesbian couple at her work who were looking into sperm donation and sets up a meeting for Jonah. The meeting does not go in Jonah's favour and the couple declines Jonah's offer. Stevie suggests another woman at work who wants a child, but is not married and sets up a meeting with her too. Although Jonah goes home with her, he ends up not sleeping with her. He claims that he was too drunk to have sex and couldn't focus.  Stevie starts to like the idea of an arrangement, especially after Jonah claims that he would give his house to the woman who carried his child. Stevie accidentally tips off Jonah that she would be interested in a deal and sends Jonah out of her room to think.  At the weekly party Stevie stays in her room, claiming that she has a migraine. Jonah calls her and tells her that he would give her anything if she would carry the child. The morning after the party, Jonah receives a text message from Stevie asking him to come to her room. It is revealed that the whole night Stevie stayed up and wrote a contract concerning her and Jonah's deal. Jonah reads through the contract and signs it and Stevie tells him that they have a four-day window that Stevie should be ovulating in.  They book a room at a cheap motel for the four days, with the final being two days before Jonah's operation. Stevie and Jonah go to a pharmacy and buy a syringe because Stevie does not want to have sex with Jonah. Back at the motel, Jonah accidentally breaks the syringe. Stevie says that it should be okay, they just missed the first day of a four-day window. Jonah is frustrated and Stevie gives in and says she is okay with natural. They have sex, and for the rest of the four days they meet at the hotel, have sex, and then stagger their arrival at home so Gus doesn't notice.  On the fifth day while Stevie is at work, she gets her period. She calls Jonah and asks him to meet her outside her work. They get into a fight, with Stevie claiming she was happy her period came because she was having second thoughts anyway. Jonah leaves, realizing he is out of time.  Stevie is absent at the party that night, but Gus has made a call to Ava. Ava arrives at the party, first mad at Jonah for not telling her he had cancer and then says she would carry his child if he wanted. They go upstairs to his room and have sex, but Jonah pulls out at the last moment because he realizes he is in love with Stevie. Jonah leaves to go find her, hoping she is home. Jonah asks Ava to stay in his room. Jonah finds Stevie, but Ava comes out of Jonah's room and Stevie storms off, feeling betrayed. Meanwhile, the police arrive to stop the party.  Jonah catches up to Stevie and tells her that he loves her, but Stevie leaves.  The next morning, Jonah's sister comes to pick him and Gus up for the operation. Jonah is sad at first, but Stevie does show up for moral support. Stevie tells Jonah (in front of Gus, who never suspected anything going on between them) that she thought Jonah would make a great father and he should look into sperm donation or adoption with her. They kiss and Jonah is wheeled away into the operating room. The final line of the movie is, "What the f***." Said by a very confused Gus.

Cindy, who works in the town's local museum, and Jim, who is employed at the town's historic [[pencil]] factory, reside in the drought-stricken town of [[Stanleyville, North Carolina]], self-labeled as "the pencil capital of the world". The Greens are informed by doctors that they are [[Infertility|unable to conceive]]. Distraught by the news, Jim convinces Cindy to dream up their ideal child and write the child's characteristics and life events on slips of notepad paper.  The couple place the notes inside a wooden box and bury it in their backyard garden. After an immediate thunderstorm, which seemingly affects only their property, a ten-year-old arrives at their home claiming the Greens as his parents. After finding the box they buried smashed to pieces around a large hole in the ground where they originally buried it, and finding the boy inside their house, covered in mud, they realize that the boy, named Timothy, is actually a culmination of all their wishes of what their child would be. The Greens also discover that Timothy has a startling feature: he has leaves growing on his legs, which he can only cover up by wearing long [[Sock|tube socks]].  The next day, at a family picnic, Timothy is introduced to members of his family: Brenda Best ([[Rosemarie DeWitt]]), Cindy's pompous sister; James Green Sr. ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), Jim's estranged father; and Mel ([[Lois Smith]]) and Bub ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]), Cindy's paternal aunt and uncle.  The parents take Timothy to their friend and town [[botanist]], Reggie ([[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]), where they learn that Timothy's leaves cannot be removed.  Timothy begins to attend school, where he meets Joni Jerome ([[Odeya Rush]]), a girl he encounters during a bullying incident, with whom he begins a friendly relationship. Meanwhile, the town's pencil factory, the largest employer in Stanleyville, begins laying off its employees. Timothy convinces Cindy and Jim to design a prototype for a new pencil in an effort to keep the pencil-producing business viable.  Unbeknownst to the parents, one of Timothy's leaves falls off each time he fulfills one of the qualities listed on the original slips of paper. Timothy eventually reveals to Cindy and Jim that his time of existence is short and that he will eventually disappear. During another intense thunderstorm, he vanishes from their house.  The Greens' meeting with the adoption counselor concludes with Cindy presenting a letter that Timothy left them before leaving. In the letter, he explains to them what he did with each of his leaves that fell off, with a montage sequence showing each person whose life Timothy touched. After an unspecified amount of time, the adoption counselor is shown pulling up to the Greens' house in a car with the little girl who is to become the Greens' daughter, Lily.

A low-intensity earthquake hits the city, and the Kanji's shop is the only shop that is destroyed.  Next day at the insurance office, Kanji and his neighbor-assistant Mahadev learn that the disaster claim does not cover any damage caused by natural calamities classified under "[[Act of God]]". Running out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God but fails to find a lawyer for such a lawsuit. Finally, he meets Hanif Qureshi ([[Om Puri]]) and his daughter ([[Puja_Gupta_(actress)|Puja Gupta]]), a poor Muslim lawyer family. Qureshi, a disabled man, helps him file the case as Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj,Gopi Maiyya ([[Poonam Jhawer]]) and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]) summoning them to the court as representatives of God on earth.  During the preliminary hearing, opposition lawyer Sardesai ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]) asks the judge to dismiss the case. But Kanji points out that religious groups claim to represent God on Earth and speak on his behalf. Hence, they are answerable for his actions. The Judge agrees and the court accepts the case. However, Kanji soon finds himself trapped amongst armed fundamentalists, with his mortgage bank occupying the house, and his wife leaving him. In all instances, Kanji is rescued by Krishna Vasudev Yadav ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who claims to be a real estate agent, rides a hot-shot motorbike. Krishna buys Kanji's house from the bank, but allows Kanji to stay with him.  The lawsuit causes a public outcry. As Kanji and Krishna watch this on TV, Krishna advises him to go to the media and present his views to the public. Kanji's interview receives wide coverage and public opinion swings in his favour. Meanwhile, hundreds of people, whose insurance claims were rejected due to "Act Of God" show up at Hanif Qureshi's house and join the lawsuit. Kanji agrees to fight on behalf of all of them. In the next court session, [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[priest]]s and Muslim [[Mullah]]s are also summoned to the court as defendants. However, lawyer Sardesai points out that Kanji has no document that can prove the disaster was an "Act of God". The judge orders Kanji to present a written proof that will support his claim.  Kanji loses hope, but Krishna rescues the day again by advising Kanji to read the [[Bhagavad Gita]], and the other holy books such as [[The Quran]] and [[The Bible]], telling him that he would find the answer of all his questions. Kanji studies the books intensively for a month. In the next session, Kanji points out a passage present in all the holy books which says that "This world is a creation of God, and it is his will to allow it to grow or destroy", which strengthens his case. As he nears the end of his argument, he suddenly loses consciousness. He is rushed to the hospital, where doctors unsuccessfully try to revive him, leaving him comatose. They announce to the media that Kanji has been paralyzed, and that only God can now save him. When Kanji opens his eyes, he finds Krishna in front of him. Krishna caresses the left side of Kanji's body with his key chain and Kanji is able to walk again.  Krishna then reveals to the confused Kanji that he himself is [[Lord Krishna]], and he has saved Kanji to show him that God does exist. Kanji then learns that he has been in a coma for a month and that a lot of things have happened during the period. The lawsuit's verdict was in his favor and religious organisations were ordered by court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs; people have started calling Kanji a "God".  Meanwhile, Leeladhar, Gopi Maiyya, and Siddheshwar have opened a temple dedicated to Kanji and accumulated millions in donations. He also learns that as per his own "will", he is about to be removed from the ventilator and thousands have gathered for his funeral procession. Krishna gives him a choice of stopping the procession or to sit back quietly. Kanji decides to fight and Krishna takes him on his motorbike to stop the procession. Kanji arrives to find his statues erected at the place where his shop once stood. He wades through the stunned crowd and breaks the statue, then admonishes the crowd about trusting in God-men. He advises them to search for God in themselves, not in statues. When the crowd's anger turns towards the collected God-men, he prevents them from further violence and tells them to allow the cheating group to leave peacefully, advising them not to believe in them anymore.  After successfully completing the job, he goes back to Krishna to thank him, only to find him and his motorcycle disappeared. Kanji's family arrive and they are reunited. On their way home, Kanji sees Krishna's key chain on the floor. When he is about to secure it inside his jacket, he hears Krishna's voice, telling him to get rid of the key chain as fear of god was what he fought against all this time. Kanji smiles and throws it away and sees it disappear into the sky with a flash.<ref name=cast></ref>

The story opens with a phone call from his mother who requests him to visit her but Raj defers her request on the pretext of work pressure. Neither does he care for his wife's views about life in general nor does he show any sympathy towards his servant who requests for a leave to see his ailing mother. Raj's ill behaviour extends to his neighbour Mr Sharma played by Ajay Arora, as well in the matters of parking cars.  The heartless attitude of Raj gets apparent when he ignores a man on the road who is lying in a pool of blood because of an accident. At work Raj recruits Jenny, a woman with no good qualifications when she gives him a hint that she is ready to please him outside the office and later that night they get intimate with each other. One day Megha, a team member, at work, approaches him to save her job for not performing well. Raj tells her that he can help her out if she agrees to compromise with him. Left with no choice Megha gives in to him due to which not only her job is saved but also a promotion is given to her.

When asked by Raj, the technician says that the report will be given directly to the employers. Suspecting that he has HIV, now Raj goes under depression.  During this period, he recalls his nasty and mean behaviour with people and regrets sincerely. He starts valuing and caring for his mother, wife, colleagues and also the servant. However, the biggest lesson he learns is from his neighbour Mr Sharma who when asked the secret behind his composed attitude, explains Raj that the only truth of life is death and when everybody has to die one day why hate or cheat anyone.  After a month, Raj gets a call from TJ computers enquiring about his joining. When Raj meets Mr Soni, he gets to know that actually the report is normal and the test for HIV gave a negative result. Surprised and majorly relieved, Raj joins the organisation and begins a new life. Life offers him temptations again in the form of Sandy who comes for a job. For few minutes Raj gets carried away but when he asks her to submit a medical report with HIV test before joining the work, the word HIV brings him back to his senses, making him recollect his depression during the days he suspected himself of having HIV.

Meanwhile, Garp reveals to Coby and Helmeppo that Zephyr once believed in the navy's justice and became an Admiral after serving as a soldier in the navy. When Zephyr's wife and son were killed by a pirate who resented him, Zephyr became an instructor. One day, most of Zephyr's recruits were killed and Zephyr lost his arm after being attacked by a pirate with Devil Fruit powers. Zephyr acquired a weapon developed by the navy's scientist to defeat Devil Fruit users and organized a strike unit. However, when the pirate who attacked him was chosen to serve as a Warlord, Zephyr left the Navy, organizing the Neo Marines as a result.  Back on Dock Island, Kuzan reveals that Zephyr is targeting the three volcanic islands known as End Points. If all three islands erupt in a short period of time of each other, it would result in a giant eruption covering the world's oceans and killing everyone in them. The Straw Hats confront the Neo Marines on the third End Point and are victorious. Kizaru and the navy confront Zephyr and the Straw Hats but the ex-Admiral allows the Neo Marines, Kuzan and the Straw Hats to escape the island. As Zephyr fights to his death and Ain and Binz mourn their loss, the Straw Hats return to Dock Island, giving their gear and weapons back to Mobston, before going their separate ways.

Situated near the reservoir of a dam, the village with its tranquillity of life, innocence of people and the beauty of the place charms him and he quickly adapts to his new life. He befriends the locals and falls in love with a native of the village, Kalyani ([[Shritha Sivadas]]).  Everything goes well for him, until one fateful day, the bus breaks down en route to Gavi. The passengers are provided with alternative transport and servicemen are called in for the repairs. The bus driver Suku ([[Biju Menon]]),from [[Palakkad]], gets drunk with a friend during the repairs, making him unable to drive.

Dim lighting of the evening, fog and distractions from his conversations with Suku makes him late to see a person standing on road. The brakes are applied too late and the bus presumably hits him. In the panic of the situation and unable to think straight, they send the bleeding victim in a pickup truck that arrived soon after. They lie about the accident and pretends it to be a hit-and-run, while the driver of the truck assures to take him to hospital. One of the bags of the victim gets misplaced and they take it with them.  Guilt-ridden, Iravi along with Suku, search the victim’s bag and recognize him to be Devan ([[Hemanth Menon]])– the son of Venu master (a retired well-respected school headmaster and the current village president) and the fiancé of Anna, his childhood friend. He works in [[Surat]], [[Gujarat]] and is to be married during his current visit. They search for him the next day in the hospitals, but is staggered to know that he is not admitted anywhere. Two days later, the police find his corpse at the bottom of hill, seemingly jumped off of the cliff. Without any other leads, the police believe it to be a suicide, but the two know otherwise.

Meanwhile, Anna ([[Ann Augustine]]) finds Devan’s bag with Iravi through Kalyani, who mistakes the bag to be his. Iravi’s grief leads him to confess, taking the blame entirely to himself.

Bhadran is the local handyman of the village and the shutter operator of the dam’s reservoir. During his childhood, his father had committed suicide in the dam, for the grief of his wife eloping with someone.

The villagers know him as a good fellow with a peculiar attitude. He had loved Anna since childhood, known to none – even to his best friend. He secretly admired her, even when she was engaged to Devan. On his visit, Devan called Bhadran, who came with the truck driver, to take him home.

Miranda tells him to leave but finds out that the gang will need to bring a koala to Bog instead of the real Koala Kid and Charlotte will have to do. Miranda offers to take her place. Charlotte goes to find Johnny while the kangaroo and the wombat army manage to distract and capture all the gang but the vulture.   Charlotte finds Johnny along with Hamish, Higgens and a [[prophetic]] [[peg-leg]] wombat and they decide to finally help Johnny get what he really wants, Miranda.

Outpost: Black Sun
 Beginning immediately after the events of [[Outpost (2008 film)|the first film]], Nazi-hunter Lena (Catherine Steadman) is on the trail of a notorious war-criminal scientist, Klausener, who at the close of World War II had begun trials of a frightening new technology that can create an immortal army. While interrogating Neurath, one of Klausener's old Nazi colleagues, he dies from a heart attack. She searches his body and finds a map of Eastern Europe and documents relating to Hunt, the man from the first movie who was hired to locate an abandoned SS bunker that was the Site of Klausener's experiments. This indicates that Neurath and Klausener were the ones who hired Hunt, as well as the fact that the second mercenary team sent in to check out the bunker by Klausener report to him that they can find "no trace of your operative or his team", obviously referring to Hunt, D.C and the other mercenaries. Lena's search for Hunt, whom she believes can take her to Klausener, leads her to a war zone in Eastern Europe (although the exact location is never mentioned, maps clearly show former [[Yugoslavia]]). There she runs into an acquaintance, a physicist, Wallace (Richard Coyle). He informs her that Hunt and his mercenary bodyguards went to find the bunker and never returned. He encourages her to stop her search because he knows what is coming and she refuses. So, pooling resources, they end up helping a professional military unit they meet take on the advancing army, the product of Klausener's experiments, a battalion of zombie Nazi Storm Troopers. Their leader, Brigadefuhrer Gotz, also known as the 'breather' and another of Klausener's old SS associates, has attached Hunt to the large generator that controls the undead soldiers. Using Hunt, Gotz has managed to increase the range of the electro-magnetic field emitted by the generator. This has enabled him and his soldiers to travel beyond the bunker and massacre scores of people. Lena, Wallace, and the unit aim to shut down the source of the evil army and prevent a Fourth Reich.

Painted Skin: The Resurrection
 In the 500 years that have passed since the events of the previous film, the fox demon Xiaowei has been imprisoned in ice for violating the demon code. Que'er, a quirky bird demon, rescues Xiaowei, and the two leave in search of a man who is willing to give his heart to Xiaowei so that she may become human. They first encounter a boorish prince who scoffs at the suggestion, so they take his heart. Xiaowei uses her magical powers to bait another potential donor, a general who dons a gold mask that covers half of his face. Curious about the general's identity, Xiaowei incapacitates him, but discovers later that her rescuer is not a man, but a woman with half of her face disfigured.  Xiaowei accompanies the mysterious woman to the White City at the border, where the woman is revealed to be Princess Jing, the youngest daughter of the ruling family who is inspecting the military outpost led by General Huo Xin. Huo once served as Jing's lead bodyguard and they developed a deep mutual affection. However, Huo remained faithful to his profession and spurned the princess's confessions to him. Princess Jing's face was disfigured by a monstrous bear while she was out in the forest. Huo showed up too late but still managed to kill the bear and save her.  That evening, while performing for Jing, Huo and his men, Xiaowei malevolently enchants the general. Unaware of Xiaowei's bewitchment and feeling betrayed by Huo, Jing throws herself into a lake, but Xiaowei rescues her. Revealing her magical powers to Jing, Xiaowei suggests that the princess's disfigurement will prevent Huo from ever loving her and convinces Jing that they should switch appearances to test Huo.  Meanwhile, Que'er, while walking through the White City at night, is accosted by two hooligans. Pang Lang, a town dweller who claims to have descended from a family of demon hunters, intervenes, but not before Que'er rips out the heart of one of her tormentors, revealing herself as a demon. Pang Lang tries to warn Huo about the demons but is prevented from entering Huo's residence by his guards.  That night, Jing, in disguise as Xiaowei, seduces the enchanted Huo. The next day, exploiting Jing's desire for Huo's seemingly unrequited love, Xiaowei suggests she and Jing exchange appearances permanently. Huo enters and, in a final attempt to reclaim his affection, Jing exposes Xiaowei as a demon and orders Huo to kill her. The enchantment prevents Huo from following the order, so Jing attacks him in frustration.  Suddenly, the army of the neighbouring Tianlang kingdom, led by an evil witch doctor, arrives at the White City to seize Princess Jing, who has been betrothed to the Tianlang prince. Jing refuses to accept the marriage, forcing Huo to protect the city. Jing ends the fighting by threatening to take her own life, and the Tianlang forces agree to retreat if Jing gives herself up in three days. Unwilling to marry a man other than Huo, Jing offers up her heart to Xiaowei so that the two may switch bodies and thus their destinies.  Xiaowei, in disguise as Jing, arrives at the Tianlang camp and discovers that her fiancé is the boorish prince whose heart she earlier consumed and that the Tianlang plan to reinvigorate him with her heart, which is actually Jing's. Without her demon magic, Xiaowei realises she can not stop this plan.  Que'er reveals to Pang Lang that Xiaowei and Jing have switched identities, and the demon hunter disseminates the information to Huo. Just as Jing is about to consume her first heart, completing her transition into a demon, Huo intervenes. He blinds himself with his sword, demonstrating his commitment to Jing and breaking the power of Xiaowei's enchantment. Que'er, Jing and Huo then rush to the Tianlang camp to reclaim Jing's heart. The four defeat the Tianlang forces, but Que'er is killed in the battle. Huo offers his own heart to Xiaowei in exchange for Jing's, but Xiaowei decides to return Jing's heart unconditionally. Under the bewitching moment of a parting eclipse, Xiaowei's soul merges with Jing's body and Jing's face is healed in the process. The film concludes with Huo and Jing preparing to live happily ever after, while Pang Lang finds a bird resembling Que'er in her true form and obtains a feather similar to the one he got from her when they first met.

Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being ridiculed by his peers. His best friend, Neil Downe, is an overweight boy who is bullied himself and finds in Norman a kindred spirit. After rehearsal of a school play commemorating the town's execution of a witch three centuries ago, the boys are confronted by Norman's estranged and seemingly deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who tells his nephew that he soon must take up his regular [[ritual]] to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Mr. Prenderghast dies.  During the official performance of the school play, Norman has a vision of the town's past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a [[witch hunt]], embarrassing himself and leading to his father Perry grounding him. His mother Sandra tells him that his father's stern manner is because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees [[Vengeful ghost|Prenderghast's spirit]] who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him swear to complete the task, Prenderghast's spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghast's house (having to take it from his [[corpse]]).  He then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of [[fairy tales]]. Alvin, a school bully, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect. A ghostly storm resembling the witch appears in the air, summoning the cursed dead to arise as [[zombie]]s, who chase the boys along with Norman's 17-year-old sister, Courtney; and Neil's older brother Mitch, down the hill and into town. Having realized that the witch was not buried in the graveyard, Norman contacts classmate Salma (who tells them to access the Town Hall's archives for the location of the witch's unmarked grave) for help. As the kids make their way to the Town Hall, the zombies are attacked by the citizenry. During the riot, Norman and his companions break into the archives but cannot find the information they need. As the mob moves to attack Town Hall, the witch storm appears over the crowd. Norman climbs the Hall's tower to read the book, in a last-ditch effort to finish the ritual, but the witch strikes the book with [[lightning]], hurling Norman from the tower and deep into the archives.  Unconscious, Norman has a [[dream]] where he learns that the witch was Agatha Prenderghast, a little girl of his age who was also a medium. Norman realizes that Agatha was wrongfully convicted by the town council when they mistook her powers for [[witchcraft]]. After awakening, Norman encounters the zombies and recognizes them as the town council who convicted Agatha. The zombies admit that they only wanted to speak with him to ensure that he would take up the ritual, to minimize the damage of the mistake they made so long ago. Norman attempts to help the zombies slip away so they can guide him to Agatha's [[grave]], but is cornered by the mob. Courtney, Mitch, Neil, and Alvin rally to Norman's side and confront the crowd, arguing that their rage, fear, and misunderstanding make them no different than the cursed townsfolk from long ago. Although the mob calms down, the witch unleashes her powers to create greater havoc throughout the town.  Judge Hopkins guides Norman's family to the grave in a forest. Before the grave is reached, Agatha's [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers separate Norman from the others. Norman finds the grave and interacts with Agatha's vengeful spirit, determined to stop the cataclysmic [[tantrum]] she has been having over the years. Though she attempts to push him away Norman holds his ground, telling her that he understands how she feels as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]], that her vengeance has only made her like the ones who wronged her, and eventually forcing her to remember happier days. Having finally encountered someone who understands her plight, Agatha is able to find a measure of peace and cross over to the afterlife. The storm dissipates, and she and the zombies all fade away. The town cleans up and regards Norman as a hero. In the end, Norman watches a horror film with the ghost of his grandmother and his family, who have grown to accept Norman for who he is.

Alex and Doug arrive home and Doug goes next door, believing he saw Holly and Wyatt. Alex finds Ben's body and is suddenly knocked down by a force, presumably Toby. She flees to Katie's home and finds Doug being dragged out of sight. She searches for him when she hears Wyatt's voice. Suddenly, Katie runs towards the camera, shrieking demonically. Alex escapes from Katie by jumping through a window and finds Wyatt in the yard. Wyatt looks behind Alex and she sees dozens of witches running towards her. As she turns around, Katie lunges at her.

 Anita ([[Macy Gray]]), the [[chain smoking|chain-smoking]] maid of the Jansen family, recounts to an unseen reporter the events of the summer of 1969, when idealistic reporter Ward Jansen ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) came back to his fictional hometown of Lately in Moat County, Florida, to investigate the events surrounding a murder in an effort to exonerate a man on death row, Hillary Van Wetter ([[John Cusack]]). In 1965, swamp-dwelling [[alligator]] hunter and small-time criminal Van Wetter has been jailed for the murder of a violent and unscrupulous local sheriff, Thurmond Call. Four years later, Charlotte Bless ([[Nicole Kidman]]), a woman from [[Mobile, Alabama]] whom Van Wetter has never met but who has fallen in love with him after exchanging correspondence, is now determined to prove his innocence and have him released so they can marry.  Charlotte requested the help of Ward and his colleague, Englishman Yardley Acheman ([[David Oyelowo]]), who are both investigative reporters from ''[[The Miami Times]]''. Ward's younger brother, Jack Jansen ([[Zac Efron]]), is hired as their driver. Ward has mixed feelings about returning home to his estranged father, who runs a local newspaper and distributes ''The Miami Times'' in their town. Both Jansen brothers dislike their father's latest girlfriend, Ellen. Jack now works as a paperboy for his father's business after having been expelled from college for vandalism, ending his prospective career as a professional swimmer. His only real friend is Anita, who brought him and Ward up after their mother left them.  The evidence against Van Wetter is inconsistent and Ward and Yardley are confident they can expose Van Wetter as a victim of [[redneck]] justice. Meanwhile, Jack has fallen in love with Charlotte, who only desires Van Wetter. During a day at the beach, Jack gets stung by a jellyfish and has a life-threatening allergic reaction. Charlotte saves his life by urinating on him, an embarrassing circumstance that his father promptly exploits for an article in his newspaper. Anita realizes that Jack can never stop thinking of Charlotte as she is his first true love.  Van Wetter is hostile to the reporters at first, and contrary to the romantic portrayal he had painted of himself in his letters to Charlotte, he reveals himself to be a racist, a sexist and, in general, a rude man with anger issues. One day, after finally acquiring some useful information from Van Wetter, the Jansens travel to meet Van Wetter's uncle Tyree. The man is the only one who can corroborate Van Wetter's alibi, since, according to Van Wetter, the two men were stealing [[sod]] from a golf course in [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]] the night of the murder. Tyree, who lives in pitiful conditions in the middle of the swamp with his "[[white trash]]" family, is initially ill-disposed and wary of admitting his own crime to save his nephew's life, but finally caves in. In the meantime, Yardley and Charlotte have visited the golf course to verify that side of the story; Yardley comes back claiming to have tracked the developer who bought the sod stolen by Hillary and Tyree, but the man only agreed to talk upon the promise to remain anonymous, so Yardley refuses to disclose his name even to Ward. Satisfied with his findings, Yardley goes back to Miami to start writing the article.  Suspicious of Yardley's motives, Ward decides to go check the truth in Ormond Beach himself, with Jack and Charlotte in tow. During the trip, Ward gets drunk, approaches two black men in a bar, and takes them to his motel room. During the night, Charlotte wakes up Jack after hearing alarming sounds from Ward's room, and the two find Ward tied up, after being raped and tortured by the two men. As Ward is taken to the hospital, Jack does not resent him for secretly being a homosexual or for "what he was into", but just for keeping from him this side of his adult life.  While Ward's still in the hospital, Jack goes to Miami to try and convince Yardley not to publish the article in his brother's name without checking all the facts first. During the confrontation, Yardley reveals he's actually an American pretending to be English to escape discrimination. He also reveals he had given Ward sexual favors in the past, which was the beginning of Ward's guilty, self-hating infatuation with black men.  After the article is published, Van Wetter obtains a pardon and is released from prison. He takes Charlotte away to the swamp to live with him. Months later, she is unhappy with the demeaning lifestyle she has to endure, and sends a letter to Jack telling him she now realizes she made a mistake and plans to reunite with him at his father and Ellen's wedding reception. However, Jack only finds out about the letter one month later, on the very day of the wedding, when Anita, who's been fired from the Jansen household, gives the letter to him, revealing Ellen decided to hide it from Jack.  Since Charlotte is not there, a worried Jack leaves the party to go find her, followed by Ward, who has lost an eye due to the incident at Ormond Beach and is now an alcoholic after Yardley left for New York with a deal to write a book on the Van Wetter case. When Jack and Ward confront Van Wetter, Charlotte has already been killed after Van Watter refused to let her leave to attend the wedding. A fight ensues, and Van Wetter kills Ward as well, by slashing his throat with a machete (the same weapon the sheriff was murdered with), but Jack manages to evade Van Wetter by diving into the swamp; the next morning, he retrieves Ward and Charlotte's bodies and leaves on the boat in which they came.  Anita finishes narrating by revealing Van Wetter was later convicted for the murders of Ward and Charlotte and sent to the electric chair, yet the identity of the sheriff's murderer was never ascertained. Jack would later meet his mother at Ward's funeral, but he would never get over Charlotte.  
Paradise: Love
 50-year-old Austrian woman Teresa is on [[holiday]] in a beach resort in [[Kenya]]. With the encouragement of other middle-aged women at the resort, she encounters younger men and has sex with them. At the same time, she worries whether they really find her attractive, and she often expresses concerns about her age, weight and appearance. Although the men profess love for her, some from the first moment they see her, she is wary at first. The men persist, calling her "Schatz" (treasure) and "love," but ultimately they are soliciting her money. The importance of these "sugar mama" tourists is evident when the women leave the resort and are constantly solicited and approached by groups of men who profess their love in German and English.  She builds a brief relationship with a man named Munga, who has sex with her and introduces her to a woman he claims is his sister. Together, they convince Teresa to give them several thousand shillings (hundreds of Euros) for their relatives in the hospital and for her baby by claiming that his father abandoned her. Over the course of a few scenes, Munga and his relatives manage to pressure her into giving more and more money until her wallet is literally empty. It becomes clear that he is interested entirely in her money, but at the same time, she objectifies him by taking nude photos of him while he sleeps. She eventually loses touch with him and returns to her hotel, later finding him in the sea with the woman he claimed was his sister. She realizes that the woman is actually his wife and confronts him, pulling his hair and slapping him.   She meets another man on the beach and begins another sexual relationship, which ends abruptly when he also asks her for money.   Teresa tries several times to call her daughter back in Austria, but is consistently unable to reach her. She leaves messages to remind her that she would like to receive a call on her birthday, but never manages to make contact. Teresa's friends hire a male stripper for her birthday, who dances nude for them. They are disappointed that they do not succeed much in sexually arousing him, despite dancing, taking their clothes off, and touching him all over.   Later Teresa invites the bartender of her resort into her room and instructs him to kiss her on various body parts, which he does. When she tells him to kiss her genital area, however, he refuses. Angrily, she tells him to get out and cries alone on the bed.  
Paperman
 A young accountant named George is standing on an elevated train platform in the 1940s at [[New York City]],<ref name="LATPageFromClassics" /> holding a folder, when he is hit by a flying piece of paper. The paper is chased by a young woman named Meg who lost it to a gust of wind from a passing train. The same thing happens to George when a subsequent gust of wind from another incoming train dislodges one of the papers from his folder and blows it into Meg's face, leaving a lipstick-smudged kiss imprinted on the paper, much to her amusement when George retrieves it. He is entranced by the lipstick mark and Meg's beauty, and therefore misses her boarding the departing train. The two exchange looks as she departs.  George arrives at work, despondent, gazing at the lipstick-marked paper on his desk. He looks out the window and is surprised to find Meg in the building across the street, working in an office with an open window. After failing to get her attention by waving his arms, George begins [[Paper plane|folding airplanes]] from a stack of papers on his desk, throwing them out the window one by one in an attempt to get her to notice him. Unfortunately, his efforts are met with varying levels of failure, as well as disparaging looks from his boss. In desperation, having used all of the paper on his desk to no success, he uses the lipstick-marked paper, although this fails as well when a gust of wind tugs it from his hands. Meg then leaves the office, and George, rebuffing his boss, dashes from his desk. Rushing across a street of busy traffic, he fails to see which way she went, and only finds the final lipstick-marked paper airplane. Angered, he throws it hard and it soars into the sky.  It turns out many of the paper airplanes have collected in a nearby alley, and when the lipstick-marked paper airplane lands among them, they begin to stir and fly from the ground, seeming to come alive, and set off in pursuit of George. A cloud of paper airplanes forces him toward a nearby train station and onto a train, much to his confusion. Meanwhile, the lipstick-marked paper airplane sets off in pursuit of Meg, finding her at a flower stand. Recognizing the lipstick-marked paper, she chases the airplane to another train station and aboard a different train. They're finally brought together when both of their trains stop at the same station; George still covered in paper airplanes and Meg holding his lipstick-marked paper airplane. As the credits roll, they are seen chatting happily with each other at a restaurant table with the lipstick marked paper between them. The picture disappears but the paper still is in the credits before it flies off.

Partysaurus Rex
 Rex disrupts the other toys blowing soap bubbles, worried that they may ruin Bonnie's house. He is chastised by the other toys, with Mr. Potato Head calling him "Partypooper Rex". The other toys sense Bonnie approaching, and scatter, leaving Rex alone when she enters. She takes him to play with while she takes a bath until Bonnie's mother comes to turn off the bath, pull out the plug and take her out. The bath toys are happy to see Rex, but soon the water gets drained, leaving them on dry land. Sad, the bath toys wish that they could continue to have fun, but all of them lack arms (except Rex) and can only function if afloat in the water. Rex initially thinks drawing a new bath is a bad idea, but after recalling Mr. Potato Head's insult, he asserts that he is "Partysaurus Rex", and helps the bath toys to start a new bath.  The toys quickly start to sing and dance in a [[rave]]-like fashion, aided by a carefree Rex throwing a bubble bath solution into the tub, and blocking the overflow drain with a frog sponge. However, he suddenly realises that if the tub overflows, the water will leak out into the hall; the bath toys become careless if this happens and continue to party. Rex tries to turn the water, but only causes the handle to fall off, and the drain stays plugged when he tries to pull it out. Finally, he spots the knob on the faucet that stops the flow from the it, but realises too late that this only diverts the water to the shower head. The tub starts to overflow, and the other bath toys are unconcerned about the problem. Outside the bathroom, Woody, Buzz, and some of the other toys arrive to check on Rex when the bathroom door suddenly bursts open and a flood of water pours out.  Later, Bonnie's mother is paying to have plumbing repairs done to the house. Though he knows it was his fault, Rex enjoys the short-lived fame with the other toys in Bonnie's room as Mr. Potato Head is still getting the water out of himself. Outside, several pool toys have heard of Rex's exploits from the bath toys and get him to agree to help turn on the outside faucet to let them party as well. Rex quickly joins in on their fun.

A Perfect Ending
  The movie immediately introduces the two main protagonists. Paris (Jessica Clark) is a young, dark-haired woman who works as a high-priced escort/call-girl, but is a creative artist by nature. Rebecca (Barbara Niven) is a rich, blond, middle-aged wife. The initial voice-over also narrates a cancer affliction that has grown beyond hope.  Rebecca has lived a wealthy yet unhappy existence in creating a seemingly perfect family with her husband Mason Westridge (John Heard). The signs of trouble are their hostility towards each other and conflicting opinions about whether Jessica, Rebecca's only daughter who has a different father, should receive equal stock shares of the family business as her two half-brothers. It is revealed that Mason had previously attempted to, and possibly succeeded in sexually assaulting Jessica.  Rebecca feels an emotional emptiness and confides in her two lesbian best friends that she has never had an orgasm, and that she and Mason only have sex once every six months, which is fine with her. One of her friends suggests that Rebecca try a very discreet escort service run by her own cousin (Morgan Fairchild).  It is then that Rebecca meets Paris and through a series of very discreet meetings, Rebecca eventually warms up to Paris' gentle advances and achieves her goals of having sex with another woman, and experiencing true happiness and satisfaction.  We learn that Paris, who is well appreciated for her services, seems to be in agony over a past mistake that had led her to this profession. It is implied that Paris' husband died after she accidentally pushed him into the road and he was hit by a car shortly after their wedding day. It is Rebecca who later helps Paris to let go of her past and heal.  Meanwhile, one of the three Westridge children finds the medical report of inoperable cancer that Mason Westridge has been hiding in his office desk. They all confront Rebecca and ask whether she had known about it all along. The children assume that the report refers to their father, and Rebecca tells her children that and they are not to mention it. Rebecca contacts another escort, Paris' friend, and gives her an envelope of money to help Paris leave the escort world and pursue her artistic talents. She reveals that she is the one who has cancer, and that she is dying. Afterwards, Rebecca makes the courageous decision to say goodbye to Paris.  Towards the end of the movie, Rebecca is seen as a butterfly, someone who has learned to spread her wings because of her relationship with Paris.  In the final scene, Paris has her own art exhibition after Rebecca's funeral. Jessica approaches Paris and introduces herself, as the two lesbian best friends watch, and says, "I want to learn about my mother at the end."

Sam needs to improve her [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT]] scores to be accepted to [[Pennsylvania State University]], so Charlie offers to tutor her. On the way home from the party, when the three hear a song with which they are unfamiliar, Sam instructs Patrick to drive through a tunnel so she can stand up in the back of the pickup while the music blasts.  At Christmas, Sam gives Charlie a vintage typewriter to help his aspirations of being a writer. The two discuss relationships, and Charlie reveals he has never been kissed. Sam, though already involved with someone else, tells Charlie she wants his first kiss to be from someone who loves him, and kisses him. Charlie, in love with Sam, begins to try to find ways to show her how he feels.  At a regular [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' performance]], Charlie is asked to fill in for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth ([[Mae Whitman]]) is impressed and asks Charlie to the [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]. The two enter into a desultory relationship. Finally, at a party, when Charlie is [[Truth or Dare|dared]] to kiss the most beautiful girl in the room, he chooses Sam, upsetting both her and Mary Elizabeth. Patrick recommends Charlie stay away from the group for a while, and the isolation causes him to sink back into depression. He experiences [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s of his Aunt Helen ([[Melanie Lynskey]]), who died in a car accident when he was seven years old.  When Brad shows up at school with a black eye having been caught by his father having sex with Patrick, he lies, saying that he was jumped and beaten up. Brad distances himself from Patrick, calling him a "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]". Brad's friends begin beating Patrick, but Charlie forcefully intervenes, then [[Psychogenic amnesia|blacks out]]. He recovers to find he has bruised knuckles and Brad's friends are on the floor, incapacitated. Charlie threatens, "Touch my friends again, and I'll blind you," then leaves. Sam and Patrick express their gratitude to Charlie, and the three become friends again.  Sam is accepted into Penn State, and breaks up with Craig on prom night after learning he has been cheating on her. The night before she departs, she brings Charlie to her room and asks him "Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?" to which he repeats advice he received from Mr. Anderson, "We accept the love we think we deserve." They confide in each other and kiss, but when Sam touches Charlie's thigh, he experiences a momentary flashback of his Aunt Helen, which he passes off as nothing, and they continue to kiss. After she leaves for college, though, his emotional state deteriorates and his flashbacks worsen. He calls his sister blaming himself for Helen's death, and admits he may have wished it upon her. His sister realizes he is in trouble and calls the police. Charlie passes out as they burst through the door and wakes up in a hospital, where [[psychiatrist]] Dr. Burton ([[Joan Cusack]]) manages to bring out Charlie's [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]] of his aunt [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] him.  Charlie then is later visited by Sam and Patrick. Sam explains what college life is like, and how she has found "The Tunnel Song"  "[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]" by [[David Bowie]]. The three revisit the tunnel, where Charlie kisses Sam again and stands up in the back of the truck. Charlie acknowledges that he feels alive and in that moment"We are infinite."

Piranha 3DD
  A year after the massacre on Lake Victoria by prehistoric [[piranha]]s, an eradication campaign has left the lake uninhabitable, and the town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the lake drying up. Meanwhile, at Cross Lake, two farmers ([[Gary Busey]] and [[Clu Gulager]]) search the waters to recover the body of a dead cow. Piranha eggs that have been laid inside the cow hatch, and the farmers are killed by the swarm, but before they both die, one farmer pops out of the water, bites the head off one of the piranhas and spits it into the air before sinking back into the water.  Marine biology student Maddy ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) returns home for the summer to the [[Water park|waterpark]] she co-owns. She finds to her horror that the other co-owner, her stepfather Chet ([[David Koechner]]), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with "water-certified [[stripper]]s", and re-open it as "Big Wet". At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old acquaintances, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle ([[Chris Zylka]])  and Barry ([[Matt Bush (actor)|Matt Bush]]), who has secretly had a crush on her since grade school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley ([[Meagan Tandy]]) and Shelby ([[Katrina Bowden]]). Shelby and her boyfriend Josh ([[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]]) go [[skinny-dipping]] in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her vagina. Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis begin to have sex in their van, but Ashley accidentally trips the handbrake with her foot, causing the van to roll into the lake. Handcuffed to the van during foreplay and unable to escape, Travis is devoured while Ashley, on the roof of the van, calls for help. With no one around to hear her cries, the van sinks into the lake and she is eaten alive by the killer fish.  The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by a swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry take it to marine expert Carl Goodman ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes, attracted by chemicals involved in swimming pool cleansers that match their spawning routes. However, the wider world wouldn't listen to his theory that the fish could evolve to become terrain-viable. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark. While Shelby and Josh are [[sexual intercourse|having sex]], the piranha in Shelby's vagina bites Josh's penis, forcing him to chop the organ off with a knife. Both are hospitalized, but survive. Kyle is revealed to be corrupt and taking [[bribery|bribes]] from Chet, who is secretly pumping water from an underground river into the waterpark, lowering his costs and boosting his profits. Chet orders Kyle to keep Maddy from finding out about his nefarious plans.  "Big Wet" opens the next day. Among the first guests are Deputy Fallon ([[Ving Rhames]]), who survived his previous ordeal with the piranhas but lost his legs, and former cameraman Andrew Cunningham ([[Paul Scheer]]). While the duo attempts to overcome their fear of the water after they were attacked a year ago, [[David Hasselhoff]] also makes an appearance as himself, a celebrity lifeguard.  Discovering the connection between the park and the underground river, Maddy attempts to shut the waterpark down, but is stopped by Chet and Kyle. The piranhas make their way to the area and attack, killing many of the lifeguards and waterpark-goers. Fallon attaches a shotgun [[prosthesis]] to his legs in order to save the visitors, while Hasselhoff, after rescuing a small boy named David ([[Matthew Lintz]]), is pleased that he has finally become a real lifeguard and seems to be nonchalant and unfazed by the bloodbath around him. In the chaos, Chet refuses to help any survivors, including Kiki ([[Irina Voronina]]), who is eaten by the fish. He reluctantly offers some cash to a young girl whose mother is dead, but then accidentally reverses over her with his golf cart. As he attempts to drive off to safety, Chet is then decapitated by a hanging cable when he is distracted by a fleeing woman in a bikini.  Maddy instructs Barry to begin draining the pools; however, while rescuing people from the water, she becomes caught in the suction and is dragged down to the bottom of the pool. After Kyle refuses to save her because of his fear of piranhas, despite being unable to swim, Barry leaps down and brings her to the surface, whereupon Maddy is revived. She and Barry then kiss.  Another employee, Big Dave, pours pure [[chlorine]] into the pipes, followed by a lit [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. The resulting explosion kills most of the piranhas, while Kyle is killed by a falling [[trident]]. The celebrations are cut short, however, when Maddy takes a phone call from a horrified Mr. Goodman, who informs them that the escaped piranha are evolving and are now able to move on land, to which Maddy replies that she knows. The film ends as a Piranha emerges from the pool and decapitates David (the small child who Hasselhoff saved earlier), leading Hasselhoff to quip "Little ginger moron", while the surviving visitors pick up their phones and take pictures of the dead child while the credits roll.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Hasselhoff is running on a beach holding a trident, advertising a film titled ''Fishhunter''.

The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!
 In 1837, the Pirate Captain, inexpert in the ways of pirates, leads a close-knit, rag-tag group of amateur pirates who are trying to make a name for themselves on the high seas. To prove himself and his crew, the Pirate Captain enters the Pirate of the Year competition, the winner being whoever can plunder the most. After several failed attempts to plunder mundane ships, they come across the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' and capture its passenger [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin recognises the crew's pet Polly as the [[Endling|last living]] [[dodo]], and recommends they enter it in the Scientist of the Year competition at the [[Royal Society of London]] for a valuable prize. Secretly, Darwin plans on stealing Polly himself with the help of his trained [[chimpanzee]], Mr. Bobo, as to impress his love interest [[Queen Victoria]].  The pirates disguise themselves as scientists to enter the competition, and the dodo display wins the top prize, which turns out to be minuscule trinkets and a meeting with the Queen. The Pirate Captain hides Polly before the meeting. There, the Queen requests that the Pirate Captain donate Polly for her petting zoo. The Pirate Captain refuses and accidentally reveals his true self, but Darwin steps in to spare the Captain's life, secretly telling the Queen that only the Captain knows where Polly is kept. The Queen pardons the Pirate Captain and orders Darwin to find Polly by any means necessary. Darwin takes the Pirate Captain to a tavern and coaxes out of him that Polly is stashed in his beard. Darwin and Mr. Bobo steal the bird, leading to a chase into the [[Tower of London]] where the Queen is waiting. She dismisses Darwin, and instead offers the Pirate Captain enough money to ensure his win as Pirate of the Year in exchange for Polly. He accepts the offer and returns to his crew, assuring them Polly is still safe in his beard.  At the Pirate of the Year ceremony, the Pirate Captain wins the grand prize from the Pirate King. But rival pirate Black Bellamy makes the Queen's pardon known to all and explains that if the Pirate Captain has been pardoned, then he is no longer a pirate and, as such, cannot be Pirate of the Year. The Captain is stripped of the prize, treasure, pirate attire, and his pirating licence and is banished from Blood Island by the Pirate King, and admits his loss of Polly to his crew, who abandon him. The Captain returns to London, intent on rescuing Polly. He reunites with Darwin, learning that the Queen is a member of an exclusive society of world leaders that feast on endangered creatures, and that Polly is likely on her flagship, the ''QV1'', to be served at the next meal. The Pirate Captain and Darwin work together to steal an airship to travel to the ''QV1''. Mr. Bobo, meanwhile, goes to find the rest of the Captain's crew to enlist their help.  Aboard the ''QV1'', the Queen locates the Pirate Captain and Darwin and attempts to kill both of them, but together they best her. In the battle, they accidentally mix the ship's store of [[baking soda]] with [[vinegar]], causing a violent reaction that rends the ship in two. The Pirate Captain rescues Polly and they escape safely, leaving behind a furious Queen. With his reputation among pirates restored because of the large bounty now on his head, the Pirate Captain is reinstated as a Pirate, and he and his crew continue to explore the high seas in search of adventure.  In a few [[post-credits scene]]s, they leave Darwin on the [[Galapagos Islands]], Mr. Bobo joins the Pirate Captain's crew, the Queen is left at the mercy of some of the rare animals she had planned on eating, Black Bellamy is stripped of his trophy by the Pirate King because of the Pirate Captain's new infamy, and the crew present the Pirate Captain with their own homemade Pirate of the Year trophy.  
The Place Beyond the Pines
  In 1997, Luke Glanton ([[Ryan Gosling|Gosling]]) is a [[Motorcycle stunt riding|motorcycle stuntman]]. In [[Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Luke reunites with his ex-lover Romina Gutierrez ([[Eva Mendes|Mendes]]), who is dating another man named Kofi Kancam ([[Mahershala Ali|Ali]]). Luke discovers that Romina has a baby son named Jason that he fathered which she never revealed to him, so Luke quits his job to stay with Romina and their son.  Luke begins working part-time for auto mechanic Robin Van Der Hook ([[Ben Mendelsohn|Mendelsohn]]). Luke asks Robin for more work, and Robin offers to partner with Luke in robbing banks. Luke and Robin successfully rob a few banks, with Luke performing the robbery and using his motorcycle as a getaway vehicle, hiding it in a box truck driven by Robin.  Luke gives his share of the money to Romina, and visits her and his son more often. Luke takes Romina and Jason out for ice cream, and the three ask a passerby to take a photo to capture the moment. Luke and Kofi, who objects to Luke’s presence, get into a fight, and Luke is arrested after hitting Kofi in the head with a wrench. After Robin bails him out of jail, Luke gives his savings to Romina to give to Jason when he's older. Luke insists on resuming their bank robberies, but Robin objects, and the two have a falling-out that results in Robin dismantling Luke’s motorcycle. Luke robs Robin at gunpoint, and uses the money to buy a new bike.  Luke attempts to rob a bank alone, but is pursued by police. Luke is cornered in a house by rookie police officer Avery Cross ([[Bradley Cooper|Cooper]]) and calls Romina, asking her not to tell Jason who he was. Avery enters the room and shoots Luke in the stomach. Luke fires back, hitting Avery in the leg, but falls out the window to his death.  Avery gains hero status after taking down Glanton, but feels remorse about the shooting. Avery and his fellow officers illegally seize the stolen money from Romina's home, but Avery tries to return the money to Romina, who rejects it. Avery then tries to turn the money in to the chief of police, who rebuffs him. Discouraged, Avery tape records other illegal practices in the police department, and uses the recording to get a position as an [[assistant district attorney]].  Fifteen years later, Avery is running for [[Attorney General of New York]]. He has his troubled teenage son A.J., who had been living with Avery’s ex-wife, move in with him and transfer to [[Schenectady High School]]. There, A.J. befriends Jason ([[Dane DeHaan|DeHaan]]), but neither know the history between their fathers. The two are later arrested for felony drug possession, but when Avery is called in to pick up his son, he recognizes Jason's name. He gets Jason's charge dropped to a [[misdemeanor]] and orders A.J. to stay away from him.  Kofi finally tells Jason his father's name, allowing Jason to discover Luke's past on the Internet. Jason visits Robin, who tells him more about Luke and their robberies. Back in school, A.J. pressures Jason to steal [[Oxycontin]], which Jason does, narrowly escaping the owner after failing to sneak back out undiscovered.  Jason eventually realizes that A.J.'s father is the man who killed his own father. After a fight with A.J., which leaves Jason hospitalized, Jason buys a gun, breaks into the Cross family home, beats A.J., and takes Avery hostage. Jason forces Avery to drive into the woods, where Avery breaks down and tearfully apologizes for killing Jason's father. Instead of killing him, Jason steals Avery's wallet and leaves him unharmed. In the wallet, Jason finds the photo of him and his parents eating ice cream, which Avery had stolen from the evidence locker.  Sometime later, Avery wins his bid for New York Attorney General, with A.J. at his side. Romina receives an envelope addressed to "Mom", with the old photograph inside. Jason purchases a motorcycle, starts the bike, and rides away from his old life.  
Pitch Perfect
 In the 2011 [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]] Finals at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]], Barden University's all-male [[a cappella]] group, the Barden Treblemakers rock their performance of [[Rihanna]]'s "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]." Directly afterwards, the Treblemakers' all-female rival group, the Barden Bellas perform [[Ace of Base]]'s "[[The Sign (song)|The Sign]]", which seems to be going well (other than the audience finding it rather boring), until Aubrey Posen ([[Anna Camp]]) suddenly projectile-[[vomiting|vomits]] on the audience in the middle of her solo. The Bellas are publicly humiliated, losing the competition. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell ([[Anna Kendrick]]) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father ([[John Benjamin Hickey]]), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer in [[Los Angeles]], Beca spends her time making [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson ([[Skylar Astin]]).  When Beca's father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave college, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. After some persuasion from Chloe Beale ([[Brittany Snow]]), the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca's talent. Beca joins alongside a group of other women who do not fit the Bellas' typical mold: Cynthia Rose ([[Ester Dean]]), Stacie Conrad ([[Alexis Knapp]]), Lilly Onakuramara ([[Hana Mae Lee]]), and Fat Amy ([[Rebel Wilson]]), but Kori and Mary Elise were kicked out of the Barden Bellas for having sex with a Treblemaker the next day after. Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Treblemakers, but his roommate Benji ([[Ben Platt (actor)|Ben Platt]]) was rejected after being called weird by Bumper ([[Adam DeVine]]).  The Bellas participate in the 2012 ICCA Regionals at Carolina University where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the finals the previous year: "The Sign", [[The Bangles]]' "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]" and [[Vicki Sue Robinson]]'s "[[Turn the Beat Around]]." In spite of their old set list, the group manages to place second, thanks to Fat Amy putting her own spin on her solo during "Turn the Beat Around", which sends them to the semi-finals. Unfortunately, disaster strikes for Beca when the Treblemakers cause an uproar with an old a capella group after the competition. The Bellas try to intervene, but Beca and Fat Amy accidentally smash a window with the trophy, which alerts a police officer standing outside who then arrests her. Jesse kindly waits for Beca outside the police station, but makes matters worse by getting her father involved in the situation, who is furious and tells Beca that he will no longer pay for her to move to Los Angeles because of the incident. This infuriates Beca, which turns her budding friendship with Jesse sour. In the meantime, Beca suggests to the Bellas to try to be more daring, but Aubrey insists that they will win with the repertoire the group has always used in the past.  At the ICCA Semi-Finals, Beca provides an impromptu layering of one of her favorite songs, [[La Roux]]'s "[[Bulletproof (La Roux song)|Bulletproof]]", into "The Sign" on the Bellas' set list in an attempt to reinvigorate the crowd after they seemed to have lost interest. Even though the audience seem to enjoy Beca's remix, the Bellas come in third in the competition behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. Aubrey becomes furious with Beca, who in turn quits, with the Bellas losing on their chance to advance due to their third place ranking. Benji finds out that the Footnotes have recruited a high school student into their team and reports it, causing their disqualification and simultaneously advancing the Bellas to the finals by default. They re-form after spring break, with the notable exception of Beca. During rehearsals, Chloe stands up against Aubrey's stubbornness. The group starts to fall apart, which sparks a fight. Meanwhile, Beca tries to apologize to Jesse for being rude, which he declines by telling her she pushes away everyone who cares about her. Beca then apologizes to the Bellas for her actions during the semi-finals and asks to have another chance, which Aubrey eventually allows. After having a group heart-to-heart conversation, the Bellas decide to adopt Beca's more modern and original music style. Aubrey and Chloe relinquish their leadership to Beca. Meanwhile, Treblemakers leader Bumper leaves after being offered a job as a back-up singer for [[John Mayer]]. With Bumper gone, Jesse persuades the Trebles to let Benji join the group in Bumper's place.  At the Finals, the Treblemakers perform, with Benji performing for the first time.

Pizza (2012 film)
  Michael Karthikeyan ([[Vijay Sethupathi]]) is a pizza delivery boy who lives with his girlfriend Anu ([[Remya Nambeesan]]). She is an aspiring novelist and is researching for writing a horror story, whereas Michael does not believe in supernatural powers, but is afraid of anything supernatural. Anu, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Michael is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he comes to know his boss, i.e., the Pizza restaurant owner Shanmugam's ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) daughter is possessed by a spirit. Meanwhile, Anu becomes pregnant, and after a brief altercation, Michael and Anu get covertly married. One particular day, Michael goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Anu's name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Michael explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha ([[Pooja Ramachandran]]) in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow.  Smitha requests Michael to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is power failure, which alarms Michael. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark, Michael hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices one slice the pizza he had delivered to be missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Michael makes a dash for the door only to realize that it has been locked from the outside. Further more when the murdered woman's husband Bobby ([[Bobby Simha]]) arrives, he at first believes he stumbles upon his wife having an affair. Through his cellphone Michael communicates with Bobby and explains his situation thoroughly instigating Bobby to aid him on how to get out of the house. Moreover, Bobby suddenly disappears from the front entrance, and is found by Michael inside the house mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of the pizza now missing. Also, Michael encounters the couple's child "Nithya", identical to the name of the spirit allegedly possessing Shanmugam's daughter.  Michael tries everything he can to get out of the house including trying to break down the sealed doors leading outside, to using the house phone which happens to work even though the line is dead. Michael manages to contact Anu using the phone and gets her to contact to the local police to come and rescue him. When a couple of policemen arrive at the bungalow, Michael believes that Anu had requested them to help him, but they reveal that four people had been killed in that house - Smitha, Bobby, their young daughter and a girl named Anu, implying that she is Michael's girl friend, Anu. The police disclose that Michael is a suspect regarding the murder case and attempt to arrest him. Confused and in tears, Michael does not believe the policemen and attempts to escape the clutches of these police men in order to go in search of Anu.  While trying to escape, Michael witnesses the police getting dragged into the house and being killed. At this juncture, Michael, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant. While Michael is not convinced that Anu is dead, his friends at the restaurant and Shanmugam start realizing that they had never seen Anu; they also observe that Michael's home does not have any evidence that he lived with Anu. Further, it is revealed that the haunted bungalow had witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two policeman, whose ghosts Michael had earlier interacted with. Meanwhile, Michael seems to continue his search for Anu, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by ghosts and supernatural entities.  As Michael during a delivery stops and calls Anu, the true story of what had happened is disclosed. The Income Tax department had planned on a raid at the restaurant owner Shanmugam's house. Shanmugam who has diamonds worth around 20&nbsp;million hidden in his restaurant hides it in a box of candies and asks Michael to deliver it to his house. But Michael is involved in a bike accident and comes in contact with the hidden diamonds. Michael and Anu decide that stealing those diamonds would improve their life style and support their baby. So, they concoct a clever story in which Michael convincingly "forgets" the Pizza bag at the "haunted" bungalow which Shanmugam would never enter into, thanks to his fear of supernatural powers. Meanwhile, Anu has left to [[Kochi]] via [[Bengaluru, India|Bengaluru]] with the diamonds and her belongings, and has obtained fake documentation using which Michael and Anu can settle abroad.  Michael, after the phone call, goes to deliver a pizza to a house and he encounters a series of events similar to the story he had narrated. Inside, he meets a little girl identical to the "Nithya" he had described in his story. Michael is locked inside the home with "Nithya" curiously looking at him. The lights then goes off followed by Michael's gasping sound in fear.

Fifteen years later in [[Marshall, Michigan]], an ambitious high school student Julian Miller ([[Johnny Pacar]]), is tasked with completing a film assignment on forgotten local stories for journalism class. Choosing the Harlan Diehl case, though it goes against the wishes of his mother, Anne Miller (Lisa Jane Todd), he selects his girlfriend, Riley ([[Ambyr Childers]]), to be his project partner, and borrows camera equipment and archive footage from his reserved former coworker at a video store, Quinn ([[Toby Hemingway]]), who has since become a news station cataloger.

 George Dryer ([[Gerard Butler]]) is a former professional Scottish [[Association Football|football]] player who played for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[D.C. United]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]], and is largely seen as a "has been". His attempts to raise money by selling his former [[Sports memorabilia|game memorabilia]] and become a [[sports announcer]] are largely met with ambivalence. George's relationship with his son Lewis (Noah Lomax) is equally unsuccessful due to his only seeing Lewis sporadically. When he discovers that his ex-wife Stacie ([[Jessica Biel]]) is getting married to her boyfriend Matt ([[James Tupper]]), George grows despondent.  After dropping off an audition tape of him practicing his sports announcements, George goes to help his son's football team practice. The team isn't very good, with the coach giving little attention to his players. The team's parents quickly pressure Stacie  to ask George to become the new coach, which he reluctantly agrees to. Once coach, George attracts the attentions of various mothers and receives a bribe from Carl King ([[Dennis Quaid]]), who wants him to give his children preferential treatment. He specifically draws attention from the divorced Barb ([[Judy Greer]]), ex-sportscaster Denise ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), and Carl's wife Patti ([[Uma Thurman]]). Denise appears to be particularly forward with George, sending him an [[e-mail]] telling him that she's thinking of him.  At practice, the next day, George is invited to a dinner party at Carl's house, is approached by Barb, and is also told by Denise that she has been given a copy of his audition tape to watch and pass along. At Carl's party, George learns that Carl has been having [[affairs]] and that his wife is aware of his infidelities, unbeknownst to Carl. Carl then lends George a [[Ferrari]] under the implication that he "takes care of his friends", which George uses to drive to see Stacie. The two discuss what could have developed between the two of them, to which Stacie says that she doesn't wonder about the past anymore.  When he gets home, he discovers Barb waiting for him. She confesses that she's very lonely and has set up a dating profile in order to find a match. After asking him if he finds her attractive, the two sleep together. The following day George is called by Carl, who asks him to pick up some money from Patti in order to bail him out of jail, as he got into a fight at the party. Doing so makes him late to pick up his son, but he manages to entertain Lewis by letting him ride in his lap and drive the Ferrari. During this time, George discovers that Lewis is sad that his mother is marrying Matt and that he won't call Matt "dad". George is then called by Denise, who informs him that [[ESPN]] is looking for a new football sportscaster and that he must come to the studio to record a tape. This enrages Stacie and Lewis due to his being late to pick up Lewis again, weakening his relationship with the both of them.  Arriving home, George is berated by his landlord Param ([[Iqbal Theba]]) for not paying his rent while driving a Ferrari and receives a call from Patti, telling him that she's in his bed. He soon finds that she's in the landlord's bed and George manages to distract the landlord by paying him with Carl's bribe money. Despite this, Patti continues to approach George sexually, who rebuffs her while saying that she should leave Carl rather than having an affair. His relationship with Lewis worsens when Denise kisses George the next day, leading Lewis to realize why his father was late. This spurs Lewis into having a fight during a game later on, prompting Lewis to tell his mother that he wants to quit playing football. George manages to later coax Lewis into playing football in the rain, which both of them find fun. Meanwhile, Stacie and George begin to reconnect romantically, which causes small rifts in her relationship with Matt.  George manages to earn the job with ESPN, but this necessitates his moving across the country to [[Connecticut]]. He asks Stacie to come with him. She initially refuses, but then he meets her at her car and she kisses him. At the game, later that same day, George finds that Barb has begun to date his landlord and that Carl has discovered pictures of Patti in George's house from the time she came on to him. The two men begin to fight, which Stacie witnesses. Stacie sees the pictures, which upsets her, despite George's claiming that it wasn't what it looked like. During the fight, Lewis's team wins the game.  After the game, George leaves for his new job. In the end, George chooses to stay with Lewis, rather than moving to Connecticut. He also renews his relationship with Stacie, who has broken off her engagement with Matt, and becomes a local sportscaster in [[Virginia]] with his friend Chip.

The Possession
 A newly separated couple Clyde Brenek  ([[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]) and Stephanie ([[Kyra Sedgwick]]) live in different homes. After Clyde picks up their two children, Emily "Em" ([[Natasha Calis]]) and Hannah ([[Madison Davenport]]), for the weekend, they stop at a yard sale where Em becomes intrigued by an [[Dybbuk box|old wooden box]] that has [[Hebrew]] letters engraved on it.<ref>The text shows a fail of translation.The line is "שנועה לש עשרה התא הארת". It can be readable backwards as "תראה אתה הרשע של העונש", – ''Look, you are the evil of the punishment''. Another try to fix the sentence: "אתה תראה את העונש של הרשע" – "You will see the punishment of the evil.". It fits to Psalm 91:8    רַ֭ק בְּעֵינֶ֣יךָ תַבִּ֑יט וְשִׁלֻּמַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים תִּרְאֶֽה  (From '''BibleGateway''')  LOOK ONLY WITH YOUR EYES AND SEE THE PAYMENT OF VILLAINS.  The text on the box sides, "קוובד", is probably backwards of "דבווק", misspelling of "דיבוק" -- "Dybbuk".  http://msc.wcdn.co.il/w/w-300/1347032-18.jpg</ref> Clyde buys the box for Em, and they later find that there seems no way to open it. That night, Em hears whispering coming from the box. She is able to open it, and finds a [[tooth]], a dead [[moth]], a wooden [[figurine]], and a [[ring (jewellery)|ring]], which she begins to wear. Em becomes solitary, and her [[behavior]] becomes increasingly sinister; she stabs her father in the hand with a fork during breakfast. That night, the house, especially Em's bedroom, becomes infested with moths.  At school, Em violently attacks a classmate when he takes her box, resulting in a meeting with Clyde, Stephanie, the principal and the teacher. Em's teacher recommends that she spend time away from the box, so it is left in the classroom. That night, curious about the mysterious noises from the box, the teacher tries to open it, but a malevolent force, the [[dybbuk]], murders her by violently throwing her out a window. Em tells Clyde about an invisible hag who lives in her box who says that Em is "special". Alarmed by her behavior, Clyde attempts to dispose of the box. During their next weekend at Clyde's, Emily gets progressively more upset with the disappearance of the box. She begins yelling at Clyde in the hall with Hannah watching in the back. The dybbuk seems to slap Em across the face. She begins yelling, asking why he's hitting her, from Hannah's perspective it looks like her father actually does. Em flees the house, recovers the box and the dybbuk begins conversing with her in a strange language.  Clyde takes the box to a university professor who tells him that it is a dybbuk box that dates back to the 1920s; it was used to contain a [[dybbuk]], a dislocated spirit as powerful as a devil. Clyde enters Em's room and reads [[Psalm 91]]; a dark but invisible force throws the [[Tanakh]] across the room. Clyde then travels to a [[Hasidic]] community in Brooklyn and learns from a Jewish priest named Tzadok ([[Matisyahu]]) that the [[Demonic possession|possession]] has three main stages; in the third stage, the dybbuk latches onto its human host, becoming one entity with it. The only way to defeat the dybbuk is to lock it back inside the box via a [[exorcism|forced ritual]]. Upon further examination on the box, Tzadok learns that the dybbuk's name is "[[Abyzou]]", or the "Taker of Children".  Em has a seizure and is taken to the hospital for an MRI. During the procedure, Stephanie and Hannah are horrified when they see the dybbuk's face in the MRI scans next to Em's heart. Clyde and Tzadok join the family at the hospital and attempt to conduct an exorcism. Where Em is taken to a room that has a tub full of water and a stretcher to keep Em stable during the exorcism. During the exorcism, the possessed Em attacks Tzadok. Clyde grabs Em from him, and Em runs out of the room. Clyde follows her out and finally finds her in the morgue where the lights are off. As he nears her, she starts to attack him. Clyde survives the attack, but the dybbuk is passed from Em to him. Tzadok performs a successful exorcism; Abyzou emerges from Clyde and crawls back into the box. The family is reunited, with Clyde and Stephanie's love rekindled. Tzadok drives away with the box in Clyde's vehicle. The car is hit by a truck, killing him. The box lands safely from the wreckage, and Abyzou's whispering is heard from it, the same [[Polish language|Polish]] rhyme heard at the beginning of the film.

 The film has a [[nonlinear narrative]]. It contains numerous flash-forward and flashback cuts, indicated with an overlaid digital clock showing the time advancing rapidly forward/backward to the next scene. In chronological order:  Wilee ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) is a disenchanted Columbia Law School graduate who has put off taking the bar exam because he could not bear to enter the humdrum life of the legal profession. He finds meaning and purpose in being employed as a thrill-seeking [[New York City]] [[bicycle messenger]] despite arguments with his girlfriend and fellow bike messenger, Vanessa ([[Dania Ramirez]]), who insists that he should make something of himself.  Vanessa's roommate, Nima ([[Jamie Chung]]), has asked Vanessa to move out for a personal reason she doesn't disclose. Vanessa is in the process of packing her few belongings. Nima delivers $50,000 that she has saved for two years to Mr. Leung ([[Henry O]]), a Chinese [[hawaladar]], in exchange for a ticket that she must deliver to Sister Chen, buying a place for Nima's son and mother in one of Sister Chen's ships on which [[Snakehead (gang)|gangs]] smuggle people from [[China]] to the [[United States]].  Mr. Lin, a local loan shark, has learned of the ticket and that whoever returns it to Mr. Leung can collect Nima's money. He approaches Robert "Bobby" Monday ([[Michael Shannon]]), a gambling-addicted [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective who owes him money, offering to clear Monday's debt if Monday gets him the ticket. Monday begins searching for Nima, who decides to hire Wilee to deliver the envelope with the ticket to Sister Chen by 7 pm after Nima is told by Leung that anyone who knew she was visiting him is a loose end which could cause her to be in possible danger if she tries to deliver the ticket herself. Wilee and Nima conduct their transaction at the college where Nima is a student. After Wilee leaves, Nima is confronted by Monday, who sees the courier receipt Wilee gave her. He is able to steal the receipt from Nima. After Monday leaves, Vanessa finds Nima, and learns the contents of the envelope.  Monday catches up with Wilee before he leaves the college campus, stating that he is a college official, that Nima had no authority to handle the contents of the envelope on the college's behalf, and that he would like the envelope back, with the receipt Wilee gave to Nima in his hands. Wilee refuses. He is able to escape, with Monday in pursuit. Wilee heads to the police station to report Monday, only to find out he's a police detective. Wilee hides in the bathroom, where he opens the envelope and finds the ticket.  After he escapes the station, Wilee angrily tells his dispatcher, Raj ([[Aasif Mandvi]]), that he is returning the package so that someone else can drop it off. Returning to Nima's college, Wilee leaves the envelope, which is picked up by his rival, Manny ([[Wolé Parks]]). Before Manny picks it up, however, Monday calls the dispatch to redirect the delivery to a different address.  As he is about to leave the college after returning the envelope, Wilee runs into Nima. He confronts her about the ticket, and she reveals the truth. Guilt-ridden, Wilee tries to catch up to Manny, who refuses to give Wilee his drop. They race each other and in the process, are chased by a bike cop who had earlier tried to arrest Wilee. As they approach Monday's location, the bike cop tackles Manny off his bike and arrests him. Vanessa, who learns of Monday's trickery and races over to warn Manny, appears, grabs Manny's bag and gives it to Wilee.  As they are about to escape, Wilee is hit by an oncoming taxi. He falls to the ground fracturing some ribs in the process. He is put in an ambulance with Monday, while his damaged bike is taken to an impound lot, with the envelope hidden in the handlebars. Monday tortures Wilee by pressing on his injured ribs, and Wilee offers to give Monday the envelope in exchange for his bike.  Wilee tells Monday that the envelope is in Manny's bag, and Monday leaves to search it, while Wilee meets with Vanessa in the impound lot. She gives him the envelope, which she had retrieved, and he escapes on a stolen bike. Monday, realizing Wilee has tricked him, pursues Wilee to Sister Chen's place. Meanwhile, Nima calls Mr. Leung for help. He deploys his enforcer, the Sudoku Man, to help her.  As Wilee reaches [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], he is confronted by Monday, who is threatening to kill him. However, Vanessa arrives with a [[flash mob]] of messengers, dispatched by Raj, who delay Monday by hitting him numerous times, giving Wilee time to deliver the ticket to Sister Chen just before the stroke of 7 pm. She calls the captain of her ship and tells him to allow Nima's family aboard. Outside, Monday is confronted by the Sudoku Man, who shoots Monday in the back of his head with a silenced pistol. Dying and feeling faint, Monday tries to get in his car saying that he just wants to think for a second, but dies before he can do so. Nima's mother calls her and confirms that she and Nima's son have gotten on the ship. Nima meets with Wilee and Vanessa while they are finally reunited again.

Prometheus (2012 film)
  As a spacecraft departs a planet, a [[humanoid]] alien drinks an [[iridescent]] liquid and then dissolves. The remains of the alien cascade into a waterfall. The alien's DNA strands mix with the water.  In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a [[star chart|star map]] in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the "Engineers". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel ''Prometheus,'' to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] while the [[android (robot)|android]] David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.  The ''Prometheus'' lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to ''Prometheus'', but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.  Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to ''Prometheus'', but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]], is pregnant. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard ''Prometheus.'' He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as "Father".  A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the ''Prometheus'' and kills several crew members before he is killed. The ''Prometheus'' captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the ''Prometheus'' into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an [[ovipositor]] down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.  In the lifeboat, an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Deacon|alien creature]] bursts out of the Engineer's chest.

Promised Land (2012 film)
 Steve Butler (Damon) has caught the eyes of top management at his employer, Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company that specializes in obtaining natural gas trapped underground through a process known as [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. Butler has an excellent track record for quickly and cheaply persuading land owners to sign mineral rights leases that grant drilling rights over to his employer. Butler and his partner Sue Thomason ([[McDormand]]) arrive in an economically struggling Pennsylvania farming town whose citizens are proud of having family farms passed from one generation to the next. Coming from a town and a life very similar to that of the people he is now determined to win over on behalf of Global, Butler tells the story of how his own town died after the local [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] assembly plant closed. The idea of a town surviving solely on family farms being passed down through generations as a viable economy is one that he can no longer accept. He claims to be offering the town its last chance. Butler spends some pleasant after-hours time with Alice, a teacher he meets in a bar.  The community seems willing to accept Global's offer, until an elderly, local high school science teacher, Frank Yates ([[Hal Holbrook|Holbrook]]), who happened to be a successful engineer in his working life, raises the question of the safety of fracking during a town meeting. It's decided that the people will vote in a few weeks whether or not to take the offer. After hearing about the vote, Dustin Noble ([[John Krasinski]]), an unknown environmental advocate, starts a grassroots campaign against Global, motivated by a tale of his family losing its Nebraska dairy farm after the herd died as a result of Global's industry-standard fracking process.  Butler begins to meet a great deal of resistance in town. Noble seems to be winning over nearly everyone, including Alice. One night Butler receives a package from Global that includes an enlarged copy of a photograph of dead cattle on a field that Noble said came from his family's Nebraska farm. The enlargement shows that an object thought to be a silo is,in fact, a lighthouse, which are nonexistent in Nebraska, revealing that Noble fabricated his story and deceived the people. Actually, the picture was from [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where Global is in the midst of a lawsuit over environmental complications that were probably caused by their fracking practices.  Butler informs the town's mayor of the deception, who then informs the rest of the town. He returns to the hotel to find Noble loading his truck, preparing to leave town. Noble accidentally reveals that he knows the picture with the lighthouse was taken in Lafayette. Butler realizes the only way Noble could have known this information is if he were also employed by Global, and that Noble's job had been to discredit the environmental movement and convince the town to vote in favor of Global's offer. He arranged for Butler to receive the "confidential" photos and engineered the entire public relations effort.  At a town meeting the next day, the citizens are prepared to vote on Global's efforts to buy drilling rights to their property. Butler talks to them about how the barn in the picture reminds him of his grandfather's barn. He reveals that Noble has manipulated them and is employed by Global. Butler leaves the meeting to find Thomason on the phone with Global. She tells him he's fired and that she is leaving for New York. Butler walks to Alice's home and she welcomes him in.  
Puerta de Hierro, el exilio de Perón
 Close to his final return to Argentina, Perón begins to record in tapes his memoirs of the exile. He begins with the [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] and the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' military coup against him, which caused his departure from the country. He met the Argentine dancer [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|María Estela Martínez]] in Panamá, who stayed with him. He finally settled in Spain, and became a friend of his doctor and a tailor named Sofía who did not recognize him. Despite of his distance of the country, he stayed informed of all the ongoing political developments, and several Argentine political figures visited him.  [[José López Rega]] began to work at the house, and became an influential figure over Isabel. Perón made an attempt to return to Argentina by laying clues that he would do so through Paraguay and fly instead to Brazil; but the Brazilian military forced him to return to Spain. Perón revealed his identity to Sofía before making the flight, which redefined their relation since then. The political crisis in Argentina worsened, and de facto president [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]] finally agreed to lift the proscription of Peronism and allow the return of Perón. Perón recorded his memoirs of the exile for Sofía, and his last tape ended with the [[tango]] song "[[Carlos Gardel|Volver]]" ().

Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos
 Some time after his adventure with the Golden Goose, [[Puss in Boots]] is riding his horse through the desert contemplating the crossroads he found himself at -outlaw or hero?- when he is captured by Italian knights. He is then taken to Princess Alessandra Belagomba, whose "Heart of Fire" Ruby, the crown jewel of her kingdom, is missing. At first, Puss believes he is being wrongfully charged for the theft, but it later turns out that the Princess only wants to hire him based on his reputation, revealing that a French thief called "The Whisperer" was the one who committed the crime and that the Princess' knights have captured three of his henchmen. The henchmen turn out to be three kittens (referred to as the Diablos). Though Puss cannot believe that such innocent creatures could be thieves, the princess and her guards are terrified of them. The Diablos agree to help Puss on the premise that they will be free if they return the ruby.  When Puss takes the Diablos to the desert, they quickly turn on him (revealing their backstabbing nature) and bury him alive. Puss later escapes and recaptures the Diablos using his wide eyes against theirs. Later, he talks about sending them back to jail for double-crossing him, but he learns that they have no family and are orphans like him. He then sympathetically tells them how he also knows it's tough growing up not knowing whom to trust and being betrayed, making an example of how Humpty led him down the wrong path, just as the Whisperer has done to them. Puss then decides to point the Diablos in the right direction and trains them how to fight and plays with them, becoming friends. He also gives them names: Perla (because she is one of a kind), another Gonzalo (for his scrappy temper) and the other Sir Timoteo Montenegro the Third (a title is all he needs).  The next day, the Diablos, turning over a new leaf, show Puss to the Whisperer's secret hideout, and are immediately confronted by the Whisperer himself, who, by his name, has a low voice volume and uses his hat as a megaphone to speak clearly. It is also revealed that the Whisperer himself has used the heart as a decoration for his own belt. After learning that the Diablos brought Puss to him to recover the heart, the Whisperer is about to punish them for their betrayal, but Puss fights him and lets the Diablos escape. They, however, return to help Puss with what they learned from him and the Whisperer falls into a bottomless pit, Puss reclaiming the heart in the process. Puss then returns the heart to the Princess and is rewarded with gold, and he gives the Princess the Diablos as her new personal bodyguards. They then say their goodbyes and Puss claims "He will never forget them, just as he is sure they will never forget the name of Puss in-"; unfortunately, the guards slam the doors before he can finish his goodbye.

She befriends Evan, the store owner, and Berner, an offbeat customer and comic book fan. The three launch a local marketing effort for an upcoming sale in hopes of drumming up business for the small comic book store.  As Berner hangs flyers at a park, he watches Mia preparing to leave after a racquetball game. She spots him and initiates an awkward conversation that reveals they have known each other for a long time, and while Mia has started college and does volunteer work on the side, Berner has become a slacker after high school. They are joined by Andrew, Mia's militant cousin who pulls her away to get to a class they share. As she leaves, Berner gives them a flyer and invites them to visit the store, to which Mia replies "we'll see."  At the shop, Cola tells Evan she has contacted Peter Whales, a legendary comic book writer who has become a local recluse. It's then revealed via flashback that when Cola was still in college, she'd started a relationship with a man named Danny. In the present, her mind still wanders and she thinks of him. Cola and Evan then argue about why comic book stores don't get the business they once had, and the general [[Portrayal of women in American comics|depiction of women in comics]].  Later, Cola finds Berner outside waiting in case Mia arrives. She then sarcastically suggests Berner "clean his pipes" to help him relax. Inside, Evan plays a card game similar to [[Magic: The Gathering]] with his friend X-Ray. As Cola leaves to prepare for her meeting with Peter Whales, Berner grabs an issue of a comic called Zombie Gal and heads to the basement. There he has a fantasy of the title character coming to life and seducing him while a zombie awkwardly watches. Cola returns in a sexy red dress at the same time Berner returns from the basement. She grabs the comic from his hand and throws it on the counter as she pulls him to go with her to meet Peter. They find Peter Whales in a small hotel room but before they can ask about the signing, he tears into them and begins deconstructing Cola's life. He accuses her of running from something. This causes Cola to think of how she ran from Danny, which prompts her to call him and ask to meet up.  After X-Ray leaves the comic store, an irritated customer tries to return a comic book while accusing Evan of masturbating into it. After Cola and Berner return, Berner admits that it was the Zombie Gal comic he'd used earlier. Evan threatens to permanently ban Berner from the store forever. Evan then goes into his own fantasy in which he returns home to [[Bree Olson]], who offers to [[sexual roleplay]] with him and make him feel better. Berner snaps Evan back into reality just as Mia and Andrew enter the store. Mia spends some time with Berner but shoots down his offer for a date saying her responsibilities keep her too busy. Meanwhile, Evan educates Andrew on the artistic merit of comic books.  At the park where they first met, Cola meets up with Danny to talk. The conversation frustrates Danny since Cola was the one who ran away from him after their two years together. They leave peacefully, but Danny asks her to never contact him again unless she's positive she wants to be with him. When Cola gets back to the comic shop, she begins educating Berner on marketing and synergy. Evan discovers that Cola had used his laptop to look for new jobs. Scared that they might lose her, Evan and Berner pressure her to stay with them and avoid returning to her previous lifestyle. Their talk turns aggressive and Evan tells her to leave the store. On her way out, she finds Berner sitting sadly on her car. She reveals to him that her whole life, she's used comic books to escape reality whenever things got too difficult. She also explains how she had quit her marketing job and punched her boss, and then later had an argument with Danny that led to their breakup.  Cola returns to the hotel room of Peter Whales and concedes that everything he'd said about her earlier is true. They go to the hotel's bar where she admits that every time things go well for her, she runs and hides out of fear. Peter tells her a story of how he couldn't get work after the [[Comics Code Authority]] was established, and he had to accept jobs he hated to support his wife until the day she died. He tells Cola that "bravery will always be the driving point of your life," and "you know you've run out of it when suddenly nothing changes anymore." He then leaves, declaring that he won't come help Purgatory Comics during the sale.  That evening, Berner offers to help Mia with her volunteer work so he can spend time with her. Cola returns to Danny's house and tells him she's not afraid to keep him anymore. Three weeks later, Cola visits the big Purgatory Comics sale during her lunch break from a new job. It is revealed that Berner has become a full-time employee and, thanks to Danny's help, a designer for the store's web site. Berner has also begun a relationship with Mia while Andrew has become a comic book fan. Evan and Cola are happy to see each other again. As she leaves with Danny, they spot Peter Whales going into the store to do a surprise signing.

Quartet (2012 film)
 The plot takes place in [[Thomas Beecham|Beecham]] House, a [[retirement home]] for former professional musicians, patterned after the real-life [[Casa di Riposo per Musicisti]] founded by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].  Reg, Wilf and Cissy are retired [[opera]] singers who often worked together in the past; among other residents are Cedric Livingstone, a former director, and diva Anne Langley. All the guests in the retirement home continue to be engaged in their former professions in one way or the other, including lecturing and initiating young people to music.  Finances threaten closure of the home, but proceeds from a yearly gala concert on Verdi's birthday hold hope for a continuation of the place. However, Cedric has become rather desperate because some of the most prominent singers have either died or decided not to participate at all. Reg, Wilf and Cissy were in the cast of a very highly rated recording of the opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'', which includes a famous quartet for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor and baritone ("[[Bella figlia dell'amore]]"). This version is very prominent among opera buffs as THE ''Rigoletto'' of the post-war era.  One day, Reg is shocked to find his former wife Jean Horton, the missing soprano of the ''Rigoletto'' recording, turning up to live at Beecham House. Reg is angry not to have been warned as their parting was on very sour terms.  At first, Jean tries unsuccessfully to mend things with Reg. In the ensuing conversations her infidelity arises, as well as her past marriages, but Reg comes to understand that all that is past. In the meantime, Wilf and Cissy convince Cedric that bringing together those who sang the quartet on the famous recording to sing it again for the Verdi Gala concert will sell enough tickets to save the home. Enchanted with the idea, they persuade Reg to overcome his objections to performing with Jean again. However, she is harder to persuade as she vowed never to sing again after retiring.  Cissy takes Jean flowers from the garden to cheer her up, and asks if she wishes to discuss the quartet, but Jean becomes violent and attacks Cissy, which only aggravates Cissy's already delicate senile condition. Jean apologises and is finally persuaded to sing in the quartet from ''Rigoletto'', after learning that Anne Langley will be singing "[[Vissi d'arte]]" from ''[[Tosca]]''. The group prepares for their performance and, moments before their curtain call, Cissy gets very confused and attempts to walk out the door, saying that she has to go back to her family, but Jean manages to salvage the situation. During her conversation with Cissy, Jean expresses regret for all her past bad behaviour towards Reg and admits that she is still in love with him. Reg overhears this.  Just as the recital is about to start, the director of the home is amazed at the energy displayed by the guests of the home. The idea of rehearsing and playing before an audience brings life back to them, leading her to the conclusion that old age and art go together. As they are about to enter the stage, Reg asks Jean to marry him again, and once on stage she whispers her acceptance.

Chaitra and Raj were childhood friends. Bellary, who is Ramamurthy's brother-in-law, found out about the presence of iron ore under Ramamurthy's land, and along with Baireddanna, decided to exploit the ore for their own benefit. When Suryanarayana and Ramamurthy objected, they and their families, except Raj and Chaitra, were killed by Bellary and Baireddanna. Chaitra was adopted by Bellary, who planned to kill her when she becomes an adult so he could acquire Ramamurthy's land. Chaitra, who was aware about Raj's love for making bets, told her childhood friend James to trap Raj by placing the bet (which took place earlier in the movie) so that Bellary and Baireddanna can be destroyed using him. Raj decides to avenge his father's death and kills Bellary, Baireddanna and his son at Rayadurg. He rescues Chaitra and distributes Ramamurthy's land to the villagers after marrying her.

Red Dawn (2012 film)
  An introductory montage shows the fallout of the [[Great Recession|economic crisis]] in the [[European Union]] and a weakened [[NATO]] alliance, amid increasing cooperation between an increasingly militant [[North Korea]] and ultranationalist-controlled [[Russia]]. The increased deployment of U.S. troops abroad leaves the [[Contiguous United States|mainland]] vulnerable.  [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Jed Eckert is home on leave in [[Spokane, Washington]]. He reunites with his father, Spokane Police Sergeant Tom Eckert and his brother, football player Matt Eckert. The morning after a mysterious power outage, Jed and Matt are shocked to see swarms of invading [[Korean People's Army|North Korean]] paratroopers and transport aircraft. Their father tells them to flee to their cabin in the woods while he helps the townspeople. They are later joined there by Robert Kitner, Daryl Jenkins, and Pete. Tensions build as the teens try to decide whether to surrender to the invaders or resist, with Pete ending up betraying their position. North Korean soldiers, under the command of Captain Cho, bring Sergeant Eckert and the mayor out to convince the group to surrender; while the mayor persuades the boys to give up, Cho executes Sergeant Eckert after he refuses to cooperate and actively encourages them to resist.  Later, Jed announces that he intends to fight and the others agree to join him, calling themselves the Wolverines after their school mascot. After acquiring weapons, establishing a base in an abandoned mine, and being trained by Jed, the Wolverines begin a series of guerrilla attacks against soldiers and collaborators, including Pete. The North Koreans retaliate by bombarding the surrounding woods to destroy the Wolverines' base, killing Danny and Julie, with the remaining survivors fleeing deeper into the woods. The Wolverines eventually encounter Marine Sergeant Major Andrew Tanner and two other Marines, Smith and Hodges. They reveal that the Russian-backed North Korean invasion used an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] weapon that crippled the U.S. electrical grid and military, followed by landings along the east and west coasts, with American counterattacks eventually halting their advances, leaving an area stretching from Michigan to Montana and Alabama to Arizona as "Free America". They also reveal that Captain Cho carries a suitcase containing an EMP-resistant radio telephone that would enable the U.S. command to contact its remaining forces for a counter-offensive. The Wolverines assist Tanner, Smith, and Hodges in infiltrating the local police station, the North Koreans' center of operations. They succeed in stealing the suitcase with Jed avenging his father's death by killing Cho, though Hodges is killed in the gunfight.  After they successfully escape with the suitcase, the Wolverines regroup at their base. After a short conversation between Matt and Jed, however, they are ambushed by Russian [[Spetsnaz]] and Jed is killed in the firefight. Visibly shaken, Matt and the rest of the Wolverines escape with the suitcase to the Marines' extraction point. The next day, Robert comes to the realization that during an earlier escape, Daryl had been tagged with a tracking transmitter and that the Russians have been homing in on them ever since. After some thought, Daryl accepts the fact that he cannot go on with them and decides to stay behind, his fate unknown.  Sergeant Major Tanner and Smith depart in a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] with the suitcase. The remaining Wolverines decided to stay behind and continue to fight, recruiting more members and raiding prisoner camps, with Matt now leading the effort to continue repelling the occupation.  
REC 3: Genesis
 Koldo and Clara are about to celebrate their wedding day. The wedding is filmed by Koldo's cousin, Adrián, and their wedding photographer, Atun, plus footage cuts from other guests' [[mobile phones]] and cameras. The guests travel to the [[wedding reception]], held in a huge mansion, on [[Coach (bus)|chartered coaches]]. Adrián films his uncle, a [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]] who claims he was [[REC (film)|recently bitten by a dog]], but states that he will be alright.  With the party in full swing, Adrián's uncle begins showing unusual symptoms such as vomiting. Adrián also captures people outside in [[hazmat suit]]s, searching the area and a police car arriving. Adrián's uncle falls from the ballroom balcony in full view of everyone. His wife approaches to help but he bites her neck, then vomits blood on another guest. More guests infected with the demonic virus burst onto the dance floor and begin attacking people. Amidst the chaos, Koldo and Clara are separated from each other. Koldo ends up with Adrián, Clara's sister Tita, Atun, and a guest named Mencu, who is nicknamed Royalties. Koldo asks Atun why is he still filming and destroys the camera. From then on, the film returns to a normal third-person cinematic view. The group tries the back exits but encounter more infected guests. [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage shows the infected now roaming in the ballroom.  They discover they fit through the [[air-conditioning]] vents, apart from Atun due to his size, and head outside. Koldo is attacked by Paloma, the woman the Uncle vomited on. Adrián and the others help him kill her. Royalties tries to use the police car's radio to get help but is attacked. The sirens are set off, attracting the infected towards them. Adrián, Koldo, and Tita find refuge inside a chapel where other survivors have gathered. The survivors reveal infected cannot enter the chapel and that holy water hurts them. Clara's voice comes over the [[public address|P.A. system]] and, knowing Koldo is listening, tells him she is all right and reveals she is pregnant, something she wanted to tell him earlier. Encouraged, Koldo suits up with a [[knight]]'s armor to find her with the help of an employee, telling the other survivors to get the children to the charter coaches and escape.  In the mansion, Clara and the priest from the wedding ceremony are hiding in the control room. A horde of infected people begins trying to break into the room. The priest claims "it's too soon"; he refers to "Genesis" and talks about the nature of the demons reciting from the book of [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]]. They escape through a window. Clara finds best man Rafa and Natalie, Clara's friend; they soon encounter more infected. In the mirror, the infected are shown as reflections of [[Tristana Medeiros]]. The priest holds them off by freezing them with prayer while the others escape. Koldo searches with the employee for the control room, but the man is then killed by the infected. Koldo then finds the control room and witnesses the deaths of Adrián and the survivors from the chapel as they are attacked by the infected during an attempt to escape by coach. In the background on the TV, a news report regarding [[REC 2 | the quarantine of an apartment block in central Barcelona is shown]], revealing that the events of this film are happening concurrently with the events of the first and second film.  Clara, Rafa, and Natalie find "Sponge John", the children's entertainer, and they try to escape, but Natalie is attacked. Outside, Clara faces her infected mother. John shoots her, but later gets bitten as Rafa and Clara go underground into a tunnel. Clara refuses to leave without Koldo. Inside, Koldo turns up the volume on one of the songs on the dance floor, the song from the start of the film. Clara goes to find Koldo, as she sees this as a sign. She fights off a horde of infected, but Rafa is bitten. Clara decapitates him and flees from the infected. She and Koldo find their way back to each other at last. Their reunion is short-lived as a swarm of infected crash into the kitchen. When they began to think they will die, all of a sudden the infected all freeze as the priest recites [[Bible]] verses over the P.A. system.  As they go outside, they are attacked by Koldo's infected grandfather who, being deaf, cannot hear the priest. Clara is bitten and tells Koldo to cut her arm off before the infection consumes her. Koldo does so and they leave. However, when they reach the exit, they discover everything has been quarantined. Clara then vomits blood, showing that she is infected. Devastated, Koldo takes her outside where the police and a [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO team]] tell him to let her go. Clara and Koldo share a final kiss before Clara bites his tongue off and attacks the armed men, who shoot both of them down. In their final moments, Clara and Koldo hold each other's hands as they die of their wounds.  
The Raven (2012 film)
 In 19th-century [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], several policemen discover a murdered woman sprawled on the floor of her apartment, which was locked from the inside. While police search for the killer's means of escape, they discover a second corpse in the chimney, later identified as the 12-year-old daughter of the first victim. A celebrated detective, Emmett Fields ([[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]]), is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in a short story, "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", that he once read.  The writer Edgar Allan Poe ([[John Cusack]]) is brought to Fields for questioning. After finding the body of Griswold ([[John Warnaby]]), a rival of Poe, cut in half by a pendulum (as in Poe's story "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]"), the pair deduce that someone is staging murders based on Poe's stories. Edgar's love, Emily Hamilton ([[Alice Eve]]), is kidnapped at her father's ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) masquerade ball, like the one described in Poe's "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]". The killer taunts Poe in a note, demanding that Edgar write and publish a new story. Poe's lodgings are burned down by people who believe he is exploiting the murders for his own journalistic ends, and he is forced to move in with Fields.  A clue from the killer referring to "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" leads Poe and Fields to search the tunnels under the city with several policemen, discovering the walled-up corpse of a man dressed as Emily. The man is determined to be a sailor, and the clues on his body bring the pursuers to [[Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Holy Cross Church]], where an empty grave with Emily's name on it has been prepared. As the police attempt to break down the church doors, the killer attacks and kills one of the policemen, then shoots and wounds Fields. Poe gives chase on horseback, but the killer escapes.  Poe writes one last newspaper column, offering his life for Emily's, suggesting that he could take poison. In the morning, the maid gives Poe a letter from the killer, accepting his terms, but the note was delivered long before the paper was distributed. Realizing that the killer must work at the paper, Poe races to confront his editor, Henry ([[Kevin McNally]]), but Henry is already dead, another note lying next to him.  The real killer is the paper's typesetter, Ivan Reynolds ([[Sam Hazeldine]]), who congratulates Poe and offers him a drink. Ivan attempts to converse with Edgar, but Poe demands Emily's location. Ivan pours a vial of poison, promising to end the story as Poe had written it. Poe agrees and drinks the liquid. Ivan quotes "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", cluing Edgar that Emily is concealed beneath the printing floor. As the killer leaves, Poe uses the last of his strength to tear up a false section of floor and open a trapdoor leading to Emily's prison.  Poe rescues Emily, and they share a poignant moment before she is taken away by ambulance. Delirious from the poison, Edgar wanders off to a park bench to die. A man walking in the park recognizes him as the famous writer, and asks if he is all right. Poe can summon only enough strength to say, "Tell Fields his last name is Reynolds." Later, when Fields comes to view Poe's corpse at the hospital, the attending physician is unable to tell him the exact cause of death, but mentions that the writer was incoherent, insisting that "his last name is Reynolds." Fields ponders the meaning of the phrase, slowly connecting the dots.  Ivan disembarks from a train in Paris. As a porter carries his luggage, Ivan climbs into a carriage and is confronted by Fields. He lunges for the detective, and Fields shoots him at point blank range.

Red Tails
 In 1944, as the [[Defence of the Reich|air war over <nowiki/>Europe]] enters a deadly phase with increasing losses of Allied bombers, the [[332d Fighter Group]] (the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]) consisting of young African-American USAAF fighter pilots, after enduring racism throughout their recruitment and training in the [[Tuskegee Airmen|Tuskegee training program]], are finally sent into combat in Italy. Although flying worn-out [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] aircraft and chafing at their ground attack missions, the  Tuskegee Airmen recognize they may never fight the [[Luftwaffe]]. The tight-knit group of Capt. Martin "Easy" Julian, 1st Lt. Joe "Lightning" Little, 2nd Lt. Ray "Ray Gun" Gannon, 2nd Lt. Andrew "Smokey" Salem, and 2nd Lt. Samuel "Joker" George under the guidance of Major Emanuel Stance and Col. A.J. Bullard, face a white military bureaucracy still resistant to accepting black flyers as equals.  Strife develops between friends Easy and Lightning, each of whom battles his own inner demons: Lightning is a hotheaded and reckless pilot, while Easy is an alcoholic prone to self-doubt. After returning to base, Lightning becomes infatuated with Sofia, an Italian girl, and starts a relationship. When Lightning punches a white man who uses a racial slur at a "whites only" officer's club, he is sent to the brig and reprimanded by Colonel Bullard.  Meanwhile, Bullard secures a chance to "light up the board" when the Tuskegee Airmen are chosen to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landings at [[Anzio]], Italy known as [[Operation Shingle]]. There, they battle [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters led by a German ace pilot they nickname "Pretty Boy" and manage to raze the base that Pretty Boy retreats back to. Pretty Boy is stunned to see the pilots who damaged his plane and razed his base were African-Americans. During their first victory, Ray Gun is injured by anti-aircraft fire and suffers impaired vision in one eye. Easy reluctantly allows Ray Gun to continue flying.  Impressed with the Tuskegee Airmen's performance, the USAAF Bomber Command ask Bullard to use his fighters as escorts for [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers because of unacceptably high casualties among bomber crews. Bullard accepts on the condition his unit be supplied with the new [[North American P-51 Mustang]]. The tails of the aircraft are painted bright red and become the unofficial name of the outfit. Noting the reckless aggression of previous escort fights, Bullard orders his pilots to stay with the bombers at all costs. Their first escort mission is a success, and the 332nd downs multiple Luftwaffe aircraft without the loss of a single bomber. Lightning even takes his chances to attack a [[Kriegsmarine]] destroyer before returning to base. However, Ray Gun is shot down and captured by a [[Wehrmacht]] patrol, while Deke crash lands and nearly dies, but is rescued from his burning Mustang before the fuel tank explodes.  As a result of his injuries, Deke is [[Military discharge|discharged]], and Ray Gun is taken to [[Stalag]] 18, a German POW camp. A group of POWs recruit him, as they believe he cannot be a German spy. Easy blames himself for Ray Gun's death and spirals deeper into alcoholism. Worried, Lightning makes a deal with Easy: he will fly less recklessly as long as Easy remains sober. Meanwhile, attitudes against the Tuskegee Airmen begin to change as they earn the bomber crews' respect. Lightning proposes to Sofia, who accepts as long as he stays in Italy. Ray Gun and his group of POWs escape, but German guards spot several POWs; Ray Gun draws the Germans' attention while the others escape. One of the POWs reaches the 332nd's base and informs them about Ray Gun's sacrifice, assuming him to be dead.  The Tuskegee Airmen are tasked with escorting the first American bombers to attack Berlin, though for propaganda reasons they are only asked to escort the bombers on the first leg of their journey. When the fighter squadron meant to relieve them never arrives, Easy stays with bombers. They are attacked by Pretty Boy, now leading a flight of the revolutionary new [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighters. Despite being outclassed, the Tuskegee Airmen shoot down several enemies, along with escorting a wounded B-17 back to Allied airspace. Pretty Boy nearly shoots down Easy, but at the last moment, Lightning attacks and kills Pretty Boy in a head-on attack. Although victorious, Lightning is mortally wounded and dies, with his Mustang crashing soon after. Easy is then forced to inform Sofia about Lightning's death and consequently overcomes his alcoholism. At Lightning's funeral, Ray Gun returns, having survived his escape from German captivity, invoking Lightning's memory.  Ultimately, the Tuskegee Airmen are awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] in honor of their achievements.  
Red Lights (2012 film)
 The film opens with two primary characters: university professor and [[psychologist]] Margaret Matheson ([[Sigourney Weaver]]), who investigates claims of [[paranormal]] phenomena, and her assistant Tom Buckley ([[Cillian Murphy]]), a physicist. The audience is provided with an insight into the world of the opening section's primary characters while concurrently observing the public reemergence of a [[psychic]], Simon Silver ([[Robert De Niro]]).  The ending of the film's first half is signified by the sudden death of Matheson from a chronic vascular condition at the same time that one of Silver's comeback performances takes place, an incident that is particularly significant due to the death of a former nemesis of Silver, a skeptic who investigated the psychic's work, under similar circumstances. Matheson also had a previous encounter with Silver. She recounted a public meeting when Silver had, for an instant, got the best of her by bringing up the subject of her son's spirit (her son was in a vegetative coma and on life support). Matheson agrees only to appear on a televised panel in anticipation of Silver's return. Prior to her death, Matheson refuses to cooperate with Buckley's insistent call to undertake another investigation of Silver, warning Buckley against such an undertaking due to her previous experience with the psychic.  However, following Matheson's death, the assistant becomes increasingly obsessed with investigating Silver for the purpose of exposing the popular psychic as a fraud. During Buckley's efforts to reveal Silver's large-scale trickery, a series of inexplicable events occurs — electronic devices explode, dead birds appear, and Buckley's laboratory is vandalized. Buckley's paranoia intensifies, as he believes Silver is behind these incidents. Buckley's calm and rational disposition eventually degenerates into an obsessiveness that resembles the late Matheson's intense antipathy to paranormal claims. As part of the introduction to the climactic section of the film, Silver agrees to participate in an investigation proposed by an academic from the same university that Matheson was employed by, and Buckley joins the observation team for the tests.  In the final moments of the film, Buckley's assistants manage to reveal the manner in which Silver defrauds the public through a close analysis of the test footage accumulated by Buckley from the university's investigation. At the same time, Buckley exposes Silver at one of the psychic's public performances, and Silver is left dumbfounded. Buckley then reveals to the viewer that he actually possesses paranormal abilities and has been responsible for the inexplicable incidents that have occurred during his investigation of Silver. In a letter to his late mentor, Buckley explains a realization in which he arrives at an understanding that his decision to work with Matheson, despite the possibility of loftier career opportunities as a physicist, was the result of an unconscious attempt to seek others like himself; the revelation clarifies that Buckley's choices were made in spite of his conscious denial of the existence of paranormal activity (such denial is touched on earlier in the film, whereby the character implies that he chose this career because his mother was delayed from seeking critical medical treatment due to advice from a fraud psychic). The letter to Matheson ends with regret that Buckley denied her the consolation of knowing that there is something more, and that now she deserved even more, "everything". Buckley then turns off the life-support machine that is keeping Matheson's son alive. He then walks out of the hospital and concludes his letter to the deceased Matheson: "You can't deny yourself forever."  
The Reef 2: High Tide

But Troy and his band of goons arrive at the reef wall and threaten the fish that in four days the water will rise high enough for the sharks to swim over the reef wall. Nerissa tells Pi that he must  but tries to train the other fish to defeat Troy this time. Meanwhile, Troy threatens Ronny into following his orders by sabotaging Pi's training and tells him in exchange, he will let Ronny go. Ronny disguises himself with a piece of kelp as a wig and false dentures on is teeth. Witnessing Pi's disastrous training, Ronny gets an idea. He announces that the fish put on an "underwater extravaganza" saying every fish has a special skill, and by doing that, they will attract humans to protect them from the sharks. Everybody but Pi is enlightened by Ronny's plan. When Pi confronts Nerissa about this, Nerissa suggests that Ronny perhaps "offers something you haven't like a chance to prove themselves." Pi retorts that he tried train them to which Nerissa responds "I suggested that you teach them to be the best they can be--not to be you." He then shows Pi an image of the legendary Sea Dragon, which those who control it must be worthy to command it. When Pi asks him if he's ever tried summoning the Sea Dragon, Nerissa responds "many times."  Pi gets an idea to create a shark trap to catapult Troy out of the sea and orders the two to get him supplies. When Pi and his son Junior set up the trap, Pi orders Bart and Eddie to guard the grotto. However, Ronny overhears Pi's trap and Troy orders him to destroy it. So Ronny tricks the reef fish that he needs a clamp for his talent show and the reef fish soon suddenly race towards the grotto and destroy the Shark Trap. Bart & Eddie report the disaster to Pi. When Pi furiously confronts Ronny, Cordelia defends him, saying that Ronny believes in them the way they are and Pi didn't. Pi leaves sadly.  The next day, Troy and his goons ambush Pi and the evil shark threatens the fish that he's gonna destroy the reef tomorrow and that "shame you're gonna miss it." Troy bares his teeth, but Nerissa arrives from behind Troy and uses a sandstorm to make Pi literally disappear from the sharks. Troy, frustrated, orders his goons to move out.  Later, Troy orders Ronny to bring Cordelia outside the reef at sunset. When Ronny succeeds, Troy exposes Ronny's disguise to Cordelia, much to her horror. But Ronny, having grown to love the reef inhabitants tries explain but Troy kidnaps Cordelia. Deciding that Ronny had outlived his usefulness, Troy decides to let him go.  Pi lies in pain in Nerissa's shipwreck when they hear a noise. They see Bart & Eddie having captured Ronny when he's exposed as a shark and bring him to Pi. But Ronny remorsefully tells Pi that Troy was forcing him and that he'll help Pi get Cordelia back from Troy. Pi, Nerissa, Bart and Eddie decide to give the remorseful dwarf shark a second chance.  While Pi frees Cordelia, Ronny blocks the hench-sharks' path telling them to stand up to Troy. Unfortunately, Troy had overheard and furious with Ronny's betrayal, Troy gobbles the little dwarf shark up in one gulp.  Meanwhile, as the other fish try to prepare for the shark battle, Nerissa enters a mysterious volcano to summon the sea dragon, and mysterious powers flow around the turtle as he summons the mysterious dragon.  Troy and his sharks attack the reef, as many fish outsmart them. Troy bites Pi and subdues him but before he can kill him, Nerissa shows up with his powerful sea dragon and blasts the other sharks. But Troy sneaks up from behind the turtle and knocks him off the dragon, causing it to dissolve away. Troy then prepares to kill Nerissa but Pi throws a Water Ball at him, and Troy returns his attention to his sole nemesis and gives chase to him. Eventually Pi, Cordelia, and Junior use the shark trap to beat Troy and send him flying out of the sea and back to the humans' boat. As the humans approach the defeated shark, Ronny flies out of Troy's mouth and back into the sea. The humans then use another vaccine on Troy, and he screams in pain (which the fish don't hear underwater)  As all the fish celebrate, Nerissa congratulates Pi for becoming a true leader. Pi and the gang thank Nerissa for risking his life for all of them to which the turtle responds "It was my part to play." Nerissa then dances with the other fish, just as a fully redeemed Ronny joins the party.

Resident Evil: Damnation
 Leon S. Kennedy sneaks into the Eastern Slav Republic (a fictional [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] country formed following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]) to verify rumors that Bio-Organic Weapons (BOWs) are being used in the country's civil war, which the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Russia]] are preparing to intervene in. After his arrival, Ingrid Hunnigan, Leon's mission support, informs him the government has ordered an immediate retreat of all U.S. forces. Determined to stop the BOWs, Leon ignores the order.<ref></ref> Leon comes across his contact, "Scarecrow," who has been attacked and is near death. A Licker finishes off Scarecrow as Leon is knocked out by an explosion; a shadowy figure orders the Licker not to kill Leon. Leon awakens, tied to a chair by rebel fighters J.D., Alexander Kozachenko (Buddy), and the elderly Ivan Judanovich, the group's [[Ataman]].  Meanwhile, President Svetlana Belikova meets [[Ada Wong]], who is posing as a BSAA agent. Ada explains a master-slave relationship between a BOW and a human infected with the virus's dominant strain is possible. Elsewhile, soldiers burst into the rebel hideout; Leon tries warning them of Ivan's infection, but Buddy starts a shoot-out. Ivan tells Buddy to kill him, fearing his poor health is a burden; Buddy reluctantly complies. Elsewhere, Leon meets JD, only for Plaga hosts to attack them; Leon suspects the rebels had Plaga, which has escaped and infected them. JD leads Leon to the church, where they regroup with the remaining rebels. JD helps Leon escape, urging him to stop Buddy; a government bombing of a school (which was mistaken for a rebel hideout) killed Buddy's fiancée and her students, causing his hatred.  Leon runs into Ada; he thinks she's responsible due to her sample-retrieval mission in ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. Ada denies it and confesses retrieving a sample is her primary objective in Eastern Slav before then flirtatiously teasing Leon by asking when they're going to continue from 'that night'. Ada then leaves, warning the city will soon be bombed. Leon returns to the church to find Ganados have attacked it, finding JD the only survivor. Buddy arrives, with JD revealing he was infected during the attack; after JD and Buddy share some last words, Leon shoots him. Leon asks Buddy to give up the Plagas. He refuses and escapes when military jets bomb the church, bringing the ceiling down.  Svetlana exposes Ada as a fraud, engaging her in hand-to-hand combat; evenly matched, Ada attempts to escape. However, the room is sealed; it doubles as an elevator. Leon arrives shortly later, descending the empty shaft. Ada finds herself tied up, but frees herself with a knife hidden in her high heels. She and Leon meet up at the main hive control. Svetlana and her army troops surround them; Ada releases a smoke bomb and escapes while Leon gets into a shootout with the soldiers, managing to kill several. Buddy arrives, sending Lickers to attack the troops. Svetlana activates her own BOWs before escaping -  two [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]s- to wipe out all opposition, including the Lickers. Leon and Buddy team up and barely make it out of the palace basement, smashing the Tyrants with the elevator.  Outside, a third Tyrant appears; Leon and Buddy decapitate it with [[BMP-3|tank]] fire. With the tank overturned, Leon and Buddy are forced out into a confrontation with the first two Tyrants, which have finally reached the surface. Leon grabs Buddy to flee while the Tyrants give chase. With no ammo left, Leon brandishes his combat knife to make a last stand, when [[the United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 attack planes]] appear and take out both Tyrants, proving to Leon that his superiors were keeping a watch on him throughout his time in the Eastern Slav Republic. Just as Svetlana prepares for her press conference, she is informed by her aide that they are under attack by both U.S. and Russian forces. Their bombardment and subsequent occupation eventually force her to resign.  As Leon and Buddy watch, Buddy believes there is nothing left to live for and asks Leon to kill him before the Plaga takes control. Leon doesn't comply, telling him to carry on living, even without the use of limbs, to serve as the living memory of those who died. Leon then shoots Buddy's spine, severing the Plaga's control over him and confining Buddy to a wheelchair; Buddy resumes being a teacher. Three days later, Leon speaks to Hunnigan about the mission while watching the news about the U.S. and Russia intervening in the civil war on TV. Elsewhere, Ada speaks to her employer about a Plaga sample she retrieved, but haggles and says that she has not quite decided whether or not to give it, even as her employer manages to annul a global arrest warrant that was out on her. The credits display cinematic scenes from ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''.  
Resident Evil: Retribution
 Alice and the others on the Umbrella Corporation freighter ''Arcadia'', now face an attack by an assaulting fleet of tiltrotor [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Ospreys]] led by Alice's former ally, [[Jill Valentine]], resulting in the killing of many of the survivors in the ship. Alice is captured during the attack while the fates of [[Chris Redfield]], [[Claire Redfield]] and K-Mart are left ambiguous.  The story switches to a suburban Alice living with her husband, Todd, and her deaf daughter Becky. Zombies attack, revealing the suburbia was actually Raccoon City during the contamination incident. Alice and Becky manage to run away from the undead, with the help of Rain Ocampo, by letting them ride in her car. As the three escape, they are hit by a garbage truck, knocking Rain unconscious. Alice hides Becky, but is killed by a zombified Todd.  Meanwhile, the real Alice awakens in an underground facility and is interrogated by Jill. During a power failure, Alice escapes her cell and the laser grid, finding herself in a simulation of Shibuya Square, [[Tokyo]]. Fighting her way out against zombies, she enters a control room filled with dead Umbrella employees and encounters [[Ada Wong]], one of [[Albert Wesker]]'s top agents. Wesker appears on a screen, explaining that they no longer serve Umbrella and the power outage was staged by Wesker's hacking into the facility's computer mainframe. Wesker also reveals that the Red Queen, one of Alice's arch-enemies, was reactivated after the Hive incident and now controls Umbrella. He furthermore explains that the facility is underwater, located in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka, Russia]], and that it formerly served as a Soviet naval outpost.  The facility was designed by Umbrella for manufacturing clones and creating simulated outbreaks to show the effect of the T-virus. Ada and Alice plan to rendezvous with a rescue crew organized by Wesker, which includes Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton, and Luther West (Alice's former ally, who survived after [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|the outbreak in Los Angeles]]). Leon's team plants explosives near the entrance of the facility, which will detonate in two hours to ensure the facility's destruction. The group plans to meet with Alice and Ada in the Raccoon City suburbia area. In a [[New York City]] simulation, Alice and Ada defeat two Executioners. Leon and his team enter a [[Moscow]] simulation ([[Red Square]] in front of the [[GUM (department store)|GUM]] façade), but they are cut off by a heavily armed Las Plagas undead horde, which has surrounded them.  In the Suburban setting, Alice and Ada encounter Becky, who mistakes Alice for her clone mother, and is instantly attached to her. They also encounter the clones, which consists of Alice's deceased allies; James "One" Shade, "evil" Rain Ocampo and Carlos Olivera, who are sent to capture them. During the shootout which was triggered by Ada, she gives Alice her smart glasses and her grappling hook so that she and Becky can find their way out, and they become separated. They encounter the "good" clone of Rain (who they met in Suburbia at the beginning) in the Moscow simulation (''[[Arbatskaya (Filyovskaya Line)|Arbatskaya]]'' metro station), and Alice gives her a weapon. She then rescues Leon's surviving crew from the barrage of Las Plagas zombies and a giant Licker. Once united, the group heads toward the tunnel and reaches the submarine pens in the facility exit, but they are ambushed by Jill's team. Becky is captured by the Licker, and "good" Rain is killed, breaking her neck after being thrown by the Licker. Alice rescues Becky, and also kills the Licker using a belt of grenades she found. Barry sacrifices himself in the process, holding the Umbrella operatives off long enough to ensure the others' escape. Using Leon's bombs, they finally manage to destroy the facility, allowing Leon and Luther to escape, while Alice and Becky also survive, having used the ventilation system.  On the surface, their snowmobile is knocked over by Jill Valentine's Oscar-Class submarine. Jill and "bad" Rain confront the group with Ada being held as their hostage. Jill and Alice begin fighting each other, while Rain – now also enhanced with the Las Plagas parasite, granting her superhuman strength and healing – fights Leon and Luther. Alice is able to tear the mind-controlling scarab off Jill's chest, returning her to her normal self. Unfortunately, Rain also kills Luther in the process, while Leon is knocked out. Realizing that they can't kill Rain, Alice shoots the ice under her feet and she is dragged down by the swimming zombies from the undersea installation to be devoured, killing her for good. Alice, Ada, Becky, Leon, and Jill travel to Wesker's headquarters, a heavily barricaded and fortified [[White House]], staffed by the remainders of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]]. Alice meets Wesker in the heavily barricaded [[Oval Office]], where he injects her with the T-virus, returning her superhuman abilities; as only Alice successfully bonded with it, she is the ultimate weapon. On the roof, Wesker explains that the Red Queen is trying to wipe out humanity, and all of the remaining uninfected humans are in the base; it is humanity's last stand. A pull-away shows the U.S. Military defending the White House alongside the remaining Umbrella Corp. soldiers against enormous hordes of T-virus abominations swarming all over the walls.

In keeping with the law of "pardon and national harmony", he has to surrender to the police and give up his weapon. He thus receives amnesty and becomes a "repenti". He is given a job in a café and a place to live. But the law cannot erase his crimes, and for Rashid, it is the beginning of a one way journey of violence, secrets and manipulation. He attempts to atone for his crimes by giving closure to a family that his "brothers" hurt. Not everyone is as thrilled by Rachid's return as his parents, and some of the men from his village accuse him of having been at a massacre where their families were killed. Rachid denies having been there, but they do not all believe him. One of the men attacks Rachid one night. Rachid fights back, and ends up killing the man with his knife. The police investigate his disappearance and the murder.  Lakhdar is a pharmacist in the same neighborhood where Rachid works. He receives a shocking and mysterious call which prompts him to call his estranged wife back to town. Even once she returns, they are distant and both in great emotional pain. They impatiently await another call from the mystery caller, which finally leads them on a journey to the mountains, still inhabited by terrorists, to get closure from the trauma that drove them apart. Lakhdar's wife is very angry with Rachid, and yells at him for making them pay for closure on the trauma that she accuses him of having caused them. He once again denies involvement, saying that he only heard the story of what had happened and not participated, adding that those responsible had died a month later. This does nothing to alleviate the loss that she feels.

The Reluctant Fundamentalist (film)
  In 2011, Anse Rainier ([[Gary Richardson]]), an American professor at [[Lahore University]], is kidnapped soon after he leaves a cinema. A ransom video is sent to the US embassy, demanding the release of 690 detainees from what is described as a [[Central Jail Lahore|Muslim concentration camp in Kot Lakhpat]] and €700,000 for the children of [[Waziristan]]. Bobby Lincoln ([[Liev Schreiber]]), an American journalist and undercover CIA informant in Pakistan, arranges to interview a colleague of Rainer, Changez Khan ([[Riz Ahmed]]), whom he suspects is involved in the kidnapping.  Changez starts off the interview, held in a café, by declaring his admiration for the American equal playing field in economic advancement. He belongs to a class of people who, while genteel and educated, increasingly find themselves left out of economic progress. His father is an elderly poet and man of letters (played by [[Om Puri]]), who is respected by all who know him. Nevertheless, money has always been a serious problem in the family and Changez was only able to attend college when he got a scholarship to [[Princeton University]]. After graduation, he earned a job position at a top Wall Street valuation firm, Underwood Samson. Meanwhile, he met a young American photographer, Erica ([[Kate Hudson]]), and a relationship developed.  The [[September 11th attack|World Trade Center attacks]] take place while Changez is in [[Manila]] on business. When he returns to the USA, he is strip-searched at the airport in New York. Later on, he is thoroughly interrogated by federal agents, after being mistakenly arrested in the street as he left the Underwood Samson building. His attitude toward the USA seems to change, as does his relationship with Erica, who has yet to come to terms with the loss of her former boyfriend, feeling responsible for his death. Changez eventually breaks up with her, after she invites him to the opening of her art show: she had used intimate details of their relationship without his knowledge, which he takes as a betrayal.  While valuating a publishing house in Istanbul, Changez discovered that the otherwise worthless firm had translated some of his father's work into Turkish and published them. He realised that the company had preserved culture, something that cannot be measured merely in terms of money. His boss at Underwood Samson, Jim Cross ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), does not see it that way, viewing Changez's attitude as unprofessional. Feeling an ever-increasing conflict between his desire of success and his sense of loyalty, between the way he saw himself and the way he was now treated, Changez finally resigns from Underwood Samson.  During his interview with Lincoln, Changez says that at one point he was approached by a terrorist cell and asked to become a ''[[mujahid]]'', and he was tempted to accept, feeling deeply angered and disillusioned by "the arrogance, the blindness, the hypocrisy" of the USA, but he finally refused when he was told about the "fundamental truths" of the Q'uran, echoing a phrase Jim Cross had used during their first encounter, "focusing on the fundamentals". Elaborating on the similarities, he explains that both groups, Islamic fundamentalists and blind capitalist economy represented by Underwood Samson, share the same reductionist outlook, view people in binary terms, and thus feeling entitled to get rid of those deemed unworthy.  Being a foreigner without a job, and with his work visa set to expire in two weeks, he returned to [[Lahore]] (Pakistan), where he found that foreign professors were leaving the university ''en masse.'' He was hired as a lecturer. He voiced dissatisfaction with US intrusions in Pakistan, and this brought him to the attention of the authorities as a suspected [[Al-Qaida]] member. They raided his office and family home and threatened his family.  Back to present day, while Lincoln and Changez talk in the café, protestors gather outside, and Lincoln gets periodic pressure from his CIA superiors to get information from Changez about the location of the kidnapped Rainier. The protests become increasingly hostile, and Changez says he has heard of a butcher shop. Contact is lost before the information can be phoned to the CIA operatives who are working with Lincoln.  Lincoln becomes suspicious seeing Changez texting, the latter saying he was just communicating with his sister, Bina ([[Meesha Shafi]]); suspicions turn to fury after Lincoln receives a picture of Rainer dead, mistakenly linking the two events. Lincoln believes the only way to safety is to use Changez as a shield venturing into the hostile crowded street. Attempts are made to keep the crowd stable but things get worse and Lincoln falls to the ground, his gun goes off and hits Sameer ([[Imaad Shah]]), one of Changez's student interns, who dies from the wound. Another student fires at Lincoln from a balcony, wounding him, after which Lincoln is quickly removed by CIA agents. Lincoln then finds out that Rainer was in fact found dead earlier that day, and that Changez had indeed rejected working with the suspected mastermind behind the kidnapping, Mustafa Fazil. He also told the truth about the text message.  Changez delivers a eulogy at Sameer's funeral, as Lincoln recuperates in a hospital, recalling Changez's words as he listens to the recording of the interview – "Looks can be deceiving. I am a lover of America... although I was raised to feel very Pakistani."  
Resolution (film)

Despite the objections of his wife, Michael decides to make one last attempt to save his friend from drug addiction.  Michael promises to return after one week and follows the map to a run-down house, where he hears Chris ranting and shooting a pistol.  Michael cautiously approaches the house and announces himself.  Chris reacts positively and invites him in, ranting about various subjects.  Michael tries to convince Chris to go to rehab, but Chris refuses.  Michael uses a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] to stun Chris and handcuffs him to a pipe.  When Michael returns from a shopping trip, he sees Chris trying to cut through his handcuff with a toothbrush.  In the morning, Michael uses the stun gun again to stave off an attempted attack by Chris.  Later, Micah and Billy show up and tell Michael that Chris is holding their drugs, which they want back.  Chris warns Michael not to mess with them, as they have become more violent and unpredictable since Michael last knew them.  Michael takes a walk and meets members of a [[UFO religion]], then returns to the house and finds a set of strange photographs.  Micah and Billy return, but they are scared off by Charles, a [[Indian tribal police|tribal security]] guard who tells Michael that Chris is [[squatting]] on [[Indian reservation|reservation land]].  Michael bribes him to allow them to stay there for five days.  Michael then finds creepy film footage, and Chris tells Michael that he never sent any emails or videos.  Michael finds a book full of creepy campfire stories on their doorstep, and, when he returns the book to the library, finds film slides.  Confused by the items that seem purposefully left for them to find, Michael suggests that it's a prank by Billy and Micah, but Chris dismisses the idea as irrelevant.  Michael continues to find conspicuous clues strewn about the area.  When he bribes Charles for information, Charles warns him off and tells him that French students used the area for research.  They encounter a con man who offers to buy the house, but he leaves after Michael reveals that they are only renting.  When Michael rewatches the video  he received in the e-mail, the video has changed: it now shows an argument that Michael and Chris just had moments before, over whether they should have made a deal with the con man.  When Billy and Micah return, they kill the dog that Chris has adopted, and Chris reveals that he is suicidal.  Michael tracks down the dog's original owner, an archeologist named Byron who was a member of the original French research team at the site.  Byron believes the area is not haunted; instead, something there desires stories.  Byron stresses the need for a beginning, middle, and end.  Alarmed by Byron's eccentricity, Michael leaves and returns to the house.  As more ostentatious clues suddenly appear from nowhere, the film projector Michael has been using to watch some of the found film footage now reveals the gruesome death and funeral photos of Michael and Chris. Michael's laptop suddenly plays a video that depicts their own violent deaths at the hands of Micah and Billy.  Confused and scared, they flee the house, only to find a compact disc that has a recording of Charles murdering them and burning down the house.  Chris insists that they leave the property immediately, but Michael does not want to bring the curse home with him; instead, he wants to attempt to appease the entity.  When Chris and Michael return to the house, they witness Charles murdering Micah and Billy before setting the house on fire.  Chris and Michael panic after witnessing the murder of their counterparts, with Chris breaking down and finally agreeing to go to drug rehab. Their joy over achieving a happy ending to their story is abruptly cut short when the entity angrily confronts them; Chris apologizes profusely, and Michael asks the entity, "Can we try it another way?" The only reply he gets is an explosive roar from the creature as the camera cuts to black.

Just before the creature strikes, the tracking software warns the soldier of its presence, and the creature flees under gunfire. The soldier chases the creature though several offices and medical labs, before losing it in a dark corridor.  The soldier emerges from a duct in the floor of another corridor, and enters a security room containing a holographic projector. The soldier removes her helmet, revealing herself to be a young woman.

Losing his trust in the Guardians, Jack isolates himself in Antarctica, where Pitch tries to convince him to join his side. When Jack refuses, Pitch threatens to kill Baby Tooth unless Jack gives him his staff, the source of his magic. He agrees, but Pitch breaks Jack's staff and throws him down a chasm. Unlocking his memories, he learns that he was a mortal teenager who fell into ice while saving his younger sister. Inspired, Jack repairs his staff and returns to the lair to rescue the kidnapped baby fairies.  Due to Pitch, every child in the world except Jamie disbelieves, drastically weakening the Guardians. Finding Jamie's belief wavering, Jack makes it snow in his room, renewing Jamie's belief and letting him see Jack.

Christian has very little influence in the [[Privy Council]], and the laws of the country are mostly decided by statesmen, but Struensee tells the king that he can have more power by "acting". The doctor begins writing speeches for the king which advocate his own progressive views, and several [[reform]]s are passed in Denmark.  Caroline and Struensee learn of their mutual interests and liberal views. They fall in love and begin an affair. When Caroline becomes pregnant, they protect themselves by convincing Christian to resume sleeping with her. As a result, [[Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark|Princess Louise Auguste]] is believed to be the king's daughter. Meanwhile, Struensee is appointed a Royal Adviser and eventually persuades Christian to assign him the right to pass any law, making him Denmark's [[de facto]] leader. His reforms include the abolition of censorship, the abolition of torture, and reducing the power of the aristocracy. The [[queen dowager]], [[Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], notices the romance between Caroline and Struensee and their affair is revealed. Christian is initially angry, but he forgives his friend and states that they must carry on as if nothing had changed.  Juliana and the prominent statesman [[Ove Høegh-Guldberg]] are strongly against Struensee's reforms, while the Danish people also grow unhappy when it becomes clear an immoral foreigner has power over the country. Høegh-Guldberg incites a coup against him. Christian refuses to hand Struensee over to the people, but Høegh-Guldberg lies that the doctor and Caroline are planning to murder him and take control of Denmark. Christian thus allows Caroline to be arrested and taken to live in exile, while Struensee is sentenced to death. Christian issues a pardon, not wanting his friend to die, but Høegh-Guldberg keeps this from becoming known in time and Struensee is beheaded. Høegh-Guldberg becomes Denmark's new de facto leader, and many of Struensee's reforms are overturned.  The film returns to Caroline writing the letter, where she reveals that she is dying of an illness. Ten years later, Prince Frederick and Princess Louise Auguste read the letter. On-screen text reveals that when he became king, Frederick returned to the reforming ways of Struensee.

Ruby Sparks
 Calvin Weir-Fields ([[Paul Dano]]) is a young novelist who is struggling to recreate the early success of his first novel and unable to commit to any of his ideas. With his introverted personality and idealistic view of what it means to be in love, Calvin also struggles in finding relationships, feeling most women are only interested in an idolized and preconceived notion of who they believe him to be.  His therapist, Dr. Rosenthal ([[Elliott Gould]]), gives him a writing assignment: to write a page about someone who likes his rather uninspiring dog, Scotty. Calvin has a dream in which he meets a strange young woman, who draws a picture of Scotty and says she likes him. Calvin wakes up and is inspired to write about her. In therapy he admits he is falling in love with the character he is writing and tells the therapist all about Ruby Sparks ([[Zoe Kazan]]).  Calvin's brother Harry ([[Chris Messina]]) and sister-in-law Susie ([[Toni Trucks]]) come to visit and Susie finds articles of women's clothing around the house. That night while writing before falling asleep at his typewriter, Calvin writes a passage with Ruby admitting that he is not the kind of guy she usually goes for and yet she is falling in love with him.  The next day, Calvin is stunned to find Ruby in his kitchen, an actual living person. Thinking he is going crazy, he calls Harry, who does not believe him and advises him to meet with someone to take his mind off things. Ruby is confused by his behavior and insists on coming along, but he leaves her to shop while he meets Mabel ([[Alia Shawkat]]), a young fan of his book who had given him her number. Ruby finds them and believes he is cheating on her. In the ensuing confrontation, Calvin discovers that others can actually see Ruby, proving that she is real and not a figment of his imagination. Calvin explains that he feels overwhelmed, and they break down in love.  Calvin introduces Ruby to Harry, who is incredulous at first and suggests alternate explanations. However, Calvin soon proves that his writing directly affects Ruby. Explaining how he loves her, Calvin asks Harry not to tell anyone of Ruby's origins. Although Harry warns him that women are mysterious creatures and that things may change, Calvin insists that since he wrote her into existence, he knows her and asserts that he will never write about Ruby again.  Months later, Calvin reluctantly takes Ruby to meet his free-spirited mother Gertrude ([[Annette Bening]]) and her boyfriend Mort ([[Antonio Banderas]]). While Ruby with her much more outgoing personality enjoys the time with his family, introverted Calvin spends the weekend reading by himself, growing jealous of the time she spends with other people as Ruby's happy spirit begins to fade at Calvin's increased gloominess.  After they return to Calvin's, the relationship is tense. Calvin complains of Ruby's singing while she cooks and he reads. Depressed, she and Calvin have a serious talk. Ruby explains how lonely she is and suggests they start spending less time together. Calvin is miserable. Fearful of Ruby's desertion and desperate, he begins to write her story again in which she too is miserable without him. Ruby returns full-time but becomes incredibly clingy, afraid to leave Calvin's side for even a second. Tired of this, Calvin writes that Ruby is "filled with effervescent joy," as a result of which she becomes constantly happy, leaving Calvin morose, him knowing her happiness is artificial.  After talking with Harry about what he has been doing, Calvin intends to write Ruby back to her normal self, but the wording he uses leaves her confused. Ruby fights with Calvin once more and he attempts to cheer her up by taking her along to a party hosted by author Langdon Tharp ([[Steve Coogan]]). At the party, Calvin leaves Ruby and talks with people about his still-unfinished manuscript. He also runs into his ex-girlfriend Lila ([[Deborah Ann Woll]]), and they have a heated argument in which Lila accuses Calvin of being uninterested in anyone outside of himself. Meanwhile, Langdon finding Ruby alone flirts with her, convincing her to strip to her underwear and join him in the pool. Calvin finds them just as she is stepping into the pool. Furious and humiliated, he drives Ruby home.  At home, Calvin and Ruby fight, with Ruby telling him that he cannot stop her from doing what she wants. As she prepares to leave, Calvin reveals that she is a product of his imagination and that he can indeed control her, and is capable of making her do anything he writes. A growing argument leads to a crazed Calvin demonstrating his power by making Ruby perform a series of ever more frenzied and humiliating acts as the type bars of the typewriter begin to jam in his excitement. Ruby, exhausted, collapses to the floor as Calvin hangs his head in anguish, before gently attempting to approach her. With a sudden burst of frenzied fear, Ruby runs out and locks herself in his room.  Calvin, distraught and ashamed, writes a final page, which states that as soon as Ruby leaves the house she is no longer his creation, no longer subject to his will, and she is free. He leaves the manuscript outside her door with a note telling her to read the last page and that he loves her. The next morning, Calvin finds that the note is gone and Ruby has vanished.  Time passes, and Harry suggests he write a new book about his experiences with Ruby. The novel, ''The Girlfriend'', is a success. While walking with Scotty in the park one day, Calvin sees a woman that appears to be Ruby but she has no recollection of him. She is reading his book, which she says her friend described as pretentious. She also states that Calvin seems familiar, which he deflects by showing her his photo on the book. Embarrassed and laughing she says they ought to start over and that she hasn't finished the book yet but, "Don't ruin the ending for me." To which he replies, "I promise."

 As the Imperialist forces celebrate their victory in the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]], a participant known as Battōsai the Killsword walks away from the battlefield, abandoning his sword. But, the Battōsai's old katana is not left alone. It is claimed by one of the fallen, [[Udō Jin-e]].  A decade later, [[Saitō Hajime (Rurouni Kenshin)|Saitō Hajime]] and his fellow policemen investigate the murder of an undercover cop supposedly by the hands of the Battōsai. But Saitō is not convinced and suspects [[Takeda Kanryū]], a wealthy, but cruel businessman. Meanwhile, the former Battōsai (now calling himself [[Himura Kenshin]]) arrives in Tokyo. While roaming its streets, he meets [[Kamiya Kaoru]], the owner of her late father's [[Kendo]] school. With her [[dojo]]'s name smeared by one bearing the name of Battōsai, she attacks him believing him to be the famed killer, but is proven wrong when Kenshin reveals he only carries a .  Elsewhere, [[Takani Megumi]], a woman forced to make [[opium]] for Takeda Kanryū, escapes and turns to the police for a safe haven after witnessing the deaths of the other opium makers. However, Udō Jin-e, under the service of Kanryū, hunts her down, slaying everyone in the police station. Luckily, she escapes in the ensuing chaos.  Kaoru crosses paths with Jin-e, the actual perpetrator killing under her dojo's style of swordsmanship. Utterly no match for him, she is injured in the fight, but Kenshin appears out of nowhere and saves her. Jin-e immediately realizes Kenshin's hidden identity as the true Battōsai, before a swarm of policemen rush onto the scene, giving Kenshin and Kaoru a chance to flee. Kaoru leads Kenshin to her dojo where they will be safe. Later, a group of thugs under Takeda Kanryū attempt to take over the dojo. Kenshin beats down the entire gang without killing a single one before the police arrive. Kenshin takes the blame for the incident and gets himself arrested in order to help avoid Kaoru's dojo being blamed for the violence. Soon, Saitō recognizes him and releases him. After his release, he is greeted by Kaoru who knows Kenshin is not the Battōsai who had defamed her dojo and takes him back to the dojo. Kenshin afterward moves in with Kaoru and her only student, the boy [[Myōjin Yahiko]].  Still running on the streets for her life, Megumi runs into Yahiko who helps hide her and brings her to the dojo where she is introduced to everyone. Kaoru treats everyone to a [[sukiyaki]] dinner at the Akabeko restaurant, only to have the occasion spoiled by Kanryū coming and offering to hire Kenshin, who humbly declines. Here, he is challenged by [[Sagara Sanosuke]] for the job and they leave the establishment to fight.  Later that evening, Jin-e goes on a killing spree leaving many corpses for the police to find the following day. Kenshin witnesses the horror, as well as a woman mourning the death of her lover. This evokes a memory for Kenshin from his years as an assassin when he witnessed a woman mourning a man that he had killed, a sword fight that left a scar on his face. Later that night, a masked man working for Kanryū warns Megumi of coming dangers.  The next day the people around the dojo fall ill from [[rat poison]] contaminating the community wells. Megumi suspects it is Kanryū's doing and helps by providing medication for the victims. Angry at Kanryū, Megumi attempts to kill him, but fails and is instead held hostage by the wealthy drug-dealer. Besting all his men, Kenshin and Sanosuke attack Kanryū's mansion in hopes of rescuing Megumi. Saitō assists them to subdue Kanryū, who is armed with a [[Gatling gun]]. They rescue Megumi, but discover that Jin-e, the fake Battōsai and Kanryū's man, has kidnapped Kaoru.  Kenshin pursues Jin-e. To further provoke Kenshin, Jin-e uses a special technique that paralyzes Kaoru's lungs and can only be undone with his death. After an intense battle, Kenshin critically injures Jin-e by shattering his elbow with his scabbard. Before Kenshin could land the killing blow, Kaoru overcomes the paralysis and stops Kenshin from killing Jin-e. Jin-e commits suicide, telling Kenshin before his last breath that he who lives by the sword must die by the sword, a re-occurring theme, counter to Kenshin's vow never to kill again.  Kenshin, tired and wounded, carries the unconscious Kaoru back to the dojo. They rest, in the care of Megumi and Yahiko. Upon waking up, Kaoru does not see Kenshin and goes in search for him. She finds him carrying back some vegetables, and is relieved of her fear that he may have left permanently.

One of the magazine's writers, Jeff Schwensen ([[Jake Johnson]]), proposes to investigate a newspaper [[Classified advertising|classified ad]] that reads:<ref></ref>   Jeff's boss Bridget ([[Mary Lynn Rajskub]]) approves of his story idea and Jeff selects his team: Darius and a man named Arnau ([[Karan Soni]]), a studious biology major interning at the magazine to diversify his resume. They travel to the seaside community of Ocean View to find and profile the person behind the ad. Jeff later reveals an ulterior motive for this assignment: to track down a long-lost love interest who lives in town.  Darius discovers that the person behind the ad is Kenneth Calloway ([[Mark Duplass]]), a stock clerk at a local grocery store. Jeff's attempt to approach Kenneth alienates him, so Jeff orders Darius to make contact. Darius' disaffected attitude serves her well, and she quickly endears herself to Kenneth as she poses as a candidate to accompany him on his mission. While Kenneth is paranoid and believes that "secret agents" are tracking his every move, Darius gains his trust as she participates in a series of training exercises in the woods around his house and begins to develop feelings for him. She tells Kenneth about losing her mother when she was young and that her mission is to prevent it. Kenneth says his mission is to go back to 2001 and prevent the death of his old girlfriend Belinda, who was killed when someone drove a car into her house.  Meanwhile, Jeff tracks down Liz (Jenica Bergere), his fling from his teenage years; although she is not as attractive as his memories of her younger self, they reconnect and sleep together. He asks her to come back with him to Seattle, but she believes this is just another fling for Jeff, so she refuses. Upset by her rejection, Jeff takes Arnau out on the town and they pick up some young women. Jeff tells Arnau to not waste his youth and convinces him to spend the night with one of the women.  The next morning, Jeff receives a phone call from Bridget, who has been following up the team's notes on the story; she informs him that Belinda ([[Kristen Bell]]) is still alive. During an interview, Darius learns Belinda was only friends with Kenneth and that Kenneth had driven into her then-boyfriend's house, but no one was injured. After the interview, Darius is questioned by two government agents who have been following Kenneth and believe that he may be a spy because of his communication with government scientists.  Darius returns to Kenneth's house to confront him, but Kenneth rationalizes Belinda is now alive because his time travel mission succeeded. Jeff runs in to warn them that the government agents are also on the property. Kenneth panics and runs into the woods.  Darius follows Kenneth who has boarded his time machine, which has been integrated into a small boat on the lake. Darius apologizes for lying to Kenneth, tells him everything else they shared was real, and joins him on the boat. Kenneth tells Darius that the mission is now only to go back for her. As Jeff, Arnau, and the agents watch, Kenneth and Darius activate the time machine and vanish.  Kenneth and Darius are shown as they happily run through the woods.  A filmed interview, presumably from earlier, shows Kenneth explaining why he chose to enlist a partner for his time travels.  
Safe House (2012 film)

After, the pair is attacked by a team of mercenaries led by Vargas ([[Fares Fares]]), Wade is killed and Frost is cornered by the gunmen, leaving him no choice but to surrender to the American consulate.  Frost is transferred to a local [[safe house]] maintained by "housekeeper" Matt Weston ([[Ryan Reynolds]]), a young agent on his first low-level CIA posting. The CIA sends in a team led by veteran agent Daniel Kiefer ([[Robert Patrick]]) to interrogate Frost and bring him back to the US. Weston watches uneasily as Kiefer and his men [[waterboarding|waterboard]] Frost. When the power to the safe house is cut, the CIA team realise that they are in grave danger. Vargas and a heavily armed group attack the safe house, killing Kiefer and his team. Weston escapes, taking Frost as his charge. Weston makes contact with his superior, David Barlow ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), at [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]] in [[Langley, Virginia]], along with Catherine Linklater ([[Vera Farmiga]]), the operative in charge of Frost's interrogation and Kiefer's superior, and CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford ([[Sam Shepard]]), who is overseeing the operation. Linklater orders Weston to lay low and await further instructions.  Frost immediately begins to manipulate Weston as they go into hiding, insisting that someone within the CIA gave away their location to the mercenaries and that Weston will be the one forced to take the fall if things go wrong, warning him to be wary of the words "We'll take it from here". Weston hides out with Frost and calls his girlfriend Ana Moreau ([[Nora Arnezeder]]), a French medical resident who does not know that he works for the CIA, and tells her to leave the house. Barlow later tells Weston to go to [[Cape Town Stadium]] to retrieve a GPS device with the location of another nearby safe house. He retrieves the GPS at the stadium, but Frost creates a diversion and gets away by disguising himself as a policeman. Weston, detained by the police, escapes but is forced to fire at police when they attempt to arrest him again. Weston goes to recapture Frost but Frost disarms him and aims as if to kill, only to fire next to Weston's head and say "I only kill professionals".  Weston contacts Langley and informs Barlow and the others of Frost's escape. Linklater orders him to visit the nearest American embassy for debriefing after hearing that Weston fired at the police. When Whitford tells him "We'll take it from here.", Weston decides to pursue Frost himself. He meets with Ana and reveals that he is a CIA agent, telling her to return to Paris for her safety.  Linklater and Barlow are instructed to go to South Africa in order to pursue Frost. En route, Linklater suggests that Weston has joined Frost, which Barlow denies. Weston tracks Frost to a [[shantytown]] in [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]], where Frost is meeting Nicaraguan Carlos Villar ([[Rubén Blades]]), an old contact and document forger. Vargas and his team attack again, killing Villar along with his wife, but Frost eludes him and his men with Weston's help. Weston brutally interrogates one of Vargas' wounded mercenaries, who reveals that Vargas is working for the CIA, which is seeking to retrieve the storage device Frost received from Wade.  As they bandage their wounds, Frost tells the story of how he was forced to kill an air traffic controller while on a mission, having been told he was helping smuggle weapons. He later learned of the man's innocence, and that he was simply part of a plot to assassinate a whistle-blower who would expose [[wetwork]] committed by the CIA. Frost tells Weston he continued his career and eventually went rogue simply because he was good at it, and urges Weston to not kill innocent people. Weston takes Frost to the new safe house, where Weston keeps the housekeeper, Keller ([[Joel Kinnaman]]) at gunpoint, believing he no longer knows if he can trust the CIA.  Keller attacks Weston, and after a brutal struggle, Weston breaks Keller's neck, but he is badly wounded in the fight. Frost reveals the device contains Israeli intelligence which includes details of corrupt officials and secret money transfers involving American CIA, British MI6, and other intelligence agencies; Weston recognises the reference to the [[Mossad]] because the CIA accused Frost of selling secrets to them before he became a rogue agent. Frost leaves Weston, who passes out from his wounds. Meanwhile, Linklater arrives in South Africa and informs Barlow of the device's existence, but not its contents. Barlow then kills her and travels to the safe house where he reveals that he is Vargas' employer. He confirms that the file contains incriminating evidence against him, and encourages Weston to lie about what has happened. Frost returns and kills Vargas and his men but is shot by Barlow. Weston then shoots Barlow in the chest, killing him. Frost gives Weston the file and tells Weston he is better than him before he dies from his injuries.  Back in the United States, Weston meets with Director Whitford, who informs Weston that unflattering facts about the CIA must be removed from his report, but that he will be promoted. He asks Weston about the file's location but Weston denies having been told about it by Frost. Whitford states that whoever has those files will have many enemies. Weston assures Whitford that he will "take it from here", visibly shaking Whitford, and leaves. He leaks the files to the media, incriminating personnel from many intelligence agencies, including Whitford. Later, Weston has tracked Ana in Paris. He sends a note to her as she sits in a cafe across the street. She reads the note, looks up at Weston, and smiles.

As punishment, Docheski's son Vassily ([[Joseph Sikora]]) and his men kill Wright's pregnant wife, then promise to kill anyone to whom he speaks regularly. Luke leaves his life behind, becoming a homeless tramp. Meanwhile, in China, Mei (Catherine Chan), a young math genius, is kidnapped by men working for Triad boss Han Jiao ([[James Hong]]). Han wishes to use Mei as a [[mental calculator]] to eliminate his criminal enterprise's traceable [[digital footprint]]. He sends her to New York City, in the care of brutal gangster Quan Chang ([[Reggie Lee (actor)|Reggie Lee]]).  One year later, Han arrives from China, asking Mei to memorize a long number. On the way to retrieve a second number, their vehicle is ambushed by the Russian mafia. Mei is taken to Emile, who demands the number, but Mei refuses. Before they can further interrogate her, they are interrupted by police, sent by the corrupt Captain Wolf ([[Robert John Burke]]), who works for Han. Mei escapes during the confusion, chased by the Russians to a nearby subway station, where Luke contemplates suicide. Recognizing Chemyakin ([[Igor Jijikine]]), one of the men who killed his wife, and seeing Mei's distress, Luke boards the train and kills Chemyakin and the other Russians. Mei flees at the next stop, only to be stopped by two corrupt detectives working for Wolf. Luke arrives and incapacitates the detectives, convincing Mei of his good intentions, before he also dispatches some Russians.  Hiding in a hotel, Mei explains the number to Luke, who guesses that it is the code to a combination safe. However, Quan tracks Mei down, through her cell phone, escaping with her during a diversion, as Luke fights through Quan's men. Across town, Captain Wolf meets with Mayor Danny Tremello ([[Chris Sarandon]]), who has learned that Luke is involved.

Luke's life of exile is not one of necessity, but rather of atonement for the things he did for the government.  Using Chemyakin's phone, Luke sets up Vassily, whom he kidnaps. Emile reluctantly accepts a deal for his son's life, explaining that Mei's number unlocks a heavily guarded safe in Chinatown with $30&nbsp;million, though he does not know the contents of a second safe. Needing a team to get to the safe, Luke recruits Wolf and his detectives. Together, they fight through numerous Triad gangsters to reach the safe. As Luke is about to open it, Wolf attempts to betray him, but Luke kills the remaining detectives and takes Wolf hostage. Using the money, Luke bribes Alex Rosen, who now works for the mayor, into rescuing Mei. Alex reveals the second safe belongs to the mayor, containing a disc with data on his corrupt deals. Alex meets with Quan, showcasing his combat powers by killing Quan and his men as Mei watches. Elsewhere, Luke assaults the mayor and retrieves a copy of the mayor's disc.  Alex and Luke arrange a meeting, but Luke refuses to surrender the money, instead suggesting that they settle it with a fight. Before they can begin, Mei shoots Alex, wounding him, and Luke finishes him off. In the aftermath, Luke gives Wolf $50,000 and instructs him to return Vassily to his father, unharmed. He sends the remainder of the money to Han, to buy off Mei's freedom, threatening to ruin Han's operations should Han try to recover Mei.

Sadako 3D
 A mysterious, white-clad man drops a long-haired woman into a well. The well is full of women, all with long hair, all dressed in night-dresses.  Thirteen years after the original film, two suicides prompt Detective Koiso and his partner to investigate a string of mysterious deaths. The deaths involve video played on devices; just before the deaths, a voice says, "You're not the one." While Koiso is unconvinced, his partner deduces that the deaths are the result of a cursed video that online artist Seiji Kashiwada created.  Akane Ayukawa, teacher of a schoolgirl who died, discovers the schoolgirl's best friend Risa had been looking into the cursed video. The video had been deleted, but the [[Error 404]] message in its wake prompts the video to play when the viewer is alone. In it, Kashiwada allows himself to be killed by a long-haired woman. When the video ends, Risa is attacked; Akane arrives just in time to save her. The ghost tells Akane that she is "the one". Akane screams, and the computer is destroyed. Meanwhile, Koiso and his partner scout Kashiwada's apartment, noting the furniture and decorative wallpaper, which look like a set. The landlady notes that everything is superficial.  Akane is a telekinetic who displayed her power years ago when a maniac attacked her high school. Though she saved the school, she was branded a freak. Takanori Andō, son of Mitsuo Andō from the [[Rasen|previous film]], and a boy who appreciates her abilities, grows up to be her boyfriend. She soon realizes the video is targeted at her when, at their home, the video plays and the woman appears. Multiple screens show the woman attacking. Takanori and Akane run to a street, where they believe themselves safe, but a large LCD display truck shows a giant version of the ghost, who snatches Takanori away.  Until his partner commits suicide in front of him, Detective Koiso continues to doubt the existence of the film, even when it is revealed that the original broadcast of the online video killed its initial viewers and employees of the site where it was uploaded. Koiso makes his way to Kashiwada's apartment, eager to find answers. He discovers the wallpaper is a horde of white butterflies hiding notes and history. Kashiwada had been attempting to resurrect [[Sadako Yamamura]], as revenge against the human populace for persecuting him. He initially kidnapped long-haired women and threw them down the well, alive. However, when it was revealed that a body could not be found that way, he orchestrated the "cursed video" so that the video would find the perfect host for her.  Koiso finds Akane, whom he'd interrogated previously, and the two of them journey to the old Yamamura household. It no longer has the inn, and a "new" decrepit mall was beside the well. However, upon approach to the well, a freakish-looking Sadako facsimile appears and attacks Koiso, biting his neck. The women that had been thrown into the well had become imperfect versions of Sadako. They attack Akane, but with stealth and resistance, Akane prevails against the imperfect Sadakos.  When she arrives at the center of the derelict building, she discovers Takanori had been trapped in a mobile phone at the center of the room. A legion of imperfect Sadakos arrive, but her fear triggers her telekinetic powers, which decimates them. Akane is transported to the roof where the "real" Sadako has been waiting. Sadako says they are exactly the same, which Akane denies; Sadako uses her powers to destroy, while she helps people. Seeing Takanori with a knife to his throat, Akane trades herself for his life. Sadako agrees and goes into her. Akane is overlain with an impossible amount of the ghost's hair and is buried inside it.  Takanori, now free from Sadako's thrall, destroys the phone. The roof gives and Akane drops to the floor below covered in Sadako's hair. However, she escapes alive. In a [[mid-credits scene]], It was shown that just outside the building beside the well, Kashiwada's landlord moves away and her words, "Isn't it all artificial?" echo. In the [[post-credits scene]], the intro to Kashiwada's video plays again. However, his introduction changes. "Here we go again."  
Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed
 In August 1944, the Allies have [[Operation Dragoon|invaded]] German-occupied Southern France. [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] Captain Erich Neumann (Lincoln Hoppe) speaks over the phone, comforting his family as he is concerned for their safety. Afterwards, he executes two French men. On the early morning of August 15, paratroopers from the [[517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team]] land in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|Provence]], France under heavy fire from the Germans. Two soldiers, Corporals Harland 'Bud' Curtis (Jasen Wade) and James Rossi ([[Corbin Allred]]) land separately and alone. Curtis is pursued by Germans after a flare exposes his location, but he manages to escape.  Hours later, Curtis tries to hide from a passing German patrol, but is spotted. Seeing himself outnumbered, he quickly surrenders. As he is restrained and searched, however, a grenade is thrown into the patrol, distracting the Germans. Rossi, who had snuck up on them, kills the entire patrol and rescues Curtis. Rossi searches the dead Germans for trophies such as a SS ring or a Luger  pistol to fulfill a promise to a friend of his named Gates (in a later recollection of Rossi is revealed that Gates was killed earlier by a German booby trap when he was searching for trophies). Rossi determines using a map and a compass that the two are still miles away from their intended landing zone in [[Les Arcs, Var|Les Arcs]], a French village. The two set off before finding an abandoned shelter where they are followed by Curtis's commander Sergeant Caleb Jones (David Nibley).  Jones explains that the trio must head for Les Arcs as soon as they can as the Germans may send patrols after them. The three travel through the French country, eventually stopping at a road. They encounter Neumann, who is meeting with fellow officers and troops. The three try to hide in the grass but Rossi inadvertently alerts them to his position, and is forced to open fire and kill a German. The two groups engage in a brief firefight, which ends in all of Neumann's troops being killed. Seeing this, he tries to flee and is pursued by Jones. Neumann trips and Jones catches up to him, but is reluctant to shoot him, being religious. He apparently kills Neumann anyway.  The three soldiers continue making their way to Les Arcs when they find a woman named Emilie, who is a member of the [[French Resistance]]. She explains that her fellow Resistance members are being held prisoner by Germans not too far away, and she needs help rescuing them. Rossi is against this, suspicious of her motives, but Jones agrees to help. The group is briefly attacked by a German plane after it shot down an Allied plane. They find a dead American paratrooper and bury him. The soldiers find where the French are being held, so Jones and Rossi separate to clear the building while Curtis and Emilie cover for them. Jones is attacked by Germans, but they are soon shot by Curtis and Emilie, while Rossi kills the guards on the other side. They find three prisoners; Philippe, Gustave and Jacques, but they learn one other was apparently tortured. Rossi goes to rescue the other, but discovers he is dead. He is then attacked by two Germans. Rossi shoots and kills one and engages in hand-to-hand combat with the other. Before Jones and Curtis can intervene, Rossi overcomes an intense fight and brutally beats the German to death. Jones is shocked by Rossi's brutality.  Jones, who speaks French, plans with Philippe to travel to Les Arcs, where Germans have overtaken the town. Along the way, they encounter a jeep with two American troops; Lieutenant Woodard (Curt Doussett) and Private Stewart. Their vehicle has broken down, and Curtis begins to fix it. Rossi and Emilie have a shooting contest, where Rossi bets a kiss and Emilie bets a whistle. Emilie surprisingly wins but kisses Rossi anyway, bewildering him. After Curtis fixes the jeep, Jones notices Woodard has German binoculars and wears brass on his uniform, something U.S. troops don't do in combat. He realizes the two are Germans posing as Americans and captures them. Jones tries to get info from them and after Gustave kills Stewart, Woodard admits they were assigned to kill a French informant and collaborator to prevent his capture by the Americans. Jacques takes Woodard away and returns with two more French resistance fighters.  The group arrives at Les Arcs and Jones spots a German tank and a armoured half-track vehicle full of German troops about to leave, intending to attack the rest of the paratroopers. Jones decides to ambush the Germans, and the group splits up into two. Curtis fires a rifle grenade at the half-track stopping it, but the German troops disembark and start firing. The Allied group fire results in high German casualties and Jones and Curtis both start pursuing the tank, which apparently fled earlier but now is firing at the group. All French troops except for Emilie are killed. Rossi covers for Jones and Curtis while they go after the tank. More German soldiers are killed as the skirmish ends with Jones disabling the tank using a magnetic hollow charge and grenades. However, he is seriously wounded when a German shoots him in the chest. Curtis tries to flee but is shot in the back. Rossi is also seriously wounded after being shot. As all three lay dying, they have recollections of their previous lives.  Curtis tries to recite the Airborne Creed, something that had been said multiple times throughout the film. Before he can finish, he has a hallucination of his girlfriend, but in reality is Emilie trying to tend to his wounds, but he ends up dying in her arms. Rossi regains consciousness and is approached by Neumann, who Jones spared earlier. Rossi gets up to fight but collapses due to his wounds. Neumann who is wounded does not kill him, honoring Jones' example. He takes Rossi to an abandoned farm, where he bandages his wounds and makes him a meal. Neumann tries to befriend Rossi and shows to him photos from his dead brother and his little son, but Rossi cannot understand how a German could exhibit the same compassion for an American soldier as was shown to him when his life was spared.  The following morning an American detachment discovers Rossi and Neumann who has died from his wound. Rossi claims and receives from an officer  Neumann's Luger pistol as a trophie. In a military field hospital Rossi is informed that sergeant Jones is alive but wounded and Curtis is dead. Emilie visits Rossi, gives him the Curtis's photo camera, whispers in his ear her real name and gives Rossi a goodbye kiss. The dead Neumann remains in the abandoned farm the photos of his son and his brother in his hand and his Luger pistol near his hand.

Chon and Ben become wealthy, and Ben devotes time and money to charity work in Africa and Asia. They are both openly in a relationship with Ophelia Sage ([[Blake Lively]]).  The trio receives a video from Mexican drug-cartel enforcer Miguel "Lado" Arroyo ([[Benicio del Toro]]) of severed heads and a chainsaw, and Arroyo demands a meeting at which the cartel offers a partnership. Although Chon and Ben offer to hand over their network and get out of the business, the cartel wants their expertise and insists on a partnership. Chon and Ben make plans with Ophelia to go to [[Indonesia]] for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. They speak to corrupt DEA agent Dennis Cain ([[John Travolta]]), who is on the take from them and who urges them to join the cartel. Ophelia is kidnapped by Lado's gang; Chon and Ben are notified of the kidnapping by a video call from cartel leader Elena Sánchez ([[Salma Hayek]]), who threatens to harm Ophelia if they decline the partnership.  They discuss the situation with Dennis, who tells them that Elena is facing the loss of her political connections in Mexico (foiling her efforts to move into the US). Since she has already lost most of her family, Dennis says that he has nothing on her that can help them. Chon stabs Dennis in the hand and demands DEA intelligence so they can attack Elena.

Ben is mortally wounded, and Chon injects him, Ophelia and himself with a fatal overdose so they can die together.  Ophelia wakes from a nightmare. At the meeting, Lado steals Elena's car and escapes as Dennis leads DEA agents to the scene. Everyone but Lado and Magda are arrested. Because Ben has incriminating information about Dennis, Dennis identifies Ben and Chon as his informants in the cartel and they are released.

At the time the station was being considered for the change, it ranked #1 in [[time spent listening]]<ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/08/27/376733/-Jon-Elliott-Wants-You-to-Save-KLSD Daily Kos article about station ratings and TSL]</ref> and had a growing market share. It also explores the history of media and broadcast regulation, the move to deregulate, and the impact from deregulation that allowed for what the filmmakers consider to be  unprecedented consolidation, to the point where a majority of all media (radio, TV, newspapers, magazines, and internet) are controlled by just five major corporations.<ref>[http://www.corporations.org/media/ Media Reform Center]</ref>  
Saturday Morning Mystery
 The brainy Nancy (Ashley Rae Spillers) is part of a financially destitute paranormal debunking team composed of her best friend Gwen (Josephine Decker), Gwen’s boyfriend Chad (Adam Tate), and Nancy’s ex-boyfriend Floyd (Jonny Mars). After a particularly disastrous paranormal investigation ends with the group ruining a police investigation, Nancy is keen to take a job debunking the Kyser mansion for a bank employee who wants to sell the property. On the drive to the mansion the group runs into Officer Lance (Paul Gordon), who tells them of the mansion's history. The property was purchased by the Kysers, who opened up a church and school on the grounds. The family was rumored to have performed [[Satanism|Satanic rituals]] that involved the [[human sacrifice]] of their children and others, which the townspeople believe was the reason the Kysers did not want to sell their land to a real estate developer that wanted to build a mall on the property.  Lance lets the group onto the property, where they promptly discover a [[pentagram]] made of twigs. He dismisses this as a childish prank by locals, but still gives Nancy his contact information in case of emergencies as well as a way to flirt with her. During this time Chad experiences what he believes to be a psychic vision of the Kysers and their Satanic practices, however the group's investigations discover little on the property. Later that night Floyd uses the group's monitoring equipment to spy on Chad and Gwen having sex, during which time he sees an unknown person watching them as well. He runs to warn them, which makes the couple angry until they see that the group's van is now on fire, stranding them on the property. The group becomes even more frightened and angry once Floyd reveals that he had accidentally spiked the group's drinking water in an attempt to hide his [[LSD]] from Officer Lance.  As the night progresses the group discovers the body of the bank employee that hired Nancy, forcing them to realize that there is something at the house. This is further confirmed when they try to locate the group's dog Hamlet, only to find that he has been killed and partially eaten by a feral child. The group is then picked off one by one until only Gwen and Nancy remain, trapped by a man wearing a leather mask. They're rescued by Lance and the trio tries to escape, only for the adult male killer to knock Lance unconscious and drag him off. Nancy and Gwen both go back into the house to rescue him and in the process discover the killers' lair, which is filled with children's toys. This prompts Gwen to theorize that the killers are actually Mona and Frankie, the two Kyser children that had managed to escape from their parents' attempt to [[murder–suicide|kill both their children and themselves]]. She further opines that the Kysers had not been Satanists, but had been accused of being as such due to them refusing to sell their land to the real estate developers.  The two women try to use this revelation to their advantage when they discover that the two now fully grown Kyser children have Lance tied to a chair. Nancy somewhat successfully tries to lure them away from Lance by distracting the Kysers with false sympathy, but Gwen is grievously injured in the process. Nancy manages to kill Frankie Kyser and attempts help Gwen, who tells Nancy that she is beyond saving and pleads with her to end her life. She tearfully obliges Gwen's wish and then tries to escape with Lance, but is ambushed by Mona Kyser.  After a struggle Nancy kills her assailant and gets Lance to his patrol car, only for the two to then be attacked by the feral child that had killed the dog.

Scooby-Doo! Music of the Vampire
 The film begins with an introductory song by Tulie, a bayou dweller, who tells the story of Valdronya and the Mystery Inc. Gang. After solving the mystery of a [[Cockroach]] Monster that terrorized a factory, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby decide to take a well-deserved vacation. Velma drives everyone to Petit Chauve Sourie Ville, a small town that is hosting a [[vampire]] festival called "Vampire Palooza." They meet Lita Rutland, the festival organizer, who explains that tourism is down and the festival is losing funds. They also meet their host, Vincent Van Helsing, who runs a vampire museum and is an aspiring author, although his books are not selling. Mayor Jesper Poubelle, an anti-vampire agitator, is also stirring up trouble by protesting the festival. Mr. Van Helsing takes the gang back to his museum and shows them an ancient book detailing vampire ways, a jeweled necklace and elaborate tiara claimed to belong to a vampire bride, and a glass-faced casket containing the inert body of Valdronya, a centuries-old vampire.  The gang and Van Helsing attend a performance by a troupe of actors. The actors are deeply dedicated to the vampire lifestyle and only perform at night. The troupe leader Bram, who catches the eye of Daphne, announces the group will perform a vampire resurrection ritual. The group has another member backstage ready to appear, but to everyone's surprise, their incantation proves far more successful, and the resurrected Vadronya appears on the stage before flying away. Back at the museum, the gang discovers the bridal jewellery missing and the body gone, although the tomb is still sealed. Out on the festival grounds, they find Lita Rutland wants to profit from the publicity of the vampire appearance. She tells a phony story about being attacked that gets on the news. Mayor Poubelle also gets a media exposure benefit for his anti-vampire crusade. They check out the trailer of his organization and discover he plans to run for Mayor, and is using the vampire story to increase his notoriety. On the way back, they are attacked by Valdronya. He clings to the top of the Mystery Machine and reaches in through the skylight. Daphne tears off a piece of fabric from his sleeve, and Velma forces him off the car by running through a very low tunnel.  That night, Shaggy and Scooby are attacked by Valdronya and chased into the swamp, where Shaggy thinks he's been bitten and will turn into a vampire. There they meet Tulie, who reveals he invented a pair of hover shoes, but the plans were stolen by vampires, and he was forced to flee into the swamp. Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne, and Velma discover the fabric from Valdronya's costume is from modern material. Van Helsing, however, says the clothing has been changed over the years due to disintegration of the original material, but the body is still the actual vampire. He shows them what remains of Valdronya's original garments, and Daphne ascertains that no fabric has been made like that for hundreds of years. Daphne decides to question the troupe and meets with Bram. When she turns down his offers of affection, with a promise of immortality, he kidnaps her to become the bride of Valdronya.  Daphne alerts Fred via text message, and Fred, Velma, and Van Helsing travel into the swamp to stop the marriage ceremony. On their way, Van Helsing is pulled from the ship and disappears; when Fred and Velma investigate they instead find Shaggy and Scooby, where Velma proves to Shaggy that he is not turning into a vampire as it was just a splinter on his neck, not a bite mark. The actors tie Daphne by the hands between two trees and put the tiara and necklace on her, and they tell her they expect to be rewarded with immortality if they give her to Valdronya as his bride. The monster appears to claim his bride, and with a swirl of green mist he sends the actors to sleep, telling them that when they awake they will be immortal. Daphne also succumbs to the mist and in a trance she agrees to the wedding. Valdronya arrives, but Shaggy and Scooby distract him while Velma unties her. In the ensuing chase, Valdronya's costume is blown away by Scooby and Shaggy's [[airboat]]'s propeller, revealing modern clothes and Tulie's hover boots underneath, and the vampire is then captured by Fred.  Valdronya is unmasked and revealed to be Van Helsing. He wanted to stage a vampire wedding to create his own new tourist attraction, and to sell more books. He used a combination of the stolen boots, knockout gas, and holographic projections to create the monster effects. The hands that dragged him away were just a machine he prepared in advance. He created the fake story about the Vampire's clothing using random ancient fabric when he thought the Gang was getting close to him. The actors were duped into thinking he was a real vampire who could grant them immortality, so they helped him. The Sheriff arrests Van Helsing and the actors. Bram apologizes to Daphne, who is oddly flattered that he chose her to be the vampire's bride, but when he makes an appeal to go on a date with her after he gets out of prison, she coldly rejects the idea because she never dates actors. The gang then leaves to go on another vacation where they hope not to run into any more monsters or mysteries.

The Second Woman (2012 film)
 Twin sisters Bao and Xiang are identical, even to a fault where their mother and Bao's lover, Nan, could not tell them apart. When Bao becomes sick after the pressure of being on stage, Xiang decides to replace her for the time being since no one else in the troupe knows about her besides Nan. After hearing that Xiang performed better than her, Bao and Nan's relationship starts to deteriorate as she suspects that her twin sister and her lover might be carrying an affair behind her back. Bao takes Xiang to their favorite hill by the cliff to have a conversation and the scene shifts to Xiang alone in a canoe in the middle of the ocean. She grabs the oar and attacks a hand that grabbed her and leaves. One of the villager fisherman, Uncle Tai, witnesses Xiang running to the dock in the rain.  The family was made aware that Xiang left to travel for work and wants to report the sudden disappearance instead. But Bao (whom the viewers is led to believe is Huixiang in disguise) hesitates on the idea. Nan, though convinced that Xiang does often disappear without leaving a message, is extremely suspicious of Bao's lighthearted attitude about the whole situation. He goes to his friend, KK, to look into Xiang's disappearance and KK reaches out to his sister, Fan, to help him. Uncle Tai finds a floating jacket at the shore and reports it to the police; KK and Fan is convinced that Xiang drowned Bao at sea to take her place based on this evidence. In the meantime, Bao starts to see manifestations of her sister and is stuck between a psychotic state and a sober state as she tries to improve her acting along with Nan and the aggressive female lead, Amy. During one rehearsal, Amy is injured but Nan believes Bao caused the accident on purpose so that she could rise as the female lead.  After going with Fan to the cliff, Nan finds Bao's floral hair pin and confronts her in the dressing room. Bao recalls the story of taking Xiang to the hill by the cliff to ask about her relationship with Nan. Xiang avoids the subject. The two take cover in a makeshift shelter from the thunderous rain where Bao drops her hair pin. Later at the beach, while reminiscing about their childhood stealing canoes, she suggests the two steal a canoe and go out to the water. When KK temporarily leaves the investigation to Fan, Fan travels to the haunted house which the twins and Nan often frequent and is captured. As KK comes to her rescue, Fan persuades him that Xiang was the one who tied her up and mentioned something about Bao finally being the female lead. Fan recalls the story as Xiang tells the rest of the story to her- that Bao continued to pressure Xiang for an answer on the canoe. Xiang gives a shallow answer by accusing her sister of being a bad performer and a bad girlfriend and then pushes her into the water. Bao resurfaces and asks Xiang to save her, like when they were kids. When Bao blames her for purposely knocking her off the canoe, an enraged Xiang attacks her with the oar. Thinking she has killed Bao, Xiang leans over to inspect the water. Xiang was then pulled under by Bao causing the canoe to flip over; Bao triumphs over Xiang and leaves her to unconscious while heading for the shore. Once she reaches the shore, she heads to Xiang's home and takes her clothes. Once she changed into Xiang's clothes, she runs back to the pier to find Xiang's body. Xiang in the meantime, regained consciousness and waited til Bao reached the shore before she came out of the water too. KK and Fan reaches the conclusion that all this time, it was actually Bao, not Xiang disguised as her, who wanted to succeed in the troupe's live performance.  During intermission, Bao was locked in her dressing room and forced to watch the performance executed by Xiang with Nan. The performance, similar to Bao's and Xiang's realistic situation, allows Bao to enter the stage with ease and play a part of her original character to synchronize with Nan and Xiang while she challenges her twin to see who Nan prefers. In shock, Nan, similar to the actual play, also could not choose between the two of them. Bao tells Xiang she hates her and wishes she had stayed away. Accepting this, Xiang finally stabs herself to death with Nan crying over her body and Bao mourning at a distance as the crowd gives a roaring applause.  The film ends with Mrs Hui sitting outside her home waiting for Xiang to come home.  
Secret of the Wings
 At the beginning of [[winter]], everyone prepares for the final season of the year. Out of curiosity, Tinker Bell wants to go to the Winter Woods. The tinker fairies make snowflake baskets which are delivered by [[snowy owl]]s. Later that day, she helps Fawn take the animals to the Woods to [[Hibernation|hibernate]]. While Fawn is busy, Tink crosses the border, and her wings start to glow. Seeing this, Tink is convinced that she is meant to explore the Woods. But Fawn warns her that her wings are freezing and rushes her to the fairy hospital. After being examined, she remains curious about her wings. Tink then flies off to the Book Nook, where she finds a book on ''Wingology'', but finds the page on "Sparkling Wings" chewed up by bookworms. A reading fairy tells her that the Keeper, the author who lives in the Winter Woods, might be able to help her.  Preparing herself and using the final shipment as her only chance, she sneaks into the workshop and climbs inside one of the baskets. She gets picked up by a novice owl and makes her way across the border. The owl then accidentally drops the basket, and she crashes into the ice. Realizing her book has been flung from her bag, she tries to get it back. However, Milori, the Lord of the Woods, finds the book and asks Sled to return it to the Keeper. Tink then follows him to the Winter Library. Upon arriving, she spots the Keeper, Dewey. But before she can talk to him, another winter fairy rushes into the room and proclaims that her wings sparkled the day before. Tink meets the fairy, whose name is Periwinkle.  Suddenly, the girls' wings start to glow. Astonished, Dewey brings the two to a platform and positions their wings before the whole chamber becomes filled with images explaining their origins: that Tinkerbell and Periwinkle were born of the same baby laughter. The two then realize that this would make them sisters. Suddenly, Lord Milori arrives, concerned about the book, warning him to send any warm fairy back. Dewey tells the two they can spend a day together before Tink has to return home.  Periwinkle shows Tink her world, meeting Peri's friends and spending the day together. That night at Peri's home, as Tink builds a fire, she realizes that if she can make it warm there, she can, in turn, make it cooler at her home. Suddenly, the floor melts beneath them. Seeing this, Dewey tells them that Tink has to go home. She then comes up with a plan. When they reach the border, she tells Peri to meet her at the border tomorrow. When Tink arrives home, she asks Clank and Bobble for help, and they bring her other friends to help. The next day, Tink arrives at the border with Bobble and Clank, pulling along a snow-maker. Now able to keep her cold enough, Peri crosses the border to the warm side of Pixie Hollow. She meets Tink's friends and continues her tour. After a while, Tink then notices Peri's wings wilting; the machine is running out of ice. They then return to the border. Lord Milori appears and instructs Peri on how to fix her wings. Queen Clarion also arrives and sadly explains that they can never see each other again.  As the girls leave, the machine gets knocked by Milori into the stream and creates a massive [[Winter storm|snowstorm]]. Later that day, Queen Clarion tries to explain to Tink why the rule is important, as does Lord Milori with Periwinkle. They are told the story of two fairies, one warm and the other a winter fairy, who met and fell in love. As their romance grew stronger, they disregarded the dangers across the border. Sadly, one of them broke a wing, for which there is no cure. From that day, Queen Clarion realized that some fairies should remain apart.  Meanwhile, the trapped snow-maker begins to freeze the Autumn Woods. They, along with Tink's friends and the Ministers, arrive at the stream and find Clank and Bobble attempting to free it. They succeed, but a freeze is coming. Queen Clarion tells everyone to save the tree for the freeze will kill it, eternally stopping the flow of pixie dust. They try everything they can to save the tree. Tink then notices that a [[Vinca|Periwinkle]] that Peri had covered in frost is still alive, despite its cold surroundings. She flies to the Winter Woods but, on her way, falls into the snow. She then asks Peri and her friends about the frost around the flower, and Gliss explains that frost acts like a blanket, keeping the warm air inside. This gives Peri the idea that they could frost the tree before the freeze comes, and they then head to the tree.  Meanwhile, at the tree, their plan is failing, to the Queen's disappointment, but then Tink and the others arrive. They explain the power of their frost, but Spike realizes that the tree is too big for three of them to finish in time. The rest of the frost fairies then arrive to help. Accomplishing the frosting of the whole Hollow, Milori states that they've done all they can. He then warns the warm fairies that the freeze is upon them and they must take cover, including the Queen whom he gives his cape to, revealing his broken wing and that he and Queen Clarion were the fairies in the story. He then orders all the winter fairies to stand guard over the tree.  Some time later, the freeze begins to melt and pixie dust begins to flow again. All the fairies celebrate. However, Tink reveals that she broke a wing when she flew to the Woods and warns Periwinkle to go back before her wings wilt. As the twins hold hands and say goodbye, they touch their wings and blindingly white light bursts from their wings, which slowly heals Tink's broken wing. In an epilogue, it is shown that warm fairies now cross over into the Winter Woods and that the two "seasons" now interact and become good friends, even lovers.

Penny discovers a letter from Olivia to her parents, which reveals Olivia's address. Penny and Dodge drive to Olivia's home, where Dodge leaves a letter to Olivia and expresses his feelings for Penny. Later, they discover a marriage ceremony performed at the beach; Dodge and Penny kiss and join the ceremony. Then, they go to the house of the man who Dodge promised could take Penny to England. The man turns out to be Dodge's estranged father, Frank ([[Martin Sheen]]). After making amends with Frank, Dodge puts a sleeping Penny into his father's plane, whispering to her that she is the real love of his life. Frank and Penny depart, leaving Dodge behind.  Dodge returns to his apartment with Sorry; they soon enter Penny's apartment, where Dodge sets a record in her turntable and listens until the power dies. Lighting a candle, Dodge hears Sorry whining. Penny has returned, upset that Dodge allowed her to leave; they embrace. As the two lie in bed, Penny expresses her fear of the end being so near. Dodge distracts her by asking her to tell him of her childhood. They feel and hear a deep booming sound, and Penny tells Dodge she wishes that they had known each other sooner. Dodge replies that there never would have been enough time together and professes his love for her.

Charlie traces Myra to the cancer ward and kills her after she refuses to tell him anything.  Billy goes to Costello's house to meet his girlfriend, Angela, who is also Charlie's girlfriend. After Billy reveals to her that he kidnapped Bonny, she calls Charlie to tell him. Billy, after finding out that Charlie killed Myra, shoots Angela in retaliation. Charlie arrives at Billy's address and discovers many packs of playing cards with the jack of diamonds missing, and realizes Billy is the "Jack of Diamonds" killer.  Marty, Billy, and Hans leave the city with Bonny. Hans reveals that he was the Quaker. Marty wrote his story after hearing it from a drunken Billy. The trio drive into the desert and set up camp. Billy suggests ''Seven Psychopaths'' end with a shootout between the psychopaths and Charlie's forces.

Seven Something
 Seven Something is a love story and was shot by three different directors. As such, the film is divided into three parts; the first is named "14," featuring problems of two teenagers and social networks. The second part is named "21/28" and is about two former actor and actress lovers who work together again after being apart for seven years. The third part is called "42.195" and is about a woman who meets a young man who encourages her to complete a marathon.  Beginning with "14" directed by Paween Purijitpanya (Director of Phobia, Phobia 2), this is the love story of Puan ([[Jirayu La-ongmanee]]) and Milk (Sutatta Udomsilp). Their love will never be the same once Puan changes his Facebook's status to "In A Relationship" and starts to incessantly post clips proclaiming his love towards Milk. For Puan, each and every moment and emotion for Milk is conveyed with each upload. There are so many comments from nosy people that the total views reach almost viral levels. Puan becomes very obsessed with this online world filled with strangers and as a result his girlfriend's love for him fades with every "Like" click on his Facebook's wall.  Next is "21/28" directed by Adisorn Tresirikasem (Director of BTS - Bangkok Traffic Love Story) - a story of how two former superstars who starred in a critically acclaimed film together deals with their emotions as their careers go downhill experiencing failure in finances and fame. All they have to hold on to is their one-hit-wonder movie. Now, the actress Mam ([[Cris Horwang|Sirin Horwang]]), who is 28 years old, is struggling to get back in front of the camera again. The chance arrives when the studio announces plans to make a sequel to their hit movie. Both Mam and John ([[Sunny Suwanmethanon]]) will get a chance to be stars on the big screen again. However, John has long left the movie scene becoming a caretaker of aquatic animals in an aquarium. Mam will have to make her way to find John, who was once handsome, but is now a vulgar overweight man who drinks a lot of beer.  And the last story is "42.195" by award-winning director Jira Maligool (Director of Mekhong Full Moon Party and The Tin Mine) which conceptualizes the parallels of life and running a marathon. The human life's mileage is not much different from the kilometer sign that shows the distance of the marathon. The story is about SHE (Suquan Bulakul) a 42 years old newsreader whose life changes and transitions to a whole new chapter once she meets He ([[Nichkhun|Nickhun Horvejkul]]), a young marathon runner who invites her to join the Bangkok Marathon race.

Their uncle's butler told them if one of them dies within a month, his/her inheritance goes to the others.

Bert Garces ([[Rommel Padilla]]) and MSgt. Martin Barrientos ([[Dennis Trillo]]) are sent on a mission to counter insurgencies in the remote jungles of Mindanao perpetrated by a certain Kapitan Baltog, leader of a lost command squad now known as Alsa Puersa.  Following the insurgents' trail, the group goes to Barangay Pototan where Barrientos meets Bunag ([[Makisig Morales]]), a local who claims "undead soldiers" were "recruiting" his father. An unexpected encounter leaves a third of the platoon missing including Garces as the insurgents abducted them. Barrientos decides to rescue Garces and the others, despite Corp. Upaon's ([[Paulo Avelino]]) suggestion to notify base and get back-up. Bunag volunteers to become the group's guide.  The group later encounters the blind Linda ([[Ella Cruz]]) in the forest and offers to lead them to her father, leader of a group fighting what she confirms to be zombies. Upaon voices his doubts, and could neither radio base nor convince Barrientos to go back. 1Pvt. Conde ([[Martin Escudero]]), meanwhile, voices his support of Barrientos' decision not to abandon their teammates so they push on ahead to a part of the forest that not even Bunag was familiar with.  Linda's father ([[Ronnie Lazaro]]) turns out to be a zombie, and has been using his daughter to bring in the unsuspecting new "recruits". An undead Garces shows up, revealing he has retained his intellect and urges the remaining soldiers to join the "new army". Barrientos and his men put up a gallant but short-lived stand causing them to become captives.  Upaon finally manages to radio for back-up before being dragged away by a zombie as Barrientos regains consciousness and meets a zombified vigilante named Col. Rolando Palma ([[Roi Vinzon]]), revealing himself to be Kapitan Baltog. He formed the Alsa Puersa, aiming to replace the current army starting with the zombified Special Unit 21. Palma also explains he was zombified somehow due to tainted food provisions. Refusing to accept defeat after being surrounded by the undead, Barrientos manages to rescue Upaon after detonating a nearby cache. However, he is forced to euthanize Upaon who has begun to change after being forced to consume tainted meat.  Meanwhile, Conde narrowly escapes his zombified platoon and finds Barrientos. The two try to escape but get separated along the way. Conde ends up encountering a soldier who can seemingly change into a normal human, and the outcome is left unknown. Barrientos, on the other hand, encounters Linda's father who offers to help him escape in exchange for getting Linda out of the forest. He explains the zombies are somehow unable to cross bodies of water, so he pushes Barrientos into a nearby river before being mauled by the zombified soldiers. Barrientos is found and rescued by an Army helicopter due to Upaon's earlier distress call.  As Barrientos recuperates in a military hospital ward, the nurse informs him that he is not the only survivor of his unit. Garces and Upaon are seen in the beds next to his, revealing that they too can morph. The ending scene shows a zombified soldier attacking a nurse.  ===Unwanted=== Hank ([[Vhong Navarro]]) and his pregnant girlfriend Kate ([[Lovi Poe]]) goes to [[SM Mall of Asia]] to retrieve their gift for their parents to announce their engagement.

When a survivor runs towards them, he tells them an unknown alien is chasing him. The survivor then flees. Then the alien appears. Tom tries to fight it off, but is killed when the head of the alien jumps on top of him. The alien's body, headless, begins chasing Hank, Kate, and Ming. They outrun it. Soon, they see a teenager crying. When they approach it, they realize it's a trap. A lobster alien appears using the teenager as bait for luring survivors. The alien kills Ming and the teenager. Hank and Kate flee.  They encounter a steward. As he is the only one who knows the emergency exits, they take him with them. A small lobster alien chases them, but is killed when Ren ([[Carlo Aquino]]) shoots the alien with a shotgun. Ren was a robber who was arrested earlier by security guards but when the mall was hit by the explosion, took the opportunity to take the guards' shotgun. The four of them saw a hooded figure in the dark. They follow it. Then they eventually see that the hooded figure is the leader of the aliens. The aliens' mothership tries to suck everyone in it. The steward is sucked and is killed inside the ship. Ren tries to shoot the leader but clones into many whenever he shoots it. The trio flee. Inside a kiddie arcade, they encounter the lobster aliens and the Alpha Lobster alien who is bigger and covered in spikes. Ren stays behind buying Hank and Kate some time. Ren kills as many as he can but is eventually killed by the Alpha. Hank and Kate make their way outside the mall, overlooking the chaos and destruction the aliens brought upon the city of Manila, which has become infested with aliens. The deceased survivors: Neil, Tom, Ming, the Steward, and Ren, all turned aliens, appear behind the couple. The transformed aliens tells them that Hank and Kate are the only ones left of their kind, and that they will start a new world, a new generation, infested with aliens.

The campaign forces the CM's office to set up an inquiry commission headed by Krishnan. Krishnan finds that the police are hiding evidence, so he summons [[Superintendent of police (India)|SSP]] Chavan ([[Chinmay Mandlekar]]), who is also uncooperative.  Shalini meets with Vinod but leaves when Vinod says that he won't give the video for free. Later, Vinod is found dead in what looks like an accident. At a later Morcha rally where Jogi is filming, Damle, head of the local party leader Deshnayak's ([[Kiran Karmarkar]]) men, informs him that he knows about the tape, subtly threatening him. Jogi is about to pack up and leave town, but he and Shalini discover the identity of the goons. Shalini and her group presents Krishnan with the CD of evidence linking IBP goons to the accident. After viewing it, Krishnan sends out a summons to the leader Deshnayak, who rejects it in a public rally, sparking up a riotous mob. Shalini visits Jogi, and Morcha thugs attack the studio. Jogi and Shalini manage to escape and hide out on the roof until morning. In the chaos of the riots, Bhaggu is found dead, ostensibly killed by Damle's men because of Bhaggu's had threatened Damle that he would spill the beans about attack on Dr. Ahmadi as Damle had not paid the fee for Bhaggu's English classes and was not answering his repeated calls.  Shalini receives a panicked call from her maid Gauri, who says that Gauri's family is in danger. Shalini and Jogi sneak over to Gauri's place, where it is revealed that Jaggu is Gauri's husband. Jogi remembers that Vinod kept a backup of the incriminating video, and sneaks back to the studio to get it. Krishnan meets with the Chief Minister about the inquiry. The Chief Minister, buoyant because she has an opportunity to eventually become [[Prime Minister]], presents Krishnan with the approval of his Stockholm trip, and a high promotion. She also asks Krishnan to stop the probe and hand over all his findings to the CID of the State Police, which shall now investigate the case further.  Jogi finds the CPU amid the studio's wreckage and has a narrow escape from the thugs chasing him. They all show Krishnan the video, which establishes that Deshnayak conspired to have Ahmadi killed and the Chief Minister was complicit in this plan. Krishnan confronts Kaul with the truth, and Kaul threatens to ruin Krishnan's career. Undeterred, Krishnan blackmails Kaul, until Kaul finally leaves to talk to the Home Minister's secretary. In the hospital, Ahmadi's family decide to take him off life support.  An epilogue explains the fate of the major characters: Krishnan refused the chance to go to Stockholm to ensure that a national investigation is opened up as per his plan. Jogi escaped Bharat Nagar but as a [[pornographer]] wanted by the police. He is declared untraceable. Shalini wrote a book about the conspiracy, but it is banned in [[India]]. In the closing scene, Jaggu is operating a bulldozer demolishing old homes for IBP. A poster carries Aruna's picture with the slogans, "Chief Minister for all, IBP for all."

Shell (film)
 Shell lives at a remote petrol station in the highlands with her father, Pete (who is epileptic). Adam (a regular customer about Shell's age) works at the local sawmill. Pete has an epileptic fit, and Shell puts a cloth between his teeth (a popular [[old wive's tale]] concerning epilepsy, but not recommended). When Pete returns home from taking a car to the scrapyard there is a charged encounter between him and Shell. That night, when the heating fails, Shell climbs into bed with her father.  Next morning, Hugh (a regular, older, customer) returns bearing a gift of clothing for Shell. There is another charged encounter. After Hugh leaves, Shell approaches her father again as he repairs the heater.  Adam arrives to invite Shell out. He has lost his job due to being suspected of a break-in at the sawmill. He describes some of his own family issues and says is considering setting up a similar operation to Pete's, or working with Pete, but Pete rebuffs him. Adam and Shell drive off and have sex in Adam's car.  A young mother and child stop off to use the petrol station's toilets and the child leaves her doll behind. Shell runs off after the car to catch them. Pete sees she is not in the petrol station, and stares along the road (towards the spread-out village of [[Dundonnell]] and the [http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/sail-mhor.shtml  Sail Mhor] outlying peak of [[An Teallach]]). Shell is lying in the roadside heather, against a backdrop of the loch and the craggy Beinn Ghobhlach, and Pete can't see her. Shell returns to the petrol station to find  Pete having another fit. While convulsing, he bites Shell badly (one reason for the caution expressed above about this [[old wive's tale]]). As he recovers from his fit, they kiss, then fall asleep together. When he wakes up, Pete sees the cut on her hand and bruises on her legs (from her encounter with Adam), gets up and throws himself under the wheels of a passing lorry.  Adam comforts Shell and they sleep together. In the morning, a lorry arrives for fuel and Shell goes off with the driver, without plans of where to go. The closing credits roll over shots of the [[A832 road#Dundonnell to Braemore Junction|Destitution Road]].

Shudra: The Rising
 ''Shudra: The Rising'' is set in the time of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and has a storyline that concerns the caste system of ancient India.<ref>[http://www.newsreporter.in/film-on-caste-divide-to-release-in-february ‘Shudra: The Rising’, film on caste divide, to release in February - NewsReporter.in]</ref>  The film depicts the four basic units of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] - the [[Brahmin]]s, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and the [[Shudra]]s. The initial part narrates the invasion of the people of west Asia to India. They were of the Aryan race and they take over the local tribe and start controlling them. Finally a learned scholar, Manu Rishi, creates a caste system which classifies the local population as Shudras, who then suffer from cruel social rules. They are suppressed and exploited at every level of their lives by the upper caste people. The film shows various rules imposed on the Shudras such as waking with a bell around their ankles and a long leaf behind their back,and a pot hanging around their neck.  
Shirdi Sai
 Shirdi Sai (Nagarjuna) appears in Shirdi at an early age and disappears. He goes to the Himalayas and returns to Shirdi after a gap of 9 years. He chooses a dilapidated mosque as his abode.

Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi
 Farhad Pastakia ([[Boman Irani]]) has a dream job as a bra-and-panty salesman. Except that he is a 45-year-old [[Parsi]] bachelor still living with his overbearing mother and grandmother. But it’s not like he’s stopped trying. Desperate to get him married, Farhad’s mother drags him to see women and even to embarrassing Parsi matrimony services.  In the midst of all the daily humdrum, Farhad meets the woman of his dreams: Shirin Fugawala ([[Farah Khan]]), who drops by his store. Shirin, who works at the Parsi Trust, hits it off with Farhad from the start. Everything seems to be perfect and Farhad gets ready to introduce Shirin to his mother. But mummy becomes the villain in their story when she discovers that Shirin is the devious Parsi Trust Secretary who got the illegal water tank in their home demolished. The water tank being the 'aakhri nishaani' of Farhad’s late father doesn’t help matters.  The ups and downs in Shirin-Farhad’s relationship and how the two try to make it work is the rest of the journey.  The proposal scene in the movie where Shrin accidentally swallows a diamond ring was plagiarized from an episode of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' where Chelsie swallows a diamond ring that Charlie Harper had put in her champagne glass.  The plot of the movie is similar to an old [[Hollywood]] classic, ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]''.  
Ship of Theseus (film)
 Aaliya Kamal ([[Aida El-Kashef]]) is a visually impaired and celebrated Egyptian photographer in the process of undergoing a [[cornea transplant]] that will restore her vision. Though the surgery is a success and Aaliya’s vision is restored, she has trouble adjusting to her new found sense of sight and is dissatisfied with her resulting photography.  Maitreya ([[Neeraj Kabi]]), an erudite [[Jainism|Jain]] monk,<ref name=diff/> is part of a petition to ban [[animal testing]] in India. When he is diagnosed with liver [[cirrhosis]], his reluctance towards animal-tested medication is questioned and he must now depend on the people he’s been fighting against – a path he refuses to take.  A young Indian stockbroker, Navin ([[Sohum Shah]]), has just received a [[new kidney]]. He soon learns of a case of [[organ theft]] involving an impoverished bricklayer, Shankar. He initially fears that his new kidney was the one stolen from Shankar. When he learns that the recipient of the [[kidney]] lives in Sweden, he decides to go there to help Shankar get his kidney back – but is Shankar perhaps better helped by a large financial settlement instead of having two kidneys again?  Ship of Theseus ends with the [[Allegory of the Cave|Platonic Allegory of the cave]]. The philosopher Plato argues that human beings are imprisoned in the cave of their own existence, falsely believing the temporary as having permanence. The job of a philosopher, he argues, is to help people find a way out of the cave.  In the last scene of the film, we see the shadow of the man in the walls of the cave he is exploring. Those who received his organs (including Aaliya, Maitreya and Navin) watch this short clip. The man who we see only as the shadow in this clip did not make it out of the allegorical prison-cave described by Plato.

Silent Hill: Revelation
   Heather Mason ([[Adelaide Clemens]]) and her adoptive father Christopher ([[Sean Bean]]), have spent the past few years moving from town to town and assuming different identities. Heather believes that they are on the run from the police because Christopher killed a man in self-defense and that her adoptive mother Rose ([[Radha Mitchell]]) died in a car crash. In fact, he has been protecting her from a cult of Silent Hill, called the Order. Rose was able to free Heather (Sharon) from one of the alternate dimensions using one half of a talisman called the Seal of Metatron, but she herself remained trapped in Silent Hill.  Heather meets fellow student [[List of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 characters#Vincent Smith|Vincent Cooper]] ([[Kit Harington]]), but is haunted by hallucinations of Silent Hill. She is approached by private investigator [[List of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 characters#Douglas Cartland|Douglas Cartland]] ([[Martin Donovan]]) regarding her identity. Heather warns her father, but he is abducted by the Order and taken to Silent Hill. Unaware of this, Heather goes to a mall to wait for him, but enters the mall's Otherworld. Douglas explains he was hired by the Order to find Heather, but decides to help her when he discovered who his clients were. A monster, the Missionary (Liise Keeling), kills Douglas. Heather returns to the real world and flees, unfortunately leaving her a suspect of Douglas' murder.  Vincent escorts her home, but they find a message instructing Heather to go to Silent Hill. On the way to rescue her father, Heather reads a letter from her father detailing the truth of her background and lost memories. Heather and Vincent travel to the town, but stop at a motel, where Vincent reveals that he is the son of the Order’s leader [[List of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 characters#Claudia Wolf|Claudia Wolf]] ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), and was sent by her to ensure Heather came of her own volition to Silent Hill. He reveals that Heather is a part of [[Alessa Gillespie]] ([[Erin Pitt]]), a girl whose immolation 38 years ago by the Order lead to creation of the town's shifting dimensions. The resulting argument triggers a shift to the Otherworld. The Missionary grabs Vincent, but not before he tells Heather to find his grandfather Leonard ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), who possesses the other half of the Seal of Metatron.  Heather ventures into one of the alternate dimensions to find Leonard. She encounters Alessa’s mother Dahlia ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), who reveals that Claudia intends to complete the purpose intended for Alessa at her burning. Heather finds Leonard who after informing her that the Seal of Metatron will reveal "the true nature of things," fuses Heather's half of the amulet with the one he possesses and becomes a monster. After being knocked out and carried off, Heather regains consciousness and grabs the amulet from within his body, killing Leonard. As she runs away, she unknowingly summons [[Pyramid Head]] (Roberto Campanella), the entity created to protect Alessa (and by extension Heather), and hides from him. Shortly after, she witnesses Vincent being taken away by the Order after being deemed insane by Claudia for betraying them.  Heather saves Vincent and they go to Lakeside Amusement Park where the Order's sanctuary is hidden. Dark Alessa ([[Erin Pitt]] and [[Adelaide Clemens]]), the manifestation of Alessa’s wrath, confronts Heather who embraces her counterpart, absorbing her, and making Alessa complete once again. Heather confronts Claudia, who is holding Christopher and Vincent hostage. Claudia explains that Alessa's destiny was to be the incubator for a deity worshiped by the Order, who would punish all sinners upon its birth, completing Heather's destiny as well. Remembering Leonard's words, Heather gives Claudia the Seal of Metatron, revealing her to be the Missionary. Heather summons Pyramid Head, who kills the Missionary, allowing Heather to rescue Vincent and Christopher.  As the fog fades from the town, Christopher decides to stay in Silent Hill to find and free Rose, leaving Heather and Vincent to care for each other. They manage to hitch a ride away from the place in a truck driven by [[Silent Hill: Origins|Travis Grady]] ([[Peter Outerbridge]]). Travis mentions to Heather (now referring to herself as Sharon) and Vincent that they were lucky he was there since [[Silent Hill: Origins|he hadn't been driving in that direction for a long time]]. [[Silent Hill: Downpour|A couple of police cars, followed by a prisoner transport, enter the area of Silent Hill]], which is then consumed by the fog. In a post-credits scene, Pyramid Head is seen walking through an unknown area in Silent Hill.

Sightseers
  Chris ([[Steve Oram]]) is a caravan fan and aspiring writer who takes his girlfriend Tina ([[Alice Lowe]]) on a road trip, much to the chagrin of Tina's mother (Eileen Davies), who has never forgiven Tina for the death of their dog "Poppy". At their first stop, the [[National Tramway Museum]], Chris confronts a man ([[Tony Way]]) who is littering, and the man refuses to pick up his rubbish. When they get back to their car, Chris runs him over and kills him. Chris claims that the death was an accident, but smirks after the impact, unseen by Tina. Chris tells Tina that she is his muse.  They meet Janice ([[Monica Dolan]]), Ian ([[Jonathan Aris]]) and their dog Banjo (who resembles Poppy) at a caravan park and Janice reveals that Ian is a published writer, something that makes Chris jealous. The next morning Ian goes for a walk. Chris follows him, hits him in the head with a rock, steals his camera and pushes him off a cliff. Tina takes Banjo with them as they go. Tina finds photos of Ian and Janice on the camera and confronts Chris, who confesses to Ian's murder. Tina accepts this. During a walk through a National Trust park, Banjo defecates on the ground and a tourist ([[Richard Lumsden]]) tells Tina to clear up the mess. Chris arrives and encourages Tina to claim that the man tried to rape her. A row ensues, and Chris beats him to death.  At the next caravan park, Chris meets Martin (Richard Glover), an engineer who is testing a mini-caravan that can be attached to the back of a bicycle. During a meal in a restaurant, Tina goes to the bathroom. When she returns, she finds Chris kissing the bride from the hen party at a nearby table as part of a bachelorette dare. Upset, Tina follows the bride outside and kills her by pushing her down a steep hill onto some rocks, observed by Chris. The next morning, instead of visiting a local tourist attraction, Chris says he is helping Martin make some modifications to his caravan. They argue, and Tina drives off alone. Upset, she calls her mother and is about to confess to the murders, when her mother hangs up. Later that night, Tina tries to seduce Chris by talking about their complicity in the murders, but he rejects her.  Chris wakes up to find Tina has left him sleeping in the caravan and is speeding down the highway. He calls her and tells her to pull over. Tina notices a jogger and runs him over. Chris is upset with her chaotic approach to the murders, believing himself to be justified in his choice of victims, and argue before hiding the body at the side of the road. They drive to a mountain, where they set up camp with the [[Ribblehead Viaduct]] in sight, the final destination on their holiday. When a hailstorm forces them back inside the caravan, Chris falls asleep and Tina looks at his notebook, finding a drawing of her and Chris standing on the viaduct, about to jump.  Martin arrives, with Banjo in the mini-caravan. While Chris is outside, Tina tries to seduce Martin, who is made uncomfortable by her advances and rejects her. When Chris returns, she tells him that Martin propositioned her in a particularly implausible and repulsive manner. Martin returns to his mini-caravan, and Chris and Tina have a fight over whether the dog should be called by the name "Poppy" or "Banjo". Upset, Tina pushes Martin's mini-caravan off the cliff, with him still in it. She re-enters their caravan and tells Chris that the problem is over. He runs outside, and finds Martin's dead body. He insults Tina and they fight, which ends in them having sex.  Chris sets the caravan on fire and kisses Tina. They run to the Ribblehead Viaduct and climb to the top, holding hands. Chris asks Tina if she enjoyed the holiday and she says it was brilliant. He apologises for insulting her and asks if she really wants to kill herself. Just as Chris steps off the viaduct, Tina lets go of his hand, watching as he falls to the ground and dies. Tina stares at her hand as the screen cuts to black.

 After eight months of treatment in a mental health facility for [[bipolar disorder]], Patrizio "Pat" Solitano, Jr. ([[Bradley Cooper]]) is released into the care of his father Patrizio, Sr. ([[Robert De Niro]]) and mother Dolores ([[Jacki Weaver]]) at his childhood home in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania]]. His main focus is to reconcile with his ex-wife, Nikki (Brea Bee). She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat had found her in the shower with another man and nearly beat him to death. During his time in the clinic Pat befriends Danny McDaniels ([[Chris Tucker]]), an easygoing man who is embroiled in a legal dispute with the clinic on whether or not he is eligible to leave. Pat's therapist, Dr. Patel ([[Anupam Kher]]), does his best to convince him to keep taking his medication, as a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. But Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: he attempts to see the good, or [[silver lining (idiom)|silver lining]]s, in all that he experiences.  At dinner with his friend Ronnie ([[John Ortiz]]) and his wife Veronica ([[Julia Stiles]]), Pat meets Veronica's sister Tiffany Maxwell ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]), a young widow with depression and relationship problems. They connect over dinner talking about different medications they took since they're both mentally ill. Sparks fly between Pat and Tiffany and she tries to connect by offering [[casual sex]], but Pat keeps focusing on getting Nikki back. Tiffany tries to get closer to Pat and even offers to deliver a letter to Nikki—if, in return, he will practice dancing with her (which she does as a therapy) and to partner with her in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks. Even Danny comes to help but when he does Pat starts to get jealous and shows a bit of affection for Tiffany but tries to push it away. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki that he has changed and become a better person.  The elder Patrizio hopes to open his own restaurant and has resorted to [[Bookmaker#Legality|illegal bookmaking]]. Having bet virtually all of his money on the outcome of a [[Philadelphia Eagles]] game, he asks Pat to attend as a "good-luck charm". Danny is eventually released from the clinic, and teaches Pat and Tiffany some new dance moves for their routine.  Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may be a chance for reconciliation between them. Before he gets into the stadium, Pat gets involved in a fight when some racist fans harass the Indian fans there including his therapist Dr. Patel, and is hauled away by the police. The Eagles lose the game and Patrizio is furious. Tiffany shows up at their house and points out that the way she is "reading the signs," Philadelphia teams do better when she and Pat are together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a [[parlay (gambling)|parlay]] with his gambling friend: if the Eagles win their next game ''and'' Tiffany and Pat score 5 out of 10 in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant, and Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade Pat to dance in the competition by telling him that Nikki will be there; it is revealed that his parents have secretly supported Tiffany's attempts to get along with him. Pat notices that the letter from Nikki also refers to "reading the signs" and realizes that Tiffany wrote it.  Tiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.

Consulting a local deputy (whom Ellison nicknames Deputy So & So), they discover that the murders took place at different times, beginning in the 1960s and in different cities across the country. He also learns that a child from each family went missing following every murder. The deputy refers Ellison to Professor Jonas, whose expertise is the [[occult]], to decipher the symbol in the films. Jonas tells Ellison that such symbols are that of a [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] deity named Bughuul, who would kill entire families and then take one of their children in order to consume his/her soul.  One night, Ellison hears the film projector running and finds the missing children seated in the attic watching one of the films. Bughuul suddenly appears on camera before physically appearing before Ellison, causing him to fall off the ladder. Ellison takes the camera, projector and the films outside and burns them with petrol. His wife meets him outside and he tells her that they're moving back to their old house immediately. At his old home, Ellison receives a video-message from Jonas, who sends him scans of historical [[Religious images in Christian theology|images]] associated with Bughuul, including the symbol seen in the murder movies; [[early Christians]] believed that images of Bughuul served as a gateway for the demon to come from the spiritual realm to the mortal world, and children who come into contact with these images can be possessed.   Ellison discovers the unharmed projector and films in his attic, exactly as he did in the new house, along with an envelope of film labeled "''Extended Cut Endings''". Deputy So & So calls and informs him that every murdered family had previously lived in the house where the last murder took place and each new murder occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into their new residence. By moving, Ellison has placed himself and his family in line to be the next victims.  The extra footage depicts the missing children coming onscreen following each murder, revealing themselves to be the killers, before suddenly disappearing. Ellison becomes light-headed, and notices a bright green liquid mixed with his coffee in the cup, along with a note reading "Good Night, Daddy" under the cup before losing consciousness. Ellison awakens to find himself, Tracy and Trevor bound and gagged on the floor. Ashley, under Bughuul's possession, approaches them, filming with the 8&nbsp;mm camera, and murders them all on camera with an axe. Ashley then views the film of her murders while drawing the murder in the lid of the home movies box. The missing children stare at her through the camera, but flee when Bughuul appears. He lifts Ashley into his arms and teleports into the film with her. The box of films is seen sitting in the Oswalt family's attic, now accompanied by Ashley's reel, labeled "''House Painting '12''".

Sister (2012 film)
  Twelve-year-old Simon ([[Kacey Mottet Klein]]) lives with his older sister Louise ([[Léa Seydoux]]) in a housing complex below a luxury Swiss ski resort. Despite his age, he supports both him and his sister by stealing equipment from the resort, refurbishing them to look new before reselling them to children at a discounted price. Though he makes a substantial sum of money through these sales, he spends most of it on Louise, buying her clothes and giving her money so that she can go on dates. Louise is selfish and irresponsible, unable to hold down a job and frequently going off with men, leaving Simon alone at home. Though Simon tries to teach her how to refurbish the skis, she leaves with Bruno ([[Yann Trégouët]]) on a short vacation.  At the ski resort, Simon meets tourist Kristin ([[Gillian Anderson]]) by helping her with her son's equipment. He introduces himself as Julien, explaining that he is alone because his parents are busy running a hotel. Later he eats lunch with her and is surprised when she insists on paying for the food, as he is used to financially supporting Louise. He also meets Mike ([[Martin Compston]]), an employee of the resort who catches him hoarding stolen skis. Mike is furious, but after Simon explains that he sells the skis to pay for food and basic necessities he decides to partner with him. Simon continues to steal equipment, and in return for some of it, Mike gives him more access to hide the stolen skis. Mike asks Simon about his parents, and Simon explains that they died in a car accident and that he is alone.  Louise returns from her trip with Bruno, who stays the night. Louise explains that Simon is only staying at their home temporarily. When Bruno asks Simon where he lives, Simon replies "with my parents" and says that they have a "fucked-up family." Bruno takes the siblings out driving in his BMW the next morning so that Louise can pick out a car and thus have better luck with getting a job. After Simon sees Bruno and Louise flirting with each other, he confesses that Louise is not his sister, but his mother. Upset, Louise begins to cry, telling her boyfriend that she was going to tell him eventually. A furious Bruno kicks them out of the car and leaves them to walk home by themselves. Louise, livid, demands that Simon follow her at a large distance; she keeps their true relationship a secret because of how hard it is to get a boyfriend and find a job while being a single parent. She says that he has been her "ball and chain" for twelve years, and he, furious, states that she's his, pointing out that he pays for her.  That night, Simon pays money to sleep beside his mother, and Louise only accepts after raising the price. Simon accepts, and Louise admits that she didn't want to keep him. When Simon asks why she did, she tells him that she only did so because everyone pressured her not to. After Simon falls asleep, Louise sneaks out of the house with the money and gets drunk. She's found passed out in a field the next morning, and Simon has to carry her home with the help of the neighborhood children. Simon realizes that she'd spent all of their money and they are broke.   Simon returns to the ski resort with another child, and Mike, angered at the sight of a younger boy stealing, rebukes Simon and refuses to steal the children's skis. Simon hides the skis anyway and steals coin purses but finds that he's only managed to steal a small sum of change. His stash of stolen equipment is found and he's thrown out of the resort. He tries and fails to sell the rest of his equipment on the side of the road.  Left without a source of income, Simon is forced to ask one of his old customers for food, but Louise cooks for him. She later takes him with her to her new job as part of a cleaning service, claiming that he's helping her with holiday cleaning. She gives him some money, telling him that she doesn't want to owe him a debt for his troubles. They end up at the cabin of Kristin, who is disappointed when she recognizes Simon and realizes that he's lied. Simon apologizes and attempts to hug her, but she rebuffs him. Later, she confronts Louise and tells her that a watch from the bathroom is missing, asking her to bring Simon in as well. Louise promises that she hadn't taken it, but does not believe Simon when he turns out his pockets. Louise finds the watch hidden in his pants, and Kristin coldly dismisses them.  Louise is infuriated that Simon cost her a job, and the two fight before returning home. Simon goes back to the resort one last time and finds that the guests are all leaving for the summer. He asks about a job but is rebuffed, and he is left staring out at the emptying resort. He takes a cable car back down and passes Louise, who is going up. Surprised and worried, she presses herself against the glass and calls to him, but she disappears from sight and Simon is left looking out after her.

The Sino-Japanese War at Sea 1894
 ''The Sino-Japanese War at Sea 1894'' is set in the late 19th century and based on the events of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–95), which was fought between the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] of China and the [[Empire of Japan]].  A young [[Deng Shichang]] enrols in the Fujian Naval Academy, where he meets his future colleagues such as [[Liu Buchan]] and [[Fang Boqian]]. In 1877, Liu, Fang, and others travel to London to further their studies at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] while Deng remains in China. Some years later, Deng visits his classmates in London and meets [[Itō Sukeyuki]], who is also studying there.  The [[Guangxu Emperor]] wants to modernise and reform China but his efforts are hindered by [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who effectively controls the emperor and the Qing government. The Qing Empire's [[Beiyang Fleet]] is formed in the 1880s and is one of the largest naval fleets in Asia at the time. In 1886, after the [[Nagasaki incident]] breaks out, the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]] of Japan feels threatened by the Beiyang Fleet's prowess, so he initiates a plan to strengthen and enhance the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Meanwhile, in China, the state funds originally designated for upgrading the Beiyang Fleet are used to renovate the [[Summer Palace]] to celebrate the empress dowager's 60th birthday.  The First Sino-Japanese War breaks out in 1894. The navies of the two empires clash at the battles of [[Battle of Pungdo|Pungdo]] and [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|the Yellow Sea]]. At the Yellow Sea, after an exchange of gunfire between warships from both sides over a few hours, most of the Beiyang Fleet is destroyed while not a single Japanese ship is sunk even though the Japanese ships also sustained heavy damage. Deng Shichang's ship, the ''[[Chinese cruiser Zhiyuan|Zhiyuan]]'', has been badly damaged. Deng gives orders for the ''Zhiyuan'' to ram the Japanese flagship ''[[Japanese cruiser Yoshino|Yoshino]]'', but the ''Zhiyuan'' is sunk before it makes contact with the ''Yoshino''. Deng stubbornly refuses to escape with the survivors and eventually drowns at sea with his pet dog.  After their victory at the Yellow Sea, the Japanese follow up by launching a land invasion and win the [[Battle of Lushunkou|Battle of Lüshun]], after which they [[Port Arthur massacre (China)|massacre the city's population]]. In the following year, the Japanese score another victory at the [[Battle of Weihaiwei]]; the Qing admiral [[Ding Ruchang]] commits suicide after his defeat. Itō Sukeyuki writes to Liu Buchan, his old classmate from the Royal Naval College, and asks him to surrender. Liu refuses and kills himself after blowing up his own warship. On 14 January 1895, the Japanese annex the [[Senkaku Islands|Diaoyu Islands]] and rename them "Senkaku Islands".  The Qing Empire agrees to hold peace talks with Japan and appoints [[Viceroys in China|Viceroy]] [[Li Hongzhang]] as its representative to negotiate with the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Itō Hirobumi]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Minister]] [[Mutsu Munemitsu]] in [[Shimonoseki]]. Japan demands that the Qing Empire cedes [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], and the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], and pay [[war reparations]] amounting to 250 million silver [[tael]]s, among other things. Li rejects the terms and leaves. He is shot in the cheek by a Japanese fanatic on the way back. While recovering in hospital, he receives a telegraph from the Qing government instructing him to accept the Japanese terms. He signs the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] on 17 April 1895.  Before the film ends, the narrator of the film drops an old photograph of Deng Shichang and his classmates at the Fujian Naval Academy into the sea. The photograph sinks to the bottom of the sea and comes to rest in the wreckage of a warship.  
Six (film)
 The film is set in Uravakonda, a remote village situated in India (Nallamala Hills or Forest). The plot is based on a series of mysterious deaths that occur during nighttime. The villagers become afraid to leave their homes between 6:00pm-6:00am. The police were unable to provide a specific answer about this strange phenomena.  Lead investigator Satyam Rajesh thought the unexplained deaths were the work of wizards, ghosts, vampires, or foul play by the village head, Pruthvi Raj. Only a young girl from Uravakonda named Tripura (Gayatri Iyer§) was able to reveal the secret behind the murders. When interrogated by the police officer, she reveals that a scientist (Surya), using the cover of the forest to research resurrection through viruses, had exhumed her lover Vijay ([[Jagapati Babu]]), a newly qualified Indian Administrative Service officer tragically killed by a lightning and revived his corpse. Her lover was then revived by an unsuccessful experiment, turning him into a monster that must drink human blood between sunset and sunrise to survive. Tripura, the police officer and the scientist venture into the forest to find, catch, and cure Vijay, with an antivirus that will return him to human form. Once the mystery of Uravakonda’s deaths is solved, the village returns to normal and Vijay takes up his role as an IAS officer.  
Small Apartments
 Franklin Franklin is a [[Alopecia universalis|hairless]], [[overweight]], [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] [[Anti-social behaviour|social misfit]] and [[Compulsive hoarding|compulsive hoarder]] obsessed with [[Switzerland]], who walks around wearing little more than briefs and mismatching socks and lives on a diet consisting of [[Moxie|Moxie soda]] and [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]]s with [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]. Living alone in an almost bare apartment in a rundown building complex in [[Southern California]] populated with other eccentrics, including cynical [[Drug culture|stoner]] Tommy Balls, neurotic geriatric recluse Mr. Allspice, and aspiring [[dance]]r Simone who lives with her mother – both of whom may or may not be [[Prostitution|prostitutes]].  At an earlier point, Franklin's landlord Mr. Olivetti accidentally died after slipping on spilled mustard caused by sneezing fits when receiving [[fellatio]] from Franklin over frequent unpaid rent. In an effort to get rid of  Olivetti's body, Franklin takes it to Olivetti's house and tries to stage it as a [[suicide]], implementing an unlikely over-array of suicide methods. Attempting to dump Olivetti's pickup truck in the outskirts of town results in Franklin being [[robbery|robbed]] (of both his brother's watch and Olivetti's truck) and assaulted by two very dimwitted muggers.  The next day, Franklin wonders why he hasn't gotten his weekly audiotape from his institutionalized brother Bernard, whom Franklin [[Relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder|almost idolizes]] as Bernard is [[Physical attractiveness|handsome]], [[charisma]]tic and [[Popularity|popular]] and included Franklin in his [[Socialization|social life]].  Unknown to Franklin, Bernard has died of an inoperable brain tumor and among Bernard's effects is an envelope holding a key to a locker containing a recorded message revealing that Bernard stole from his employer and has left Franklin a savings in a [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]] and a [[passport]] [[Identity creation|in a new identity]]. Meanwhile, fire investigator Burt Walnut, and other detectives examine Olivetti's body, and quickly conclude that it's staged due to Franklin's amateurishness, and put a lookout for his pickup truck. Walnut, visiting the apartment complex, meets Balls and Allspice and becomes suspicious of Franklin. Walnut is estranged from his wife (who was having an affair with his cousin), and learns that Allspice's wife died around the time as Olivetti's wife, 13 years ago.  Working at his [[convenience store]], Balls shatters Simone's dancing dreams with his brutal honesty; upset, she hides in the restroom. Balls is then held up by Franklin's muggers, who shoot Balls in the [[Trunk (anatomy)|torso]] when startled by Simone. Franklin returns to his apartment, but seeing the police, keeps on driving. Walnut discovers that Allspice has committed suicide, (likely upset over the death of Olivetti as Allspice revealed that they were close friends) and when answering a phone call by Franklin, is asked to adopt Franklin's dog (also named Bernard). Walnut informs Franklin of the muggers' arrest, calling them Olivetti's murderers, remarking of Olivetti that "some might say that he had it coming to him."  Although innocent, Franklin takes his Switzerland flight (dressed in shorts and button up shirt), sitting next to Dr. Sage Mennox, a self-help author whom Bernard obsessed over. Franklin tells Dr. Mennox that his brother had died, and was not insane (as Mennox had previously asserted), but had actually been impaired by a fatal brain tumor "the size of a racquet ball". Mennox is taken off guard by this, and Franklin (who has held a grudge against him for belittling Bernard, his hero, in the past), slyly remarks that they would be stuck together, in this awkward situation (on Mennox's part), for the duration of a very long flight.  Ultimately, Franklin is seen in Switzerland standing in front of the [[Matterhorn]] mountain surrounded by three attractive [[Swiss people|Swiss women]] in [[Folk costume|Swiss folk costume]].  
Skyfall
  [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agents [[James Bond]] and [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]] pursue mercenary [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Skyfall|Patrice]], who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents.  As Bond and Patrice fight atop a train, [[M (James Bond)|M]] orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice from long range.  Moneypenny misses and inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river.  Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes.  Three months later M comes under pressure from Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]'s [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|Intelligence and Security Committee]], to retire.  MI6's servers are hacked and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 headquarters explode.  Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to London.  Although he fails a series of physical and psychological examinations, M approves his return to the field.  Bond is ordered to identify Patrice's employer, recover the stolen hard drive, and kill Patrice.  He meets [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], MI6's new [[quartermaster]], who gives him a radio beacon and a [[Walther PPK]] pistol.  In [[Shanghai]], Bond follows Patrice into a skyscraper but is unable to prevent him from killing a target.  The two fight, but Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity.  Bond finds a [[casino token]] in Patrice's rifle case, which leads him to a casino in [[Macau]].  Bond is approached by [[Sévérine]], Patrice's accomplice, and he asks to meet her employer.  She warns him that he is about to be killed by her bodyguards, but promises to help Bond if he will kill her employer.  Bond thwarts the attack and joins Sévérine on her yacht, where they have sex.  They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau where they are taken prisoner by the crew and delivered to Sévérine's employer, [[Raoul Silva]].  Silva, once an MI6 agent, has now turned to [[cyberterrorism]] and orchestrated the attack on MI6.  Silva kills Sévérine, but Bond captures Silva for [[Rendition (law)|rendition]] to Britain.  At MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop.  Q inadvertently gives the laptop access to the MI6 servers, which allows Silva to escape.  Bond deduces that Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M, whom he resents for [[Burn notice (document)|disavowing]] him.  Bond gives chase through the [[London Underground]] but loses Silva after a train crash.  Silva attacks M during a [[public inquiry]] into her handling of the stolen hard drive but Bond arrives in time to repel the attack.  M is saved from a bullet by Mallory and ends up in a car with Bond.  Bond and M travel to Skyfall, the Bond family estate in the [[Scottish Highlands]].  Bond instructs Q and [[Bill Tanner]] to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow.  Bond and M meet up with Skyfall's [[gamekeeper]] Kincade, and together the trio set up a series of [[booby trap]]s throughout the house.  When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade manage to kill most of them. M is wounded, but conceals it from Bond and Kincade. Silva himself arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade off through a [[priest hole]] to a chapel on the grounds. As the house is destroyed Bond escapes down the same tunnel and heads toward the chapel.  Silva survives the destruction of the house and follows Kincade and M to the chapel.  He forces his gun into M's hand and presses his [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] to hers, begging her to kill them both.  Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back, but M succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.  Following M's funeral, Moneypenny formally introduces herself to Bond and tells him she is retiring from field work to become secretary for the newly appointed M.  Bond is summoned to M's office and finds that Mallory is his new boss.

The Sleeper (film)
  In 1979, a giggling man with milky white eyes (credited as "The Sleeper") breaks into a bedroom in the Alpha Gamma Theta sorority house in the middle of the night, killing a resident with a hammer. Two years later, the sorority is organizing a party to welcome new pledges, an event that prompts the return of the Sleeper, who has been living on the campus in secret, spying on the Alpha Gamma Thetas, and threatening them over the phone.  On the day of the party, the Sleeper sneaks into the sorority, kills Cindy by bashing her face in with a hammer, and hides her body. By the next day, the girls find Cindy missing and so does Bobby. Later that night the Sleeper strikes again, ripping Rebecca's face off using the claw of his hammer in a gym's locker room. He then moves on to killing Stacy, her suitor Derek, and an employee at a pool hall. As these homicides occur, Cindy's boyfriend Bobby goes to the police to report Cindy's disappearance, and he and Detective Drake learn that Rebecca and Stacy have gone missing after the detective calls the sorority. Drake sends Bobby home, and goes to the sorority while the Sleeper kills Matt, a boy who had walked Alpha Gamma Theta pledge Amy to her dormitory.  Amy discovers she has been left a message by the Sleeper just before Drake calls to ask her if she has seen any of the missing co-eds. Drake advises Amy to come to the Alpha Gamma Theta house (where they are setting up a [[Telephone tapping|phone tap]]) when she tells him about the message she had received. The Sleeper's calls are traced to an old storm cellar in Jacob's Hall, so Drake heads there. Two officers are left to watch the house, but the Sleeper manages to get inside, and kills everyone in the building (including Bobby when he drops by) besides Amy. The Sleeper wounds Drake when he returns, chases Amy through the campus, and to his lair, where Amy stabs him.  Amy is found by a patrolling officer, and taken to a hospital, where she is informed by a doctor that Drake is in the [[Intensive-care unit|ICU]], and the Sleeper was caught. As she tries to rest, Amy is bothered but then answers a nearby ringing phone and screams when she realizes that the killer is on the line..

Supposedly, if a person on a [[Chatroulette]]-style website types the phrase "I did it for the [[LOL|lulz]]" three times, their chat partner will be murdered by a killer called Smiley, so named because he mutilated his own face by stitching his own eyes shut and [[Glasgow smile|carved his mouth into a smile]], before they themselves are killed.  A college student named Ashley (Gerard) becomes roommates with Proxy (Papalia). Ashley decides to go to a party where she meets Zane (Allen), Mark (Turner) and Binder (Dawson), who is mocked by his classmates for having reported a case of pedophilia, earning him the nickname [[Pedobear]].  One night Ashley and Proxy test out the Smiley myth with a random person online. After typing "I did it for the lulz" three times, to their horror, the stranger is murdered. Proxy convinces Ashley to stay silent. However, Ashley begins experiencing guilt over the stranger's death. She also begins to believe that Smiley is stalking her and intends to kill her; her friends and a psychiatrist write this off as anxious hallucinations and nightmares. Ashley eventually goes to the police; there she tries to convince them, to no avail, to investigate the murders caused by Smiley. The police basically dismiss her, implying that she is going crazy and quite possibly on the receiving end of a large, elaborate prank.  When Proxy loses contact with Zane, she video chats Ashley, in hysterics. Ashley goes to his house to check on him, only to find him shot dead with a handgun he purchased for self-defense. Instead of calling the police, Ashley picks up the gun and orders Proxy to type "I did it for the lulz" three times, hoping to ambush and kill Smiley. However, she accidentally shoots Binder, who had been coming over to check on her. Moments later, Smiley appears and slits Binder's throat. Ashley is then attacked by multiple Smileys, finally throwing herself out a window to her presumed death to escape them.  It is then revealed that all Ashley's classmates, including Proxy, Binder, and the babysitter murdered in the opening, are all part of a fringe group of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. They created the Smiley myth as a large-scale prank, although they are satisfied with Ashley's death. Binder states that Smiley will likely live on long after them and inspire copycat killings.  Later, Proxy is video-chatting with Zane, questioning their morality. Zane dismisses her worries and types "I did it for the lulz" three times as a joke. However, a real Smiley appears behind Proxy, kills her, and then waves at Zane via webcam. In a [[post-credits scene]], Ashley is revealed to have survived her fall.

Snow White and the Huntsman
 While admiring a rose blooming in the winter, Queen Eleanor of the kingdom of Tabor pricks her finger on one of its thorns. Three drops of blood fall onto the snow-covered ground, and she wishes for a daughter as white as the snow, with lips as red as the blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and a heart as strong and defiant as the rose. Queen Eleanor gives birth to her daughter, [[Snow White]], but falls ill and dies several years later. After her death, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], and his army battle an invading dark army of demonic glass soldiers. Upon rescuing their prisoner Ravenna, the King becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.  [[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]] is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Army's master. On their wedding night, Ravenna confesses there was a king much like Magnus that hurt her. She declares she cannot be a weak queen and kills Magnus before unleashing her invading army upon the kingdom. Snow White's childhood friend William and his father, Duke Hammond, escape the castle but are unable to rescue her, and she is captured by Ravenna's brother Finn and locked away in the north tower of the castle for many years.  Tabor is ruined under Queen Ravenna's rule as she periodically drains the youth from the kingdom's young women in order to maintain a spell, cast over her as a child by her mother, which allows her to keep her youthful beauty. When Snow White comes of age, Ravenna learns from her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] that her stepdaughter Snow White is destined to destroy her unless the Queen consumes the young girl's heart, which will make her truly immortal. Queen Ravenna orders Finn to bring her Snow White's heart, but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Ravenna makes a bargain with [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]], a widower and drunkard, to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White, but when Finn reveals that Queen Ravenna does not actually have the power to revive the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White escape. Meanwhile, Finn gathers another band of men to find her, and the Duke and his son William learn that she is alive. William leaves the castle on his own to find her, joining Finn's band as a [[Archery|bowman]].  The Huntsman and Snow White leave the Dark Forest, where she saves his life by charming a huge troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to make themselves useless to the Queen. While there, the Huntsman learns Snow White's true identity, and initially leaves her in the care of the women. He soon returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and eventually meet a band of [[Seven Dwarfs|eight dwarves]]. The blind dwarf Muir perceives that Snow White is the daughter of the former king, and the only person who can defeat Ravenna and end her reign.  As they travel through a [[fairy]] sanctuary, Snow White encounters a White [[Hart (deer)|Hart]], but as Snow White approaches the deer, the group is attacked by Finn and his men. A battle ensues during which one of the dwarfs, Gus, and Finn and his men are killed, while William reveals himself. William joins the group which continues the journey to Hammond's castle.  Halfway to Duke Hammond's castle, Queen Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple, but is forced to flee when the Huntsman and William discover her. William kisses Snow White, whose body is taken to Hammond's castle. As she lies in repose, the Huntsman professes his regret for not saving Snow White, who reminds him of his late wife, Sara; and he kisses her. The spell broken, Snow White awakens and walks into the courtyard; rallying the Duke's army to mount a siege against Queen Ravenna.  The dwarves infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the Duke's army inside. Snow White confronts Queen Ravenna, but is overpowered. Queen Ravenna is about to kill Snow White and consume her heart. Eventually, Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and mortally wounds Queen Ravenna, and Duke Hammond's army is victorious. With Queen Ravenna defeated, the kingdom once again enjoys peace and harmony as Snow White is crowned queen.  
Smashed (film)
 Kate Hannah ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]), an elementary school teacher, arrives at work hungover and vomits in front of her class. Asked by a student if she is pregnant, she pretends she is, then continues the lie to the school principal, Mrs. Barnes ([[Megan Mullally]]). Her co-worker Dave ([[Nick Offerman]]) reveals that he knows she has been drinking and she makes him swear not to tell anyone.  Attending a party with her husband Charlie ([[Aaron Paul]]) and his brother Owen ([[Kyle Gallner]]), Kate drinks heavily. While leaving, she meets a woman who asks Kate for a ride. Kate is offered [[Crack cocaine|crack]] and the two get high together. The next morning, Kate wakes alone on the street. She finds her car and drives home, where Charlie acknowledges they both are [[alcoholics]]. They get intoxicated and have sex before Charlie passes out. Kate heads out alone to buy wine but is turned down by the cashier. She urinates on the floor because the bathroom door is locked, then steals a bottle of wine.  Waking up, Kate realizes she has passed out again. At work, Dave, a recovering alcoholic, invites her to an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) meeting. There, she befriends Jenny ([[Octavia Spencer]]), who has chosen a passion for food and cooking over alcohol. Kate decides to become sober and change her life. Dave drives Kate home, but bluntly makes an offensive comment which upsets her. When Kate and Charlie visit her estranged alcoholic mother, Rochelle ([[Mary Kay Place]]), Kate mentions the AA meetings but Rochelle is skeptical; Kate's father left them after getting sober and now lives in another state with his "shiny new family".  Kate is surprised the next day when she is thrown a baby shower by her colleagues. She reconciles with Dave, putting his comments behind them. At home, Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie's sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.  Kate tells Charlie she feels she must confess to Mrs. Barnes the truth about her faked pregnancy. Charlie discourages her, warning that she will lose her job, and they begin to fight over financial issues. Kate lashes back that she would never depend on Charlie's parents' money and that she has struggled her whole life. Kate decides to tell Mrs. Barnes the truth and is fired. In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie.  After some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating one year of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, to give him a chance to redeem himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.  
The Snow Queen (2012 film)
 The Snow Queen covered the world in ice. Only Master Vegard stands in her way, whose mirrors reflect not only appearances but also souls. One day the polar wind takes away Vegard and his wife Una, but they hide their children Gerda and Kai. Years later, the Snow Queen's servile troll Orm (who can shapeshift into a black weasel) locates Kai, who is deemed Vegard's successor, at an orphanage. After a tangle between both siblings and Orm, Kai is abducted by the polar wind to the Snow Queen's palace. Gerda embarks on a journey with Orm and her pet white weasel Luta across the icy lands to rescue her brother.  They first enter a garden dome run by an old lady who seems nice, but her true intentions are to drug and enslave Gerda to grow and sell flowers. Orm and Luta catch wind of the scheme and thwart it, but the lady sends out her carnivorous plant, Ivy, but the trio make their escape. Meanwhile, in the ice palace, Kai arrives and the Snow Queen leads him to her throne room. The Queen's mirror, after examining Kai, reveals that Master Vegard has two heirs. Kai tries to hide the truth, but the Snow Queen reads it in his heart and sees Kai's painting of Gerda.  Gerda thanks Orm for saving her life and they begin to warm up to each other. Then the three stumble into Imana's caves, the birthplace of trolls. Orm briefs about how the trolls' age of peace was tainted by the Snow Queen and turned their clans to fight each other, until only the cowardly Orm survived, and the souls of the trolls remained trapped in the lake Gow. While Gerda and Luta look around, Orm is contacted by the Snow Queen with orders to bring Gerda to her. Orm helps Gerda and Luta cross the evil lake Gow and Gerda avoids its curse, much to Orm's amazement.  Outside the cave, the trio encounter a king on a royal hunt. The king tries to hunt Orm (in weasel form) and Luta, but he bumps into a tree. The trio are escorted to the king's castle. The king has had a trouble in which his children have literally half-shares in his property after the Snow Queen split the castle in half and Queen Anself was lost. The king takes Gerda as his prisoner, until she shows compassion for her brother. The king and his children have an argument and start a fire but Gerda saves them. As a reward the trio are given a sleigh for their journey.  The trio are captured by pirates and taken to their ship, but Gerda is able to persuade them to let them continue their quest, and the captain's daughter gives them a reindeer for the journey. Meanwhile, in the Snow Queen's ice palace, Kai is frozen by the Snow Queen. Gerda meets the Lady of Lapland in a tent, who recounts the Snow Queen's origin. As a girl, Irma, who had a gift of magic, was ostracised and went to Imana's caves where her ill wish upon the people, granted by the lake Gow, turned her into the Snow Queen. The Lady of Lapland grants the trio a snow boat and sends them to the Snow Queen.  Orm tries to protect Gerda and make her change her mind, but Gerda is determined. Inside the ice palace, Gerda finds her brother frozen then the Snow Queen appears. Orm turns down his reward to be free and beseeches the queen to spare Gerda. Since the queen will not listen to reason, Orm ceases to serve her. The Queen summons ice trolls and giants, but Orm transforms into a polar bear to defeat the monsters and allow Gerda to reach the throne room. But both Orm and Luta are cornered by the polar wind.  Gerda finds the queen's mirror and walks through it, entering the mirror realm. The Snow Queen tries to freeze her heart but, guided by the spirits of her family, she regains hope and retaliates with the magic mirror. The Snow Queen's curse is finally broken, Irma is transformed back and Gerda banishes the evil curse from returning. Irma revives Kai, Orm turns back into a troll and Luta wakes him up and the eternal winter is finally ended. With that Gerda, Kai, Orm, Irma and Luta all set off home. And Gerda and Orm finally accept each other as best friends.  
Snow Shark
 On February 6, 1999, a team of three [[biologist]]s, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, investigate a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small [[New York (state)|New York]] town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings may have something to do with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered a hole in the ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a "snow shark", before it bites him.  Twelve years later, the snow shark has become a town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is informed when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once more. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while [[Urination|urinating]]. The next day, with the rest of the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and prepares to set out to kill it.  A [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]] named Lincoln Anderson, a biologist named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit the town and have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron make their way into the woods, armed with a [[Crossbow|miniature crossbow]], a shotgun, and a [[Motion detector|motion-sensing camera]]. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.  When Lincoln finds that the camera has not detected any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman [[Involuntary euthanasia|shoots him in the head]] to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a [[hand grenade]] but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.

Soldiers of Fortune (2012 film)
 As the film opens, Captains Craig McCenzie ([[Christian Slater]]) and Mike Reed ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor) |Freddy Rodriguez]]) are [[United States]] [[special forces]] soldiers on a mission to find [[Osama Bin Laden]] in an unspecified location in the [[Middle East]]. Their mission quickly goes awry when [[CIA]] operative Carter Mason ([[Colm Meaney]]) turns up independently, but with Reed already having infiltrated the settlement he is unable to extract himself and his cover is quickly blown. Captured by the locals, he is interrogated briefly by Mason, who threatens to [[emasculate]] him if he does not disclose the full details of his operation, but he is swiftly freed by McCenzie, much to the displeasure of the agent.  Four years later, both McCenzie and Reed have been dishonourably discharged from the army due to the influence of Mason, and are running a struggling private security firm back in the USA. When McCenzie attends a biker gang-run poker tournament to barter for a loan to keep the pair financially stable, he witnesses several other players draw guns on the dealer, before it is revealed that the entire game was simply set up as a test for him, to see whether he has retained his combat skill. When he is offered a well-paid job aiding freedom fighters on a tiny, dictator-controlled European island he initially turns the offer down, but when it is explained to him that Mason is on the island as head of the dictator's brutal military, he changes his mind and he and Reed leave for Europe.  On arriving at a base camp close to the island, the full extent of his job is finally explained to him. The freedom fighters are poorly-funded, and thus are sourcing money via a [[war tourism]] adventure called ''Soldiers of Fortune'' that invites wealthy foreigners to pay to join their ranks for the thrills and experience of a fully [[tax deductible]] adventure. To prevent them from risk of death, however, McCenzie and Reed have been drafted in to act as their tour guides and body guards, offering them a realistic experience of army life while ensuring they stay out of harm's way. Their five charges (Roman St John, Sam Haussmann, Grimaud Tourneur, Tommy Sin and Charles Herbert Vanderbeer) are for the most part all self-made millionaires who each believe themselves in one way or another to be up to the task of professional soldiery. As the two Captains give them a whistle-stop training, the recruits - with the notable exception of St John ([[Sean Bean]]) - all reveal themselves to be hopeless, though they do all gain a basic understanding of weaponry.  In no time at all the five and their escorts are dispatched to their first mission, but they immediately come under attack, resulting in the death of Reed along with the rest of McCenzie's unit. As the Captain and the five manage to reach relative safety, McCenzie turns on his charges, accusing Tourneur ([[Ving Rhames]]) of arranging the ambush. Tourneur, a [[black market]] weapons dealer, counters by revealing his reason for taking up the holiday - he sold the dictator his arms but realised too late that his buyer had no intention of paying, leading him to crave revenge. Short of options, the group heads for the rebel base, where the tourists discuss their reasons for coming, Sin ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) revealing that his psychiatrist has suggested that his addiction to the violent video games he develops has left him disconnected with real life and in need of understanding the realities of warfare.  Further treachery leads to a morning attack on the encampment, and while the five tourists make it to safety they are all finally exposed to the horrors of war. While McCenzie returns to the camp to save the life of Cecilia, the woman who originally recruited him, the tourists opt to snipe at the attacking troops, which draws attention to them and results in the apparent death of Vanderbeer ([[Charlie Bewley]]). As tourists and tour guide reunite and they flee the ambush, St John directs them to a helipad attached to a mine complex, and his obvious knowledge of the terrain forces him to reveal that he is in fact a mineral trader and a native of the island, and has only returned in order to arrange supply of the rare and valuable metal [[coltan]]. As McCenzie again separates from the group to converse privately with Cecilia, the remaining four again opt to launch an assault by themselves, this time resulting in their capture. In prison they are reunited with Vanderbeer, and though he initially plays innocent they rapidly realise that he is the traitor who informed Mason of the rebels' location; he reveals that he negotiated a deal with the dictator to sell the rebels out in exchange for money to replace his lost fortune, having lost all of his wealth in a stock market crash.  After McCenzie and Cecilia effect a rescue, the group arm themselves before splitting up. McCenzie engages Mason, Sin and Tourneur ambush Vanderbeer, St John flees the compound while Cecilia herself is cut off from the men and leaves on a jet-ski. Haussmann ([[James Cromwell]]) sacrifices his life to hold off the rest of the dictator's private army, thus fulfilling his own reason for coming to the island - to die heroically, thus preventing his wife from gaining half of his assets from a pending divorce settlement.  In a lightning-paced finale, Sin kills Vanderbeer, McCenzie avenges himself on Mason, Cecilia is chased down by the dictator's daughter but succeeds in eliminating her also while St John opts to eschew an escape to turn around and save Cecilia from the floating wreckage. Tourneur wraps up the final loose end by killing the dictator with a well-aimed bazooka shot. As the island's inhabitants party into the night, the five survivors toast Haussmann's sacrifice.

Sorority Party Massacre
  Every year, Stella Fawnskin selects seven members of Sigma Phi Pi, a sorority with chapters all over the United States, to compete for the Fawnskin Grant. On her way to Stella's ranch, which is in the isolated [[resort town]] of Grizzly Cove, grant contender Holly Fanning is killed at a deserted [[rest area]]. The next day, Detective William Watts is informed by Holly's father, Captain Dan Fanning, that he is being suspended from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] due to his repeated use of excessive force. When Dan, who is protective of his daughter, mentions that Holly has not yet checked in with him, Will offers to go to Grizzly Cove to keep an eye on her, in exchange for Dan helping him get back on the force.  Will is ferried to Grizzly Cove by Kreeger, and meets with Sheriff Barney P. Lumpkin, and Deputy Lang. The three go to Stella's ranch, and speak with her, the six other girls (Paige, Brooklyn, Veronica, Jessie Lynn, Kioko, and Sloan) competing for the grant, and Stella's "[[mongoloid]]" handyman, Aggo. They all claim to not know where Holly is, so Will does a bit of research, and discovers that sorority girls have been vanishing in and around Grizzly Cove since at least the 1980s, news which shocks Barney, and Lang. Will tries to call Dan, but the police station's line has been sabotaged, leaving the town's only functioning telephones in the possession of Stella, and Mayor Carson. Will, Barney, and Lang travel to Stella's ranch, arriving just as the body of Veronica, who had been murdered with bees, is uncovered. Upon discovering that Stella's phone is dead, Will takes charge, sending Barney to Mayor Carson's house, and Lang to Kreeger, instructing the deputy to have Kreeger ferry her to someone who can get her in touch with Dan.  Barney returns from Carson's house, claiming to have found the mayor's severed head there. He and Will then venture to the dock, where Lang is dead in the water, and the frightened Kreeger is fleeing the scene. The law enforcement duo go back to the ranch, and are unable to stop someone from hanging Stella. Everyone, minus the missing Kioko, gathers in the dining room, but they become separated due to panic caused by the power going out, and Kioko's corpse being found in the refrigerator. During the chaos, Sloan is set on fire, and burns to death.  Elsewhere on Stella's property, Brooklyn stabs Jessie Lynn in the head. Following a bloody trail leading from Jessie Lynn's remains to a hidden chamber, Will finds Brooklyn and Barney tied up. Barney tricks Will into incapacitating himself with a bear trap, and releases and threatens Brooklyn into going after Paige and Aggo. Barney takes Will to the dock, and informs him that he is the one who has been murdering sorority girls over the past several decades, inspired to do so after helping cover up Stella's murder of her rival, who, unbeknownst to Barney and Stella, was the aunt of Brooklyn. Back at the ranch, Paige and Aggo (who is really a con man named Brian) are chased by the axe-wielding Brooklyn, who hates "sorority bitches" and was the one who hanged Stella. Paige fights Brooklyn, and strangles her.  When Barney finishes gloating, Will grabs a speaker and presses it into Barney's chest, causing Barney's [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] to malfunction, and seemingly kill him. Will is joined by Paige and Brian, and together they ready Kreeger's boat to take them to aid. Will is content that everything is over, until he notices the bee stings on Paige's arm. Realizing that the detective is on to her, Paige knocks out Aggo, and throws Will overboard while claiming that she only intended to scare Veronica, not kill her. Will manages to knock Paige into the water, and drown her. Later, while using his precincts' washroom, Will is taunted and mocked by an obnoxious rival detective, who he gives a [[List of school pranks#Torture and indecent assaults|swirly]] just as Dan walks in.  In a post-credits scene, Barney is shown recovering, and it is announced that "Detective Watts Returns in ''Bachelorette Party Massacre''".

However, Geki convinces Qom to give him another chance and returns to Earth.  Upon his return, Geki meets with Itsuki and takes her into the Dolgran where she meets his partner Shelly of Planet Bird.  Refusing to tell her the truth about what happened with him and Toya during the mission one year before, Geki's search takes him to Oyama Energy Laboratory where a meteor is being researched. However, Geki finds himself being attacked by the scientists and security as Shelly fails to stop Makuu's Witch Kill from obtaining the meteor which is needed to resurrect Don Horror. Kill takes her leave as Geki and Shelly escape with their lives, with Itsuki finding Toya's pendant among the wreckage.

By that time, after she broke the code with Shelly pinpointing the location, Itsuki has Geki take her to the location. There, she sees an illusion of Toya as she and Geki follow it into a trap set up by Makuu's leader Brighton.

Luckily, the original Space Sheriff Gavan arrives to even the odds and get Geki to safety, revealed to have been the one who saved Geki from drifting space and during his fight with Zan Vardo.  Learning from Commander Qom that he has been relieved of duty, Geki finds himself being attacked by Gavan as he ends the youth's indecision as only he can stop the rebirth of Don Horror. The two then find themselves attacked by Lizard Doubler, with Geki saving Shelly before the Doubler sends the two into Makuu Space where he becomes three-times as powerful. After successfully escaping Makuu Space, the two Gavans don their combat suits and Gavan stays behind to destroy Lizard Doubler so Gavan Type-G can proceed to space, destroying an entire fleet of Makuu ships with the Electronic Starbeast Dol before reaching what remained of Makuu Castle. With Sharivan and Shaider holding off Witch Kill and Zan Vardo, Gavan Type-G finally reaches Itsuki and Brighton, revealed to be Toya.  Revealing that he pledged himself to Don Horror while trapped in another dimension, Toya intends to kill Geki for not saving him while offering Itsuki's body to Don Horror so he can possess her and engulf the entire universe in Makuu Space. With no option left, with Itsuki trying to fight out of the possession, Gavan Type-G mortally wounds Brighton with a Gavan Dynamic to end the ritual. With Makuu Castle beginning to self-destruct, Geki manages to save Toya from falling into the abyss as they and Itsuki escape on Dol. Back on Earth, an agonizing Toya finally reconciles with Geki and Itsuki before passing away to his friends' dismay. Shelly later informs that in recognition to his efforts, the Galactic Union Patrol officially establishes Geki as the new Gavan. Geki then departs from Earth with Shelly, leaving behind a letter to Itsuki, where he states that he will return to meet her again once he accomplishes his duty as a Space Sheriff.

Starship Troopers: Invasion
 On an asteroid, the [[Terran Federation (Starship Troopers)|Terran Federation]]'s Fort Casey is crawling with bugs. The starship ''Alesia'' begins to deploy its [[Mobile Infantry (Starship Troopers)#The Mobile Infantry of The Terran Federation (Novel)|Mobile Infantry]] troopers, by dropship, to seize and control the hangar and rescue any survivors. Lieutenant Daugherty's 'Alpha' team lands and immediately engages bugs, fighting through to rendezvous with the surviving Fort Casey troopers. After setting explosives charges, the troopers head to the starship ''John A. Warden'' for evacuation, only to see it leave dock without them—Minister Carl Jenkins has commandeered the ''Warden'' from Captain Carmen Ibanez, sending her to ''Alesia''. Before leaving, Jenkins orders that Major Henry "Hero" Varro, the commander of Fort Casey's K-12 troopers, be escorted to ''Alesia'' as a prisoner. ''Alesia'' docks with Fort Casey for emergency evacuation of the surviving troopers, and the Fort Casey asteroid is successfully destroyed.  While en route to Earth, ''Alesia'' is contacted by [[Juan Rico|General Johnny Rico]] from High Command at L-6 Base. When he orders ''Alesia'' to search for the ''Warden'', which has broken all contact, the Fort Casey troopers agree to do so on condition that Varro leads them during the mission. When they find the ''Warden,'' Daugherty's team escorts Ibanez to the bridge while Varro's team secures the Engine Room, both teams finding nothing but dead crewmen and a few dead bugs. Varro finds a deranged Jenkins and is warned—too late—not to power up the ''Warden'' as 'she' has hacked all the systems. As the engines recharge the ''Warden'', an Arachnid Queen inside takes control of all systems and opens bulkhead doors to release her bugs. As Ibanez and the troopers attempt to return to ''Alesia'', the Queen uses the ''Warden''s main weapons to destroy the other ship, then flies ''Warden'' into a wormhole whose outlet is in near-Earth space. The troopers return to the ''Warden''s bridge, where Varro reveals he was arrested when Jenkins had ordered his unit to capture the Queen alive on Fort Casey, but Varro had refused to sacrifice his squad.  General Rico deploys three starships from the L-6 Base in Earth orbit, but they are unable to stop the ''Warden''. The Queen sets the bug-infested ''Warden'' on a trajectory to crash land in [[Paris]], but Alpha Team sniper Trig manages to shoot out the wires linking the Queen to the ship, allowing Ibanez to re-direct the ''Warden'' to crash land in the [[Alps]]. Meanwhile, General Rico leads a squad of troopers in Marauder suits to stop the bugs from escaping the crash site, while high command gives him 30 minutes before they will drop nukes from the L-6 Station to sanitize the site.  Back on the ''Warden'', the five surviving troopers make their way towards the Queen. Ice Blonde protects Ibanez at a nearby airlock while Mech and Ratzass go to the engine room to blow it up. When Varro and Bugspray find Trig's corpse, Bugspray uses Trig's family-made sniper rifle to buy Varro some time to reach the Queen. Jenkins, having recovered from his mental breakdown, provides Varro back-up with bugs under his mind control—revealing an important Terran breakthrough in the war and the reason for capturing a live Queen.  Rico is the only one from his squad to reach the ''Warden''. The extraction shuttle from L-6, and the nuclear strike, are all destroyed by the Queen's control of the ''Warden's'' weapons. As Jenkins leads the team to his shuttle from Fort Casey, Rico rushes to distract the queen and rescue Varro. Varro, critically injured, blows a grenade when surrounded by bugs. Rico abandons his broken Marauder suit and uses a [[combat knife]] on one of the Queen's eyes, buying Ibanez time to make take-off preparations. Rico barely sprints back into the dropship as it escapes the ''Warden'' before the explosives detonate and destroy the ''Warden''.  Mech, Ice and Ratzass pay their respect to their fallen comrades while Ibanez confronts Jenkins over the recent crises. Jenkins sidesteps the issue, telling Rico and Ibanez that his research will someday save the entire galaxy. In the aftermath, one warrior bug is seen navigating a sewer system, having survived the ''Warden''s destruction.  
Stash House
  The film begins with a man going into a church. He enters the confessional booth where he tells the priest he would like to make a donation to the church, but before the father can accept, the man shoots himself in the head.  The film then turns to Amy Nash ([[Briana Evigan|Evigan]]) and her husband, David ([[Sean Faris|Faris]]). It is Amy's birthday, and David buys her a house. Amy, who seems to hate the house, quickly turns to an upset David and tells him she loves it. A happy David shows his wife the security cameras, that watch over 360 degrees of their premises. Amy's friend, Trish (Alyshia Ochse) stops by and congratulates them for being homeowners. She then gives Amy a gift, and quickly leaves for a date with her boyfriend. After Trish leaves, an officer stops by, and identifies himself as Ray (Huertas) and welcomes the couple to the neighborhood before leaving. Amy and David are about to celebrate, when they hear a noise coming from a stove that is somehow in their room. They dismiss the noise as being rats, and continue their celebration.  Amy goes to the restroom to freshen up after hurting herself on the wall. David checks the wall, and finds it to be loose. David takes off the walls and finds heroin stashed in the walls. Amy enters the room, and David quickly lets her know about the situation, and they decide to leave. As they are about to take off, they run into Ray, and tell him about the house. Ray laughs, and reveals to them, that he bet $20 with his buddy that they wouldn't find the stash, before pointing a gun at them. David quickly hits his car, which makes their bikes fall on Ray. The couple quickly takes refugee on the house, as Ray begins to terrorize them. He enters through the back door, and shoots David. As he is about to shoot Amy, she falls on a switch that puts the house on lockdown. Amy then quickly goes to David's aid. Meanwhile outside, Ray's buddy, Andy Spector (Lundgren) gets to the house, and argues with Ray, for now they must keep the couple alive. As the couple watches the men, David decides to put the stash in trash bags, and give it to them. Amy agrees, and they give it to the men, who throw it on the trash, stating they "do not want that poison". David then comforts a hysterical Amy. David then shows her that the whole house is designed for drug dealers. The house has bulletproof windows, and is made of metal under the walls. The criminals begin to circle the house, and set up a booby trap. Amy decides to make a run for it, while David distracts the criminals in the front, but David makes a run for it, not wanting Amy to get hurt. Amy looks through the cameras, but before David can make it to the fence, he trips over a rope Spector put. Ray hears David fall in the pool and goes after him. Amy quickly gets in Ray's way, and begins to shoot at her. Ray then immediately puts his attention on David, who has now exited the pool. Amy goes back in the house, and finds Spector inside, who attacks her. Amy grabs a spray for animals, and sprays it on Spector's face, before hitting him with it, and quickly puts the house on lockdown. Spector threatens to kills David if Amy doesn't open the door. Ray shoots David in the hand, and finds David to be in the outhouse. He shoots through the door, thinking its David, but finds out he only shot a raccoon. David, who was in the other side of the house, runs off. Amy, who thinks David was shot, begins to mourn her husband, as she thinks it's her fault David was killed. David attracts Ray into a line of gas, before setting fire to Ray's leg. David then goes to Amy, who lets him in, and covers him in hugs and kisses.  Later that night, the couple begins to hear something in the roof, and find Ray has climbed to the roof, and is trying to break into the chimney. David tries to close the chimney, but before he can, Ray drops a grenade that gets stuck on the door. The couple runs for cover, but the grenade still affects the couple's ears. Amy, who has become affected by the loud blow, sits and mumbles random things, while David finds and shoots a flare gun at Ray, who gets burned on his neck, and falls from the roof. An angry Ray then begins to shoot at them, and threatens to kill them, before leaving. The couple then sits down, and Amy confesses to David that they never should have left Ohio. David begins to look around the house to find possibilities of what the criminals might want. Amy finds a switch, and it opens to a hidden room. They begin to hear noise, and go to the stove in their room, where they find a hidden basement, and find a man, who is unconscious.  Meanwhile, Spector and Ray find a tunnel that heads into the house. Spector decides to distract the couple, while Ray goes through the tunnel. Spector begins to try to trick the couple into letting him in. He reveals to Amy that David knew the last owner was known as a drug lord who committed suicide in a church (revealed to be the man from the beginning of the movie). The couple then hears Ray climbing through the floor, and they hold him down. Amy also gets Trish’s birthday present, and stabs Ray’s hand with it. An angry Ray begins to shoot through the floor, which causes the couple to hide in the hidden room. Ray lets Spector in, and they begin to saw through the floor, looking for the man. Dave looks through a peephole, and finds the shotgun all alone, and decides to go for it. As he approaches the shotgun slowly, the man wakes up, and begins to freak out, but Amy calms him down before Spector and Ray hear them. David reaches the shotgun; at the same time that Ray and Spector find the man is gone. A police officer then knocks on the door, and asks Ray, who says he lives in the house, if he knows anything about the flare gun. As Ray is about to answer, David points the shotgun at Spector, and makes the officer think David is an intruder, as the two argue, Ray kills the officer, and then attacks David. Ray is about to kill David, but instead, Spector kills Ray.  A few seconds after, Trish enters the house, telling David she and her boyfriend broke up. She quickly realizes what’s going on, but is killed before she can react. Spector then forces David to open the hidden room, but finds it empty. Amy then shoots Spector with the shotgun, and they close the door, leaving Spector inside. While Amy calls the police, David finds the front door with a bomb, which he doesn’t know how to disarm, and then finds the switch, that can unlock the house, has been broken. They remember the tunnel, and try to open it, for Spector jammed the lock. Meanwhile, Spector, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, blows up the wall, and goes after the trio. The old man tries to run, but is shot in the process. The couple is unable to open the tunnel, and as Spector is about to kill them, they hear the police, and Spector makes a new plan. He tells David that he will pretend to be Amy’s father, while David hides, for he is the criminal. He tells David that if David is caught before Spector can flee the country, he will kill Amy. David hides, and Spector pretends to be Amy’s father. The police buy it, but suspect something, when Amy seems to be hiding something. The two then see paramedics taking the old man, who is still alive, causing Spector to get distracted a few times.  Meanwhile, a police officer unjams the lock, and David knocks him out, and escapes through the tunnel, while a few officers pursue him, but he is able to lock them in, and goes after his wife. The chief of police asks to interview Amy alone, and right when she leaves Spector’s side, she tells the chief to shoot Spector, but instead, he tries to calm her down, causing Spector to kill him. David then gets to the scene, and threatens to shoot Spector, causing the other police officers to come, and they shoot David, before he can shoot Spector. Spector then drags Amy to the side, and knocks her out, before turning his attention to the old man. Amy wakes up, and goes after Spector, and wounds him, before Spector can kill the old man. He hits Amy, and is about to kill her but the police get there, and kill Spector. Amy then goes to David’s aid, and tells him that Spector’s last words were that next time, she should pick the house. The film ends with them going in the ambulance.

Stand Up Guys
 Released from prison after serving 28 years, Val reunites with his old friend and partner Doc. Doc has been ordered by mob boss Claphands to kill Val as soon as he gets out. One of the first things Val wants is to visit a local brothel, which is run by Wendy. After Val is unable to perform, he and Doc break into a drugstore where Val consumes a larger dose of Viagra than what is prescribed. After a return to the brothel, Val tells Doc that he's ready to party. They go to a club, where Val shares an intimate dance with a younger woman.  After snorting some pills, Val passes out, so Doc contemplates killing him then and there. Instead, he takes Val to a hospital where the head nurse is Nina, their old friend Hirsch's daughter. Thereafter, they go to a local diner where Val correctly guesses that Doc is to kill him. Doc says he's been given until 10 a.m. to do the job, or else he will be killed as well. Val breaks into a black Dodge Challenger SRT8, and they go to get Hirsch, who had once been their getaway driver. Hirsch gets behind the wheel and almost immediately into a highway chase with the police. Asked what he wants to do next, the widowed Hirsch chooses the brothel, since he hasn't slept with anyone since his wife.  After they leave, the three men hear sounds coming from the Challenger's trunk. In it, they find a naked Sylvia, who was kidnapped by men who abused her, then threw her into the trunk. Sylvia tells them where the kidnappers are. Val and Doc go there, then shoot a couple of them. After tying everyone up, Sylvia comes in with a baseball bat, whereupon Doc and Val leave her to her revenge. Back at the car, Doc and Val find that Hirsch has died. They break the news to Nina, who helps the two bury her father at the cemetery. Doc and Val return to a diner, where the young waitress (who waits on them several times) is revealed to be Doc's granddaughter Alex, who adores Doc, but has no clue who he is. Doc makes a phone call to Claphands, begging him to show Val mercy, since he has only a few years left. Claphands reveals that he knows about Alex, and that he will hurt her if Doc doesn't complete the job.  Doc writes a letter to Alex, puts his home keys inside the envelope, then pins it to the wall of the diner. Walking down the street at sunrise, Val spots a church and he goes inside to give a priest his confession. Next, they break into a tailor shop, where they try on suits. Two thugs working for Claphands interrupt them, pestering Doc to get the job done. Doc and Val shoot and wound them both. Alex goes to Doc's apartment. The phone rings. It's Doc and he asks what she thinks of his paintings of sunrises. When he was painting, Doc says, he was thinking of her. A shoe box in the closet is filled with cash. The rent has been paid in advance for a year. He tells Alex goodbye and Alex calls him her grandfather. He tells Alex that he loves her and hangs up.  Strolling down to Claphands' warehouse, Doc and Val draw their pistols and open fire. A firefight commences, during which Doc and Val shoot at Claphands and his men, killing both of the latter. A firefight between them and Claphands ensues. The camera pans above the building, and the sky turns into one of Doc's sunrise paintings.

Stolen (2012 film)
 In New Orleans, Will Montgomery ([[Nicolas Cage]]) and Vincent Kinsey ([[Josh Lucas]]) are preparing for a heist, aided by Riley ([[Malin Åkerman]]), their getaway driver, and Hoyt ([[M.C. Gainey]]), a computer security expert. They are watched by FBI agent Tim Harland ([[Danny Huston]]), who knows that Will and Vincent have been casing a jewelry store for several weeks and plans to arrest them mid-crime.  Will and Vincent break into the neighboring toy store, blowing the adjacent wall. Harland gives them a few minutes before sending his agents into the jewelry store, but Will and Vincent are not there, having instead used the jewelry store to gain access to a bank. In the vault, Will collects $10 million in wrapped bills and drags away Vincent, who had been eyeing a stack of gold bars. They come across a janitor in a back alley. Vincent attempts to kill the man, but Will stops him, and Vincent accidentally shoots himself in the leg. As their escape van pulls up, Vincent gets in and tells the others to drive off, leaving Will stranded with the money and the FBI closing fast. After a car chase, Will is cornered in an abandoned building. Agents arrest him but find no evidence of the money.  Eight years later, Will is released from prison. He is taken back to New Orleans by Harland, believing that Will stashed the money before his arrest. He warns that he will be watching Will closely. Will returns to his daughter Alison ([[Sami Gayle]]), finding that she is struggling with [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]]. She refuses to let him talk to her, instead handing over a package addressed to him that was left there that morning. She goes off in a taxi, which is shown to have been trailing Will since his release.  Will goes to a nearby bar where Riley is working. As they talk, the package starts to ring. Will finds a cell phone inside, and the caller reveals himself as Vincent, the driver of the taxi, who has now kidnapped Alison, and he demands the $10 million from the heist within 12 hours. Vincent says he will be tracking Will via the phone and will make regular calls that Will must answer or Alison will die. Vincent drugs Alison and locks her in the taxi's trunk.  Will, aware that Harland's men are also following him, uses the [[Fat Tuesday]] celebration to escape. He purchases a second cell phone to redirect calls from the first, then plants the first phone on a leaving train to throw Vincent's tracking off. Will explains the situation to Harland, vowing that he burnt the $10 million just before he was arrested, and asks for help. Harland rejects this, showing that Vincent was reported dead a year prior, a burnt body identified by DNA.  Will is forced to steal FBI credentials to find the current address of Hoyt, who is revealed to be working with Vincent and helping to track the phone. They have a brief standoff before the FBI agents arrive and kill Hoyt before he can fire on them. Will escapes, then talks to the taxi dispatcher, where they help identify Vincent's taxi and current location. In a celebration parade, Will finds that the taxi belongs to another driver, and that Vincent has masked the taxi number and stashed his cab's GPS system in the car.  Will is captured again by Harland's men, but when they do not let him answer Vincent's call, Will escapes after crashing the vehicle. On the call, Will tries to explain the money is gone, but Vincent doesn't believe it and reminds him of the deadline.  Will gets an idea. With Riley's help, they tunnel up below the bank where the gold was stashed and use a [[thermal lance]] to melt enough of the gold before their actions are detected. Riley drives off to distract Harland. Will takes the gold to Vincent at an abandoned amusement park, but Vincent lights the taxi on fire with Alison still inside. Will and Vincent fight, and Will takes a gunshot. He still manages to douse Vincent in gasoline and set him ablaze, giving him time to drive the taxi into a nearby pond.  As he races to free Alison from the submerging vehicle, Will is attacked by Vincent, but impales and kills him. Will rescues Alison and collapses  just as Harland arrives in a helicopter. Harland assures Alison that Will will be okay, convinced now of Vincent's guilt, and Will is taken to get medical attention.  Sometime later, Will, Riley, and Alison are enjoying an afternoon barbecue, still being watched by Harland from a distance because the bank gold is still missing. Will finds a chunk of the melted gold in Riley's truck—the missing amount—and he and Riley debate whether to keep it or throw it away, the latter clearing Will of any wrongdoing. After a thought, Will throws the gold into a bayou, leaving Harland without any evidence, so he ends his monitoring. Unknown to Harland, Will threw away a decoy, and leaves the nugget on the table as the three go to enjoy lunch.  
Step Up Revolution
 The film starts on Ocean Drive in [[Miami, Florida]]. A [[flash mob]], later identified as "The Mob", shuts down Ocean Drive briefly by cutting off the streets with retro convertibles and dancing on cars to music blasted by DJ Penelope ([[Cleopatra Coleman]]).   A few hours later, Sean Asa ([[Ryan Guzman]]), Eddy ([[Misha Gabriel]]), and Jason Hardlerson ([[Stephen "tWitch" Boss]]), the leaders of The Mob, watch their latest flashmob air on the television news in a restaurant kitchen of the Dimont Hotel where they work as waiters. A few complain about their public disturbance, while others praise it. After they get off work, they sneak into the hotel's beach club, claiming to be guests, not employees.  Meanwhile, across the club at the bar, Emily Anderson ([[Kathryn McCormick]]) tries to get the bartender's attention, but ends up preparing her own beer. Sean, who is immediately smitten by her, asks for a beer. She tells him it's on the house, then heads down to the beach to dance, resulting in a dance battle between the two, but ending with Emily suddenly running off when she sees one of her dad's business partners, Trip.  The next day, Emily and her father William "Bill" Anderson ([[Peter Gallagher]]) argue over breakfast at the Dimont Hotel. Sean, their waiter, immediately recognizes her, but Emily spills her orange juice. Sean helps clean it up then leaves to fetch her another juice. While he's gone, Emily continues to argue with her father before storming off. Sean later finds her in the hotel's ballroom, where Emily begins a fast contemporary dance, oblivious to Sean's presence. After Emily notices Sean and warms up to him, she explains to him that she's trying to nail an audition for the prestigious Winwood Dance Academy Company. Sean advises her to incorporate faster, more interesting moves, but Emily declines, saying that there are rules. Sean, in turn, tells her to break the rules, giving her an address and telling her to come there. Emily does and finds herself at the Miami Museum of Fine Arts, where the paintings and statues come to life, which is the work of The Mob. By telling her to attend, Sean basically reveals to her his participation in The Mob.  The next day, Emily persuades Sean to let her take part in their next flashmob, which is scheduled to hit a restaurant the following week. Eddy immediately dislikes Emily, giving her the lead to test her. Sean then introduces her to "the gang" where she meets Eddy (The Hacker), Penelope (The DJ), Jason Hardlerson (The FX), and Mercury (The Artist), who never talks. He also explains that they are trying to win a contest through YouTube by getting 10 million hits on the site. The flashmob goes well and Eddy admits that Emily did great. They then celebrate at Ricky's, where Sean and Emily salsa together, much to everyone's delight. Sean and Emily then sneak onto a boat and sail down the river. There, they bond over their mothers both not being a part of their lives, and they kiss and sleep on the boat until morning. When they hurry back to Ricky's, which turns out to be owned by Sean's uncle Ricky, Ricky reveals to them that Emily's dad, a building tycoon, is planning to develop the strip, destroying Ricky's bar, Sean's home, Sean's sister's home and workplace, and many other things. Enraged, Emily storms off to talk to her dad, with Sean following behind her. Emily wants to tell The Mob who her dad is, but is reluctantly convinced by Sean not to. She instead finds out from her dad that there will be a meeting to determine whether the project to develop the strip goes through or not. She convinces the rest of The Mob to protest the plans. Their dance is a huge hit, gaining the group over a million more views.  Eddy finds out that Emily is William's daughter through watching a tape of Sean and Emily rehearsing where she reveals the truth, without knowing that they are being recorded. Enraged, he reveals Emily's complicity with The Mob to William through a protest dance flashmob. This ruins the relationships for Emily with Sean (romantically), Eddy (friendly), William (trustfully), and the rest of the Mob. Emily leaves embarrassed, and Sean, brokenhearted, is arrested for trying to stop Eddy from being arrested after they fight. Emily had rehearsed her Winwood audition piece as a duet with Sean, but now that she and Sean are estranged, she no longer has him as a dance partner. Instead, she adapts the piece, dancing it as a solo performance. The result falls flat and she fails her audition for the troop. Sean finally meets Emily, still hurting from the humiliation, and tells him she is going back to work for her dad, per a promise she made with her dad that if she did not become a professional dancer by the end of the summer that she would work with him back in Cleveland.  After Sean and Eddy were sent to jail for being caught in the flashmob, Ricky bails them out, with Sean quitting The Mob plus ending his friendship with Eddy, after what he did to split him and Emily apart. Eventually, with Eddy feeling guilty for making the rash decision for revenge, makes up with Sean for the errors they both caused. Then The Mob plan one last protest to speak for the people who don't have a voice. They then flashmob the development public announcement, with the help members of [[Step Up 3D|The House of Pirates]], including Moose ([[Adam Sevani]]), Vladd and Jenny Kido. Sean and Emily then perform the original audition piece. Seeing his daughter so happy, William decides to build up the community rather than tear it down, and he and Emily reconcile. Sean and Emily kiss passionately and make up, and Sean and Eddy make a deal with the owner of the marketing firm that represents [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for the Mob to dance in their commercials.

Stitches explains that "they" made him do it when he signed up. Stitches arrives late at Tommy's tenth birthday party. He attempts to entertain the children, but they instead ridicule him. Tommy's best friend Vinnie ties Stitches' shoelaces together, and Tommy throws a soccer ball on his face, causing him to trip and land on a kitchen knife on the other side of the room, unseen to the children, which penetrates his face. As the children come to find out, Stitches slowly gets up, revealing the knife lodged in his eye. Stitches stares at the kids and makes raspy breathing. Seeing him, all of the kids scream in terror and run away. However, Tommy stays; when Stitches removes the knife, blood gushes out of his head. When stitches was in pain, he made weird gremlin like noises. After it stops bleeding, he attempts to stab Tommy, only to slip on a puddle of blood. Stitches falls on the floor as the knife falls into his eye a second time, killing him. Tommy visits Stitches' grave to put a squeaky flower on top, only to find a group of clowns entering an abandoned building. Tommy enters the building to find the clowns performing a ritual with Stitches' egg. One member discovers Tommy and brings him to the cult's leader, The Motley. The Motley warns to Tommy that a clown who dies and never finishes the party will never rest in peace, and a joke is not as funny the second time.  Six years later, Tommy is preparing for his sixteenth birthday. He is still haunted by the memory of his past birthday, and begins to have frightening hallucinations, such as a teacher turning into a clown and ripping off Vinnie's [[Testicle|testicles]] before tying them to a party balloon. Hesitating at the idea of throwing a large party, he considers instead inviting only a few friends. Ultimately, he settles on a large gathering, and Vinnie secretly distributes many more invitations over the Internet. Tommy, Vinnie, Richie and Bulger, all of whom had been present when Stitches died, prepare the house. As the guests, including Tommy's childhood crush Kate, arrive for the party, Stitches comes back to life and leaves his grave.  Tommy, startled by Paul dressed as a clown as a joke, injures his head. Bulger takes Tommy to find a first-aid kit, and Tommy retreats to his treehouse with Kate. There, Tommy discusses his memories of the ritual he had encountered as a child. Meanwhile, Paul is attacked by Stitches, who rips off his ear and one of his arms and pulls a live rabbit out of his throat before kicking his head off. The clown then finds Bulger, opens up his skull with a can opener, and removes his brain with an ice cream scooper.  After serving up three perfectly round scoops of brain in a glass bowl, Stitches adds blood as a topping to complete his grisly ice cream sundae. Sarah, Paul's girlfriend, enters the attic to look for him. There, she is attacked by Stitches, and manages to fight back. As she escapes, Stitches drives an umbrella through her skull, killing her. Through his telescope, Tommy sees Stitches in the house, and goes to warn Vinnie of his presence, but is at first unsuccessful, due to Vinnie's desire to have sex with a formerly overweight classmate. Tom asks Kate to leave, but her boyfriend Dan stops her.  Outside, Stitches attacks Richie. Richie attempts to flee but trips and falls.

Strange Frame
 Set at the end of the 28th century, the human race has long since abandoned a desolate earth, colonizing Jupiter's moons, particularly [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Most of the refugees fleeing earth did so in exchange for an agreement of [[indentured servant|indentured servitude]], projected to last "at most" one or two generations. However, this proved untrue, and by the 28th century a large portion of the population are in permanent [[debt bondage]] from birth. Naia ([[Tara Strong]]) is one such debt slave, genetically modified to have enhanced lung capacity in order to survive harsher work environments.  During a protest riot, Naia is freed with many other debt slaves from a holding cell on Ganymede. As she flees she encounters Parker ([[Claudia Black]]), a street saxophone performer being set upon by city police who incorrectly believe she is part of the riots. Naia saves Parker from a beating, with Parker later returning the favor. The two ultimately escape and quickly find themselves becoming attracted to each other, and soon after are in a romantic relationship and are living together.  Both musicians, Naia and Parker begin composing music together, Parker's saxophone complimenting Naia's guitar and singing. The two join with friends Chat ([[Alan Tudyk]]) and Atem ([[Khary Payton]]) and form a band, quickly rising in popularity and notoriety owing to Naia's passionate, anti-debt slavery lyrics. This soon attracts the attention of Ganymede "starmaker" Dorlan Mig ([[Tim Curry]]), who invites Parker and Naia to a party at a high-class club where he can discuss signing the band to his company. At the party both Naia and Parker indulge in several exotic treats, culminating in a rare vintage alcohol which renders both of them unconscious.  Parker awakes in an alley in Ganymede's slums and soon discovers that Naia and the rest of the band have been signed without her. She tries to make contact with Naia several times, only to be dissuaded (often violently) by the rising star's bouncers, who inform her that Naia doesn't want to see her anymore. Heartbroken, Parker spends weeks lurking near Naia's studio. She soon finds herself needing to leave the area after district police label her a troublemaker. She finds a sympathetic ear in Captain Philo D Grenman ([[Ron Glass]]), a hoverchair-bound double amputee who buys her breakfast one morning. After hearing her story, Philo offers Parker a home on his non-operational spaceship; Parker accepts, and soon settles in with Philo and his first officer Reesa ([[Cree Summer]]), the only other person on the ship.  Weeks pass, Parker tracking Naia's progress via news feeds. After seeing reports of a number of troubling incidents - Atem dying in a mysterious shuttle crash, Chat leaving the band due to a previously unknown drug addiction, and another talent signed to Dorlan's company dying just as her popularity peaked - Parker realizes that Dorlan is going to have Naia killed in order to maximize the popularity of her music. She strikes a deal with Philo and Reesa: if she buys them the last part needed to make the ship operational, using money from selling her antique saxophone, Philo and Reesa will help her recover Naia before she can be killed. Parker makes her way to a massive Naia concert, but after listening to her unemotional performance she realizes that the Naia on stage is actually an android duplicate, meaning the real Naia is being held somewhere else. She, Philo, and Reesa update their plans.  Parker infiltrates the fake Naia's luxury apartment, with friends of hers providing a distraction. She confronts the fake Naia, incapacitates her, then grabs her. When security forces arrive Parker flees down the side of the building on Philo's loaned hoverchair, accidentally dropping the Naia android in the process. Though damaged, Parker recovers it and is soon picked up by Philo, who has stolen Dorlan's car. Philo flees from the police while Parker searches the android's databanks for Naia's location, eventually finding it. Successfully evading the police, Philo and Parker find the lab where Naia has been held, being used as a template to better enhance the Naia android's behavior. Naia is near death but alive; Parker rescues her, leaving the android in her place and setting the lab on fire.  Naia is placed in a medical treatment device on Philo's ship, Parker unsure if she will survive. The destroyed lab is investigated; finding remains which seem to match Naia, the authorities declare Naia dead. Dorlan is soon arrested for his presumed involvement in the lab and Naia's death, especially since his car was found just outside. After some time, Naia finally awakes on the ship, greeting Parker lovingly.  
StreetDance 2
 To beat the world's best dance crew at a dance-off in Paris, France, streetdancer Ash ([[Falk Hentschel]]) and new friend and manager, Eddie ([[George Sampson]]), gather the greatest streetdancers from around Europe, whilst hoping to add a [[Latin dance|Latin]] element courtesy of salsa dancer Eva ([[Sofia Boutella]]).  After a rough start, the group all agree to incorporate this element and have fun adding Latin to street dance; whilst doing this, Ash and Eva grow closer.

Ash and his crew leave for the dance-off and are frustrated to find the gates locked.  Ash gets them in wearing popcorn sellers' clothes.  They battle Invincible until the last dance where they need Eva.  She appears and does the dance as planned.  Ash and his crew finish, and are estatic to find they have won.

Stone (2012 film)
 The film begins with the murder of an old man on a boatyard with a 200 mm nail. Then a 7 year old boy named Kolya is kidnapped who turns out to be the son of businessman Vlad Gireyev. The kidnapper later calls the father, and confronts him with a choice: either Gireyev kills himself or the kidnapper will kill the son.  24 hours are allotted, until 6 pm. The kidnapper drives Kolya to a rented house on the lake in the suburbs, and keeps him there in a closed room with no windows. He treats the child roughly, but does not mock, hit, or starve him, takes the child outside immediately when he asks, takes him along for trips, permits to play computer games, gives tips on how to survive alone, teaches how to makes fire and shoot (the gun is not loaded), and then gives him a cartridge as a souvenir. He demands Kolya to call him "Stone". Although Stone seems gloomy to others, everyone thinks that he is a polite rich man. With the neighbor, who in the past was the headmistress of an orphanage, he often plays chess. Once he starts a conversation with her about former pupils, to which the woman makes uncomplimentary comments about orphans in general.  Vlad decides not to shoot himself and hires a professional special effects expert for staging suicide. On the phone, Stone puts pressure on Vlad's wife, urging her to kill her husband in order to save their son. And she almost does it, but at the last moment throws away the gun. Vlad can not figure out what he did to deserve the kidnapper's wrath.   Through flashbacks it turns out that Stone and Vlad grew up together in the same orphanage where they were mistreated by the headmistress and the [[Physical education|physical education teacher]]. Once Vlad stole condensed milk from a warehouse, and Stone did not tell on him. Then Vlad persuades the boy to steal a folder with their personal affairs and to escape from the orphanage (Vlad hopes that his grandmother will take him, who for some reason did not issue guardianship over him). On the way, Vlad says to Stone that when he grows up, he will set his own rules, and no one will give orders to him. But after destroying the case folders, Vlad suddenly abandons Stone, claiming that his grandmother will not take the two of them. He only needed Stone to steal the folders – he was younger and could crawl under the window in to the archive. In parting, he hands him his nail, which was used as a weapon of self-defense. Realizing that in the orphanage he will be severely punished, and wish to be adopted was burned together with the case (before the escape he was eligible for adoption), Stone tries to cut his own throat using the nail. But he is caught and returned to the orphanage, where the headmistress and the physical education teacher torture the boy by dousing him in cold and hot water.  Vlad, using expensive tracking equipment, tries to track down Stone during telephone conversations, but Stone is skillfully encrypted. Finally, Vlad manages to get a personal meeting at a large parking lot where Stone furtively enters his car. When Vlad requires explanation, Stone puts a nail in front of him on the seat and leaves. Vlad understands. Stone visits his neighbor, who was headmistress of his orphanage (she does not recognize Stone) and kills her. It becomes clear that the dead man in the beginning of the movie was the former physical education teacher. At the appointed hour, Vlad goes to the square to stage a suicide, but under the pressure of conscience shoots himself. Even before the death of Vlad, Stone releases Kolya, drops him off on the road near the house. However, Stone does not feel the moral satisfaction from the death of Vlad – childhood's desire to avenge a betrayal eventually became the meaning of life to Stone, which is now simply gone. After some time, Stone, not feeling the desire to live, shoots himself too.  In the last scene on the river banks Kolya buries the cartridge, which Stone gave him. When his mother asks what he is doing, the boy replies: "Collecting stones", — in one scene, Stone, when explaining the reason for his vengeance against Vlad, he says: "It's time to collect stones."

When Chris recovers they learn that a deadly creature of some kind is on the loose, and they are not safe.  Together, they hide themselves in one of the storage rooms as the creature lurks outside. However, Chris runs; the creature catches him and rips out his heart. The group then decides to stay in the unit rented by the man, David, because it is lockable from the inside. David helps them to piece together what must have happened, by showing them the news channels on a collection of televisions he has acquired. Their only hope is to escape from the facility, and to do that they will need the engineer’s equipment in the basement.  Before they venture there, they decide to use the ventilation ducts in order to search other units for weapons.   Mark and Charlie search several units, but find only a knife, a crowbar, and some fireworks. As they return, the creature breaks through the duct inches from Charlie and Mark abandons him.

Heading for the basement, they are confronted by the creature, and David sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape. They split into pairs to search the basement.  Charlie and Nikki find the electronic keypad controlling the shutters near Bob's mutilated body. When they return, Mark is alone. He tells them Shelley has been taken by the creature and they must leave immediately.  Charlie insists on a rescue attempt and doubles back with Nikki.  In a corridor nearby, Shelley is held captive by the creature.  As it prepares to kill her, she stabs it with the knife and runs, but is cornered in a lift. Charlie and Nikki send a walking toy dog rigged with lit fireworks down the hallway. The fireworks explode, allowing Shelley to escape to Charlie.   Believing the creature dead, they run to Reception only to find Mark has barred its door with the crowbar. They plead with him; he stares distractedly, leaving them trapped.   Charlie kicks the door open, and tries to open the shutters with the keypad. Just then the creature breaks through the wall behind Mark, and kills him. With Nikki’s aid, Charlie kills the creature by thrusting the crowbar through its abdomen.  Charlie finally releases the security shutters, and the trio emerge into the street.  Shelley apologises and Charlie accepts the break-up. They go their separate ways.  London is ablaze, under [[Alien invasion|heavy attack]] from alien spaceships. The film ends abruptly.

He desires to go to [[Northwestern University]] in order to one day become the youngest editor for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', but so far is having limited success in making those dreams happen.  One day during a writer's club meeting, Malerie Baggs ([[Rebel Wilson]]) comes in to get advice about her short stories. Carson tells her not to give up, and says that she can't find the ideas, the ideas have to find her. He later goes to a student council meeting run by head cheerleader Claire Matthews ([[Sarah Hyland]]). Claire, as well as everyone in student council, resorts to ignoring him due to his constant objections to their ideas. While Carson's mother Sheryl is picking up several prescriptions, she makes idle small talk with the cheerful new pharmacist April Adams ([[Christina Hendricks]]), who is six months pregnant. Carson also visits his grandmother ([[Polly Bergen]]), the first person who encouraged his writing, but she doesn't know who he is due to [[Alzheimer's disease]]. She tells him her grandson used to be so happy and full of life, but was now his own personal rain cloud.  As Carson is finishing up the school paper late at night, he accidentally catches wealthy student Nicholas Forbes ([[Carter Jenkins]]) and flamboyant drama club president Scott Thomas ([[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]]) making out in a bathroom stall. Nicholas, horrified, begs Carson not to tell anyone since his rich family would disapprove of his [[homosexuality]]. Carson agrees on the condition that they will contribute to the paper until they both graduate.  April and Carson's father, Neal, visit Neal's lawyer to straighten out some legal issues. April, who had no knowledge about Carson or Sheryl, storms out when she learns Neal is still legally married, and has a child she never knew about.  Carson's guidance counselor ([[Angela Kinsey]]) informs him that one way to improve his chances of getting into Northwestern is to submit a literary magazine in order to show he can inspire others to write. He gets permission to start the magazine from his conservative principal ([[Brad William Henke]]). He announces at a school assembly that all entries will be taken, but later finds the submission box filled with nothing but trash. When Malerie suggests that others will eventually join because Carson convinced Scott and Nicholas to write for the school paper, Carson tells her the real reason behind their participation. She in turn reveals that she caught Claire having sex with Coach Walker ([[Charlie Finn]]), who is also the older brother of her boyfriend, Justin ([[Robbie Amell]]). Malerie goes on to say how everyone in their school probably has an embarrassing secret that they wouldn't want to get out.  Sheryl has another run-in with April when April recognizes Carson's name on the anti-depressant prescription. She then comes home to Neal and demands to meet his son. During the homecoming parade, Carson is forced to pull the writer's club float himself after the cheerleaders take the car they were assigned. Feeling more humiliated than ever, Carson decides to blackmail several of his peers into writing for the literary magazine. He tricks yearbook president Remy Baker ([[Allie Grant]]) into sending him a dirty picture that could ruin her reputation. Together, he and Malerie blackmail fellow school paper members Dwayne ([[Matt Prokop]]) for bringing [[marijuana]] to school, and goth girl Vicki ([[Ashley Rickards]]) for taking [[BDSM]]-style pictures that her church-going parents would disapprove of. Carson additionally discovers that supposed foreign exchange student Emilio ([[Roberto Aguire]]) is from [[San Diego]], knows only rudimentary [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and is using his faux-exotic charm to seduce women.  During a meeting with the other students and Coach Walker, Carson [[Extortion|extorts]] agreements that everyone must offer something to put in the magazine if they want their secrets to stay quiet. Carson also tells Claire and Coach Walker that they must have each cheerleader and football player submit something as well, as a way to make the issue more popular among the student body.  After school, Carson gets an unexpected call from his father. Neal tells him about April, the baby, and how he wants them to get together soon. When he has dinner with Neal and April, Carson realizes that his father is trying to make himself sound like he has been more present in Carson's life, which quickly results in an argument and Carson storming out. Later, during a student council meeting with the principal, Carson opposes a ban on clothing logos in school. As punishment, the principal revokes all off-campus privileges for students.  During another encounter at the pharmacy, Sheryl explains to April that she gave her husband everything, and was therefore left with nothing when he decided she wasn't enough for him and that just like April, she had a kid to keep him around, but that didn't change anything. Meanwhile, Carson completes the literary magazine, but it flops due to the backlash from the student body. Carson also learns that he was accepted into Northwestern, but since he never confirmed his admission, he must wait to reapply and go to community college in the meantime. Carson assumes his letter was lost in the mail, but after telling his mother, Sheryl admits she threw away his acceptance letter to protect him from her perceived "reality" that his dreams will probably never come true.  While Carson and Malerie pack up the unread literary magazines, Carson asks her why she likes to film everything. Malerie replies that "It doesn't matter if you're stuck in the past or if you're trying to forget the past, what matters is what you do in the present and I try to soak it up." As Malerie is leaving, she asks Carson if he thinks they're friends. He says they're best friends. Carson suddenly decides that there's one story left to write; his own. His voice-over explains how he finally realized that, despite everything he went through, he successfully got the other students to write for the literary magazine, so for the first time in his life, he was truly happy. He is then shown going outside as the thunder starts.  It takes over three days for people to find Carson's body. Many people, including the principal and the students who hated him, come to the funeral. It's shown that Carson did leave an impression on everyone he knew. Malerie takes over as president of the writers' club, while Sheryl visits her mother in assisted care.

Bill's son Rusty is a high school student in love with a classmate named Kate but lacks the courage to talk to her. Bill's daughter Sam is a cynical college student who prefers [[one-night stands]] and hook-ups with people she knows are less intelligent than herself, in order to shield herself from love.

At the same time Kate struggles with her drug addiction; while visiting Erica's house, she rifles through a medicine cabinet and is on the verge of stealing prescription drugs when Erica walks in on her.  Bill has regular sexual liaisons with his married neighbor, Tricia ([[Kristen Bell]]), with whom he occasionally jogs. However, he continues to mope over his failed marriage. While Christmas shopping he runs into Erica and they talk over coffee. He tells her that, if given a second chance, he would be a much better husband, leaving Erica visibly uneasy. Tricia urges him to move on and begin dating again, helping him dress better and creating an online dating profile. After going on a somewhat successful date, he stops by Erica's house and peeks in her window. Seeing her read a book, he leaves his wedding ring as a sign that he has moved on. However, he does a double take and realizes she is reading one of his own books. Heartened, he takes back his ring.  Sam has a party for the launch of her book, where Bill makes a speech about the process of writing, quoting ''[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]'', his favorite book. Erica is invited by Lou, but is clearly uncomfortable and avoids conversation. Bill encourages her to talk to Sam, who pretends not to know her when signing Erica's copy of her novel. When Sam gives Kate champagne—unaware of Kate's addiction and the fact that she's underage—Kate goes back for more and eventually goes home with Gus, one of Bill's students. The Borgens track her down; Bill and Erica barge into Gus's apartment and find her asleep in his bedroom after a night of drinking and doing drugs. As Kate is loaded into the car, Rusty lifts the blanket covering her and realizes she had sex with Gus, which leaves him in tears.  Heartbroken, Rusty turns to alcohol and comes home drunk almost every night. While at a convenience store with Jason he runs into Glen, who chases down and beats him. Kate writes Rusty a letter apologizing and telling him she's in rehab, having realized the only person who could truly fix her is herself. She hopes that one day she could be worthy of somebody like him. Bill, worried about Rusty, tells him to channel his pain into his writing. Rusty asks if he did the same when Erica left, prompting Bill to ground him. Rusty writes a story entitled "I've Just Seen A Face" (after [[I've Just Seen A Face|the Beatles song of the same name]], which he told Sam he hears when thinking of Kate) and finds it therapeutic. Later, he gets a call from [[Stephen King]], his favorite author, who tells him that Sam sent his story to King, who had it published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''.  Bill reveals to Sam that he walked out on Erica when Sam was a baby, and that when he came back six months later she accepted him, having waited the whole time. He promised that if she ever left him, he'd give her a second chance. When Lou's mother dies, Sam realizes how much her mother means to her and they tearfully reconcile. A year later, Bill shows he's moved on from Erica by not setting a place for her at the table for Thanksgiving. As the family sits down to eat, joined by Lou, Erica arrives and tearfully asks if there is a place for her. She joins them at the table and Rusty announces his story is being published. While the family celebrates, Bill again quotes from ''What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'': "I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark."

As Superman arrives in Bialya, the Pokolistani forces release a bioweapon on the Bialyan military which destroys most of their ground forces. As Superman gets the soldiers to safety from the bioweapon, [[The Elite (DC Comics)|the Elite]] arrive just in time to help Superman destroy it.  Superman returns to Metropolis to report the news and also gain more information on the Elite. Superman and Lois fly to England to find out if they, and the world, can trust the Elite. It is revealed through Manchester Black that he gained his powers near puberty and used it for the first time to save his sister [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Vera Black|Vera]] from being hit by a train. The Elite and Superman arrive on the scene to save the civilians on a subway train which was trapped underwater due to a terrorist attack. After Superman and Black save the passengers, Black interrogates the terrorists that bombed the train nearly killing them. Superman begins to be concerned about the motives of his new-found friends.  Back in Metropolis, Lois tells Clark that there is no birth record or death certificate of Manchester's sister Vera. This makes Clark further question the Elite's origin and what they are really trying to accomplish. When Manchester broadcasts a message for all the world to hear, he ends up telling them that they will take care of all the world's villains by killing them. After the broadcast, Superman travels to Bialya. While there, Superman is hit by an EMP which weakens him. Closing Pokolistani forces are about to attack him when the Elite attacks. Powerless to stop the Elite, Superman ends up passing out. He eventually awakens at the Elite's base of operations, a sentient macroorganism called Bonnie, and is teleported back to Earth after he fails to convince the Elite that they don't have to kill to be heroes.  Atomic Skull breaks out of prison and looks for revenge on Superman. The Elite arrives but have little success against the overpowered Atomic Skull. When Superman arrives, he coordinates an attack with the Elite to get all the extra power away from Atomic Skull. After Atomic Skull's power is drained by Coldcast, he is executed by Manchester Black under the vote of a boy whose father was one of Atomic Skull's victims. The Elite who tell him that they have killed both the Pokolistanian and Bialyan leaders and that peace can reign supreme in that area once again. Angered, Superman punches Manchester in the face and the Elite take it as a statement of war against the world's "favorite heroes." They tell Superman that they will kill him for this outrage.  The next day, Superman stands in the middle of Metropolis telling the Elite that he is ready to fight. Asking them to do it somewhere safe, they teleport to the Moon where they begin their fight, with the people of Metropolis watching via Bonnie. Both sides are evenly matched until Black telekinetically induces a seizure in Superman. Coldcast then unleashes a massive blast of electromagnetic energy on Superman, and to those watching the battle on Earth, it appears that Superman has been obliterated. However, moments later, the Elite start hearing Superman's voice all around them. In his taunts, Superman states that he has finally been convinced that he needs to start killing villains--beginning with the Elite. Superman then begins to take out the Elite one by one; first he injects Menagerie with a poison that causes her sym-beasts to abandon her and apparently kills her. The Hat attempts to exploit Superman's known weakness to magic but is suffocated by a super-speed generated whirlwind and sucked into the funnel.  Against Coldcast's wishes, Manchester teleports them to Metropolis to use the innocent civilians as cover. Black gives the order to combine powers to destroy Metropolis when Superman appears. After Superman knocks Coldcast into orbit, he confronts Black. Manchester attacks Superman with everything he has but fails to harm the Man of Steel. Through heat vision, Superman [[Lobotomy|lobotomizes]] Manchester, stripping him of his powers. Believing his death to be seconds away, Manchester tells Superman that the world knows he is no better than they are and will never again trust him. Superman reveals that he faked killing the other members of the Elite and had his Super-Robots protect all of the civilians present and to create the illusion that he had killed indiscriminately. They were really transported to the Fortress of Solitude to be stripped of their powers, then sent to a prison. In addition, Bonnie was offered a way to return home. In the end, the people of Earth see that violence and killing never really was the right way for justice and accept that Superman's way is best for all of mankind. After that, he flies off with Lois and they kiss.

They set up chimes all around the castle, but Rothbart eventually re-enlists the help of Bridget (his [[hag]] henchwoman from the first film who had turned good) and she helps remove the wind chimes for him.  As part of the Christmas festivities, Uberta and Rogers are staging musical performances, but because of Rothbart's spell they have become aggressive and competitive with each other. Odette, who is staging her own song, invites the children to perform "Christmas is the Reason" which momentarily weakens Rothbart's power over Uberta and Rogers. Odette follows up on this by inviting Uberta and Rogers to give gifts and food to the poor. This time the good will breaks the spell on the whole kingdom, and Rothbart is severely weakened.  Rothbart's last chance to ruin the kingdom's Christmas spirit is to sabotage the royal Christmas tree. He sends Number 9 to steal one of the Christmas lights, and Rothbart casts a dark spell on it that will destroy the tree. Derek learns of this plan thanks to Bridget, who has double-crossed Rothbart and traps him inside a giant chime.  Derek rushes back to the Christmas Eve party to stop the tree from being lit, but they are too late. The enchanted light bulb bursts the tree and its ornaments into flames. Rothbart becomes fully restored to his physical body, takes Uberta's crown which he turns into his own, and kidnaps Odette where he takes her back to Swan Lake.  At Swan Lake, Rothbart once again turns Odette into a white [[swan]] and traps her inside a cage made of roots, just as Speed, Puffin and Jean-Bob arrived. Puffin tries to attack Rothbart, but the evil sorcerer knocks the bird down and turns him into a [[Christmas ornament]]. He then casts a spell on the moonlight, so that when it touches Odette's wings, she will turn into a golden swan-shaped ornament forever. Derek arrives to rescue Odette and Rothbart has assumed the form of the Great Animal again to fight Derek. At first Derek is overpowered, but Odette starts singing "The Season of Love," which weakens Rothbart until he bursts into flames and dies. With Rothbart defeated for a second time, Odette changes back into a human and Puffin returns to his normal self. Derek dies in her arms due to his injuries, but a distraught Odette sings again, the great spirit of Christmas returns him to life and restores the royal Christmas Tree. At the Christmas party, the kingdom puts up a new Christmas ornament on the tree, honoring Derek and Odette.

The Tall Man (2012 film)
 Julia lives in a small town in Washington called Cold Rock. She is the town's local nurse, widowed by her husband, who was the town's doctor. Cold Rock was formerly a prosperous [[mining town]], but has become poverty-stricken. There is little work, the school has been closed and the town is virtually vanished from the map. During her day, Julia visits several families. Jenny and Carol live with their mother and her violent, alcoholic boyfriend, who has impregnated Carol. Despite this, their mother did not kick him out, drawing Julia's ire. Instead, she sends away Carol and her baby, whom Julia helped to deliver. Because of her rough life, Jenny is selectively mute, communicating through a journal she carries. She also sketches things she's seen, including "the tall man". This is a local legend or [[urban myth]] surrounding a being who abducts local children who are never seen again.  Julia returns to her large home on the outskirts of Cold Rock, which she shares with her son David and his nanny. She eats dinner, puts David to bed, and falls asleep on a couch. She awakes to a noise downstairs, followed by a loud radio sermon. She finds the nanny bound and gagged, then rushes to her son's bedroom, finding him gone. While in pursuit of what the viewer believes is "The Tall Man", it is gradually revealed that David is not her son at all, but rather one of the kidnapped children. The kidnapper is actually the real mother of the boy, attempting to take back her child. The rest of the town, skeptical of the mother's accusations, agree to give her a chance to prove her claims.  Julia, with the help of Jenny, pursues the mother, reacquires David, and hands him off to "The Tall Man" in the tunnels which run under the town, left over from the defunct mine. Jenny begs her to send the Tall Man to take her, too. Julia initially refuses but then relents, cautioning her to remain silent about it until the Tall Man comes for her. Julia then waits in her house. The police and FBI arrive, as does an angry mob. The nanny hangs herself, and Julia is taken to jail, where she is despised and threatened as a child killer. Julia admits to kidnapping and murdering the children, but the confession is later revealed to be a lie. Julia is part of an organization which "rescues" young children from bad homes and places them with good ones, in an attempt to break the cycle of poverty and abuse which passes from one generation to the next.  Soon after, Jenny watches her mother engage in a drunken fight with her boyfriend, before laughing with him over it. Disgusted, Jenny walks off into a nearby field, where she finds the Tall Man waiting for her—Julia's husband, who is not dead after all. He takes her to an empty house in a nearby city, providing her with new clothes. He then delivers her to a new family, with a new identity. The Tall Man refuses payment, saying that the organization faces massive risks to rescue each child, with Julia martyring herself to save the organization.  In Cold Rock, Jenny's birth mother grieves over her runaway daughter, the town continues to decline, and Julia sits in prison. The police have given up on finding the children, thinking that Julia buried them in the tunnels which run for miles and are dangerous to traverse because of cave ins, etc. In comparison, Jenny lives in a beautiful home, where her art is encouraged, and she has the best of everything. She has begun to talk and seems well-adjusted and happy. As she walks to an art class, she gives a voice-over expressing love and gratitude toward her three mothers: her birth mother, whom she misses; Julia, who gave her a chance at a new life; and her new mother, who is providing her with everything she could ever want. As she crosses a park, she sees David with his new family, which he now accepts as his own. (Jenny thinks he and the other younger ones have forgotten and do not recognize her, but the visual cues leave it decidedly open-ended). Despite getting her wish of a better life, she sometimes wishes to return. Jenny's closing thoughts question society's implication that her new life is better.  
Talaash: The Answer Lies Within
 Late at night on a deserted road, well-known actor Armaan Kapoor ([[Vivan Bhatena]]) loses control of his car for no evident reason, apparently trying to avoid something, and drives into the sea.  Senior Police Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat ([[Aamir Khan]]) with his assistant Devrath Kulkarni ([[Rajkummar Rao]]) begins an investigation into Armaan's death. Surjan's personal life is in turmoil since his 8-year-old son, Karan, drowned recently during a family outing. His wife, Roshni ([[Rani Mukerji]]), is still grieving and Surjan has developed a guilt complex.  Surjan learns that on the night of Armaan's accident, Armaan was travelling with 2 million in cash, which is missing from the car. Armaan had given the money to a blackmailer, a [[pimp]] named Shashi ([[Subrat Dutta]]). Three years back, Shashi had performed a cover-up for Armaan and his friend Sanjay Kejriwal ([[Suhaas Ahuja]]). Once he learns of Armaan's death, Shashi takes off with the cash, leaving behind a mistress, Mallika (Aditi Vasudev). Shashi's friend, Tehmur ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]), steals Shashi's discarded sim card. Shashi begins blackmailing Sanjay. In panic, Sanjay employs some thugs to murder Shashi. Tehmur begins to use Shashi's old sim card to blackmail Sanjay with Shashi's murder.  Meanwhile, Roshni seeks solace from a [[medium (spirituality)|medium]] neighbour, Frenny ([[Shernaz Patel]]) who is in touch with Karan's soul. One night, Surjan is propositioned by an [[Call girl|escort]], Rosie ([[Kareena Kapoor]]). He declines Rosie's advances but asks her if she can become an informer. Through Rosie, Surjan finds out about Shashi's connection with the case. The police find Shashi's body, along with the blackmail money and a DVD. The DVD contains embarrassing CCTV footage of Armaan and his friends leaving a hotel with a girl. Convinced of Armaan's link with prostitutes, Surjan focuses his search on the slums near the Hotel Lido. To speak unobserved, Rosie takes Surjan to a quiet place by the riverside and tells him that three years ago, she was picked up by Armaan and his friends, Sanjay and Nikhil (Prashant Prakash). However, she doesn't reveal anything more. Surjan tries to approach Nikhil for more information but discovers that Nikhil has been brain-dead after the incident three years ago. After a heated argument with Roshni, Surjan confides in Rosie, who comforts him by taking him to the Lido.  Tehmur is killed by the two thugs in Sanjay's employ. One of the thugs is captured by the police and reveals that Sanjay has been behind the murders of both Shashi and Tehmur. Surjan arrests Sanjay, who confesses that three years ago, Sanjay, Armaan and Nikhil had picked up an escort to celebrate Nikhil's birthday. While driving, Nikhil began making out with the girl in the backseat. The car door opened by accident, throwing both Nikhil and the girl from the moving car to the road. Both were badly injured. Armaan and Sanjay rushed Nikhil to the hospital but fearing scandal, left the girl unattended on the road. Sanjay had called Shashi to ask him to take care of her. However, Shashi informed them that the girl had died and that he had footage of the three leaving with her. Since then, Shashi had continued to extort money from them by blackmail.  Surjan re-watches the footage and realizes that the girl is Rosie. As he drives Sanjay to the police station, they approach the same road where Armaan had his car accident. Both Surjan and Sanjay see Rosie standing ahead. In a re-enactment of Armaan's accident, Sanjay swerves the car into the sea. With Sanjay already dead, Surjan struggles to get himself out of the car. Rosie appears underwater and saves him. At the police station, Surjan's superior advises him against reporting his incredible story. Surjan agrees to write in the official report that Armaan Kapoor's death was an accident. He returns to the riverside place where he used to meet Rosie and uncovers her remains where Shashi had hidden her body. Remembering that he had been told that "the dead come to those who are troubled," he gives her a proper funeral.  Now more accepting of the supernatural, Surjan finds a letter from Karan, penned by the medium. Through the letter, Karan tells Surjan not to blame himself for his death and that he wants both his parents to be happy. Surjan cries and Roshni consoles him. The two are reconciled.  In a post-credits scene, two workers are seen putting a caution signboard on the same accident spot.  
Tabu (2012 film)
 ;Prologue A narrator, Miguel Gomes himself, reads in [[voice-over]] a poetic and philosophical text that invokes a legend in which the Creator orders, but the heart commands: the suicide of an intrepid explorer who, somewhere in Africa, long ago, plunges into a turbid river after a frustrated love affair and is devoured by a crocodile. Many swear they have seen a beautiful woman and a sad crocodile on the riverbank and that the two share a mysterious empathy.     ;Part 1—Paradise Lost Three disparate women dwell in an old building in [[Lisbon]]. Aurora, an octogenarian living off her pension, eccentric, talkative and superstitious, seeming more dead than alive, and Santa, her housemaid from [[Cape Verde]], live at the same apartment. Santa is semi-literate, but proficient in the divinatory art of [[West African Vodun|voodoo]]. Pilar, their neighbor and friend, a Catholic middle-aged woman, and militant social benefactor, involves herself in their psychodramas.    Pilar has another friend, a romantic painter in love, a gentleman who insists on offering her tacky pieces of art. But Pilar is more concerned with Aurora: with Aurora's solitude, with her frequent escapes to the casino. She is even more worried about Santa, with her long silences and devil arts. Santa thinks it better to take care of oneself without annoying others, so keeps quiet.  Something else concerns the old lady: understanding she will die soon, she feels someone is missing her, someone her friends have never heard about: Gian-Luca Ventura. So she asks Pilar to find him. She succeeds in doing so and the man appears. He is an old colonist, a disturbed man, from [[Mozambique]], a former Portuguese colony. Another story emerges, beginning: "Aurora had a farm in Africa at the foothill of Mount Tabu..."  ;Part 2—Paradise [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]]: The story of Aurora’s life, told by Gian-Luca Ventura in [[voice over]].

Taken 2
 At the funeral of his son Marko and associates in [[Tropojë]], [[Albania]]n mafia head and low-lying freelance terrorist Murad Hoxha vows to seek vengeance on his son's killer. Travelling to [[Paris]] with his men, he interrogates and tortures former intelligence agent Jean-Claude Pitrel, whose business card was found at the scene of Marko's death, but finds no information. He then bribes a corrupt police official for Pitrel's files and deduces that Pitrel's old friend Bryan Mills was responsible and is in [[Istanbul]].  Meanwhile, Bryan has just finished his three-day security job for a wealthy Arabian sheikh in Istanbul and is surprised by his ex-wife Lenore and daughter Kim. While going out for lunch with Lenore the next day, Bryan spots Murad's men following them. He tells Lenore to run and tries to shake the Albanians, but finally surrenders when they capture Lenore. Realizing that Kim is also a target, Bryan calls her at the hotel and tells her to hide, but then he is captured and knocked out. She narrowly avoids capture when the kidnappers are forced to flee after shooting two security guards.  Regaining consciousness, Bryan finds himself [[cable tie|zip tied]] to a pipe over his head in an empty basement. He uses a concealed miniature cell phone hidden in his sock to contact Kim and instruct her to alert the American Embassy; instead she convinces him to let her help. Opening her father's equipment case, Kim takes a grenade and detonates it on a nearby rooftop; the resulting sound allows Bryan to instruct her on triangulating his location.  The mobsters bring in Lenore, cut her throat slightly, and hang her upside down to bleed out. As soon as they leave, Bryan frees himself and then her. He next has Kim detonate two more grenades and releases some steam through a chimney to guide her to his location. Kim tosses a gun down the chimney, which Bryan uses to kill his guards. He rescues Kim, but watches Lenore get recaptured. Stealing a taxi, Bryan and Kim pursue the kidnappers' van, whereupon an SUV, driven by one of the kidnappers' henchmen, arrives to distract them. A chase and shootout ensue, alerting Turkish police and ending when Bryan manages to lure the SUV into the path of an oncoming train, taking it out.  Leaving Kim at the U.S. Embassy, Bryan uses his memory to find Murad's hideout. He rescues Lenore and pursues the surviving mobsters to a bathhouse, where he kills them. Confronting Murad, Bryan offers to let him walk if he agrees to return home and cease his desire for revenge. Murad agrees and Bryan drops his gun, but the former goes back on his word and tries to kill Bryan, only to find the gun unloaded. Realizing that Murad will never drop his vendetta against him, Bryan kills him by impaling him onto a sharp towel hook.  Three weeks later, the Mills family is at a diner back in Los Angeles, having milkshakes to celebrate Kim passing her driving test. They are joined, much to Bryan's surprise, by Kim's boyfriend Jamie, to which she jokingly tells her father not to "shoot this one".

This causes a lot of chaos around the kingdom and explosions start to happen, but it was revealed to be a dream. With more time, they go after the rings only to be launched in 2 directions.   One of them lands in a pot of soup and Pascal goes after it. When coming out, he causes chaos around the tables and finally retrieves the ring, only to find his tongue stuck in ice. Meanwhile, Maximus runs after the other ring, but he runs into shoes, make-up, hats and dresses and he is now dressed as a lady (a male horse falls in love with him, but he kicks him and goes after the ring).

Meanwhile, the carriage Maximus is in finally stops and is launched into the air (passing Pascal, but he doesn't know that and looks at the camera). He lands on a decoration and a flock of doves passes Pascal, causing him to lose the ring. It hits a wind vane, a fountain, a decoration and a hook and finally lands on a dove's foot.  Maximus hits the ground, but the hook that the ring landed on causes barrels of juice to chase Maximum and Pascal. When coming to a dead end, Maximus uses one of the decorations as a slingshot and launches them into the air for Pascal to grab the ring. Unfortunately, he misses, but he uses his tongue to grab it. Now with both rings secured, they land in a tar factory. Just as the priest finishes, he asks for the ring, only to find Pascal and Maximus covered in tar and they hand them the rings.

Tell (2012 film)
 Taylor (Todd Bruno) argues with his girlfriend Jenny (Shana Eva), before taking a hammer from his car and murdering her. He then wraps her body in a sheet, takes her upstairs, and hides her in his attic. He then phones Ray (Tim Connolly) and informs him of the crime. Referencing an earlier conversation in which a drunken Ray had suggested murdering Jenny, Taylor tries to convince him to help cover up the crime. Ray declines, leaving Taylor to deal with the consequences alone.  He begins to clean the blood from the kitchen floor, and hears something moving in the attic. He goes to investigate, and hears Jenny screaming. Whilst investigating, he finds blood dripping from the loft hatch, and goes up to investigate, where he finds the body as he left it. As he climbs back down the ladder, he slips on the blood, and is knocked unconscious.  On regaining consciousness, Taylor finds blood on his forehead, and looks up into the still-open attic, where he sees a hallucination of Jenny looking down at him. He goes to the bathroom and cleans the blood from his hands, head, and clothes, and finishes cleaning the kitchen. Terra (Brigitte Kali Canales), Jenny's friend, arrives, and finds that Jenny is missing. Taylor tells her that she has walked out, and left her phone. Fearing that Terra knows of the murder, he arms himself with a kitchen knife, but she leaves before he attacks her.  Whilst disposing of the blood-stained towels used to clean the kitchen, Taylor takes a saw from his garage, and takes Jenny's body into the bathroom. Once he has put the body in the bath, Taylor closes Jenny's eyes, and prepares to cut her arm off. However, he is interrupted at the last moment by the shower curtain moving. He goes to investigate, and looks back to find Jenny's eyes now open again. The curtain moves again, and Taylor jumps back, hits the light switch, and falls to ground. The curtain is then pulled back and Taylor sees Jenny's bare foot touch the carpet. In terror, he flees from the bathroom and then the house. Whilst outside, a police car pulls up, causing Taylor to return to the house.  When Police Officer Diaz (Adriana Pascual) knocks on the door, Taylor feebly tries to stop her from entering the house. When she does, she begins to search the ground floor and, on finding nothing, goes to search upstairs. Taylor again attempts to convince her that there is no issue but is ordered to remain downstairs whilst Diaz searches the upper floor. Diaz does not enter the bathroom, and therefore does not discover Jenny's body, but Taylor stabs her in the neck as she turns to leave. The two struggle silently, with Taylor pushing Diaz's gun down into its holster to protect himself. He is interrupted by an apparition of Jenny standing at the door, giving Diaz time to draw her weapon and shoot him. The two separate, and fall against opposite sides of the room, where they sit against the walls, dying.

Teddy Bear (2012 film)
 Despite his physique, Dennis ([[Kim Kold]]), a thirty-eight-year-old Danish bodybuilder, has never had a girlfriend and lives with his elderly mother, Ingrid (Elsebeth Steentoft), in a small town outside [[Copenhagen]].  On arriving home from a date gone south, Dennis undergoes his mother's interrogation on his whereabouts.  He fabricates a story about going to the movies which hints at a possessiveness on her part that makes it difficult for him to form relationships.  Things appear even more bleak when his uncle, Bent (Allan Mogensen), marries a younger woman from [[Thailand]], making Dennis feel even more hopeless about his situation.  Believing that his nephew’s chances for a relationship will improve outside the country, Bent arranges for Dennis to fly to Thailand.  He leaves, telling a disgruntled Ingrid that he is going to [[Germany]] to compete in a [[Professional bodybuilding|bodybuilding competition]].  Though the culture shock is initially daunting, Dennis feels more comfortable after meeting Scott ([[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]]), a middle-aged American man who introduced Bent to his wife.  Scott plays matchmaker by offering to arrange a blind date for Dennis, a prospect that bolsters his confidence.  That night, however, Dennis feels uneasy when it becomes apparent that the bar in which the meeting is to take place is frequented by older gentleman seeking pleasure from the women in Scott’s employ (who turn out to be [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]).  Despite reservations, Dennis takes one of them back to his hotel room, but the cheapness and aseptic nature of the scenario make him hesitant and he rejects her advances.  The next morning, Dennis attends a local gym where Prap (Prap Poramabhuti) and Bobby ([[Bobby Murcer]]), two of the patrons, recognize him from his bodybuilding career.  While discussing his passion, Dennis’s shyness and social ineptitude vanish and Prap introduces him to Toi (Lamaiporn Sangmanee Hougaard), a local woman who owns the gym.  Though having more in common with this crowd, Dennis goes back for a second round at the bar, but leaves within minutes of meeting another prostitute.  Following up on an invitation from Prap, he joins him and his friends for dinner where a conversation with Toi sparks an attraction.  A day of fun and sight-seeing builds up to an evening visit to Toi’s apartment, where the two kiss passionately, but Dennis’s shyness resurfaces and he abruptly leaves.  Realizing, however, that Toi is the only woman with whom he has ever felt a connection, he returns and, in a poignant scene, the two embrace and fall asleep in each other's arms without having sexual relations.  With plans for the future, Dennis goes back to [[Denmark]].  Unable to lie anymore, he eventually divulges everything to Ingrid, who accuses him of being a [[Sex tourism|sex tourist]] and forbids him from seeing Toi again.  He agrees, but then secretly arranges for Toi to come to Denmark permanently.   He avoids introducing Toi to Ingrid and tells her that the time he spends with his mother is due to her convalescing from a heart condition and not because he lives with her.  Ultimately, the charade falls apart when Dennis and Toi happen to cross paths with Ingrid at a shopping mall.  Intent on quelling Ingrid’s anger, Dennis comes home and finds her sitting at the table with an injured hand.  He goes to his room, finds its contents destroyed, and cries silently.  In the aftermath, it is revealed that Ingrid’s insecurities stem from Dennis’s father having left her before he was born.  Her attempts to play the victim, however, fall short to Dennis’s passive resolution to become independent.  He packs his belongings and kisses her goodbye.  The last scene shows him getting into the car with Toi and exchanging loving looks while driving to their new home.

Sanjay Raina tries his best to save his daughter Piya ([[Avika Gor]]) and the passengers in the train who are thrown in the mix are police officer Shivan Menon ([[Mohanlal]]) and his team of cops, who are escorting a prisoner on the same ill-fated train. Aakash demands 10 million euros to tell them how to disarm the bomb. The ministry does not want to give the money, but Khanna convinces them that the money will be given back and is a way to lure the terrorists.  After following Aakash's instructions and dropping the money in a river, he walks away. Meghna gets the money and tries to get away. She evades the cops after a vicious chase but unfortunately she is killed by a van in an intersection. Khanna finds out that Khan is one of the bombers and chases him.

However, the restaurant catches on fire and the letter is burnt. Aakash visits Nikita and his son and they arrange to flight out of the UK that night. Khanna visits Nikita and tells who her husband is. After changing the plan (that they should leave UK via train because the police has found out about his plan of leaving via plane), he goes to the train station. There he sees a video of Raina asking the bomber to call again as the letter was burnt.  Aakash calls Raina and tells him that the bomb was not connected to the wheels and the train will not explode if stopped. Raina stops the train, and everyone disembarks safely. Nikita who is helping Khanna now, goes to the train station and sees Aakash and the news that the bomb threat was a hoax. She lets Aakash go, but Khanna finds out as Aakash's son calls him Daddy. Khanna chases him and they fight. Aakash pleas to Khanna to let him go and explains why he took such drastic actions. Realizing that Aakash was a victim of deportation and wants to just be with his family again at peace, Khanna stays silent (hinting he will let him leave scot free). However, the police arrive; after seeing that Aakash had a gun, they shoot him.  In the end, Nikita receives a letter Aakash had written. It stated that the money (which Aakash asked for defusing the bomb) was in Aakash's bank locker. He also states that she should give half the money to Megha's brother and Adil's mother.

Shiva and Sharath are very close friends. Meantime Shiva gets married to Meenakshi ([[Anushka Shetty]]), an eye doctor in Delhi.

In the meantime, Sharath handles a case where an Indian Army secret (a [[flowchart]]) about a [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] goes missing. Shiva shows interest in this case and he goes to London (with a different name, where a former Indian Policeman named Kenny helps him) to find an important clue, as Sharath is injured during a fight, but Shiva is shocked to find his plan go terribly wrong and is now chased by the [[City of London Police|London police]], following a few incidents. But now he finds a shocking truth about Sharath. It's shown that Sharath is the mastermind behind the missing flowchart, and he sells it to a terrorist group, with some help from the London militants. Shiva finds out about this entire plot and asks Sharath to surrender, but he later learns that Meenakshi also has come to London along with Sharath (to surprise Shiva on his birthday and propose to him). To save her, Shiva abides by Sharath's order and he comes to a place (with Kenny), where a sudden bomb blast occurs, killing Kenny and Meenakshi and blinding Shiva. Kenny's actual wife is Geetha, who decides to take revenge on those responsible for the deaths of Kenny and Meenakshi. She forms a team with Shiva, and joins him in a school where he learns echolocation from [[Daniel Kish]], an expert echolocator.

After electrocuting Sharath in Victor's (Sharath's friend) factory, the Union Minister requested Kenny to come back to India as Shivakumar, but he rejects the request as Kenny's former identity as Shivakumar had 'died' and he is going to spend his life for Meenakshi.

The children are shown as fully grown men in present-day Italy, visiting their father's childhood home and relating their own memories of some events Rabito wrote about. Despite remaining distanced from his wife, Rabito took great pride in his children, particularly because they were all fully educated and literate. Rabito did not learn to write until he was an adult; the spelling in his memoir is largely based on phonetic transliterations of Sicilian language.   Although Rabito is telling his own story, he is scarcely shown in the film. Instead, his narration generally underscores footage of war, images of Sicilian villages and countrysides, and images of his journals.

The Thieves
 A cat burglar named Yenicall ([[Jun Ji-hyun]]) seduces the owner of Leesung Gallery ([[Shin Ha-kyun]]), and steals a rare artifact with the help of three other criminals: Popeye ([[Lee Jung-jae]]), the leader, Zampano ([[Kim Soo-hyun]]), the assistant, and Chewing Gum ([[Kim Hae-sook]]), a middle-aged conwoman. They are visited by a detective (Ju Jin-mo) shortly after, and realize that staying in Korea is too dangerous. They decide to join a heist led by a master thief named Macau Park ([[Kim Yoon-seok]]), a Korean based in Macau who is also Popeye's former boss. Popeye brings along Pepsi ([[Kim Hye-soo]]), a convicted safe-cracker who was recently released on parole. In Hong Kong, Chen ([[Simon Yam]]), Jonny ([[Derek Tsang]]) and Andrew ([[Oh Dal-su]]) are contacted by Macau Park and agree to enroll as the Chinese part of the team, along with a safe-cracker named Julie ([[Angelica Lee]]).  Macau Park reveals the target to be the Tear of the Sun, a valuable diamond in the possession of Tiffany (Yeh Soo-jung), the mistress of a powerful crime lord named Wei Hong (Ki Gook-seo). The plan is to steal the diamond while Tiffany is visiting a casino in Macau, and to sell it back to Wei Hong, a risky venture seeing that Wei Hong is known for murdering whoever offends him. Each team agrees, however, when they learn that the diamond is worth USD 20 million.  It turns out that Julie is really an undercover police officer hoping to arrest Wei Hong. Moreover, both the Chinese and Korean teams are mistrustful of Macau Park. Chen, Johnny, and Andrew plan to ignore the diamond and run off with Tiffany's money, while Popeye and Pepsi have purchased a fake diamond to swap with the real one. A flash-back reveals that Macau Park, Popeye, and Pepsi were formerly a team, but Park's cable snapped during an escape as he was rappeling and he ran off with the gold. Pepsi, worried for his safety, inadvertently exposed herself to a security camera, leading to her conviction.  With the help of Tiffany's step-sister, Macau Park lays out the plan. Chen and Chewing Gum are to pose as a Japanese couple and keep Tiffany occupied at the gambling table. Yenical and Zampano are to infiltrate Tiffany's private suite through a window and open the door from the inside. Popeye, Pepsi, and Julie are to enter the suite and open the two safes, one of which allegedly contains the diamond. As this takes place, Johnny and Andrew must enter the security room and hold the guards at gun-point. All of this has to happen within 10 minutes, after which the police will arrive.  Chen and Chewing Gum find common ground in the Japanese language and end up growing closer. They fall in love over the course of the evening and spend the night together. Zampano, meanwhile, unsuccessfully prods Yenicall for a confession of love. She avoids answering by setting the plan in motion.  As the plan is being executed, the team, to their dismay, discovers that neither of the two safes contains the diamond. As the police rush in, Chen and Chewing Gum try to escape in a car, but Chen is shot dead and the car collides with a wall, killing Chewing Gum. Johnny manages to escape, and so does Yenicall after Zampano surrenders to the police to buy her time. In the commotion, Macau Park, disguised as an old janitor, steals the diamond from a safety deposit box. Popeye, Pepsi, and Andrew are arrested but fight inside the police van. Popeye, Andrew, and the police jump out before the van plunges into a sea.  Pepsi, however, = is still hand-cuffed and nearly drowns, except that Macau Park suddenly arrives and rescues her.  Pepsi regroups with Popeye, Yenicall, and Andrew, and they force Tiffany's step-sister (who is in fact an actress hired by Macau Park) to reveal Macau Park's place of exchange: the Busan Grand Hotel, located in Busan, South Korea. While the step-sister distracts Macau Park in a cafe, the four break into Macau Park's apartment to search for the diamond. Macau Park reveals that it was Popeye who cut the rapelling cable four years ago because he too was in love with Pepsi. When Macau Park tried to find his way back to them, he discovered the two locked in a passionate kiss. Not realizing that it was Pepsi's way of dealing with his "betrayal", he left. Hearing this via earpiece, Pepsi confronts Popeye and then walks off of the job. Yenicall finishes it by taking the real diamond and replacing it with afake.  Macau Park meets with Wei Hong, revealing that his main motive is revenge, as Wei Hong killed Macau Park's father. The meeting is raided by the South Korean police and SWAT and multiple gun-fights ensue. Popeye tricks Yenicall into giving him the diamond and then runs away with it, leaving Andrew and Yenicall behind. While running Popeye is hit by a car and the diamond breaks, revealing that this too is a fake, planted by Yenicall.  Pepsi is waiting at Busan Pier and spots Macau Park in the crowd, but Wei Hong arrives to kill him and Julie arrives to arrest Pepsi. After Wei Hong opens fire, Julie turns her attention on Wei Hong and shoots him to death, while Macau Park and Pepsi escape. Pepsi returns to Korea and learns that Yenicall has travelled to Hong Kong again, hoping to find another buyer for the diamond. Pepsi also finds a gift of gold bars left by Macau Park. The story concludes with Pepsi meeting Leesung Gallery's owner, whom Yenicall had seduced, and asking him to buy the diamond. Before the exchange can take place, Macau Park calls Pepsi and reveals that he has infiltrated Yenicall's hotel room and stolen the diamond, and he promises that Pepsi will reunite with him soon.

Then comes an investigation officer Alexander ([[Sreenivasan]]), and an assistant Ramachandran ([[Vinay Forrt]]). Alexander unlike the assistant, is an officer who doesn't believe in torturing the accused people to prove crimes.

The LEGO Story (film)
  The short film is first set in Denmark and explores the origin and history of Lego through the experiences of the Kirk Kristiansen family. This includes Ole Kirk Christiansen, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen and Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen. They all took significant roles in changing and shaping the Danish Lego company to be what it is today. The short film conveys the significance of family, inspiring and supporting one another during tribulations and adversity.  The company of Lego was founded by Ole Kirk Chrstiansen and his son Godtfred back in 1932.  The word “Lego” derive from two Danish words, “leg” and godt”, which translates to “player well” and in Latin translates to “I put together”. The product of Lego was very different from what it is today. In the short film, the company started out making wooden toys in 1932. It was during this time Godtfred saved time and money by putting less work into making the toys. Ole Kirk Chrstiansen was not impressed and was in fact disappointed. Ole Kirk Chrstiansen got his son Godtfred to work on the toys again. That day they learnt an important lesson that the high quality of the toys and honesty of the customers were important. This led to the central idea that “Only the best is good enough”.  It was in 1946 when the plastic block was introduced which was later iterated and improved during the mid-1950s to become the modern Lego brick. This was also around the company introduced the Lego system.<ref></ref> <ref name="portsmithco.com"/> <ref></ref> <ref></ref> <ref></ref>

The Third Half
   ''The Third Half'' depicts the history of 7,148 [[History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia| Macedonian Jews]] who were deported to the [[gas chambers of Treblinka]] by the Bulgarian administrative and military authorities, who were cooperating with the Nazi regime.<ref>In February 1943, Bulgaria and Germany signed an agreement stipulating the deportation of Bulgarian Jews to camps in Poland. Initially Bulgaria was to deliver 20,000 Jews to the Germans. The plan's first step called for the "purification" of the Bulgarian occupied territories of Thrace and Macedonia. In March 1943, Bulgarian police rounded up the Jews of Thrace and Macedonia at night and placed them in detention camps under extremely harsh conditions. Their property and their houses were confiscated prior to their deportation in the later part of the month. Sealed trains transported 11,384 Jews, mainly via the Danube River, to death camps, from which almost none returned.

New Haven and London, 2001, p. 102.</ref> In 1941, a young Eastern Orthodox man, Kosta, and a wealthy young Jewish woman, Rebecca, fall in love, despite her father's effort to keep them apart. With the war raging around their borders, the Macedonians remain cocooned in their world of patriotic pleasures, primarily concerned about getting the beleaguered Macedonia Football Club on a winning streak. Their manager hires the legendary German-Jewish coach Rudolph Spitz to turn them into champions. But when the Nazi occupation begins and they start deporting Jews, Kosta and his teammates realize that the carefree days of their youth are over.

Third Contact
 Psychotherapist, Dr David Wright is in a session with depressed physicist Karl, who tells him about a thought experiment called [[Quantum Suicide]]. Karl then goads Dr Wright about another patient, Rene (who has recently taken his own life), provoking him into an angry outburst.  Rene's sister, Erika, arrives in London to sort out her brother's affairs. She discovers something curious - his apartment is almost empty: a cup, a spoon, a fork, a knife, frames without pictures, torn photos... One more curiosity: Four dated descriptions of moments in Rene's life.  Another patient dies, leaving another list of memories. There's something strange going on. Something sinister behind these 'suicides'... David Wright, who starts the film having lost faith in psychotherapy (seeing the quest for happiness as futile in a world of misery) is energised by the mystery behind the deaths of his patients.  David quizzes Erika for clues about her brother. In the following argument, David flushes her brother's ashes down the toilet in a rage. While she weeps, he discovers a number burnt into the bottom of her brother's ashes urn. Erika tells David her deceased brother wishes them to call the number. David says it is not a telephone number, so if he calls it and someone answers, then everything he knows about the universe is wrong.  At home, David calls the number. A woman answers and asks who gave him the number. On instinct, David tells her his patient Karl gave him the number and she gives him an address to meet First Contact. After bluffing his way into a meeting with First and Second Contact he awakes naked in his house, stripped of his belongings in the same fashion as his dead patients. Hearing Erika's farewell from his answering machine, his desperate bid to save her leads to another dead end and another dead body.  Seeming to confirm David's belief that all struggle is futile, and coming through his subsequent mental breakdown, he meets Karl and accepts his conditions for a meeting with Third Contact. Waking in a dark underground laboratory, he discovers he has been part of an experiment called 'Quantum Suicide' where memories become 'destinations' and your obsession with the past can lead you to a chance of happiness in a parallel world.  David finally meets the man behind the mysterious suicides - Third Contact - and is horrified to discover it is himself, but 30 years older. The experience is too much for his mind and he passes out again. When he wakes, he finds the mysterious women who answered his call tending to him. She explains how they use a bullet, inserted into the brain, to send someone who has had enough of this life to their chosen "destination" - which will be one of four specific listed memories. David takes out his list and reads. The woman declares that he is ready to go and injects him with an anesthetic, sending him to sleep.  He wakes in total darkness. Finds a torch and navigates his way back past a cellar full of belongings. He finds the underground lab again, but now all the equipment has been removed. All that remains is the 30 year old David Wright, with a hole drilled in his head, David's list of memories still clutched in his dead hand.  Back in time, David is in the garden with Theresa, in the moment when they were last happy, before she disappeared. As they hold each other tight, full of love, peering from the shadows of the kitchen window can just be seen - the old Dr. David Wright.

The Three Stooges (2012 film)
 The film is composed of three acts, which are referred to as episodes (a reference to how the original ''Three Stooges'' short films were packaged for television by [[Columbia Pictures]]).  ===Act / Episode 1: More Orphan Than Not=== 35 years in the past, the children at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage are playing soccer with an old soda can in the front yard. But then, Sister Mary-Mengele ([[Larry David]]), the meanest and strictest nun in the [[orphanage]] gets their attention by telling them to go inside and do their work. The kids sing "Everybody is Special", but she tells them to shut up and go to work. Later, infant versions of Moe, Larry, and Curly are dumped on the doorstep of the orphanage from an unknown person’s car. Ever since, the trio have wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele, who has always hated the trio. Ten years later, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually being forced to add a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters ([[Stephen Collins]] and [[Carly Craig]]), decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead.  25 years later, in the present, the trio ([[Chris Diamantopoulos]], [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] and [[Will Sasso]]) are adults, still living at the orphanage and working as maintenance men. [[Monsignor]] Ratliffe ([[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) arrives to give everyone an important message. After Monsignor Ratliffe tells Mother Superior ([[Jane Lynch]]) that the orphanage is going to close, she tells Sister Mary-Mengele to get the trio. However, the trio accidentally injure Sister Mary-Mengele when she tells them that Mother Superior needs them. They head to Mother Superior until another on of their accidents causes Monsignor Ratliffe to fall on top of the nuns. Monsignor Ratliffe gets attacked by Moe, Larry, and Curly, who think that Monsignor Ratliffe was [[sexual assault|getting fresh]] with the nuns. Eventually, Monsignor Ratliffe informs everyone that the orphanage will be forced to close down unless they can come up with $830,000 in 30 days. The trio volunteers to go out and try to raise the money somehow. Some of the nuns think that they will not be able to succeed because the only people they know are nuns and kids, but Mother Superior thinks otherwise.  ===Act / Episode 2: The Bananas Split=== A [[subplot]] involves a woman named Lydia ([[Sofía Vergara]]), who wants to kill her husband so she can be with her lover, Mac ([[Craig Bierko]]), and inherit her husband's considerable fortune. She then finds the trio and offers to pay them the money they need to take care of the hit job. They botch the job by letting Curly push Mac (the supposed husband) in front of a bus and leave Mac in traction in the hospital. When they try to visit Mac in the hospital to finish the job, they are chased by the cops throughout the hospital and escape by jumping off the roof using a fire hose. They end up running into a now grown-up Teddy ([[Kirby Heyborne]]), who invites them to his anniversary party, but Moe refuses. It turns out that Teddy is actually Lydia's husband. Their next scheme for raising the money is selling [[Aquaculture of salmon|farm-raised salmon]], with them scattering salmon on a [[Golf course|golf range]] and watering them like [[Crop|produce]]. But the same cops from the hospital arrive at the golf course to arrest them and the trio are chased off the golf course and they hide in an old building (getting in by using Curly as a [[battering ram]] to bust down the door), where they have a slapstick fight. Larry then stops the fight, and he and Curly then scold Moe for rejecting Teddy’s invitation and Teddy's father's earlier adoption attempt; they could have used his adoptive parents’ wealth to help save the orphanage. Moe angrily yells at them by telling them that he doesn’t care and also saying that he didn't need them. After deciding to split up, they leave the old building, with Moe left inside alone. Then it turns out that they were all on stage in front of an audition crew who select Moe to be the newest cast member of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' as "Dyna-Moe".  ===Final Act / Episode 3: No Moe Mister Nice Guy=== Larry and Curly are getting along well without Moe, but they return to the orphanage, where they find out a girl named Murph is very ill, but has not been taken to the hospital because the orphanage has no medical insurance. Sister Mary-Mengele tells them that no one will insure the orphanage due to the trio’s numerous accidents and injuries over the years, and the $830,000 is needed in order to cover medical bills that accumulated over the years. Larry and Curly later meet up with Teddy's adopted father at his office to talk about what happened with the orphanage. Teddy's father confesses that Moe wanted him to go back for his friends to adopt them and he didn't want to so he gave Moe back and took Teddy in his place. Then Larry and Curly discover a picture of Teddy and Mr. Harter with Lydia and Mac and realize that Teddy is the husband that Lydia wanted to murder. In addition to this, they feel guilty for rebuking Moe in not accepting the Harter’s adoption and decide to go find him.  Meanwhile, Moe has been causing a lot of havoc on ''Jersey Shore'' by slapping the cast members around and not putting up with their spoiled antics. The cast go to the producer and tell him to kick Moe off of the show or sue him. The producer then informs them that the show is all about [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]… NOT them. Larry and Curly finally go to the set of ''Jersey Shore'' to reunite with Moe and they all head to the anniversary party where they show up to thwart the murder plot, getting in as balloon men. When they get inside, Curly gives all the balloons to a little girl and she floats up into the air. Later, they get chased by the angry Lydia and Mac after the same girl’s balloons are popped and she falls onto the wedding cake, destroying it. Moe, Larry, and Curly are chased into Teddy’s bedroom, finding Teddy on the bed, drowsy. Mac then draws a gun on the trio, but Teddy’s dad appears and tells Mac to put his gun down. Mac then says Lydia was “calling the shots", but Teddy’s dad confesses that he was “calling the shots”. The trio then realize that Mr. Harter was the real [[wikt:mastermind|mastermind]] and Lydia was working for him. He married into the money and was incensed to find out the money was left to Teddy and not him when Teddy’s mother died years earlier. They are taken for a ride, but the car crashes into the water when Curly’s pet rat Nippy distracts them; then, they all escape when Curly [[Flatulence|passes gas]], and they light it with “waterproof, strike-anywhere matches” that Larry had, causing enough of an [[explosion]] to blow out the windows. Once they are back on land, Mr. Harter, Lydia, and Mac are arrested, and Teddy thanks the trio for saving him. When the trio request the $830,000 from Teddy, he says no, stating he refuses to help the same orphanage that gave him up to a father that tried to kill him, as well as sending him to [[military school]] when he was 7, among other things over the years.  A couple months later, the trio return to the now-condemned and abandoned orphanage. They then start crying for feeling like failures, but then they hear kids laughing, swimming and playing. When they investigate, they find out a whole brand new orphanage was built next door, complete with a swimming pool, a basketball court, and a tennis court. They soon learn that the money came from the ''Jersey Shore'''s producers who consider this as an advance payment in relation to a new reality show, ''Nuns vs. Nitwits'', in which the entire trio will take part. Murph is revealed to be perfectly fine and her illness was due to poison in the cheese (really from rat traps in the attic), though Larry has always suspected it was from too much iron in the water. Then she, along with her friends, brothers Peezer and Weezer (the latter thought to have been lost forever to a foster home), will be adopted by Teddy and his new fiancee, Ling ([[Emy Coligado]]), who was Teddy's father's secretary. In the end, after causing one more incident (namely, Curly accidentally knocking Sister Mary-Mengele into the pool with a folded-up diving board, causing the sister to scream, "I'm gonna mash your heads like potatoes!!"), the trio run away and bounce off trampolines out of the orphanage and onto some mules, on which they ride away from the orphanage, off into the distance.  ===Post-script epilogue=== An [[epilogue]] consists of two actors ([[Antonio Sabàto, Jr.]] and Justin Lopez) playing [[Farrelly brothers|Bobby and Peter Farrelly]], explaining that the stunts were all done by professionals, showing the foam rubber props used in the film for the trio to hit one another, demonstrating the fake eye-poke trick (to the eyebrows), and advising children not to try any of the stunts at home.  During the end credits, a music video plays showing the Stooges and Sister Rosemary performing "[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]", originally recorded by [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]] in 1970, interspersed with excerpts from [[deleted scene]]s and a couple of brief [[outtake]]s. Though credited to "The Spinners and The Three Stooges", Hudson's own distinctive vocals can also be heard.

 CIA agents and best friends Franklin "FDR" Foster ([[Chris Pine]]) and Tuck Hansen ([[Tom Hardy]]) are deployed to [[Hong Kong]] to prevent international criminal Karl Heinrich ([[Til Schweiger]]) from acquiring a weapon of mass destruction, but the mission goes awry, resulting in the death of Heinrich's brother, Jonas. Heinrich swears vengeance against them. Upon returning to America, their boss, Collins ([[Angela Bassett]]) assigns them to desk duty for their protection.  FDR is a womanizer, whose cover is a cruise ship captain, while Tuck, who presents himself as a travel agent, has an ex-wife, Katie ([[Abigail Spencer]]) and a young son, Joe ([[John Paul Ruttan]]), who believes his dad is a weakling.  Tuck goes to Joe's karate lesson, where Joe loses his match. Tuck tries to give Joe advice but Joe rolls his eyes and asks how he would know since he is just a travel agent. Tuck walks Joe to the car, where he attempts to rekindle his connection to his family, but Katie makes excuses as to why they can't go out for supper together.  After being rebuffed by Katie, Tuck sees a commercial for online dating. He decides to sign himself up and is paired with Lauren Scott ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), a product-testing executive who is dealing with the recent engagement of her ex-boyfriend. Her best friend, Trish ([[Chelsea Handler]]) enrolled her in the same online dating website. FDR insists on being Tuck's backup for the date and hides nearby, but Tuck and Lauren hit it off right away.  Shortly thereafter, FDR runs into Lauren at a video store and tries to flirt with her, not knowing she's Tuck's date. She surmises that he's a ladies' man and ignores him. Intrigued, FDR crashes into one of Lauren's test groups and coerces her to go on a date with him.  FDR and Tuck soon discover that they are seeing the same woman and decide not to tell her that they know each other, not to interfere with each other's dates and not to have sex with her, letting her instead come to a decision between them.  Tuck takes Lauren on a date to a circus (after hours) where they swing on the trapeze and have a really great date.  The date with FDR does not go well at the start, with Lauren storming out of the club FDR takes her to. After arguing in the street, FDR walks away from Lauren but seconds later, Lauren sees her ex-boyfriend and his fiancée approaching. Desperate, Lauren grabs FDR and kisses him. She lies to her ex that she and FDR are together, as FDR plays along with the ruse. Her ex and his fiancée both seem jealous at the passion displayed, and later move along. FDR demands that Lauren explain what just happened and suggests they grab some dinner at a nearby pizza parlor, where they talk seriously and hit it off.  Later, after dating both men a few times Lauren feels guilty about dating them at the same time, but is persuaded by Trish to make the best of the situation.  By this time both men have bugged Lauren's home and cell phone so they can spy on her when she is on dates with the other one, they overhear her tell Trish that she is going to need to have sex with them both to decide which one is the right one. This leads to both men taking steps to ensure she does not sleep with the other one.  After a few more dates, Lauren and Trish discuss the pros and cons of dating more than one guy, especially since Tuck has told Lauren he loves her. Trish tells Lauren "don't pick the better guy, pick the guy that'll make you a better girl".  After a while, Lauren invites Tuck to lunch, while FDR discovers that Heinrich has arrived in town to exact his revenge. He interrupts Lauren's date to warn Tuck but Tuck doesn't believe him. They engage in an extended fight, after which Lauren discovers that they are in fact best friends and, feeling made a fool of, leaves with Trish. At that moment, the women are kidnapped by Heinrich and his men, who are pursued by FDR and Tuck.  FDR and Tuck rescue Lauren and Trish after a car chase, in which they reveal that they are not who they say they are. On Lauren's advice, they shoot out the headlights on Heinrich's SUV, deploying the airbags and sending the car rolling out of control towards them all. With Lauren standing directly in the path of the approaching SUV, FDR and Tuck, on opposite sides of the road, urge her to come to their side and she is saved as she ultimately chooses FDR's side, while Heinrich dies when his car rolls off the elevated freeway and crashes below. Lauren has decided to be with FDR and Tuck makes amends with him, as they declare their brotherly love for one another, and FDR says they're "family, and forever." Lauren and FDR kiss. The car chase is picked up by the news, and Katie and Joe see it. Joe tells his mom that his dad is not a travel agent.  Later, Joe is at his karate lesson with Tuck when Katie comes to pick Joe up. Tuck and Katie reintroduce themselves to each other and she invites him out for supper as a family.  Shortly thereafter, FDR and Tuck go on a mission. They are about to parachute out of a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook helicopter]] when FDR reveals that he will be marrying Lauren, and asks Tuck to be his best man. He reveals that he had sex with Katie before she met Tuck, but no longer feels guilty about it because Tuck had sex with Lauren. Tuck, however, reveals that they did not go all the way and angrily tackles FDR out of the helicopter.  
A Thousand Words (film)
 Jack McCall ([[Eddie Murphy]]) is a [[literary agent]] who uses his "gift of gab" to get various book deals, and he is not afraid to stretch the truth to get them. While he is trying to get a book deal from a New Age self-help guru named Dr. Sinja ([[Cliff Curtis]]), the guru sees through his deceit and agrees to the deal, only to later deliver a five-page book. That night, a [[Bodhi Tree]] magically appears in his backyard. Dr. Sinja goes to Jack's house and they both discover that for every word that Jack says, a leaf will fall off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, the tree will perish, as will Jack. In time, he finds that even written words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree will also affect Jack. When Jack tries to cut it down with an axe, an axe wound appears on him. When squirrels climb the tree, it tickles him. When a gardener tries to poison it with [[DDT]], Jack gets high on the fumes and when the gardener tries to water the tree, Jack starts to sweat/perspire profusely.  With Jack forced to pick and choose his words, communicating with others becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These misunderstandings cost him two book deals, his job, and his wife Caroline ([[Kerry Washington]]). She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to his not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesn't believe him. Only Jack's assistant Aaron ([[Clark Duke]]) realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to Jack's house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose lots of leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the ground does Jack stop speaking.  With his life falling apart and the tree running out of leaves, Jack confronts Dr. Sinja and asks how to end the curse. The guru tells him to make peace in all of his relationships. With just one branch of leaves left, Jack tries to reconcile with his wife, but she remains hesitant. He visits his mother Annie ([[Ruby Dee]]), who lives in an assisted-living center and has dementia. Annie tells Jack, who she thinks is Jack's late father Raymond, that she wishes Jack would stop being angry at his father for walking out on them when he was a kid. Jack, realizing that this is the relationship that needs the most mending, goes to visit his father's grave. Jack expends the last three leaves of the tree with the words, "I forgive you." With no leaves remaining, Jack suffers a heart attack in a storm and appears to die.  Aaron then calls Jack on his cell phone.  Jack, who is still alive, answers his phone. Aaron tells him that the tree's leaves have magically reappeared and Jack can now talk freely again.  Jack and Caroline get back together, with Jack buying the family-friendly house Caroline asked for earlier, and the tree is in their front yard. He does not get his job back (Aaron was promoted to Jack's old position), but he writes a book about his experience, called ''A Thousand Words'', and gets Aaron to make the deal. Unfortunately for Aaron, his promotion causes him to be like Jack was, thus he gets his own smaller office Bodhi tree.

Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].  At the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.

The Thought Exchange (film)
 ''The Thought Exchange'' serves as a condensed introduction to the methods taught by David Friedman in his Thought Exchange book. The film uncovers methods of successfully implemented the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|Law of Attraction]] by a more comprehensive understanding of [[reality]] and how [[Sensation (psychology)|sensations]] are used to influence "deliberate creation", or as the film refers to as "manifestation". The film claims that human sensations are the leading factor in the success or failure of [[Creative visualization | visualizations]] when one is attempting to "manifest"  a change in their life or their way of thinking. The film also discusses matters of reality, [[mind over matter]], [[causality]] and the role of the [[Quantum mechanics | observer]] in human beings as [[Avatar | spiritual avatars]]. <ref> The Thought Exchange,  </ref>  After the release of David Friedman's book, Usher Morgan acquired the rights and developed the film with Friedman who also stars in the film.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243629/</ref> Many of the subjects who appear in the film are individuals who claim to follow the Thought Exchange principles and have used it to finally get the Law of Attraction to work in their life.  
Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie
 Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim are two filmmakers who are given a record-setting $1 billion budget to make a movie. The funds are provided by Tommy Schlaaang and the Schlaaang Corporation. The two waste all of their money on the making of ''Bonjour, Diamond Jim'', a three-minute film (based on a poem by "personal shopper and spiritual guru" Jim Joe Kelly ([[Zach Galifianakis]]) who they paid $500,000 a week), plus expensive makeovers, 10-course lunches, real diamonds for Diamond Jim's suit, and a [[Johnny Depp]] impersonator. Because of this, the two leave Los Angeles in fear that they will go to prison or be hunted down by the Schlaaang Corp.  After seeing an advertisement for it in a nightclub bathroom, Tim and Eric decide to renovate the S'Wallow Valley Mall run by Damien Weebs ([[Will Ferrell]]), in the hopes that they will make back their billion dollar debt. While trying to refurbish the mall, they must deal with vagrants such as a man-child named Taquito ([[John C. Reilly]]), bizarre stores (such as Reggie's Used Toilet Paper Discount Warehouse), and a man-eating wolf that stalks the food court.  During their time at the S'Wallow Valley Mall, Tim and Eric also face many challenges, such as an angry shop owner named Allen Bishopman ([[Will Forte]]) who "doesn't want anything to change", and the fact that Eric is in love with Katie ([[Twink Caplan]]), a woman who works at the mall (whom Eric also compulsively masturbates to.) Because of this, Tim poisons Eric and ends up making love to Katie, whilst Eric goes to the Shrim Alternative Healing Center, run by Dr. Doone Struts ([[Ray Wise]]) to seek "spiritual healing", only to be placed in a bathtub which gets filled with diarrhea by Struts' sons as part of the "spiritual healing". After the event, Eric finds Tim sleeping with Katie and subsequently fights Tim. After the fight, Eric apologizes to Tim for starting the fight and understands why Tim made love to Katie.  They are eventually discovered by the Schlaaang Corporation because of Allen. After a dramatic shootout in front of the mall, in which most of the main characters are killed, Tim and Eric manage to kill the members of the Schlaaang Corporation, and are sentenced to death for murder.   However, it is  revealed that [[Film within a film|the preceding events are actually a film]] the two were showing to [[Steven Spielberg]], who pronounces it the greatest movie ever made. Tim and Eric then celebrate with their ''Awesome Show'' co-stars.  
To Rome with Love (film)
 ''To Rome with Love'' tells four unrelated stories taking place in Rome. The second story, Antonio's, is a direct lift with some amendments of an entire [[Federico Fellini]] film, ''[[The White Sheik]]'' (1952).  ===Hayley's Story=== American tourist Hayley falls in love with and becomes engaged to Italian pro bono lawyer Michelangelo while spending a summer in Rome. Her parents, Jerry (Woody Allen) and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fiancé and his parents. During the visit, Michelangelo's mortician father Giancarlo sings in the shower and Jerry, a retired—and critically reviled—opera director, feels inspired to bring Giancarlo's gift to the public. Jerry convinces a reluctant Giancarlo to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs, but Giancarlo performs poorly in this setting. Michelangelo accuses Jerry of embarrassing his father and trying to use him to revive his own failed career, which in turn breeds discontent between Michelangelo and Hayley.  Jerry then realizes that Giancarlo's talent is tied to the comfort and freedom he feels in the shower; Jerry stages a concert in which Giancarlo performs at the [[Teatro dell'Opera]] while actually washing himself onstage in a purpose-built shower. This is a great success, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage the opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'', with an incongruous shower present in all scenes. Giancarlo receives rave reviews, while Jerry is unaware that he has again been slammed as he has been called "imbecille" ("stupid" in Italian). Giancarlo decides to retire from opera singing, because he prefers working as a mortician and spending time with his family. But he appreciates being given the chance to live his dream of performing ''Pagliacci'', and his success has mended the relationship between Michelangelo and Hayley.  ===Antonio's Story===  Newlyweds Antonio and Milly plan to move to Rome because Antonio's uncles have offered him a job in their family's business. After checking into their hotel, Milly decides to visit a salon before meeting Antonio's relatives. She becomes lost and loses her cell phone, but ends up at a film shoot where she meets Luca Salta, an actor she idolizes. He invites her to lunch. Back at the hotel, Antonio is worried Milly will be late for their lunch date with his aunts and uncles. Anna, a prostitute, then arrives, having mistakenly been sent to his room.  Despite his protests, she wrestles him into a compromising position just as his relatives arrive; the only way he can think to save face is to introduce Anna as Milly, and he convinces her to pose as Milly. The group goes to lunch at the same restaurant Luca takes Milly. Antonio becomes jealous as Luca flirts with Milly, but they don't see Antonio. Antonio's uncles and aunts then take him to a party. Antonio has nothing in common with the people he's introduced to, but most of the male guests are Anna's clients. Anna and Antonio walk in the garden, and Antonio talks about how pure Milly is. When Anna finds out he was a virgin before meeting Milly, she seduces him in the bushes.  Meanwhile, Luca tries to seduce Milly at his hotel room. Milly decides to have sex with him, but then an armed thief emerges and demands their valuables. Suddenly, Luca's wife and a private investigator arrive. Milly and the thief climb into bed and fool Mrs. Salta into believing the hotel room is theirs while Luca hides in the bathroom. Once his wife has left, Luca runs off. The burglar flirts with Milly and she has sex with him instead. When she returns to the hotel room, she and Antonio decide to return to their rustic hometown—but first they begin to make love.  ===Leopoldo's Story===  Leopoldo lives a mundane life with his wife and two children. The best part of his day is watching his boss's beautiful secretary Serafina walk around the office. Inexplicably, he wakes up one morning to discover that he has become a national celebrity. Paparazzi document his every move. Reporters ask him what he had for breakfast, if he wears boxers or briefs, whether he thinks it will rain or which hand he scratches. Leopoldo even becomes a manager at his company, and Serafina sleeps with him. He begins dating models and attending fancy film premieres. The constant attention wears on him, though. One day, in the middle of interviewing Leopoldo, the paparazzi spot a man "who looks more interesting," and they abandon Leopoldo. At first, Leopoldo welcomes the return to his old life. But one afternoon he breaks down when no one asks for his autograph. Leopoldo has learned that life can be monotonous and wearying whether one is a celebrity or a normal man. Still, it is much better to be a weary celebrity than it is to be a weary regular man.  ===John's Story=== John (Alec Baldwin), a well-known architect, is visiting Rome with his wife and their friends. He had lived there some thirty years ago, and he would rather revisit his old haunts than go sightseeing with the others. While looking for his old apartment building, John meets Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), an American architecture student who recognizes him. Jack happens to live in John's old building, and invites him up to the apartment he shares with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig). Throughout the rest of the story, John appears as a quasi-real and quasi-imaginary figure around Jack and makes unusually frank observations of events.<ref></ref> Sally tells Jack that she invited her best friend Monica, an actress, to stay with them and tells him that Monica (Ellen Page) gives off a sexual vibe that drives men crazy. John predicts Monica will bring trouble, and John keeps telling Jack that Monica will lead him to trouble. Even though John cautions Jack against cheating with Monica, he begins to succumb to her charms. Sally sets Monica up with Leonardo, one of their friends, and Jack is jealous of their relationship. One night he and Monica decide to cook dinner for Sally and Leonardo. They flirt more and more until Jack kisses Monica; they go down to his car to have sex.  Jack, now besotted with her, plans to leave Sally for Monica, but they decide Jack should wait until Sally finishes her midterms for Jack to break up with her. The trio go out for lunch after Sally's exams, and when they are alone, Jack tells Monica he plans to dump Sally that night. They make plans to travel to Greece and Sicily together. Then Monica gets a phone call from her agent who says she has been offered a role in a Hollywood blockbuster. She will film in Los Angeles and Tokyo for the next five months and she immediately becomes completely focused on preparing for the role. She forgets about traveling with Jack, who realizes how shallow she is. John and Jack walk back to the Roman street corner where they met and they part ways. It is possible that John's whole experience was actually his memory of what happened to him 30 years ago. (It is loosely implied that Sally is now his wife.)

Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles
 Makoy (Dingdong Dantes), an arrogant and ill-mannered playboy from Manila, travels to an unnamed province to get to the town of Pulupandan in an effort to make amends with his pregnant girlfriend, Sonia (Lovi Poe). Sonia's mother, Fely (Janice de Belen), is very unhappy at his arrival and immediately asks him to leave. Sonia likewise asks him to leave, intending to break off their relationship and raise the child on her own.  Makoy calls one of his friends back in Manila from the store next door, and is convinced to make another attempt at reconciliation. The store owner, Pacing (Rina Reyes), explains a little of Sonia's background.  Makoy goes back to the house, and Sonia's father, Nestor (Joey Marquez), is more welcoming. He invites Makoy to attend Sonia's birthday celebration the next day and asks him to help shop for supplies with their house helper, Bart ([[Ramon Bautista]]). While at the town marketplace, Bart suggests they buy a pig from his cousin Ringo (Mike Gayoso) who he says can give them a discount. Nestor and Makoy then travel to the next town to meet Ringo.  A group of four rowdy kids, led by Kulot, harass the two. They are saved by Ringo, who berates his son Kulot in front of them. He also refused to give a discount to them, and Makoy urges Nestor to go back to the first marketplace instead. On their way out, however, Kulot hears that Sonia is pregnant, and offers to sell them a pig at a much lower price. Although Nestor hesitates, Makoy decides to buy it. Kulot however, is missing during the actual transaction which is completed by Hilda, Kulas and Mutya.  Nestor invites Makoy to spend the night at his house. Makoy tries again to reconcile with Sonia, although both Sonia and Fely rebuff his efforts. Makoy, Nestor and Bart then decide to have a few drinks after dinner. Makoy and Nestor later hear strange noises, reminding Nestor of tales regarding the Tiktik - a variation of aswang. He and Makoy then come back inside the house.  Meanwhile, the pig is later revealed to be a Tiktik and attacks Sonia while she sleeps. She is able to scream, and Makoy and Nestor are able to deal with it. Makoy ends up killing the creature, which turns into Kulot upon dying. Bart recognises Kulot as the latter is his nephew. This leads Makoy to accuse Bart of being an aswang too, and ties him up.  Ringo finds out about Kulot's plan, much to his chagrin. After Kulot fails to come back, he sends Kulas and Cedric to investigate. He confronts the humans after learning of Kulot's fate, revealing their status as Tiktiks. He demands an exchange - Makoy's unborn child for not attacking Nestor's family. He declines, causing the group of aswangs to begin their attack. Makoy takes Bart hostage, and drives away to draw them away.  Makoy and Bart drive to the military checkpoint near the outskirts of the town, seeking their help. Ringo and the others change back to human form, and the soldiers stand down as Ringo is familiar to them. Ringo accuses Makoy of hurting Bart. Seeing Bart still bound, the soldiers turn their attention to Makoy but are ambushed by Ringo and his group, wiping them out. Makoy and Bart take a military vehicle and crash it on to Kulas, killing him, then run back to Nestor's house.  The humans spread garlic cloves and salt - items said to have the power to repel aswangs - onto the windows and doors of the house to prevent the Tiktiks from entering.  During the standoff, Rex and his son Abel arrive at Nestor's house to deliver the items he purchased from them at the first marketplace earlier. Upon seeing the dead Kulot at Nestor's doorstep, Rex hesitates to enter despite the prodding of Nestor and Makoy. The Tiktiks emerge from the shadows and attack, killing Rex although Makoy is able to save Abel.  Ringo directs Hilda and Cedric to find an entry point. The two are able to enter through a window that has no garlic clove or salt. Cedric attacks Fely, while Hilda attacks Sonia who has begun to undergo labor. Makoy comes to Sonia's aid and kills Hilda, while an enraged Nestor kills Cedric who mortally wounded Fely.  A new group, led by their elder Tatang (Roi Vinzon), suddenly arrive. Ringo apologizes for the aswangs' deaths, but Tatang kills him. Tatang apologizes to the humans for the attack, but states that he still has to kill them all lest their presence be revealed to the rest of the townsfolk. He empowers his kin, making them less susceptible to the garlic cloves and salt, allowing them to slowly gain entry to the whole house.  Makoy convinces a mourning Nestor help him get Sonia to safety, and asks him to join him in Manila when all is said and done. He addresses Nestor as "dad", which in turn convinces Sonia to accept Makoy's reconciliation.   Bart reveals that he has been mortally wounded during their escape from the military checkpoint earlier, and decides to draw the attackers as Nestor, Makoy, Sonia and Abel quietly slip away through the backdoor. He is killed after setting off molotov cocktails, taking some of the pursuers with him.  The humans seek refuge at Pacing's store. She gives Makoy a pair of stingray's tail whips - said to be a more potent weapon against aswangs - and helps deliver Sonia's baby. Sonia, Pacing, and Mackie - the newborn child - head to the salt farm at the back of the store while Nestor, Makoy and Abel face off against the Tiktiks. Tatang, meanwhile, tracks the baby down. He transforms into a winged aswang, and is able to get Mackie. However, Sonia throws salt at him, and Makoy hits Tatang with the whip. Sonia is able to catch Mackie as Tatang is destroyed.  They then are able to be at ease for a little while, and decide to go with Makoy's earlier [[Kubot: The Aswang Chronicles 2|plan to move to Manila]].

Total Recall (2012 film)
   At the end of the 21st century, Earth is devastated by [[chemical warfare]]. What little habitable land remains is divided into two territories, the United Federation of Britain (UFB, located on the [[British Isles]] and western mainland [[Europe]]) and the Colony ([[Australia]]). Many residents of the Colony travel to the UFB to work in factories via “The Fall,” a [[Gravity train|gravity elevator]] running through the Earth’s core. A Resistance operating in the UFB, which the UFB views as a terrorist movement, seeks to improve life in the Colony.  Colony citizen Douglas Quaid<ref></ref> has been having dreams of being a secret agent, aided by an unknown woman. Tired of his factory job building police robots with friend Harry, he visits Rekall, a virtual entertainment company that implants artificial memories. Among the choices Rekall salesman Bob McClane offers Quaid are the memories of a secret agent. An emblem of Rekall is stamped onto his arm. Just as Quaid is starting to be implanted, McClane discovers that Quaid already has real memories of being a covert operative. As McClane starts to question Quaid about the memories, UFB police officers burst in, kill the Rekall crew, and attempt to arrest Quaid. Quaid instinctively reacts and kills the officers before escaping. Upon returning home his wife Lori attempts to kill him, revealing that she is an undercover UFB agent who has been monitoring him only for the past six weeks, and that she doesn’t know who or what he was. After Quaid escapes, Charles Hammond, a “friend” Quaid does not recognize, contacts him and directs him to a safe-deposit box numbered 10549 at First Bank. Quaid finds a recorded message from his former self with the address of a UFB apartment.  While being pursued by Lori and other human and robot police, Quaid meets Melina, the woman from his dreams. At the apartment Quaid finds another recording, revealing that his name is actually Carl Hauser, an agent working for UFB Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen. After defecting to the Resistance, Hauser was captured by the UFB and implanted with [[False memory|false memories]]. The recording reveals that Cohaagen will use robots to invade the Colony so the UFB will have more living space. Hauser, however, has seen a “kill code” that would disable the robots. The code can be recovered from his memory by Resistance leader Matthias. Melina reveals that she was Hauser’s lover before Hauser was captured; she proves that they knew each other by showing that they have matching scars from a time they were both shot while holding hands. The police surround the apartment building and Harry appears. He tries to convince Quaid that he is still in a Rekall-induced dream and that killing Melina is the only way out. Quaid is conflicted, but notices a tear on Melina’s cheek and shoots Harry instead. Lori pursues the pair inside the building's elevators, but fails to capture them.  Quaid and Melina meet with Matthias. While Matthias searches Quaid’s memories, Lori and Cohaagen storm the Resistance base. Cohaagen reveals that Hauser was in fact working for him without Quaid even knowing it due to the memory alteration, using the kill code as a trap. Cohaagen kills Matthias and arranges to restore Hauser’s memory before leaving with Melina as a prisoner. As the officers are about to inject Quaid, Hammond (revealed to be one of the police officers involved in the raid) sacrifices himself to help Quaid escape. Cohaagen begins his invasion of the Colony, loading The Fall with his army of robots. Quaid sneaks on board, setting timed explosives throughout the ship while searching for Melina. After freeing her, they climb atop The Fall as it arrives at the Colony. As they fight the soldiers and Cohaagen, Quaid's explosives detonate. Quaid and Melina jump off before the ship plummets back into the tunnel and explodes underground, killing Cohaagen and destroying his army and The Fall itself. Waking up in an ambulance, Quaid is greeted by Melina. When he notices that she is missing her scar, he realizes that she is Lori using a holographic disguise; they fight and Lori is killed. Quaid finds the real Melina outside the ambulance and they embrace. As news channels declare the independence of The Colony, Quaid looks up to find an advertisement of Rekall on an electronic billboard, notices that his forearm is missing the 'peace sign' that he was supposed to have received earlier in the timeline at the Rekall parlour, and briefly contemplates about reality before accepting his current world as real and embracing Melina.

On his first day volunteering, he tells one of the children that the [[Tooth Fairy]] isn't real, upsetting the little boy and making him doubt the realness of the Tooth Fairy.   That night Larry is approached by a Tooth Fairy, who tells him he is a substitute Tooth Fairy, and must collect ten [[teeth]] in ten days. Larry is given magic dust to help him, and is told if he fails to collect ten teeth, his greatest memory will be taken away.   Larry awakes from what he thought was a [[dream]], but soon finds out he was wrong. The following [[night]], he turns into the Tooth Fairy and goes to collect his first tooth. He manages to collect it, with some difficulty but is very proud of his abilities. The next night he turns into the Tooth Fairy again.   During this time, he is beginning to make improvements at the after school program, helping them raise [[money]] for new supplies. Brooke is starting to warm up to him, and tells him she is happy with what he has done. He then offers to go out and buy the supplies with the money they made, in hopes to impress Brooke further.   Shortly after Larry collects the supplies for the program, he turns into the Tooth Fairy and is forced to serve his duties. While he is collecting a tooth, Bo steals the supplies, in order to make Larry look bad. When Larry returns from collecting the tooth, he is shocked to find his car empty, and has to break the news to Brooke and the kids the next day.   Soon after and feeling discouraged, Larry decides to quit his job as the Tooth Fairy and lose what he thought was his greatest memory. When he finds out that winning the Metro County Miracle wasn't his greatest memory, he is confused. He decides to reclaim his role as the Tooth Fairy, with little time to spare.   After successfully collecting the remainder of the teeth, and restoring the children's beliefs in the Tooth Fairy, Larry finds out that his greatest memory was, in fact, one shared with Brooke. Larry decides to tell Brooke this, and when she asks Bo for his greatest memory she is disappointed. She ends her engagement with Bo and rekindles her love with Larry.   In the end, Larry and Brooke get married and are expecting a child, while Larry is still secretly a fill in Tooth Fairy.    ===Larry's pink outfits===  When Larry is transformed into a Tooth Fairy, he is initially given a [[pink]] ballerina-like outfit.  Larry later asks for a new outfit.  Some of the outfits offered to Larry included a pink superhero outfit, a pink cowboy outfit, and a pink [[Statue of Liberty]] outfit.  Nix, the head Tooth Fairy, then offers him a pair of overalls, which Larry accepts.  As with the other prior outfits, the overalls given to Larry were also pink, which Larry initially complains about but later becomes more fond of.  
Touchback (film)
 The setting begins with the introduction of Scott Murphy, former high school football hero. An injury he received during the Ohio State High School Championship game terminated his scholarship to Ohio State University and his dreams of a professional career in football. It's been twenty years since that game and Scott still resides with his family in the quiet town of Coldwater, Ohio. He has a splinted leg and has been a farmer since high school. Rather than marrying the head cheerleader, Scott marries and has two daughters with a clarinet-playing band member named Macey. Difficulties with a compromised harvest and bank obligations have caused strain on his farm, which he is in jeopardy of losing. With bad luck around every corner, Scott is not mentally prepared for the game in which he will be honored  (in a halftime ceremony), and the return of his good friend Hall who made the NFL and married Scott's old high school girlfriend only adds to the depression he is feeling. An early frost and a broken soybean header bring Scott to the brink. His wife, Macey, suggests that they could pick the soybeans by hand in order to bring them to market. Scott finds this far-fetched since there are 200 acres to combine (harvest). He decides to kill himself via carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in his truck, at least his wife and two girls will receive the life insurance bonus – which is another mistake since a suicide death will not activate a life insurance payout. As he passes out, Scott wakes up back in 1991, on the eve of the big game.  Scott embraces his return, as he is able to spend time with his hard-working mother. One last recruiting meeting with scouts from OSU enlightens Scott as the scout admits the game will be hard, and that if he so chooses, sitting out will not impact his invitation to joining the quarterback unit at OSU. Scott introduces himself to Macey and tries to share with her what is happening with him. With the championship game upon him, he informs Coach Hand (played by Kurt Russell) that he will not play in the big game which will undo the events which have directly led to his pain and misery. Coach offers a speech about the merits of the people of Coldwater. Coach even shares with Scott how he receives a job offer from OSU annually, only to turn it down out of respect for Coldwater, and the people who make the town so special. As Scott lives through the events leading up to the game, he decides he will play, and in doing so he exhibits an incredible talent on the field. While Scott's efforts on the field keep the game close, Coach Hand encourages him to share the ball with his teammates. In the second half, Scott mixes it up a bit and with "the play" imminent, Scott tells his coach he will not run the pitch-fake which ultimately causes his leg to be broken. Coach smiles and suggests a passing play, but informs Scott that based upon the Chief's defensive formation, he can call an audible as necessary, that it is his decision.  As Scott prepares to call for the hike, he looks over at his girlfriend, then looks out into the band bleachers, where he sees Macey. The clock runs down and Scott calls an audible, a running play where he maneuvers himself close enough to jump into the end zone. As he crosses, Scott is hammered by two defensive players, and his leg is shattered at the knee. Coldwater wins the Ohio State High School Championship game over the heavily favored Chiefs. Scott demonstrated that he is an intensely talented football player, as he basically, for the most part, single handedly, beat a high school team that had eight players on defense already signed to NCAA Division I scholarships.  Back in Scott's beaten up pick-up truck, he awakes and realize it was just a dream and sees that he ran out of gas. This means his engine died, no longer producing CO, so Scott escapes death. As he walks to town, he sees it is desolate — even the football field is absent of any people or players. As he makes a turn for his farm, he sees his soybean field crowded with all the citizens of Coldwater. They heard about his hardship, his need for his crops to make it to market, and the people of Coldwater have stepped up to return the favor ... in honor of the great Scott Murphy, the exceptional quarterback who gave Coldwater the 1991 Ohio State High School Championship. Scott decide to stop complaining about his life and he is happy about what he has and never regret it. He also decides to be an assistant coach to his old mentor coach. He also reunited with his wife and his two kids.

Tower Block (film)
  One night in London, the 15-year-old Jimmy (Ralph Laurila) runs through a housing estate begging passersby for help. Everyone ignores him. He enters the condemned Tower Block 31 and finds his way to the top floor, which is the only floor that is still inhabited as the tenants wait to be rehoused. He bangs on doors as the two masked men who have been chasing him appear. The only person who helps him is office worker Becky ([[Sheridan Smith]]), but she is beaten to the ground and he is dragged away. The next morning Detective Constable Devlin (Steven Cree) conducts door-to-door enquiries about the previous night's murder, as the boy's body has been found. Nobody will speak to him; not even Becky, who claims her injuries are the result of a [[Robbery|mugging]].  Three months later, Becky wakes up in her flat next to her colleague Ryan ([[Jamie Thomas King]]), with whom she has had a one-night stand following an office party. As they have breakfast, Ryan is suddenly shot in the head through the window. Becky flees into the hallway, along with the other residents, as all the flats have been targeted: young couple Amy ([[Loui Batley]]) and Jeff ([[Michael Legge (actor)|Michael Legge]]); Carol ([[Julie Graham]]) and her teenaged computer game addict son Daniel ([[Harry McEntire]]); [[chav]]vy single mother Jenny ([[Montserrat Lombard]]); middle-aged former soldier Neville ([[Ralph Brown]]) and his wife Violet ([[Jill Baker]]); small-time drug dealers Gary ([[Nabil Elouahabi]]) and Mark ([[Kane Robinson]]); lonely alcoholic Paul ([[Russell Tovey]]); and the violent petty criminal Kurtis ([[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]]), who extorts protection money from his neighbours. Amy, Jeff, and Mark are wounded. As well as Ryan, Carol's husband and Jenny's two young children have already been killed by the sniper. Amy too soon succumbs to her injuries despite the best efforts of Violet, who is a first aider. The phones and internet have stopped working. The walls and doors are covered by homemade posters bearing three [[emoticons]]. Daniel, who has learned about such things from computer games, says that the sniper knows what he is doing and is using a high-powered military-grade rifle.  The fire escape is exposed to the sniper's gunfire, so they force open the [[elevator|lift]] door. It is boobytrapped with a [[shotgun]], however, which kills Jeff. Becky, Kurtis, and Paul climb down the lift shaft, but discover the ground-floor exit door has been blocked with a [[Skip (container)|skip]] and return to the top floor. Jenny suggests the emoticons symbolise the [[three wise monkeys]] and that the sniper is targeting them because they let Jimmy be killed and refused to speak to the police about it. She then walks into her flat to be shot dead alongside her children.  The largest of the posters has been stuck on the door of the flat occupied by Gary and Mark. Kurtis forces them to admit that they were the two masked men who chased and beat Jimmy because he had withheld money from them after they used him as a drug courier; they claim they did not mean to kill him. Nevertheless, Kurtis forces them into the flat where the sniper kills both of them.  Believing they can now leave because Jimmy's killers are dead, Carol runs down the fire escape, followed by Daniel. The sniper lets them reach the ground and then kills both of them. It is now obvious that he intends to execute all of them for refusing to help the police. The survivors have now been trapped for two days. They hatch a plan to tie all the building's [[fire hose]]s together and for one of them to climb down to the ground from the roof on the far side, where the sniper cannot see. Paul volunteers to go. Violet opens the door to the roof and is killed by another shotgun boobytrap. Becky, Kurtis, and Paul climb to the roof and secure the hoses, and Paul begins to climb down. The sniper, however, shoots the top of the hose until it breaks, and Paul falls to his death. Becky and Kurtis barely manage to get back inside.  As a final act of desperation, the three survivors set fire to the top floor, hoping someone will see the fire and alert the emergency services. They then climb down the lift shaft. Kurtis falls and breaks his leg. Property developer Kevin ([[Christopher Fulford]]) and his assistant Eddie (Tony Jayawardena) arrive and spot the flames, but before they can call the fire brigade, the gunman shoots them both at close range. He then enters the building after throwing in a [[smoke grenade]]. Becky sneaks out and finds a [[nail gun]] in Kevin's [[pick-up truck]]. Using this the three survivors manage to subdue the gunman and remove his mask, only to discover it is DC Devlin, who has cracked after endless lack of assistance in the cases he is investigating. After a struggle, Becky kills him with the nail gun and the survivors walk outside with the sound of approaching sirens.

Transit (2012 film)
  The film opens up with an armored truck coming across a car accident in the middle of a road. The driver finds this suspicious and prepares to drive off, but the truck is suddenly attacked by masked robbers. The driver tries to make a break for it, but his partner is revealed to be in on the heist. They execute the driver when an alarm in the truck goes off, and then his partner when he questions the lead robber's motives.  After the heist, local law enforcement have created road blocks in search of the robbers. The four robbers, Marek, his girlfriend Arielle, Losada, and [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] Evers know that they fit the profile of the robbers and so, to prevent themselves from being caught, hide the $4 million in a tent bag belonging to a family of four who are on a camping trip. They manage to hide the bag full of money in the family's camping gear on top of their Land Rover while the family uses restrooms at a small gas station.  Both the robbers and the family drive off and arrive at the road blockade. The robbers are immediately pulled over by the police and their vehicle is searched. As it is, the family passes through the blockade with no trouble. Aside from a police scanner belonging to Marek, the police are unable to find any incriminating evidence against them and let them go. The robbers catch up to the family in their black Chevelle. The father, Nate (Jim Caviezel) notices the Chevelle coming up behind him very fast. He tries to outrun the vehicle, but a police car detects his speed and pulls him over. The robbers manage to get away because Arielle detected the cruiser with the scanner. Nate tries to tell the officer the Chevelle was chasing him, but the patrolman insists because they were following him at great speed, it allowed them to get away with it.   Because of Louisiana state law, Nate is given a misdemeanor for reckless driving. Nate pleads with the officer not to give him the ticket because it will violate his parole, having spent the last 18 months in jail because of real estate fraud he committed. When he innocently begs the patrolman further, he is arrested and taken to the police station. Meanwhile, his wife Robyn (Elisabeth Rohm) and his two sons Shane (Sterling Knight) and Kenny (Jake Cherry) drive to a motel to spend the night while await Nate's release. Nate is put in a cell block for the night. Back at the motel, the robbers invade Robyn's motel room and attack her. She locks herself in the bathroom door, then escapes through the bathroom window. The robbers are forced to leave when they learn the police are on their way. Marek is frustrated they didn't find the money in Robyn's room and gets angered further when Evers revealed the family had two motel rooms, insisting the bag must have been in the other room.  The police arrive on scene, and bring Nate along once learning of the attack on his family. They decide to reduce the charges against Nate and give the family an escort out of town. Robyn and Shane demand to return home, but along with Kenny, Nate insists they need the trip in order to repair their relationship as a family and have family memories. The next morning, they leave the motel for the campgrounds. A police cruiser escorts them a few miles down the road before turning back and racing to another emergency. Meanwhile, the robbers spot the family Land Rover and head on after it. As they keep driving, one of the straps holding the camping gear comes loose and so the family pulls over to fix it. As Nate and Robyn unload the camping gear, he hands her the sleeping bag full of money. When she opens it, her face turns white. She tells the boys to get back into the car before lashing out at Nate. Robyn believes Nate actually stole the money from members of a laundering scheme that exposed his real-estate fraud and threw him in jail, and that they were the ones who attacked her at the motel, and insists the camping trip was nothing but a ruse for them to "start over". Nate is confused by her allegations and pleads with her he didn't do anything wrong. She throws the bag at Nate and drives off with the two boys, leaving him stranded. When he looks into the bag, he realizes that the money belongs to the robbers.  Shane and Kenny plead their mother to turn the car around to get Nate, but they are attacked by the robbers in their Chevelle. They drive them off the road and cause them to crash into a log. Marek demands to know where the money is, and Robyn tells him her husband has it. Marek and Arielle drive off with the family while Losada and Evers remain in the Chevelle in-tow. Meanwhile, Nate walks on-foot, first down the road and then through the swamp adjacent to it. He hears a motorboat pass by and shouts for help. The driver of the boat spots Nate for a split second, but continues on and doesn't stop. Nate hides the money in a tree trunk and returns to the road. As soon as he does, the Land Rover speeds pass him. He chases after it, but is too late to stop it. Suddenly, the Chevelle appears and Losada and Evers apprehend him. They take him captive and drive off after the others. Losada informs Marek they have Nate and the two cars intersect. Marek demands Nate to hand over the money, but Nate says he'll get it once his family is let go. Marek refuses to negotiate and holds Nate at gun point to show him where the money is hidden. They return to the spot with the tree trunk, where to his horror, Nate discovers the money is missing. He doesn't tell the robbers this and returns, stating once his family is set free he'll give them the money (he keeps eye contact with Losada while saying this). This angers Marek again, who says he's in charge and makes the rules, however this angers Losada who claims he should be in charge instead.  Nate manipulates the two into a brawl, which allows him to run off. Arielle sees this and tells him not to do anything stupid, unknowingly allowing Robyn and the boys to escape. She drives off, but Arielle clings onto the back of the Land Rover but the boys manage to knock her out. Nate runs up to the road and Robyn slows down the car to let him get in. They speed off, but turn around after Nate tells them the next town is 40 miles away and so they're better off returning to the town with the motel. The family manages to flag down the same patrolman that arrested Nate, but he doesn't believe their wild stories of anyone chasing them. Suddenly, he's hit by the robbers and the family flees again. Marek steals the cop car and tries to gun them down. As the Chevelle and cruiser try to box the Land Rover, Nate notices gas leaking from the tank of the cruiser. Nate swerves the Land Rover into the cruiser, which ignites the fuel, causing the cruiser to spin out of control and crash into a ditch. Evers and Losada retrieve Marek and several weapons from the cruiser. Marek tells a wounded Arielle "he won't lose to this man." Fed up with Arielle slowing them down, Losada and Evers turn on him who insist on killing her. Marek turns the tables and holds them at gunpoint, but surprises them when he shoots Arielle in the back of the head.   Meanwhile, the family tries to escape by boat but Nate uses it to distract the robbers' attention so that they can escape. Unfortunately, this backfires as the robbers take the boat to track the family down. Robyn, Kenny and Shane come across the small headquarters of Gator Trax, the owner of the boat, located in a  cabin in the swamps. They find the bag of money locked inside, and a [[cb radio]]  and manage to contact someone for help, who says the police will be there in 30 minutes. Shane says that's not enough time. Nate hides in the bushes as Marek searches for the family. A snake however causes Nate to be spotted and forces him to run, however Marek shoots him down, demanding him to reveal the location of the money, and then his family. Meanwhile, Robyn, Shane and Kenny find the money and several loaded guns inside a locked up closet in the cabin, finally proving their father's innocence. Suddenly, they spot Evers and Losada outside. Robyn hides the kids in the closet and shoots Losada just as he breaks down the door. Evers retrieves him and a gunfight breaks out. When the firing stops, Shane sets fire to several portions of the money and throws them out the window, threatening to burn all of it if they don't let them go. Marek and Nate arrive. Marek threatens to execute Nate if they don't bring out the money. When Shane brings it out, Losada refuses to give him back his dad and is about to shoot him, however he is shot again and killed by Robyn. Shane flees back into the house with the money. Marek and Evers try to level the cabin by firing bullets at it. This allows Nate to grab Losada's gun and shoot Marek in the shoulder. He quickly grabs his machine gun and fires at Evers, whose last words to Nate are "watch your back". Nate turns around and sees Marek swing a machete at him, wounding his chest. Nate seemingly falls into the swamp as Marek takes several swings at him. Marek then enters the cabin and attacks Shane, but Robyn threatens to burn the money. Marek says she has nowhere to run, but she burns the money anyway. Marek knocks her out cold.  Nate appears and tackles Marek, and the two engage in a brutal fight. The two of them try to choke each other, however Nate slams Marek's head into a nail on a wooden deck outside the cabin, finally killing him. Robyn, Shane and Kenny mend to him, and the four of them reconcile. In the last scene, a revving car engine is heard as well as the application of brakes. A shot of Nate's wedding ring lies covered in blood on the road (Losada chopped Nate's ring finger when he found him on the side of the road) and a hand, presumably Nate's, picks it up before the screen goes black.

Thomas connects to two halves together and puts them in the hole, causing the tip of the [[obelisk]] to rotate facing the moon and the light of the moon to light the way. Babi tells the Buddies that they are heading to the [[oasis]]. In the morning, Babi rips off a hose from their truck to delay Phillip from heading there first. As they leave, Cammy spits digested food or "gnarly loogey" as B-Dawg calls it, at the camel dealer and they start leaving for the oasis. Babi hitches a ride on the truck to the desert.   At the oasis, Thomas tells the story of Cleocatra, the cat god [[Bastet]] gave a special [[necklace]] called "The Cat's Eye Necklace" to [[Cleopatra]] the ruler of [[Egypt]]. Her cat Cleocatra was angry that Bastet gave the necklace to a human, so she decided to steal the necklace. A puppy named Buddasi saw Cleocatra, so he informed Cleopatra what was going on. Cleopatra was so triggered and enraged at her trusted cat, so she decided to use the necklace to make dogs man's best friend, and cats were banished from the palace. Pete thanks Thomas for bringing him on the adventure. Meanwhile, they realized that fate sent them on the adventure and journeys have deeper meanings as they go to sleep. In the morning, Farah surprises Pete by hiding behind a well, and Amir asks Pete if Thomas knows him well. He says that he met him a few days ago and Amir tells Pete to tell Thomas that he should not be trusted.   In the morning, they start looking for clues. They brush off sand revealing the Cat's Eye symbol. Babi spies on them opening the door into the well. Inside, they wipe off a symbol of [[royal family|royalty]] and the menet. Meanwhile, Babi pokes a hole in their tire with a [[knife]] to delay them more. Ubasti catches Babi and he runs away. The Bedouins start leaving the oasis. Budderball starts [[hallucinating]] from dehydration that a picnic is there and starts rolling on the sand. B-Dawg says "That's what I call a sand-wich!" and asks for a [[rimshot]] but there's no rimshot. Budderball spots an oasis and start heading there for water. They find the stairway entrance to the well and start splashing around. As they come out, coconuts start falling on them, they realize Babi is shaking the tree and they are glad to see him. Mudbud asks where Thomas and Pete are located and says they are on the way to the oasis. Phillip's car suddenly stops and he blames Seti and Tarik on the flat tire. Meanwhile the Buddies make it to the Bedouins and Cammy is reunited with her mother. At night they watch the tribe dance and eat a feast.   At night Pete overhears Phillip talking about getting rid of Thomas and Pete so that the treasure will be theirs. Remembering what Amir said about Phillip, he races to the tent and wakes up Thomas and tells him about Phillip. Phillip comes into the tent saying that Thomas will do whatever he says and Thomas says that he is done helping him. In the morning, the tribe makes a [[hot air balloon]] in order so they can find Thomas and Pete. Pete spots the balloon but Thomas keeps Phillip from discovering by saying that there are no [[baboons]] in the desert. The Buddies and Babi attempt to land in the desert and land on a sand dune, falling in fast motion into the sand. They enter the temple and make it in time to escape a sandstorm. They meet a [[cobra]] named Slither, who was put here to protect the tomb. If Slither hypnotizes Buddha, they become his supper, if Buddha hypnotizes Slither, he is considered a descendant of Buddasi and can pass to the tomb. Buddha wins and Slither lights the way to the tomb.  Phillip, Thomas, Pete, Seti, and Tarik make it to the tomb while the Buddies and Babi are inside the tomb facing booby traps and various stuff including a giant game of [[senet]] and a quicksand trap. Ubasti finds out that the Buddies are already there and chases after them. B-Dawg is saved from the pit of snakes at the giant game of senet but Seti is eaten by the snakes in the pit. The Buddies make it into the tomb, B-Dawg starts wearing the Cat's Eye Necklace and starts acting like a cat. The statues start to come to life and Ubasti commands the cats to chase the Buddies. Two of the cats fall into the pit of snakes and another two Budderball traps in the [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]] chamber. The last group of cats are eaten by Slither.  Phillip, Thomas, and Pete make it to the tomb chamber and Ubasti scratches Phillip's face because she didn't want Phillip to take it. She starts wearing the Cat's Eye Necklace, and becomes ruler of the cats only to be turned into stone by the tomb because of a [[curse]] that any cat that wanted power would gain everlasting life in the form of a statue. A door opens with riches inside and Phillip is wowed by it and wants to steal it. Phillip then challenges Thomas to a fierce duel. Phillip is about to win when Pete knocks him out with a [[shield]]. Phillip regains conscience and escapes with the Cat's Eye Necklace and is chased by the Buddies. Babi gets on Phillip's head and bangs it multiple times, making Phillip drop the Cat's Eye Necklace. Cammy spits at Phillip's face and is captured by the Bedouins, tied to a camel and (per request) is placed under the custody of the [[British embassy]]. At a dance in Bastati, Amir congratulates Thomas and Pete for helping to find the Cat's Eye Necklace while Farah shows Pete some of the moves the dancers make. At the museum opening, Thomas and Peter are declared national heroes along with the Buddies, and Amir and Farah clap for them at the grand opening. The collar is put on permanent display in the museum in Fernfield. Babi's grandson believes him to have exaggerated the story but Babi smiles and takes out Cleocatra's collar from a mummy coffin behind him, revealing he stole it from the Fernfield museum.

As Gus, Mickey and a group of other scouts watch Bo play, Gus and Mickey realize he can't hit a [[curveball]]. Gus advises Johnny to pass on Bo in the draft, and Johnny takes his advice. However, when Gus calls Pete and the Braves' management with the same advice, Philip disagrees based on [[sabermetrics|statistical analysis]] and stakes his career on his opinion, leading Braves general manager Vince (Patrick) to draft Bo against Gus's advice. When Johnny learns of the move, he believes that Gus and Mickey double-crossed him to allow the Braves to draft Bo instead and angrily leaves.  Gus abandons Mickey at the hotel. She hears a pitcher throwing outside her room, and realizes he is talented just from the sound. She approaches the young man, Rigoberto, and volunteers to catch for him. After seeing him throw a few curveballs, she calls Pete, who reluctantly agrees to have him tryout in Atlanta.  Gus returns to the Braves' office where Vince and Philip criticize him for his evaluation of Bo. Pete interrupts to let them know that Mickey has brought Rigo to the field. As Bo practices batting, Philip mocks Gus and Mickey for bringing in Rigo, an unknown. Mickey insists, however, and Pete allows Rigo to pitch. Rigo throws several [[fastball]]s, which Bo repeatedly misses. Mickey calls for Rigo to throw a curve and again Bo cannot connect with the ball, and the staff realize they were wrong about both Bo and Gus.  The management resume their meeting, intent on signing Rigo. Gus suggests Mickey could be Rigo's [[sports agent]], due to her legal background and knowledge of the game. When Philip makes another snide remark towards Gus, Vince fires him and offers Gus a contract extension. Mickey then gets a partnership offer from her firm. Outside the stadium, Mickey and Gus find Johnny waiting. Mickey approaches him and they kiss while Gus lights a cigar and walks away.

But soon the officer Lt. Cavallaro manages to trick him and send him to prison along with his entire gang, including the funny Pino "The Stranger" (as for the inhabitants of Calabria citizens of [[Apulia]] appear as non-EU citizens). In [[Veneto]] in [[Northern Italy]], the manufacturer Rodolfo "Olfo" Favaretto (Albanese) dreams for years to unify the Italian regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardia]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Veneto]] with a long highway to [[Austria]].

Only one thing the Secretary recommended to the three; swear allegiance and never betray him. Their ineptitude, their meanness of character and habits, and particularly their ideals will only create trouble for the government buildings. In fact, the Secretary has made a mistake because he chose not professional "Art of Swindle" and fend for themselves, but of the provincial administrators who think only to their directives. Cetto La Qualunque does not appear even once to the House to vote in Parliament and has not abandoned the sake of having sex with beautiful girls, but a haunting happens to him when he has a brief affair with a transexual.

Inside they find several targets (none of which are seen) and receive the kill-order. A series of gunshots rings out, accompanied by a series of screams. Moments later a young woman named Dana stumbles out of the house with blood on her hands, and gazes up at the sky in disbelief.  Two days earlier, Dana and her friends engage in a night of heavy drinking, fighting, and carousing at a club: Michael, a lieutenant in the [[Special Air Service|SAS,]] his best friend and warbuddy Robin, and Vincent. Robin proposes to Dana and she immediately accepts, while Michael hooks up with a beautiful American girl named Carrie. Vincent, however, acts very indecent towards a clubber and gets thrown out, along with Michael when he defends him. A fight ensues between Michael and the bouncers, with Robin and Dana joining in. Eventually the group heads back to Robin's house where Michael and Carrie have sex while Dana and Robin celebrate their engagement in a similar manner.  Hung-over, they drunkenly stumble out of Robin's house, and discover that nobody on their street has mobile phone service or power.  They are confronted by an apparently deranged tramp who insists that they are in danger from people with a purple mark.  When a city-sized spaceship hovers over [[Derby]], the city panics and society begins to break down.  Michael, attempts to lead his friends to safety. They make their way to a store where their friend Pete works, but it is closed.  The group rescues an immigrant from angry thugs, and Pete allows the group in through the side entrance.  However, a riot breaks out when the crowd sees them gathering supplies, and looters attempt to steal their groceries.  Michael frightens off the looters with a pistol, and the friends head back to Robin's house.  Michael and Carrie go out to get fuel and ammunition for Michael's handgun, and they run into John, a gas station attendant who believes that the aliens will attack.  Carrie suggests that the aliens are explorers, but John says that there will be no lasting peace, because even if the aliens don't attack first, the human governments will panic and attack the aliens, inciting them to respond in kind.  Back in the car, Carrie tells Michael that she is in England to learn about its culture and people, and they are involved in a car accident.  Carrie frantically tries to save a survivor, but Michael administers a [[mercy killing]] when it becomes clear that will not make it.  As Michael tries to drag Carrie away, she insists that there's a girl (seen earlier at the Market Square) still alive in the car.  They rescue the girl, and the car explodes behind them.  When they attempt to get supplies to bandage the injured girl, a policeman stops them, having locked up the place, but agrees to let them in when the girl identifies him as a "man with a purple mark". Once inside however, the policeman suddenly attempts to kill the girl.  Michael engages in a long battle with him, only for the latter to overwhelm with superior  fighting skills. Carrie saves Michael from being strangled by stabbing the policeman with a shard of glass, causing him to choke on his blood and suffocate.  Carrie is left disgusted at Michael, and viewing him as cold-blooded killer, but Michael counters that it was "him or us".  Aliens target Robin's house, and he, Dana, and Vincent barely evade alien patrol ships.  Robin and Vincent go out to steal a car, and Dana is left alone in the house, where she is apparently stalked by a spotter ship.  She is saved by soldiers Kenny and Sam who shoot the ship down with a rocket launcher. The group reunites and heads off to George's house when the deranged tramp appears and confronts them with a pistol and says that they are protecting the Devil.  Michael tries to reason with him, but the soldiers shoot the tramp dead as the tramp accidentally kills Robin.  The group drives to George's house, where they become convinced that alien infiltrators are hiding among humans, identifiable via a purple mark. The group learns from the girl that the policeman they encountered earlier was one of them and had tried to kill the girl because she knew too much. George reveals that he has monitoring the situation with a special transmitter, supposedly alien in origin, and states that no one would know if it was happening. He concludes that they should only trust people that they know. The group turns on Carrie, for whom none of them can vouch and because the tramp had been pointing his gun at her.  Michael convinces the others to allow him to privately inspect Carrie for a purple mark. As they enter the room, Michael confesses that he was [[Military discharge#Types of discharge|dishonourably discharged]], something he had neglected to tell anyone, even his friends. He states that he doesn't want to believe she is an alien but that he needs her to prove it, when Carrie abruptly shoots him dead with his own gun. Carrie fights off Sam, Kenny, and George who arrive to stop her, displaying the same combat skills that Michael had used earlier and survives a point blank shot from George's shotgun. She then takes Dana hostage and escapes outside George's house. Kenny follows her into a barn and shoots her just as she is teleported aboard a ship.  George attempts to mollify the aliens by offering alien technology that he owns, but they disintegrate him.  Kenny and Sam attack the UFO with automatic rifles, but their weapons seem to have no effect.  As they wait to be disintegrated, another UFO attacks and destroys that one.  The sky fills with two different kinds of UFOs, which attack each other.  Sam is killed in the crossfire, and the others retreat back to George's house.  On his television, they see a newsreader in the form of Carrie announce that humanity has won the war and people should return to their homes.  Vincent attempts to rape Dana, and Kenny savagely beats him and threatens to kill him.  Before he can, an alien infiltration team led by a duplicate of the policeman breaks in and reports that there is a young girl there who can identify them. A series of flashbacks reveals there were several other copies of him who have followed the group and were presumably used as infiltrators. In the last scene, the infiltration team receives a go-ahead to kill everyone in the house, and their screams are heard over the radio. In the depths of [[Outer space|outer-space]], the battle between the two alien factions rages on, as the mothership begins to descend.  
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2
   [[Bella Swan|Bella]], who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation and is introduced to her daughter [[List of Twilight characters#Renesmee Cullen|Renesmee]]. The rest of the Cullens and Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has imprinted on her, making her furious until Jacob explains what imprinting is. Meanwhile, Bella's father, [[List of Twilight characters#Charlie Swan|Charlie]], has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle comes to believe that they have to leave [[Forks, Washington]] to protect their identities - especially because of Charlie. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tell him that Bella is alive and well, but had to change in order to get better. Jacob also tells Charlie he doesn't live in the world he thinks he lives in, but says nothing about vampires. He then phases into his wolf form.  Charlie then visits the Cullen house and meets Renesmee, but doesn't know he's her biological grandfather. Afterward, the Cullens are able to stay in Forks.  Several months pass with [[List of Twilight characters#Carlisle Cullen|Carlisle]] monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter [[List of Twilight characters#Denali coven|Irina]] sees Renesmee from a distance and assumes she's an [[Immortality|immortal]] child without asking any questions. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and because they could not be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were the parents who created them, and the creation of such children outlawed. Irina goes to the [[Volturi]] to report what she has seen. Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denali, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward's mind reading even when she was human, and which she can now extend to protect others from attacks.  As some of their potential witnesses are attacked and prevented from supporting the Cullens, Carlisle and Edward realize they may have to fight the Volturi. Their witnesses ultimately agree to stand with them in battle, having realized the Volturi increased their Guard by falsely accusing covens of crimes, destroying them and then recruiting the vampires with gifts. The Volturi arrive prepared for battle, led by [[List of Twilight characters#The Volturi|Aro]], who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven as part of his Guard. Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee, and is convinced that she is not an immortal child. Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake, leading to her immediate death. Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future, validating his claim that battle is necessary. Before any violence, Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come, during which both sides sustain heavy casualties, including Aro, who would also die. Aro believes her, giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness, Nahuel (a half-mortal half-vampire just like Renesmee). The witness proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not a threat. The Volturi unhappily walk away, explaining that there will be no battle today.  Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella together with Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee also together. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in the meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment she and Edward shared together and the two share a kiss after Bella telling Edward, "Nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you", and both Edward and Bella say they'll love and be together forever. The end credits present the cast members from all five films.

Two Lives (film)
 It is based on the novel ''Ice Ages,'' by German author . She was inspired by reports in the late 1980s of the discovery of the half-burned body of a young woman near [[Bergen]], and there was speculation as to her identity. This was just before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and reunification of Germany.   The film gradually unravels the story of Katrine Evensen Myrdal ([[Juliane Kohler|Kohler]]), a happily married woman with a grown daughter and granddaughter, and of her mother Åse Evensen ([[Liv Ullmann|Ullmann]]). Katrine is known to have escaped from East Germany and made her way to Norway as a young woman to be reunited with her birth mother, Åse Evensen.  The film explores the cases of [[Lebensborn]] or [[war children]], born from unions between German soldiers and Norwegian women, who were taken away after birth to be raised in Germany. Some were adopted by German families; others raised in orphanages. Both societies had shunned the Lebensborn children and their mothers after the war; in Norway, women known to have had relationships with Germans during the Occupation were sometimes incarcerated in work camps. In East Germany, some war children were recruited by the [[Stasi]] as agents. Given false identities, they "escaped" to Norway as adults to be reunited with their birth mothers, claiming places of war children and serving as spies. Reportedly there are still such Lebensborn agents in Norway who have not been discovered.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2014/02/27/282092605/a-legacy-of-war-hitting-home-decades-later-in-norway Ella Taylor, "A Legacy Of War, Hitting Home Decades Later In Norway"], NPR, 27 February 2014, accessed 10 July 2014</ref>

Underworld: Awakening
 A few years after the events of [[Underworld: Evolution|the second film]], both the government and the general public have become aware of the existence of the Vampires and Lycans. A program to study and potentially harness their powers soon escalates into an all-out genocide and shortly after the "Purge" begins, Selene and Michael are captured by humans. Due to her enhanced vampiric traits, Selene is imprisoned in [[cryogenic suspension]].  After being frozen for twelve years, during which both species have been hunted to the brink of extinction, Selene manages to escape. She soon learns that another subject, whom she initially believes to be Michael, has also escaped. While making her way through the high-tech facility, Selene has visions from someone else's point of view. Believing that Michael is mentally guiding her, she follows these visions, leading her down a garbage chute into a labyrinthine series of basement tunnels. Here she encounters a young vampire named David, who has been tracking her. They quickly realize that the tunnels are infested with Lycans, who are hunting the subject Selene is connected with. Determined to reach Michael, Selene fights her way through the Lycan pack until she reaches the second escapee: not Michael, but a frightened and confused young girl named Eve.  Using David's van, Selene, David and Eve make their way out of the facility, only to be attacked once again by a trio of Lycans. David stabs a Lycan while Selene shoots another; the third smashes its way into the rear of the vehicle, where it bites Eve's shoulder. This triggers Eve's partial transformation, revealing her hybrid traits, as she savagely rips the creature's head in half. Selene realizes that Eve is her and Michael's daughter. Eve reveals that during her own escape from the facility, she found Selene's cryogenic tank and deactivated it, which was what allowed Selene to escape. However, despite her hybrid nature it becomes apparent that Eve's bite wound is not healing and she is rapidly growing weaker, resulting in David agreeing to take the pair to his coven.  After reluctantly drinking some blood, Eve's wound heals, but as they do not feel welcome in the coven, Selene gets ready to leave. David tries to convince her to stay and help them start an offensive against the humans by training some [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealers]], but before she makes up her mind, the coven comes under attack by Lycans. Selene joins the fight and kills many Lycans before being knocked unconscious by a "Super-Lycan" that heals instantly and is not affected by silver. When she awakens later she finds that Thomas, David's father, has surrendered Eve to the Lycans in return for them leaving. David had been mortally wounded in the battle, but Selene revives him with her blood. After leaving, Selene confronts a human detective named Sebastian, who is sympathetic to the vampires due to his now dead wife being a vampire. Sebastian confirms that the Lycans have been traced to Antigen, the corporation dedicated to killing off the immortal species. It is also revealed that Antigen runs the facility from which Selene had earlier escaped.  Selene discovers that Antigen is actually run by Lycans, who have been posing as humans in order to trick the world's governments into believing the Lycans are extinct. The director of Antigen, Dr. Jacob Lane, is trying to perfect the Lycan race and wants Eve's DNA to do so. The "Super-Lycan" Selene faced earlier is identified as Quint – Lane's son and the prototype for Lycan modifications. Selene and Sebastian infiltrate Antigen to stop Lane's plan and save Eve. Selene comes across Subject 0, whom she identifies as Michael and attempts to free him by shooting his cryogenic tank. However, she is forced to leave the thawing Michael in order to stop the Lycans from escaping with Eve. David, who had inherited Selene's immunity to sunlight, arrives and helps Sebastian kill several Lycan henchmen. After confronting Lane and his son, Selene fights Lane's son and after tricking him into returning to his more vulnerable human form by hiding in a narrow tunnel, kills him by implanting a silver grenade in his stomach, while Eve kills Lane by ripping out his throat. As the police arrive, Sebastian urges the vampires to flee and distracts the officers. Selene, Eve, and David return to Michael's tank and find it empty with the ice shattered. Selene states that the world will be hunting Michael and the trio vow to find him first.  
Ultraman Saga
   The film opens with a powerful apocalyptic vision of Tokyo, buildings destroyed and the city seemingly devoid of life. We are soon introduced to the Earth Defense Force (EDF), Team U (played by members of the female idol group [[AKB48]]), who go on a shopping raid in a desolate store in the city. During their raid, Team U is attacked by the monster, [[Earthtron]]. Despite their setup traps and weapons assisting them, they are no match for the monster. As the monster rampages, [[Ultraman Dyna]] appears and quickly destroys Earthtron.  Meanwhile, in the alternate universe in which [[Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial|he defeated Ultraman Belial]], [[Ultraman Zero]] receives a distress call from an unknown voice as he is battling a hoard of Legionoids and proceeds into the multiverse after making quick work of the robots. Upon arriving to the universe where he received the distress signal, he goes towards the Earth in aid, which is revealed to be the same universe in while  [[Ultraman Dyna]] took place. Shortly before Zero departs, the hosts and Human forms of Ultraman, Seven, Jack, Ace and Leo comment on something unusual taking place in the multiverse, referring to the universe in which Zero is headed for.  Taking place 15 years after Shin Asuka (Ultraman Dyna) disappeared through a black hole at the series's ending, Earth has since then set up a space station on Mars in Asuka's honor and memory. The space station is then attacked by a few Granspheres, only for the invaders to quickly be fended off by a young defense team pilot named Taiga. Shortly after recklessly pursuing the Granspheres, Taiga is trapped (along with a few other Granspheres) inside of a Fortress-like Ship of an invading alien force, that quickly disappears.  Taiga soon finds himself in the apocalyptic version of Tokyo, as Ultraman Zero battles the fleet of spaceships that were released by the Fortress. As Taiga notices a crashing ship heading straight towards a young boy, he pilots his ship directly into its path in an act of self-sacrifice. Witnessing his brave actions, Ultraman Zero rescues Taiga and joins with him. Once Taiga reawakens, he discovers that Ultraman Zero saved him and is not happy to be joined with the Ultra. Trying to dismiss and expel the Ultra from his body, Taiga and the boy are attacked by another monster named [[List of Ultraman monsters#Gubira|Gubira]]. As Taiga tries to keep the boy and himself from getting harmed, Gubira is confronted by another Ultraman, [[Ultraman Cosmos]]. After a relatively short fight, Cosmos manages to calm down Gubira and the monster leaves the deserted city peacefully.  Shortly after encountering Ultraman Cosmos's human host, Musashi Haruno, both Ultras and the boy named ''Takeru'' are picked by Team U and taken to their base, which is revealed to be a warehouse full of children. Taiga and Musashi learn that Team U and the children are the last survivors on planet Earth after the world was invaded by an evil alien known as [[List of Return of Ultraman monsters#Alien Bat|Alien Bat]], who was revealed to have abducted all life on Earth, including nearly the entire human population. Shortly after the introductions, Alien Bat reveals himself to the survivors and unleashed Gubira and the monster, [[Gomess]] to attack them. With the help of Ultraman Cosmos and Ultraman Zero (the latter being only 5 meters tall due to Taiga's stubborn participation), the monsters are turned gentle once again, only to be murdered in cold blood by Alien Bat for failing him. Alien Bat then announces to the survivors that they will all be killed by his greatest weapon: [[Zetton#Ultraman Saga|Zetton]].  As Taiga and Musashi bond with Team U and the children, it is revealed that the reason for Taiga's general dislike towards Ultraman is due to his parents being killed by accident during one of Ultraman Dyna's fights against a monster, thus forcing him to live a very lonely lifestyle growing up. It is also revealed by Team U that Ultraman Dyna and his human host Asuka had once stayed with the team and protected them, but was lost in battle against Alien Bat's Zetton. The next day Alien Bat reveals his customized Zetton and what remains of Ultraman Dyna, who has been turned to stone. With his creation complete, Alien Bat unleashes Zetton onto Team U and the survivors, destroying their shelter and leaving them all in despair. In their depression, Team U is exposed as being frauds, not associated with Earth's Defense Force but instead are a group of amateur mechanics who took it upon themselves to protect the surviving children by lying to them. Touched by Team U's bravery, and now realizing the seriousness of the situation this Earth is in, Taiga sets aside his differences with Ultraman and transforms into Ultraman Zero, where he and Cosmos head off to destroy Zetton.  Arriving at the Zetton's birthplace, Zero and Cosmos manage to hold off against the monster, but Alien Bat's Zetton is too big in size and strength for the combined Ultras to stop him. During the crossfire Cosmos is knocked out of commission, leaving Zero to face the Zetton by himself. With the Ultra fighting Zetton, Team U and Takeru arrive to help him when Takeru digs up the object that can revive Ultraman Dyna, Dyna's Reflasher. Despite some interference by Zetton, the Reflasher reunites with the statue of Dyna and Ultraman Dyna is revived to assist Zero and Cosmos, (whom had been revived by Dyna and Zero) in destroying Alien Bat's Zetton. However just as it seems the Zetton has been defeated, Alien Bat merges both his fortress and himself with the remains of the Zetton to reveal his creation's true form: ''Hyper Zetton''.  Now with enhanced speed and power, Hyper Zetton easily defeats the three Ultras, leaving the group of heroes hopeless in stopping the crazed alien and his weapon. Unwilling to give up their home and the lives of their friends, Taiga, Musashi, and Asuka merge to form a new Ultraman known as "''Ultraman Saga''". Ultraman Saga confronts Hyper Zetton, but both Ultra and Monster's abilities are evenly matched with both combatants unable to best each other. Motivated by the Ultra, Team U assists Saga when the battle is taken to the deserted city. Leading Hyper Zetton to a trap that was set for Earthtron, Ultraman Saga takes advantage of the distraction by slicing off Hyper Zetton's wings, the source of Hyper Zetton's abilities. With Hyper Zetton crippled, Ultraman Saga takes the monster into the Earth's Atmosphere and finally destroys it and Alien Bat with an energy-powered punch.  With Alien Bat and his Zetton destroyed, all those abducted by the alien return to Earth to live their lives in peace. The children reunite with their parents, Musashi returns to his home planet on Juran, Asuka returns to his home dimension briefly to inform his old teammates on Taiga's status and says that he will wait for them catch up to him before resuming his journey through space, and Taiga remain on Earth to live with Team U. Feeling confident that Taiga is ready to protect the Earth with Team U, Ultraman Zero separates from him and returns to his own universe.

Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning
  John awakens from a coma to find that his wife and daughter were brutally murdered in a [[home invasion]]. With the help of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Gorman, the still [[amnesia]]c John identifies the perpetrator as former Universal Soldier (UniSol) [[Luc Deveraux]], now a wanted man. Gorman activates [[sleeper agent]] Magnus, one of the cloned Next Generation UniSols from ''Regeneration''. Magnus reaches a brothel and kills all the women working there and most of the patrons, all men with exceptional physical resistance. His last adversary, a clone of UniSol Andrew Scott and Deveraux's former nemesis, incapacitates Magnus and injects him with a serum that frees him from government control. Magnus is introduced to a separatist group led by Deveraux and Scott, who are taking in wayward UniSols to turn them against the U.S. government, thus establishing a new order ruled by UniSols.  Determined to find Deveraux, John receives a call from someone claiming to be his friend Isaac, urging the two to meet. At his house, he finds Isaac long dead and evidence of Isaac's involvement with the UniSol government program. A matchbox found on the scene leads John to a strip club, where he is recognized by a stripper named Sarah, whom he cannot remember. Magnus injects John with Scott's serum, whereupon John hallucinates about Deveraux but retains his will. John follows Sarah to her apartment, where they are attacked by Magnus again. Though in the confrontation John loses some [[phalanx bone|phalanges]], they escape. Sarah tells John she remembers him working as a truck driver, living in a riverside cabin, and that the two were romantically involved.  Calling his own memories into question, John requests a meeting with Agent Gorman. He learns Deveraux was often seen at the docks from where John used to take shipments. John goes to the docks, inspects the last unshipped cargo and meets with local manager Ron Castellano, who plays hidden camera footage that shows John brutally murder Isaac.  As John and Sarah drive towards the cabin, they are once more intercepted by Magnus. Upon finally eliminating Magnus, John realizes he possesses superior strength, resistance and fighting abilities; his severed fingers have regrown in the meantime. John and Sarah reach the cabin to find it inhabited by an exact duplicate of John, who reveals himself as the original who had killed Isaac and been in contact with Sarah and Castellano in the past. The original John had been mind-controlled into hunting down Deveraux, but was turned by him and hired as a transporter and assassin for his organization, until he met Sarah and deserted Deveraux. He tries to kill Sarah but is shot dead by the other John, now suspecting himself to be a UniSol [[sleeper agent]].  By the river, a rogue UniSol takes John to the separatists' underground headquarters. There, he is greeted by Dr. Su, a former scientist of the UniSol program, who reveals John had been synthetically created a few weeks earlier, therefore his family never existed. Dr. Su also says the missing shipment contains the hardware that will allow Deveraux to create clones. John accepts Su's offer to surgically sever his emotional bond with the fake memories of his family, but the pain and attachment to those memories drive John insane. He kills every UniSol in his path, culminating with Andrew Scott in a one-on-one confrontation. John then reaches Deveraux himself; in the ensuing fight, Deveraux eventually gains the upper hand. Realizing the cycle of sending clones of John against him is destined to repeat, and seeing John as a worthy successor, Deveraux allows John to kill him.  Later, John meets with Agent Gorman again. Gorman admits to his involvement with the UniSol program and that he had purposefully put an unaware John on Deveraux's trail. Gorman ascribes John's success to his familial attachment, as opposed to the patriotism implanted in his predecessors. John kills Gorman, then a clone of Gorman and three UniSols emerge from John's van. The clone leaves in Gorman's car, hinting that John has acquired the cloning equipment and taken over the separatist group, now determined to infiltrate the government which he holds responsible for his pain.

Upside Down (2012 film)
 The film starts with Adam telling the story of his two-planet home world, unique from other planets or planetary systems as it is the only one that has "dual gravity". This phenomenon of dual gravity allows the two planets to orbit each other in what would otherwise be impossibly close proximity. There are three immutable laws of gravity for this two-planet system:  # All matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other. # An object's weight can be offset using matter from the opposite world (inverse matter). # After a few hours of contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns.  The societies of the two worlds are segregated by law. While the upper world (Up Top) is rich and prosperous, the lower (Down Below) is poor. Up Top buys cheap oil from Down Below and sells electricity back to Down Below at higher prices. A person from Down Below going Up Top (or having contact with anyone from Up Top) is strictly forbidden and can be punishable by incarceration or death. People from Up Top regularly visit Down Below to experience novelties like dancing on ceilings. The only physical connection linking the two worlds is the headquarters of the "TransWorld" company.  Adam lives in an orphanage in Down, having lost his parents in an oil refinery explosion. The only living relative he has is his great-aunt, whom he visits every week. His great-aunt has a secret recipe for flying pancakes using pollen from pink bees which gather pollen from both worlds. The recipe has passed through generations and will be inherited by Adam.  As a child, Adam secretly climbs a mountain that gets very close to Up. There he meets Eden, a girl from Up. Years later in their teens, they are in a relationship. They meet on the mountains and Adam uses a rope to pull Eden towards Down, and they head to the woods for a stroll. They are later discovered, and while Adam frantically releases Eden back to her world, he catches a bullet in his arm and drops her. Helpless, he watches Eden lying motionless on the ground as blood oozes from her head. When he returns home, his aunt Becky is arrested and her home is put to the torch.  Ten years later, Adam is now working on creating an anti-gravity product using his great-aunt's recipe. The recipe allows matter to feel both gravitational fields at once. Adam is developing it as a cosmetic product for [[face-lift]]s. Then he sees Eden on TV and learns she is alive and works at TransWorld. He finally works out his formula and gets hired by TransWorld to develop the face-lift cream. Adam's plan is to find Eden in TransWorld. In his office he meets Bob, a TransWorld employee from Up who becomes his friend after he helps him [[Stamp collecting|obtain rare stamps]] from Down. Bob offers to help him contact Eden.  With the help of Bob, Adam meets Eden by putting Up-material in his clothes to disguise himself as a worker from Up, using Bob's name as his own. But Eden doesn't recognize him because of [[amnesia]] from the accident as a teen. The Up-material in Adam's clothes starts to burn so he has to return to Down. Later on, Bob is fired but as he leaves, he secretly gives Adam his ID to help him exit the TransWorld building and into Up. Later, by calling Eden through Bob's phone, Adam manages to get a date.  Meanwhile, his cosmetic cream becomes of great importance to the company. While Adam is doing a presentation of the cream, Eden enters the lecture hall and discovers his true identity. After she flees the auditorium Adam runs to find her but Bob's ID, having been terminated, lands him in trouble. He escapes to Bob's house. He shows him that mixing liquids from both gravity fields can make a hybrid solution that resists both gravitational fields and simply floats between the two. Adam then reveals that he didn't give TransWorld the main secret ingredient of his compound, leaving the company unable to manufacture the product without him.  With Bob's help, he goes back to the restaurant where he met with Eden before and finds out she has begun to recover old memories of him. But the police arrive and he has to run. Upon returning to his planet he goes to the mountain top where he met Eden. Eden comes to find him and they meet again as they did long ago. But police are on their trail and, as they fail to escape, Eden is arrested while Adam falls the remaining distance between worlds. But he survives because of a vest containing inverse matter which he still had strapped to his torso. TransWorld agrees to drop the charges against Eden if Adam gives them his formula and never contacts Eden again.  Now Adam has gone back to his old life, believing he will never see Eden again. But Eden, not so easily dissuaded, goes to Bob for help. Bob finds Adam and surprises him by showing he can stay Down without the help of the opposite-matter accoutrements; Bob has been able to use Adam's methods to create a way to negate the effect of gravity. Bob tells him he had purchased the [[patent]] of his beauty cream before TransWorld attempted to do so. He finishes by informing him that Adam also has a "date" with someone.  The film ends with Eden revealing she has become pregnant with twins, and the camera zooms far out to reveal towering skyscrapers on both sides, showing that both sides have become prosperous, as well as children from both sides interacting by playing basketball.

Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara?
 The story of the film revolves around a palace known as ‘Gandharva Mahal’ which belongs to Rayudu ([[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]]), the present head of a royal family that has lost its former splendor. Rayudu lives with his wife (Meena Kumari) and two daughters Visalakshi ([[Madhumitha]]) and Jagadha ([[Deeksha Seth]]) in a small house beside the Mahal. Rayudu rents out the palace to make ends meet. He is shown as a soft and generous man. Some of the tenants take this generosity for granted and harass Rayudu, without paying the rent.  Into this scenario comes Manoj ([[Manoj Manchu]]), as someone seeking a place to rent. He slowly gets rid of the problematic elements in the palace and restores control to Rayudu. Manoj falls in love with Jagadha. A happy Rayudu decides to get Visalakshi married and decides to give away the Gandharva Mahal as dowry. One night, Manoj comes to Rayudu with a bloodied nose and claims that he saw a ghost which tried to kill him and warned him about selling the Mahal. Rayudu reveals that the ghost might be his dead father, Rudramaneni Narsimha Rayudu ([[Nandamuri Balakrishna]]) and explains the history of Gandharva Mahal to Manoj.  Gandhrva Mahal has been with the Rudramaneni family for centuries and was passed on to Narasimha Rayudu ([[Nandamuri Balakrishna]]), a [[Zamindar]] who is well respected in the village. He lives with his wife ([[Panchi Bora]]) and sister Jagadamba ([[Simer Motiani]]). He marries his sister Jagadamba to Phanindra Bhoopati ([[Sonu Sood]]). Few days after the marriage, Bhoopati insults Narsimha Rayudu and asks him to give their share in the family property. Deeply hurt by the incident, Narsimha Rayudu gives half of everything he owns including the Gandharva Mahal to his sister and walks out of the house. He also gives hundred acres of land to Seshayya ([[Bhanu Chander]]), his trusted employee and friend. It is later revealed that Bhoopati married Jagadamba only for the money and wants to marry his sweetheart Amrutha Valli ([[Lakshmi Manchu]]). Amrutha doesn't want to marry Bhoopathi since he already has a wife. Consequently, Bhoopathi kills Jagadamba and makes it look like a suicide.  On hearing the news, Narasimha Rayudu is devastated. Only a week after Jagadamba's death, Bhoopathi tries to marry Amrutha in the Gandhrva Mahal. Narasimha Rayudu, angered by Bhoopathi's actions, confronts him. Bhoopathi gets into a fight with Narasimha Rayudu and stabs him with a sword. He also reveals to Amrutha and the dying Narasimha Rayudu that he was the one who murdered Jagadamba. In anger, Narasimha Rayudu kills Bhoopathi and dies in the Mahal. Amrutha, saddened by the events, blames herself for the whole incident and eventually turns into a beggar.  In the present, Gandharva Mahal is readied for the marriage of Visalakshi. The bridegroom Rishi ([[Richard Rishi]]) and his family arrive for the wedding. It is revealed that Rishi's uncle Bujji ([[Sai Kumar (Telugu actor)|Sai Kumar]]) wants to take the palace and convert it into a hotel. Later that night, Bujji sees Narasimha Rayudu's ghost and gets scared. Bujji seeks the help of a Mantrik ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) who reveals that the house is indeed haunted by the souls of Bhoopati and Narasimha Rayudu. He captures the violent soul of Bhoopathi and traps it in a bottle. It is also revealed that Manoj is Seshayya's grandson and was sent by his mother Suguna ([[Suhasini Maniratnam]]), Seshayya's daughter to help Rayudu and his family. Manoj reveals to Jagadha that he was never attacked by a ghost and tells her it was part of his plan to avoid giving the Mahal as dowry. He also reveals that it was not a ghost but him that scared Bujji. Bujji overhears the conversation and is angered.

V/H/S
 The film is presented as an [[anthology]] of short horror films, built into a [[frame narrative]] which acts as its own short horror film. Each short film is linked together with the concept of [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] (each segment is from the [[VHS]] tapes found in the room).  ===Tape 56/frame narrative=== *Directed by [[Adam Wingard]] *Written by [[Adam Wingard]] & [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]] The [[frame narrative]] focuses on a criminal gang who film their exploits, which include smashing the walls and windows of an abandoned house and sexually assaulting a woman in a parking lot. An anonymous source offers them a large sum of money to break into a house and steal a single VHS videotape. The gang is eager to expand their criminal enterprises, and accept the task.  Entering the house, the criminals find an old man sitting dead in front of several television sets playing [[white noise]]. Feeling free to roam the house, they discover hundreds of unmarked VHS tapes, and set about collecting them all to ensure that they retrieve the right one. One of the criminals stays behind in the TV room with the dead body to watch the "Amateur Night" tape left in the [[VCR]]. The contents of this tape and the four subsequent ones comprise the bulk of the film, with the action cutting back to the criminals' efforts between each short.  As the frame narrative progresses, the gang encounters a strange figure moving around the basement, which appears to be the old man. Glimpses of the TV room demonstrate that, unknown to the criminals, the man's body disappears at one point only to reappear in the exact position. Similarly, the criminals return to the TV room to find that the first viewer has disappeared, prompting Zac to continue watching the tapes himself. After the ending of "The Sick Thing that happened to Emily when she was Younger" segment, Gary returns to the TV room to discover that Zac has disappeared as well, he is the only person left, and that the old man's body is gone.  Searching the rooms upstairs, he finds the decapitated remains of Zac, and is subsequently attacked by the old man, who is now a [[zombie]]. The terrified leader flees downstairs, where he falls and is killed by the zombie. The frame narrative ends with the camera left in the TV room picking up the sound of the VCR starting the "10/31/98" tape by itself.  ===Amateur Night===   *Directed by [[David Bruckner]] *Written by [[David Bruckner]] & Nicholas Tecosky  Shane, Patrick, and Clint are three friends who have rented a motel room to fulfill Shane's intent of bringing women back for sex; Clint's glasses have been outfitted with a hidden camera that will allow them to turn their planned encounter into an [[amateur pornography|amateur porn]] video. While the three men are bar-hopping, Clint encounters a mysterious young woman, Lily, who appears unusually shy, and says little other than "I like you."  In addition to picking up Lily, the men also succeed in convincing another young woman, Lisa, to return to their motel with them. Lisa passes out as Shane attempts to initiate sex and Patrick, laughing, discourages him from continuing. Lily continues awkwardly coming on to Clint, but a dejected Shane comes on to Lily instead, oblivious to the scales visible on her feet as he undresses her. Lily appears responsive, pushing Shane onto his back and then beginning to undress Clint, seemingly beginning a [[threesome]]. Overwhelmed, Clint goes to the bathroom; Patrick disrobes and attempts to take Clint's place, but Lily has made it clear that she dislikes Patrick.  Moments later, Patrick bursts into the bathroom claiming Lily bit him. When they approach Shane, Lily sprouts fangs, attacks and kills him. Clint and Patrick hide in the bathroom until Patrick, still nude, arms himself with a shower curtain rod and returns to the room. Clint tries to wake Lisa and Patrick attempts to fight Lily but she subdues him, drinks his blood and [[Emasculation|rips off his genitals]]. Clint escapes, but ends up falling down a stairwell and breaks his wrist in the process. Lily catches up to Clint, but instead of attacking, she attempts [[fellatio]]. Finding Clint unaroused, she crawls over to a corner and cries softly, which gets louder, then turns into a horrific growl. Clint flees, begging bystanders for help, but he is suddenly lifted into the sky by Lily, who has transformed into a winged creature. This reveals that she's a [[succubus]], who was on the hunt. The glasses fall off Clint's face and hit the ground before the video cuts out.  ===Second Honeymoon=== *Directed by [[Ti West]] *Written by [[Ti West]] A married couple, Sam and Stephanie, travel to Arizona for their second [[honeymoon]]. They visit a [[Wild West]]-themed attraction where Stephanie receives a prediction from a mechanical [[fortune teller]], which claims that she will soon be reunited with a loved one. That evening (off camera), a woman comes to Sam and Stephanie's motel room and awkwardly tries to convince Sam to give her a ride the next day. In the middle of the night, while the couple are asleep, someone breaks into the room, turns on the camcorder and films stroking Stephanie's buttocks with a switchblade. The intruder then steals $100 from Sam's wallet and dips his toothbrush in the toilet. The next day, on their way to visit the [[Grand Canyon]], Sam notices the missing money and accuses Stephanie of taking it, but she assumes he is joking. That night, someone enters the room again and repeatedly stabs Sam in the neck with a switchblade, filming him as he chokes on his own blood and dies. The camera then shows the killer, the woman from earlier, cleaning the blade while she and Stephanie make out passionately, revealing that the woman was Stephanie's lover. The recording cuts to Stephanie asking her lover if she has erased the footage.  ===Tuesday the 17th=== *Directed by [[Glenn McQuaid]] *Written by [[Glenn McQuaid]] Three friends—Joey, Spider, and Samantha—accompany their new friend, Wendy, on a camping trip. Joey films the group as Wendy leads them through the woods, occasionally mentioning 'accidents' that took the lives of her friends. When scanning certain areas, images of mutilated bodies appear in the film. Wendy then tells them that a murderer killed her friends during a camping trip here the previous year, but the group laughs it off as a joke. Spider and Samantha leave the group and are killed by a human-like figure with a red head obscured in [[video tape tracking|tracking errors]] named "The Glitch" (as identified in the end credits).  At the lake, Wendy tells Joey she lured all three of them to the grounds to use as bait so she can find and kill the mysterious force. Wendy reveals that she had been to this lake before where a killer had slaughtered all her friends and she was the only survivor. She notes that the police did not believe her when she said the killer could be in two places at once. The entity walks up behind Joey and slits his throat.  Wendy runs away, luring the figure into two easily escaped booby traps and is cut by it in the second one. She films the entity close up, but it continues to be obscured by the tracking error. Wendy continues to run through the woods, she finds Joey in his death throes. After he dies, the figure approaches Wendy and a final trap impales it. Wendy gloats at it and walks away but when she turns around, it is gone; it reappears in a tree and jumps down, beats her with the camera, then slashes her stomach, subsequently eviscerating her and afterwards violently inhabiting her body.  ===The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger=== *Directed by [[Joe Swanberg]] *Written by [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]] This segment is shown through computer [[Videotelephony|video chats]]. Emily talks to her boyfriend James, a trainee doctor, about a strange bump on her arm and how it reminds her of an accident she had when she was younger. After witnessing a small, childlike entity rush into her room and slam the door shut, Emily believes her apartment is haunted. Her landlord claims that no children have ever lived in the apartment, but Emily is unconvinced. During her next video chat with James, an increasingly frantic Emily digs into her arm with a scalpel to find out what the bump is, but James urges her to stop before the wound becomes infected.  Emily attempts to contact the being, but it knocks her out. James quickly appears in her apartment and surgically removes an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] fetus from Emily's torso. Aliens are using Emily as an [[Incubator (neonatal)|incubator]] for alien/human hybrids, and James has been working for them and removing the fetuses for some time. The aliens erase Emily's memory, and James mentions that the arm bump is a [[tracking device]]. In their next chat, a badly injured Emily believes she sustained her injuries after wandering into traffic in a [[fugue state]]. She reveals that the doctor James recommended has diagnosed her as [[Schizoaffective disorder|schizoaffective]], and tearfully says that James deserves a better, more normal girlfriend. He assures Emily that she is the only person he wants to be with, but once their chat ends he begins a new chat with a different woman who has the same bump on her arm and also believes James is her boyfriend, showing that the aliens are using more than one person as an incubator.  ===10/31/98=== *Directed by [[Radio Silence Productions|Radio Silence]] *Written by [[Matt Bettinelli-Olpin]], [[Tyler Gillett]], Justin Martinez & [[Chad Villella]] It's Halloween 1998. Chad, Matt, Tyler, and Paul (dressed in Halloween costumes as [[Ted Kaczynski|the Unabomber]], a pirate, a teddy bear implanted with a [[nanny cam]], and a Marine, respectively) head out to a [[Costume party|Halloween party]] at a friend's house, only to end up at the wrong place. Sneaking inside, they begin to experience paranormal phenomena and believe that they are at a realistic [[haunted house]] attraction and have fun with it. In the attic they find several men gathered around a young woman whom they've suspended from the rafters, apparently performing an exorcism. The men are chanting "cast you down", and the boys exuberantly join in. One of the men reacts angrily to their presence and physically assaults the young woman. Some of the men are pulled upwards into the darkness by an unseen force. More violent, overtly threatening paranormal phenomena then begin to occur and the boys initially flee before realizing they should try to rescue the girl. Returning to the attic, the boys work to untie her and get her to safety, as the house itself comes to life with [[poltergeists|poltergeist]] phenomena and ghostly arms rising from the walls and the floors to claim the lives of the woman's captors.  Exiting through the basement, the boys pile into their car with the girl and drive away. The car abruptly stops and the girl disappears, reappearing in the street before them and walking away amid a flock of birds before they realize that they've stopped on train tracks. The boys attempt to get out of the car as the train approaches, but they are unable to unlock the doors. The screen starts to flicker with static and the train smashes into the car off-camera, killing all inside.  During the end credits, clips from Tape 56 are shown.  ===Alternative Ending to 10/31/98=== A joke ending was shot in one-take by [[Radio Silence Productions|Radio Silence]] in which the doors are unlocked and the boys get out just before the train smashes into their car. The boys walk away and talk about how much fun they had and what a crazy night it was as the train hits the car and it explodes behind them.  <ref></ref>  
Ustad Hotel
 Abdul Razaq ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) and Fareeda ([[Praveena]]), a Muslim couple in Kerala, are expecting their first child. Razaq wants the child to be a boy and wants to name the child Faizal and call him Faizi. To his disappointment, the child is a girl. Fareeda gives birth to three more girls, which irritates Abdul Razaq, who migrates to [[Dubai]]. Finally, Fareeda gives birth to a boy but, because of her many deliveries, Fareeda becomes ill and dies. Abdul Razaq takes his five children to Dubai. Faizi is looked after by his sisters whom he affectionately calls "Ithathas & Company" (Sisters and Company).  As Faizi ([[Dulquer Salman]]) grows up, his sisters get married one by one, and his father marries for a second time. Faizi hopes to be a chef, much against his father's aspirations. Faizi goes to Switzerland to study hotel management at the [[University of Lausanne]]. When he returns with much fanfare after the course, it is revealed that he has secretly studied to become a chef and not hotel management. This shatters Razaq's dream of opening a five-star hotel in his hometown ([[Kozhikode]]) and costs Faizi a marriage proposal from a wealthy family. Razaq had wanted Faizi to marry a close friend and business tycoon's daughter Shahana ([[Nithya Menen]]).  Angered by the humiliation (since being a chef is equated with a job of less dignity in most of India), Razaq virtually disowns Faizi and takes custody of his passport and credit cards so that Faizi cannot go to London, where he has a job as a sous chef at [[The Ivy]] restaurant. In anger, Faizi travels to Kozhikode to join his grandfather Kareem ([[Thilakan]]) who is affectionately called "Kareem Ikka" locally. Kareem has been managing Ustad Hotel (named by local people since Ustad means master in Malayalam) for the last 35 years.  Faizi is in Kozhikode longer than he had anticipated. During his stay with his grandfather, Faizi gets involved in the daily activities of Ustad Hotel. He strikes friendships with the members of the band "Kallumakkayees" ([[mussel]]s). A five-star hotel named "Beach Bay" next door wants to acquire the land on which Ustad Hotel stands. Kareem having incurred [[lakh]]s in debt was at the mercy of his bank which was conspiring to seize the restaurant and give the property to the five-star hotel. Faizi tells the owner of the Beach Bay that he will not allow him to take over Ustad Hotel's property. The owner then bribes the local health department and gets Ustad Hotel closed down because of unhygienic conditions.  Faizi collects money from the employees and renovates the hotel. Shahana, too, has realized the futility of her family's orthodox nature and comes calling. She joins Faizi and they reopen the restaurant, which becomes very successful, enabling them to clear the debts. Faizi then receives a new job offer to work as an executive chef in a restaurant in [[Marseille]], France.  When he breaks this news to his grandfather, Kareem has a heart attack and is hospitalized. At the hospital, Kareem asks Faizi to visit his friend Narayanan Krishnan in [[Madurai]], whom Kareem had been funding to feed the poor. On seeing how poor Indian people struggle for food, Faizi now understands the meaning of Kareem's words that "anyone can fill a stomach, but only a good cook can fill the heart as well". By the time Faizi comes back, Kareem decides to leave everything behind and go on a pilgrimage to the Sufi shrines in North India, his lifelong ambition. Faizi changes his mind and stays with Ustad Hotel. He marries Shahana, who helps him run the restaurant. Faizi's rich father changes his mind and supports the restaurant, making it a profitable one.

Vamps (film)
 Stacy ([[Krysten Ritter]]) and Goody ([[Alicia Silverstone]]), are two socialite [[vampire]]s living the good life in New York City. Goody was turned in 1841 by the vampire stem Ciccerus ([[Sigourney Weaver]]). She struggled with her life as a vampire until Stacy was turned by Ciccerus sometime during the early 1990s. Goody was able to teach Stacy how to use her new abilities, like sustaining themselves on rat blood, but keeps her actual age a secret because she is afraid of being viewed as old.  While at a vampire meeting, Stacy explains how she struggled with [[drug addiction]] as a human, but is now happy since being a vampire gave her a second chance. Goody also discovers that if their maker or "stem" Ciccerus is ever killed, they would revert to their human ages. While working at a hospital as exterminators, Goody runs into her ex-boyfriend Danny ([[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]]), whom she has not seen since the 1960s. They re-connect under the pretense that she is Goody's daughter, but Danny eventually learns the truth when he sees her bite into another man to prevent a stroke. When he asks why she left him, Goody explains that even though she loved him, she did not want to stand in his way of finding someone he can actually build a life with.  A sub-plot about the vampires being sought by the government via the patriot act by using their electronic devices causes panic for the vampire's anonymous group. Goody along with their vampire-wannabe friend, the tech savvy Renfield and Danny (now a lawyer) come up with a plan to delete and change all the information about all the vampires in the New York area during a solar eclipse. After they succeed the vamps throw a party for both human and non-human feeders, and some old rivalries are put to rest. But all is endangered by Ciccerus who didn't attend and massacred an entire Asian restaurant full of people, because she's a psychotic monster.  Meanwhile, Stacy begins a relationship with a young college student named Joey ([[Dan Stevens]]). It is soon revealed that Joey is the son of the infamous vampire slayer [[Abraham Van Helsing|Dr. Van Helsing]] ([[Wallace Shawn]]) who is in town to find and kill vampires. After spending the night at Joey's place, he sees  Stacy crawling down the side of his apartment building in order to get home before the sun rises. Despite his initial shock, Joey accepts that Stacy is a vampire and the two resume dating. When Stacy begins vomit upon awakening every night, Goody discovers that Stacy is pregnant, but that the baby won't survive unless she becomes human again, which can only happen if they kill Ciccerus. To accomplish this they have to figure out where her tomb is, but Goody thanks to an old trivia game show, figures out that she has taken the tomb of [[Ulysses Grant]] because it's the one place in New York that nobody ever goes to.  Goody tells Stacy that they must become human again in order for her to stay pregnant, and the two decide that while they have had a lot of fun as vampires, "being young is getting kinda old". Goody then goes to Dr. Van Helsing to get his help in killing Ciccerus, and she advises him that vampires can only be killed via sunlight or decapitation.  When asked why she wanted to become a vampire, Goody explained that her husband and sisters had been killed during a cholera epidemic, and that she had to stay alive in order to protect her two children. Van Helsing then has his assistant look up Goody's living descendants; most of them being doctors, teachers, and a politician. The girls team up with Joey and Dr. Van Helsing to track down Ciccerus and after a struggle, they end up killing Ciccerus so that Stacy can keep her baby and have a future with Joey. Stacy looks relatively the same despite being forty years old, but Goody rapidly ages into an old woman. Revealing her actual age, Goody accompanies Joey and Stacy to Times Square where Goody reminisces about her life. As the sun rises, she disintegrates into ash.  A few years later, Stacy and Joey show up at Dr. Van Helsing's house to pick up their young daughter, whom they have named after Goody. As Van Helsing plays with his granddaughter, he notices that the little girl sports a set of vampire fangs, but rather than being horrified he seems amused.

Susan gets work as an additional music teacher at the local [[high school]] which will be closing after the current year.  Though the current music teacher, who is also the school's principal, Barry Hickman discourages students and doubts their skills, Susan thinks the right approach will help the kids. She involves the school in a [[talent show]], which, if they win, will save the school from closure. Hickman assigns Ace to play drums, but Ace panics and falls off his stool. This is recorded by the other students; since Ace is also the son of the new teacher, he is teased and ostracized. Skylar befriends Ace, though she tries to hide it from the other students.  Susan gets a letter from a notary: the father of her late husband has died, and Ace has inherited his old dog Fang. Later, a trunk is delivered; inside is apparently a regular dog.  A television program shows an interview regarding a woman from Transylvania and the incident with the dog. Doctor Warhol sees the show, and is now sure: the legend of the vampire dog is true. Warhol is sure the [[DNA]] of the vampire dog will lead to a solution to create a [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]] which will stop aging of human skin. She orders her assistant Frank to search for the vampire dog.  Next day, Fang is outside, tied onto a long string. When Ace arrives from school, Fang is hiding in the shade under the deck. Once inside, Fang starts talking and blames Ace for putting him in the sun: he is allergic to sunlight. Ace faints and Fang drags him to the couch.  After Ace awakens, Fang explains that he is a 600-year-old vampire dog, living on jelly pudding. Besides talking, Fang can hypnotize and can run at almost the speed of light. Ace forbids Fang to tell his mother - she might faint and hurt herself. Ace decides not to tell his mother the dog needs jelly pudding to survive, so he smuggles Fang to school each day so the dog can seek pudding in the schools' kitchen and cafeteria.  Meanwhile, Skylar knows the truth about Fang. Fang tells her he turned into a vampire dog 600 years ago when a certain [[Vlad Dracula|count Vlad]] tried to attack the great-great-great-...-great-parents of Ace. Fang attacked the vampire, but was bitten. As he became immortal, the dog stays with the family. After becoming a vampire, Fang ate mostly horse hoofs until discovering jelly pudding. Skylar, a genius in chemistry, knows the reason: jelly pudding contains [[gelatin]], which contains [[collagen]], which for Fang, is a substitute for [[hemoglobin]]. Skylar wonders if she can find a way for Fang to walk in the sunlight.  Doctor Warhol and Frank have attempted to kidnap the dog and failed. They then scheme to buy up all the gelatin in town to lure the dog, but fail again. Not much later, Fang is found by the school caretaker and brought to a pet shelter. Ace is grounded by his mother for taking the dog to school and refused to get his dog back because she see her son as an embarrassment and tries to save her career. Despite being grounded, Ace and Skylar visit the pet shelter to save Fang from another kidnap attempt by Warhol and Frank. The talent show takes place that evening. Susan's class performance is stopped by Hickman, exposing that the drummer is using a drum computer to cheat. Hickman and the drummer, (his nephew Murray Arbuckle), were bribed by Warhol, to doom the school, so she can build her chemical company on the land. The contest jury rules that the group can continue if another drummer can be found. Ace appears and plays drums without his stage fright. His school wins and is saved. Susan is proud of her son. The corrupt Hickman is fired, while Arbuckle is assigned to the instrument [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] instead of drums. Ace becomes a very popular boy. Skylar finds out Fang only needs to take some drug against sun allergy. Warhol and Frank are arrested by police and declared lunatics after they claim Fang is a vampire dog.

A number of humorous incidents follow, such as Jayanthi's to-be husband is actually revealed to be a clumsy NRI Gautham, who she disapproves of. She openly expresses her love for Gurumurthy, and hence he subsequently marries her. After this, the NRI takes leave.  Thirumurthy rises to fame in his job by having his younger brother secretly punish suspects and save victims for him. Everyone believes that Thirumurthy actually fought the criminals himself, but in reality took credit for Gurumurthy's doings, unknown to them. One of the village's biggest mob bosses Annachi ([[Ashutosh Rana]]) finally discovers the truth via a [[CCTV]] showing Gurumurthy's face. Enraged, he has his men to severely beat up Thirumurthy, making the latter confident that his brother will continue his job. Gurumurthy, now enraged, proclaims that he made his elder brother a policeman not for fake, but to overcome his fears and to become stronger. Following his recovery, Thirumurthy begins training up under Gurumurthy, and subsequently overcomes his fear and manages to defeat a few of Annachi's men.  Eventually, Annachi and his men break into the brother's house and cause havoc. Thirumurthy and Gurumurthy arrive and defeat all of Annachi's men, however they are unable to beat Annachi. When Annachi falls for a trap set by the brothers, he is defeated but the two brothers quarrel whether to kill him or arrest him. Gurumurthy declares that they will roll a gun and when the gun stops rolling at the brothers, they will arrest Annachi. But if it stops at Annachi, he will be killed. The gun stops rolling at Annachi and Thirumurthy shoots him dead.  As the credits roll, scenes show that Thirumurthy is again congratulated by the local police, but gives equal credit to his brother as well. Through this praise, Gurumurthy also gets to join the police force.

The Viral Factor
 IDC (International Defense Commission) agent Sean Wong ([[Andy On]]) and his team members are in Jordan on a dangerous mission to escort a scientist named Kenner Osama Muhammad, who has stolen a copy of the smallpox virus, to Norway. On the way out of the country, the convoy were ambushed by a group of assailants. It was later revealed that Sean has betrayed the team for his own agenda and shot his colleagues Jon Man ([[Jay Chou]]) and his girlfriend Ice ([[Michelle Bai]]). Sean then escapes with Kenner and the virus. The failed mission left Ice dead while Jon has a bullet lodged in his brain with no safe way to remove it and only two weeks to live. Three months later, the crew of a freight ship on Malaysian water was found to have been infected and killed by the smallpox virus. Elsewhere, Sean contacts an arms dealer called Tyler ([[Jared Robinson]]), who suggests to mutate the virus into a biological weapon, develop a vaccine and sell it to a corrupt pharmaceutical company. In Beijing, Jon returns home to spend his remaining days with his mother ([[Elaine Jin]]), who tells him that he has a long lost brother, Man Yeung ([[Nicholas Tse]]) whom she left behind with his father, Man Tin ([[Liu Kai Chi]]).  In Malaysian court, Man Yeung is being charged for numerous crimes that he had committed. While being escorted to the prison, he attacks the police personnel and makes a successful escape. He later meets up with corrupt police officer Russell, who aided in his escape from custody and was given a new job. On his flight to Malaysia, Jon meets Asian Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) doctor Rachel Kan ([[Lin Peng]]), who was later abducted by Yeung after the plane landed. A suspicious Jon, who noticed that the car that Rachel was travelling in has a different driver from earlier, tails the vehicle and ended up being forced into the vehicle. Jon, unaware of Yeung's identity, puts up a fight against him and the other henchmen, causing the car to crash. Yeung escapes after a brief struggle with Jon. Later, Jon meets his father and Man's daughter, Cheung-sing, who shows him a newspaper article that the man he encountered earlier was his brother.  Meanwhile, Yeung and his goons breaks into Rachel's house, who holds her mother hostage and forces her to get a Carnot virus sample from the ACDC headquarters. The next day, while Yeung and Rachel are leaving the building after obtaining the virus sample, a security personnel triggers the alarm, causing a chase through the city. Yeung crashes the getaway vehicle and flees on foot. He calls his father and tells him to bring Cheung-aing to meet him at the train station. Jon, who was nearby to meet up with Rachel, witnesses the event and join in the pursuit of Yeung. Working together, Jon and Yeung managed to hold off the corrupted police officers long enough for them to board a train to escape. Jon persuades Yeung to surrender himself but the two brothers got embroiled in a fist fight. They were later intercepted by the police at a train depot, where Tin sacrifices himself in order to let Yeung and Cheung-aing escape, but Cheung-aing was caught by a henchman and Jon arrested by the police.  Russell then discovers that Jon and Yeung are brothers, and orders his men to kill Jon, who is at a hospital for a check-up. Yeung later follows Russell to a nightclub, who was meeting Sean. After being assaulted by Yeung to release his daughter, Russell escapes and runs to the road only to be knocked down by a bus, killing him instantly. At the hospital, Russell's men failed to kill Jon, who escapes after putting up a fight.   Next morning, Yeung goes to an abandoned building to bring the Carnot virus sample to Sean in exchange for his daughter. Rachel was then forced to combine the Carnot virus sample with the smallpox virus, which Sean later tries to test on Rachel's mother. Before it could be done however, Jon shows himself and holds Sean at gunpoint. Sean tries to dissuade Yeung from helping Jon by threatening his daughter's life. A police tactical team then storms the building, and in the confusion, Sean escapes with the virus. Jon then gives chase and when it appears that he has nowhere to run, Sean injects the virus into Yeung's daughter, who was placed inside a car. Sean, claiming to be the only person who has the antidote to the virus, tells Jon to bring Rachel to him in exchange for Cheung-sing. With Cheung-sing's life at stake, he was left with no choice but to let Sean go. Jon then gets into another car and picks up Yeung, who has been shot, before escaping together. That night, after removing the bullet, Jon and Yeung share their life stories together. However, the police moved into their hiding place. Yeung escapes while Jon stayed behind to surrender himself.  Later while being transferred to maximum security prison, Jon hijacks the helicopter he is in. Together with Yeung and Rachel, they escape via air and arrives at Sean's designated location. However, it turns out to be a trap when Mark, Sean's henchman appears and shoot Yeung before abducting Rachel. Jon spots Sean and gives chase while Yeung goes after Rachel, who is brought onto a ship to create the antidote to the virus. Yeung encounters Mark dumping Cheung-sing's body into the sea and kills him in a fit of anger before jumping off the ship to retrieve his daughter. Jon arrives in time to help both of them get back onto the ship, and tells Yeung to guard the engine control room to stop the ship from starting while he looks for Rachel. After finding her and breaking her out, they are chased by Tyler and Sean, while Yeung easily disposes off Tyler's henchman Mike. Sean then shoots and injures Rachel. Jon was nearly killed by Tyler after dropping his gun, but managed to retrieve it at the last moment and shoots the arms dealer. In the final showdown, Sean pins down both Jon and Yeung. Jon, who is becoming weaker by the minute, knows his time is almost up and because only one of them can take down Sean, walks out to become a distraction allowing Yeung to shoot Sean.  In the aftermath, Yeung has surrendered to the IDC and goes to Beijing with Cheung-sing to visit his mother in a sign that shows he has forgiven her. The film ends with a narration by Jon that his family is his "everything".  
Voices of Transition
  Using interviews and overlays of graphics and text, the film presents the current problems facing [[industrial agriculture]]. It explores why in the interviewees' view the current industrial model is not up to the task of feeding the world's people. According to the film every [[calorie]] of energy contained in a food source currently takes between 10 and 20 calories of [[crude oil]] in the production of [[fertilizers]] and transportation to produce, leading to a strong dependence of the cost of food on [[oil prices]]. As a result of [[peak oil]] and increasing oil prices this dependence will lead to ever increasing food prices. According to the film, this dependence already represents a significant weak-spot in the global food [[supply chain]].<ref name=tagblatt.de></ref> Additionally, agriculture is already responsible for 40% of [[greenhouse gas emissions]], contributing to [[climate change]]. Furthermore, the film argues that the overuse of inorganic [[fertilizers]] has been responsible for the loss of [[soil fertility]] and threatens the complete loss of usable soil within the next decades through [[soil erosion]] and sinking [[crop yields]].  These effects, according to the film, can only be partly mitigated by the increased use of those same fertilizers. The loss of workplaces, the concentration of land in the hands of a few (allegedly a farm closes every 23 minutes in France) as well as the dependence on large corporations are enumerated as side effects of the industrialisation of agriculture since the 1920s. Companies, such as [[Monsanto]] and [[Bayer]], control everything from seed stock to fertilizers and the necessary chemical mixes for hybrid plants, thereby controlling the entire supply chain. The film argues that this development was supported through subsidies from the [[World Bank]]. Interviews with [[Vandana Shiva]], the founder of the [[Transition Towns]] movement [[Rob Hopkins]] and various agricultural experts serve to argue this viewpoint. The dependence on [[crude oil]] is illustrated through the example of the wholesale food market in [[Rungis]].  [[File:Voices of Transition Vaches normandes.png|thumb|Agroforestry in [[Normandy]]]] To illustrate alternative scenarios the documentary visits places in England and France to conduct various interviews. [[Agroforestry]] expert [[Martin Crawford]]<ref></ref> gives a tour of his [[forest garden]], explaining how the assortment of different plants on various levels results in a [[symbiotic relationship]] between them whereby they supply each other with [[nutrients]]. He explains the high productivity rate and efficiencies realised through the use of these [[Permaculture]] principles. A further application is shown on farmlands, where rows of trees are planted with cereal crops in between. As a result, the later can still be harvested using large-scale machinery, while the trees provide a better [[microclimate]] by providing living space for animals, much higher rates of [[biodiversity]] and a replenishing of the soil as a result of the regular loss of root structures. According to the interviewees in the film the trees themselves could provide a counterbalance to the deficit of wood in European countries, act as carbon sinks and contribute to the value of the land. As experts on these matters the film presents Christian Dupraz<ref name=Christian_Dupraz></ref> from the French Institut national de la Recherche Agronomique as well as French [[soil scientist]] Claude Bourguignon.  [[File:Voices of Transition Rob Hopkins.png|thumb|[[Rob Hopkins]]]] The second part of the film depicts the British [[Transition Towns]] initiative, whose local actors claim to promote a more liveable future by building resilient structures in anticipation of the threats of [[peak oil]], [[climate change]] and [[economic crises]].<ref name=tagblatt.de /> The film shows Permaculture gardener Mike Feingold<ref></ref> as he works in his [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] and whilst making apple juice from apples he has harvested himself. Further, the film highlights barter markets, [[local currencies]] such as the [[Totnes Pound]]<ref name=The_Independent></ref> and events where plants are planted with the goal of making 'edible cities'. Sally Jenkins, as representative for the project Grofun (Growing Real Organic Food in Urban Neighbourhoods)<ref></ref> shows how she plants food in her front yard to inspire her neighbours to do the same. Co-founder of the initiative [[Rob Hopkins]], who stresses the importance of building a vision that will be able to carry people through the decades to come, further explains the whole movement. According to him this will act both as the means to jointly prepare for looming crises while simultaneously re-learning to enjoy life.  [[File:Voices of Transition Mitglieder Cooperativa Alamar.png|thumb|Cooperative Alamar, Cuba]] The final third of the film turns to [[Cuba]], whose agriculture was cut off from the use of [[crude oil]] and global food markets at the beginning of the 1990s due to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. As a result, [[community gardens]] and [[urban agriculture]] developed, in which organically grown food is produced. The film claims that the Cuban capital [[Havana]] is able to source 70% of its fresh vegetable needs directly within the city or its immediate surroundings,<ref name=Film_Dienst_article /><ref></ref> with a yield of up to 20&nbsp;kg per square meter. Fernando Funes-Monzote, co-founder of the Grupo de Agricultura Organica (winners of the 1999 Right Livelihood Award)<ref></ref> appears as the main interviewee. He claims that [[Cuba]] must be the only country which is close to developing a [[sustainable]] food supply, a claim which is supported by a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] study according to which [[Cuba]] is the only country to fulfil the minimal criteria for [[sustainable development]].<ref name=WWF_Report></ref> Governmental support of urban agriculture has led to a higher degree of [[food sovereignty]] and a degree of independence from the world market and oil prices. Because of this, Cuba's forced development could serve as an example for other countries whose resource shortages are yet to come.

Linda wants to stay and has sex with Seth. George is pressured to have sex with Eva, but he becomes uncomfortable and drives her away with his awkward and bizarre behavior. The next morning, George reaches a breaking point, again, stating that he dislikes the rules of Elysium and wants to leave. Linda wants to stay, so George goes back to Rick's house alone.  Seth believes he has found his soul mate in Linda and searches for the deed to Elysium, which he finds and sells to the property developers, for $11,000, to start a new life with Linda, betraying the commune. A child from the commune witnesses the burning of the deed by Seth and the man that wants to build the casino. Seth tells Linda he wants them to leave Elysium behind, together, and that the others can look after themselves. Linda refuses.  In the meantime, George realizes he loves Linda and comes back to find her, getting into a fight with Seth while the commune looks on and tries to help 'non-violently'. The child that witnessed the burning of the deed by Seth tells the commune what happened and George punches Seth in the jaw.  In the aftermath, the news show that visited Elysium does a follow-up story about the commune.

Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory.

Paige rejoins law school and Leo signs divorce papers. At a store, she meets her old friend Diane who, unaware of her amnesia, apologizes for having had a relationship with Paige's dad, thus alerting Paige as to why she had left her family. When she confronts her mother about this, Rita tells her that she decided to stay with Bill for all the things he had done right instead of leaving him for one wrong act. Paige then asks Leo why he never told her, and he replies he wanted to earn her love instead of driving her away from her parents. Paige, while in class, starts sketching; thus depicting why she first left law school. She continues her interest in art, eventually returning to sculpting and drawing. Though Jeremy confesses he broke up with his present girlfriend, hoping to be back with her, she turns him down stating she needs to know what life would be like without him.  As seasons change, Leo discusses his philosophy about "Moments of impact."  "A moment of impact whose potential for change has ripple effects far beyond what we can predict. Sending some particles crashing together, making them closer than before. While sending others, spinning off into great ventures, landing where you never thought you’d find them..."  Back in her room, Paige finds the menu card on which she had written her wedding vows and is deeply moved. The movie ends with Paige finding Leo at their regular Café Mnemonic and going with him to try a new place instead of their old haunts.

The Wall (2012 drama film)
 A woman ([[Martina Gedeck]]) travels with her two friends, Hugo and Luise, and their loyal dog Lynx to their isolated hunting lodge in the [[Central Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]]. Soon after they arrive, Luise insists that Hugo accompany her to a pub in a nearby village, leaving behind their dog and the woman. The next morning, realizing her friends never returned as planned, the woman sets off on foot toward the village, followed by the dog. As she walks along the road, her progress is stopped abruptly by a mysterious invisible wall. After several unsuccessful attempts to continue past the invisible barrier, the woman turns back to the lodge with the dog. Along the way she approaches a farmhouse, but again is prevented by the invisible wall from making contact with the two owners who appear frozen in time.   Back at the lodge, the woman grows increasingly depressed over her predicament. After exploring the area again with binoculars, she concludes that the couple at the farmhouse, as well as all the people in the village, must be dead. During her walk, the woman encounters a cow that she takes with her. Knowing the animal is both a blessing and a burden, she feeds and milks her, and names her Bella. Sometime later, she gets into Hugo's car and drives down the road toward the village and tries to drive through the obstruction—but the car crashes into the invisible wall.  Fighting off despair, the woman decides that she can survive the summer with the cow and her endless supply of wood. While she plants potatoes and looks for food, she keeps track of the passing time by crossing off the days on a calendar—a remnant of the civilized life she still retains. She takes in a stray cat. While she welcomes the newcomer, the dog remains her "only friend in a world of troubles and loneliness"—always happy to see her.<ref name="dvd"/> To survive, she is forced to engage in the "bloody business of hunting" animals for food.  One day the woman hikes to another lodge in a high mountain pasture. Comforted by the warm summer sun, the beautiful mountains, and the gentle sounds of birds, the woman is transformed by the experience. Soon the cat gives birth and the woman names the newborn white cat Pearl. Later that summer, the woman with great effort harvests the hay in the meadow. In the fall, the white cat Pearl dies in a wind storm. On 5 November, the woman starts to write her "report" on the back of old calendars and stationery.  The woman and her animals face an icy winter. On 11 January, the cow gives birth to a calf. In the coming weeks, the woman grows tired and dreams of succumbing to the deadening snow. On 25 May, after spending a year at the lodge in the narrow valley, the woman and her animals leave in a procession and climb to the high mountain pasture where they spend the summer comforted by the warm sun and star-filled nights. For the first time in her life, the woman experiences a feeling of calm "as if a big hand stopped the clock" in her head.<ref name="dvd"/> During that second summer, a transformation begins to take place in her, as if her "newer self" was "being absorbed into a greater whole".  In October the woman returns from the pasture and begins writing her report again. Winter quickly follows, and soon the spring. One morning she spots a white crow, seemingly ostracized by her black brethren. Gradually the woman becomes disengaged from her past. In June, she and the animals return to the pasture, but this year she does not feel the same rapture as before. One day, while returning with Lynx after a walk, the woman sees a strange man killing Bella's bull calf with an ax. As Lynx runs to stop him, the man kills the loyal dog. The woman retrieves her rifle and shoots the stranger—killing him. After rolling the corpse over a high cliff, the woman buries her dog Lynx in a deep hole. The next morning, she and Bella the cow leave the pasture and return to the narrow valley.   That October she harvests potatoes and fruit and soon the winter arrives again. On 25 February, having run out of paper to write on, the woman ends her report.  
Waiting for the Sea
 From the port town of Abasta (which resembles [[Mo‘ynoq]]) at the southern shore of the [[Aral Sea]], Captain Marat sets off on a fishing trip despite a storm warning, since on this day an extraordinary amount of fish comes into the bay. After some hesitation, he takes his wife Dari along but sends her younger sister Tamara home. The ship sinks in the storm, leaving Marat the sole survivor.  Ten years later, Marat is released from prison and returns to the town only to find that the sea has gone. The sea is now far away, and the port's pier rises into a vast sand desert with rusted ships. Town people treat Marat with hostility for the loss of their relatives during the naval accident. None of the missing crew members was ever found. Tortured by feelings of guilt, Marat starts to drag his ship with his own muscles in search of the sea. Only his old friend Balthazar stands by him. Tamara, the younger sister of his drowned wife Dari, loved Marat from her childhood and is now desperately trying to win his heart; Marat insists that Dari is his wife and tells her that he has "ashes in his heart". He only lives on for his quest of searching the sea, believing that if he finds the sea, he would also see his crew and his beloved wife Dari again, because "the sea doesn't kill. It returns what it takes".  In the end, Marat dies of sickness and exhaustion. The perspective now changes into the soul of Marat: In a storm the sea returns and takes Marat on his ship out in the open, accompanied by the [[revelation of John]] 21:1.  
War of the Worlds: Goliath
 The film is set in an alternate-reality Earth. In 1899, The [[Mars in fiction|Martian]] launched an unprovoked attack on the major nations of the world. In Leeds, England, a younger Eric Wells watches in horror as a Martian Tripod lays waste to his city and then kills his father and mother. But before it can kill him, the Martian Tripod suddenly keels forward and crashes into the ground. Over 140 million people were killed by the Martians, and many of the great cities of the world were destroyed until the Martians were killed off by Earth's bacteria, to which the Martians had no defense against.  15 years later, in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] in 1914, the world has seen radical change and development. It has become a [[dieselpunk]]/[[steampunk]]-like world, where [[Earth]] is at the potential onset of the [[First World War|Great War]] as the European nations' fragile alliance begins to shatter. A now grown-up Eric Wells is Captain of a Tripod squad for the A.R.E.S. (Allied Resistance Earth Squadron) organization, alongside American Lieutenant Jennifer Carter, Irish Corporal Patrick O'Brien, Canadian Sergeant Abraham Douglas, and Malayan Lieutenant Raja Iskandar Shah. A.R.E.S. is commanded by strict Russian General Sergei Kushnirov (who lost his family to the Martians in 1899 at St. Petersburg), Secretary of War [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (who forsook a second term as President of the United States), and Professor [[Nikola Tesla]], an enigmatic scientist who reverse-engineered the technology from the first, failed, invasion of the Martians and created A.R.E.S. weapons and vehicles.  Eric Wells is given the first of a new type of steam-powered, Achilles-class Battle Tripod, (65 feet tall, armed with heavy machine guns and six light rockets, a heat ray and an 88-millimeter cannon) who nick-names his new tripod 'The Goliath'.  But as his crew are preparing to engage another group of Tripods in a simulated war game against Japanese Captain Sakai, the A.R.E.S. alliance is threatened by the onset of the Great War when [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo]]. The members of A.R.E.S. are all called back to their respective countries in preparation for the coming war, but Eric, outraged at the stupidity of the human politicians and leaders, convinces everyone to stay and prepare for the coming Martian invasion.  This proves to be advantageous, as a second, more ruthless, Martian invasion begins, using more advanced, 100 foot tall, heat ray spewing, tripod battle machines, and are now immune to Earth's bacteria. The Martians first attack the War Games, and decimate many of A.R.E.S.'s forces until they themselves are destroyed by Eric and his team. But, according to General Kurshnirov at the debrief, that was just a probing attack to judge A.R.E.S.' combat potential as the real invasion began.  
The Watch (2012 film)
  In the town of Glenview, [[Ohio]], Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is a passionate volunteer in the community and senior manager of the local [[Costco]] store. His life is changed when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and overprotective father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent [[Divorce|divorcé]].  The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and relax, much to Evan's chagrin. While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly destructive weapon and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan seemingly kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch members theorize that the aliens are stealing their victims' skins and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is [[Infertility|infertile]], and reveals his worry that it may cause her to dump him.  Evan suspects that one of his neighbors is an alien due to his [[deadpan]], cryptic way of speaking and because he always seems to be following Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from [[Rape|raping]] Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out together.  Evan then receives an urgent visit from Jamarcus, who confesses that he is one of the aliens but has chosen to side with humanity after experiencing human culture. He warns the group that the aliens are building a transmitter beneath the Costco store which will summon their armada to destroy the earth; he is expelled from the watch for his deception. Bob, Franklin, Evan, and Abby arm themselves and infiltrate the Costco to destroy the transmitter. Bob encounters Jason who reveals that he is also an alien, and they brawl. Evan and Franklin attempt to disable the transmitter, but are surrounded by aliens. Jamarcus arrives and saves the pair, revealing that the aliens' brains are located in their crotch; Bob kills Jason by ripping off his penis. Evan discovers that the transmitter is powered by the metallic orb and removes it, disabling the machine. More aliens arrive, forcing the group to flee. The watch uses the metallic orb to destroy the Costco building, killing all of the aliens inside.  In the epilogue, Evan and Abby rekindle their romance and adopt a daughter. Bob is closer to Chelsea and likes her new boyfriend, who is scared by stories of how Bob killed Jason by "ripping his dick off". Franklin is finally accepted by the Glenview Police Department, and Jamarcus continues participating in the secret neighborhood orgies. The group maintains the watch, continuing to protect Glenview.

Werewolf: The Beast Among Us
 In the 19th century, a young boy named Charles watches as his family is slaughtered by a werewolf. Before dying, Charles' mother gives him a silver amulet of a howling wolf head, which belonged to his grandfather, who was a "Great Hunter" of werewolves. Charles escapes death by activating a trap which causes a chandelier to fall and kill the attacking werewolf. Twenty-five years later, Charles is a werewolf bounty hunter, working alongside a band of other hunters to rid the world of all werewolves. Werewolves in this fictional world can inflict [[lycanthropy]]. Infected individuals are typically shot in the head, after which their bodies are burned. Werewolves are usually only able to transform during the full moon. Charles and company receive an offer to hunt down a particularly vicious werewolf of a new breed. This new type of werewolf is able to transform three nights in a row.  Daniel, a young man apprenticed to the town doctor, has been studying the werewolf's victims to understand how it is behaving. When Charles and company arrive, Daniel witnesses Charles expose a scam being run by a competing werewolf bounty hunter named Jaeger (German for "Hunter") on the townsfolk. Impressed, Daniel offers his assistance to Charles, who politely declines his offer. Daniel persists until Charles gives in and agrees to let Daniel help him hunt down the werewolf. Eva, Daniel's rich girlfriend, tries to talk him out of hunting the werewolf and into accepting an offer to study at the medical college in the city, but fails. Stefan, a well dressed and handsome companion of Charles, flirts with Eva, much to Daniel's annoyance.  During the next full moon, Jaeger and some friends try to poach the werewolf from Charles' group, but instead they are tricked into triggering all of the traps that Charles and company had carefully prepared earlier. In doing so, the werewolf reveals that it is as intelligent as a person instead of the mindless animal that werewolves usually are. Charles and Daniel are told by the local gypsy leader that this new werewolf will soon be able to transform at will. The townsfolk have lost faith in the bounty hunters, and decide to take matters into their own hands. The town constable has established a list of people who have insufficient alibis to not be the werewolf, so some of the townsfolk lock them in jail. Daniel's mother Vadoma is locked away, as are Eva's father and the town constable, and placed under armed guard.  The next night, the constable has a convulsion, and is shot by the frightened guards. Now panicking, the guards shoot and kill all of the prisoners except for Vadoma and the local gypsy leader. Vadoma manages to escape from her cell. In the nearby ruins, Jaeger, who narrowly survived the previous night, is used as bait in a new trap by Charles. The werewolf battles Charles and his companions and wins, but decides not to kill them, much to everyone's confusion. Daniel, who has become increasingly haunted by nightmares of a werewolf, wakes up the next morning with injuries matching those sustained by the werewolf the night before. Daniel is horrified to discover that he is the werewolf and confronts his mother, who tries to convince him to flee with her. Daniel refuses to leave the town, and instead makes his way to town.  Charles suspects that Daniel might be the werewolf and asks the doctor a few questions, which confirms his suspicions. He then confronts Daniel, who begs Charles to kill him. Instead, the Doctor shoots Charles from behind, and confesses to training Daniel to hunt and kill people. Horrified, Daniel flees to Eva's house, where she is being assaulted by Stefan. Stefan and Daniel fight to a [[stalemate]], despite Daniel's werewolf strength. Stefan ambushes Daniel and knocks him out when he leaves Eva's house. That night, Stefan puts Daniel on display for the townsfolk to see him transform. Daniel transforms, breaks free of his shackles, and flees. Vadoma, pleading with the townsfolk to spare her son, is killed by mistake.  Stefan and Daniel battle it out in front of Eva, and it is revealed that Stefan is a hundred-year-old [[wurdalak]], granting him unnatural strength and toughness. Daniel impales Stefan on a spike, causing Stefan's body to disintegrate. The Doctor appears and orders Daniel, who is still in werewolf form, to kill Eva. Instead, Charles, who has been absent since being shot, appears and shoots the Doctor from behind. Daniel turns back to normal, and Charles lets him go and gives him his silver amulet, telling Daniel that he is the hunter now. Eva and Daniel kiss passionately, while Charles and crew walk away.

Now ruined and without any money, they move to the nearest city, [[Oran]], where Issa, Younes's father, works difficult jobs for a pittance. Physically and psychologically worn, Issa is resigned to give his son away to Mohamed, his elder pharmacist brother, to whom he didn't speak for a long time because Mohamed married a [[Pied-Noir|pied-noir]] piano teacher named Madeleine.  Renamed Jonas by Madeleine, Younes is warmly hosted in his new and only family after the death of his sister and mother during the [[battle of Mers El-Kebir]], and the disappearance of his father, sunk into alcoholism.

That's how he meets Emilie, a young girl from [[France]] whose parents came to live in Algeria and begins a friendship with her.  Spotted because of his political positions, Mohamed is harassed by the French police. To escape from it, Mohamed decides to leave [[Oran]] with his family. They settle in a little town called Rio Salado inhabited by a large population of [[pieds-noirs]] from Spanish backgrounds for the majority. The family builds a new life and Jonas meets new friends, three children of this community, Jean-Christophe, Fabrice and Simon.

Now, 37 years old, and after 17 years of waiting for her turn to come in the long queue of applicants, Monaliza finally gets a governmental job at the Directorate of Archiving and makes a decision that it’s time for her to go out into the world. This makes Afaf (Haifa Al Agha), her older unmarried agoraphobic sister who wants to keep Monaliza by her side, very unhappy. At the same time their outgoing neighbour, Rodaina(Suha Najjar), is trying to marry Monaliza off to her sleazy, older and still unwed brother, Suhail(Haidar Kfouf).

White Tiger (2012 film)
 After an Eastern Front tank battle in the summer of 1943, a Russian tank driver is found alive in a destroyed Soviet tank among dozens of other wrecked tanks. Miraculously recovering from burns on 90% of his body, he suffers amnesia and cannot recall his identity. He receives a new passport with the name Ivan Naydёnov (from the Russian word for "found") and is returned to duty. Naydёnov believes he has the mysterious ability to communicate with tanks as if they were people, though he tries not to advertise this. He is also recognized as the best tank driver in his army group.  In the meantime, rumors arise about a new, invincible Nazi tank that appears seemingly out of nowhere and disappears just as quickly, destroying dozens of Soviet tanks. A captured German soldier describes the tank as a [[Tiger I|Panzer VI Tiger]] painted completely in white. This mysterious, heavily-armored and powerfully-armed enemy tank is dubbed the "White Tiger" by the Soviet and German forces.  Naydёnov is given command of a prototype tank, an upgraded version of a [[T-34/85]] with stronger armor, a more powerful engine, and only needing three crew members. Given his skills, Naydёnov is ordered to locate and destroy this White Tiger. He plans to hide his tank in a ditch in the middle of a forest and use another T-34 to lure the White Tiger into an ambush. On the edge of the forest, the White Tiger appears and opens fire. Naydёnov's plan fails, the other T-34 is destroyed by the Tiger, and Naydёnov's tank is damaged when the Tiger hits it from behind. The White Tiger then retreats back into the forest from which it came. The crew of Naydёnov's tank is confused on why the White Tiger didn't destroy them when it had been behind them at such a close range. The Soviet officers believe the Tiger sank into the swamp behind the forest where it disappeared, but Naydёnov believes it's still out there.  As the story turns out, Naydёnov believes in the existence of "The Tank God" He thinks that he was revived because the Tank God wanted Naydёnov to destroy the "White Tiger". He believes this is why he can understand the tanks and why he survives his battles, he thinks that when shells are fired at him his own tank warns him of the incoming danger and he avoids it. Naydёnov becomes obsessed with finding the mysterious Nazi tank. He is convinced that the enemy tank is unmanned, a ghost of the war. The counterintelligence officer assigned to track down the White Tiger comes to believe the latter's interpretation and assists Naydënov. A captured German officer also reveals that he has never received any reports or documents on the existence of this Tiger, and he remarks that the legend of the tank is causing more fear than hope in the German Army.  During a subsequent battle, a Soviet tank force is completely decimated by the White Tiger, which reloads and fires faster and more accurately than any tank crew should have been able to. When it withdraws, Naydёnov gives chase in his tank and comes upon an abandoned village. After destroying a hidden [[Panzer IV]], he comes upon the White Tiger and engages it. The White Tiger's turret is damaged during the battle, but it manages to escape after Naydënov's T-34's gun is disabled. The sympathetic counterintelligence officer attempts to convince his commanding general that both the White Tiger and the "born-again" Naydёnov are creations not of man, but of the war itself. The general is unconvinced and sends the counterintelligence officer on 10-day leave, thinking the officer is exhausted or insane.  After the [[Battle of Berlin]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|surrender]] of Nazi Germany in May 1945, the counterintelligence officer meets Naydёnov in a field and tries to convince him to go home, saying that the war is over. But Naydёnov disagrees, saying that the war will not truly end until the White Tiger is destroyed. Naydёnov believes the White Tiger has gone into hiding and has been recovering from its wounds since their last battle. He claims it will return in several decades unless it is completely destroyed. Naydёnov then vanishes along with his tank, seemingly into thin air.  In the final scene, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] is shown seated in a large room with a fireplace, talking to a shadowy stranger and defending his actions during the war, saying that war has no beginning or end and that it is the original human state.  
White Night (2012 film)
 The plot appears to follow a man who returns to Korea for one night. He has been away for an extended period of time. At a cafe, he meets up with a past love or friend he left behind when he left Korea. The mousetached man is still upset about the past event, and perhaps also by him having left. He claims that he is involved someone different, as does the main character - "a 35 year old in Germany". Equally wounded, tears begin to form in the eye of the main character, and he abruptly leaves the cafe without saying goodbye, when his friend or past love goes back in to make another order.  Later in the evening, he is approached by a man in a red jacket. They quickly become acquainted and their communications escalate towards a sexual nature. He notices a scar on the back of the main character's shoulder. The main character becomes tentative and touchy, and decides suddenly he does not want to do anything sexual with the man in red, to the man in red's confusion. However, he still wants his company, and so after some small bickering, they head to a bar.  Suddenly the main character recognises a man in the bar, and chases after him, as they run through urban streets. The man in red follows, despite not understanding the situation. It is later revealed the main character was stabbed in a homophobic attack, and the man he chased after knows the man who stabbed him, and his current location - the pool hall. The man he met at the cafe in the beginning was also attacked. The main character states it is the reason he left Korea, as it shook his life up, and outed his sexuality publicly, leaving him stigmatised and outcast. They both head to the pool hall, despite the man in red's discouragement, and together they punch up the man who stabbed him a long time ago.  Afterwards, despite shallow bickering between them, and not being comfortable being open about their emotions, it becomes clear they feel affection and compassion towards one another. They head to a park and discuss their pasts. This time, when asked, the main character states he is seeing "a 24 year old in Germany," which would seem to imply he has lied both times and therefore is actually single - too hurt to become close to anyone since. They have sex and before parting ways the man in red gives him his number. The film ends on a cliffhanger with the main character staring at a payphone from a taxi, thinking about calling him.

Four years later, Kipps is instructed to visit Crythin Gifford to retrieve any relevant documents left by the deceased owner Alice Drablow. And as a prelude to orchestrate the sale of Eel Marsh House, an isolated and desolate estate on the marshland. Upon arrival, Arthur finds many of the villagers rather unwelcoming, though he finds sympathy in a wealthy local landowner Samuel Daily ([[Ciarán Hinds]]).  The next morning, Arthur goes to meet his legal contact, Mr. Jerome, who tries to hurry him away from the village. Arthur, undeterred, travels to Eel Marsh. There, he is distracted by odd noises, a bolted nursery, and the appearance of a spectral entity in funerary garb. He hears sounds on the marshes of a carriage in distress and a screaming child, but sees nobody on the [[causeway]]. He later attempts to alert the village constable, who dismisses him. Two children enter the station with their sister Victoria, who has ingested [[lye]], but she subsequently dies almost immediately afterwards.  That night, Sam reveals that he and his wife Elisabeth ([[Janet McTeer]]) lost their young son to drowning. Elisabeth suffers from fits of hysteria, which she attributes to her boy speaking through her. When Sam attempts to drive Arthur to Eel Marsh the next day, a fleet of local men attempt to drive him off. Victoria's father blames Arthur for his daughter's death, as Arthur saw "that woman" at Eel Marsh.  At the house, Arthur uncovers correspondence between Alice and her sister Jennet Humfrye ([[Liz White (actress)|Liz White]]). In her letters, Jennet denies Alice's verdict that she is "mentally unfit" to take care of her son, Nathaniel, and demands to see him, as the Drablows have formally adopted him, and barred her from contact. A death certificate reveals that Nathaniel drowned in a carriage accident on the marsh. The letter reveals that Jennet blames Alice for saving only herself and leaving Nathaniel's body in the marsh. The death certificates reveal that Jennet hanged herself from a beam in the nursery, vowing never to forgive Alice. That night, after the front door was tried for several minutes upsetting the dog that barks, Arthur goes outside in a thunderstorm and lightning and also sees visions of dead children in the marshes, Victoria among them.  Arthur finds the nursery no longer locked. Inside, he sees  the Woman in Black hanging herself. In town, Jerome's house catches fire with his daughter still inside. When Arthur attempts to save her, he sees the Woman in Black goading the girl into immolating herself. The townspeople blame Arthur for this death as well.  At her son's grave, Elisabeth tells Arthur that the Woman in Black is Jennet, who claims the village children by having them take their lives in penance for her own son being taken. Arthur realizes that his son Joseph, who is coming to Crythin Gifford that night, is Jennet's next victim. In an effort to lift the curse, Arthur and Sam find Nathaniel's body in the marsh, and place it in his nursery, where Arthur lures Jennet to him. Arthur and Sam bury Nathaniel with Jennet, though her voice echoes through the house that she will never forgive the wrongs she suffered.  Assuming Jennet pacified, Arthur and his son Joseph meet at the railway station. While bidding farewell to Sam, Arthur sees the Woman in Black lure Joseph onto the tracks towards an oncoming train. Though he attempts to save him, both Arthur and Joseph are killed by the oncoming train while a horrified Sam sees the spirits of the village children, and the Woman in Black.  After the train passes, Joseph spots a woman in white on the tracks, and Arthur identifies her as his late wife Stella, the family now happily reunited, as the Woman in Black looks ominously on.

Without a Net (film)
 In an abandoned parking lot in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[favela]] sits a [[circus]] [[tent]]—an incongruous sight, but no more unusual than its motley crew of young performers, searching for a life apart from the drug-related violence around them. As chronicled by first-time [[feature film]]maker Kelly J Richardson, putting on a show takes rigor and resourcefulness in their impoverished community, and even this modest production of [[Acrobatics|acrobats]] and [[contortion]]ists isn’t free of injuries and ego clashes. But the [[Big top (circus)|big top]] is their oasis, and the human drama of hope and ambition the greatest show on earth.  
Wither (film)
  The hunter Gunnar is looking for his daughter Lisa. He finds her lying on the ground being eaten alive by his wife. Gunnar shoots his wife twice in the head, killing her. The opening titles include rough sketches, showing the history of the Vættr.  The young couple Albin and Ida are planning a weekend trip to a remote cabin with Ida's brother, Simon, and a couple of friends. The group drive to a remote woodland area and are forced to walk the last bit. While walking to the cabin, the group notices Gunnar watching them from a cliff and the aggressive Simon shouts him off. The group finds the cabin locked, contrary to the information given by Albin's father, Olof. While Albin tries to pick the lock on the front door, his friend Marcus finds an open window on the backside and talks Marie into climbing in to scare the others. Marie climbs in and goes into the basement to investigate, finding an axe. She does not notice an earth-like creature watching her from the shadows.  The group finally gets into the cabin and is scared by Marie's sudden appearance. She does not seem to be well. While the others install themselves on the ground floor, Ida's [[goth (fashion)|goth]]-friend Tove brings Simon upstairs and instigates a sexual encounter with him despite knowing that Linnea is in love with Simon. The gang throws a party, but Marie's sickness gets worse and she attacks Tove, biting off her lip, and then spits blood in Linnea's eyes. Simon captures and binds Marie. Gunnar arrives at the cabin, suggesting the group should kill Marie. He tells them about the Vættr and how his own family were killed in the cabin just a few days prior. Gunnar informs the group that the Vættr have the ability to steal the souls of the living by looking in their eyes, turning them into the undead. Gunnar also warns them that the undead slaves of the Vættr are very infectious. While Marcus tends to Tove she is resurrected and attacks Marcus, wounding him. Gunnar arrives and saves Marcus but Tove manages to escape. Simon and Linnea arm themselves with shovels in the shed and go to fetch police aid which Albin was called for. Gunnar goes out to kill Tove, but she ambushes and bites him. Gunnar proceeds to beat Tove into a pulp before carving off her head with his fishing knife. Gunnar then commits suicide in the shed. Simon notices infection in Linnea's eyes and beats her unconscious and buries her alive. Overcome with grief over his action, he ignores his instruction and goes back to the cabin to save his sister. The aid of armed lawmen is now impossible. Meanwhile, Marie breaks free and attacks the others. Albin, Ida and Marcus fights her but Marcus dies before Albin crushes her head with a rock. Marcus turns into an undead and Albin and Ida has to hide upstairs, unable to escape. Simon arrives and tries to help them but is thrown from a window by Marcus. Simon survives but is attacked by Linnea and killed. Albin uses Ida's cellphone to determine that they can leave their hideout and Albin grabs the axe Simon had fetched before but dropped. Marcus and Linnea attack but Albin kills Linnea with the axe before Marucs take it from him. Albin and Ida lock themselves into a room and dig through the floor, dropping in the kitchen. Albin breaks his arm in the process. Marcus jumps after him, but Albin pushes a table beneath the hole, which Marcus impales himself on. Albin then kills him with a hammer. Simon attacks Ida and forces his blood into her mouth with a kiss. Albin is unable to save her and rushes to the shed and grabs Gunnar's rifle and manages to blow off Simon's head with a [[point blank|point-blank]] gun blast.  Albin returns but realises Ida is (un)dead too. Albin barely manages to fight back out of grief but finally kills Ida by dropping a heavy shelf on her. Albin cries for his girlfriend and his friends, but suddenly there is movement beneath the floorboards. The Vættr herself ascends from the basement and inspects the devastation. However, Albin closes his eyes and turns off the lights, rendering the ancient and fragile creature powerless. Albin drops the fridge on the Vættr, crushing it. Albin then leaves the cabin, now having become the "new Gunnar".

The Words (film)
 Clayton Hammond ([[Dennis Quaid]]) attends a public reading of his new book, ''The Words''. Clayton begins reading from his book which focuses on a fictional character named Rory Jansen ([[Bradley Cooper]]), an aspiring writer who lives in [[New York City]] with his girlfriend, Dora ([[Zoe Saldana]]). Rory borrows some money from his father ([[J. K. Simmons]]), gets a job as a mail supervisor at a literary agency and attempts to sell his first novel, which is repeatedly rejected by publishers.  After living together for some time, Rory and Dora marry and, during their honeymoon in [[Paris]], Dora buys Rory an old briefcase he was admiring from an antiques store. After returning to America and having his book rejected again, Rory finds an old but masterfully written manuscript in the briefcase with a central character named Jack. Rory types the manuscript into his laptop. Later, while using the laptop, Dora happens upon the novel and reads it. She mistakenly assumes that Rory wrote the novel and [[plagiarism|convinces him to give it to a publisher at work]], Joseph Cutler ([[Željko Ivanek]]). After a few months Joseph finally reads the manuscript and offers Rory a contract which he accepts. The book is a hit and Rory becomes famous.  At this point, Hammond takes a break from the reading and goes backstage, where he is introduced by his agent ([[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]]) to Daniella ([[Olivia Wilde]]), a student and amateur writer who wants to interview him and notes that he is separated from his wife, although he still wears a wedding ring. Hammond agrees to meet her after the ceremony and returns to the stage, where he continues to read the book.  The second part of the reading details Rory’s encounter with "The Old Man" ([[Jeremy Irons]]) in New York City's Central Park, who reveals himself as the true author of the manuscript and that it was based on his life in Paris. He explains that he was a young man ([[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]) when first stationed in [[France]] by the U.S. Army in the final days of [[World War II]], where he fell in love with Celia ([[Nora Arnezeder]]), a French waitress. They eventually married and had a daughter, but the baby died shortly after birth. Unable to cope with the loss, Celia left him and moved to her parents' house. He then used his pain as inspiration to write the manuscript, which he took to Celia while visiting her at her parents’ home. She found the story so moving that she chose to return to him. However, she unintentionally left the manuscript in a briefcase on the train after her trip back to Paris, thereby losing it. Because of the loss of the manuscript, their reconciliation was short-lived, and they divorced soon afterwards.  The public reading ends and Hammond tells his fans they must buy the book to learn how it ends. Daniella then accompanies Hammond back to his apartment where she pressures him into telling her more. Hammond explains that Rory tells the truth about the creation of the story, first to his wife and then to Cutler. Also, Rory tells Cutler he wants to credit the old man as the true author. Cutler angrily advises against this as it would severely damage both their reputations and recommends giving the old man a share of the book's profits instead.  Rory then seeks out the old man to pay him and finds him working in a plant nursery. The old man refuses the money but, after doing so, reveals that while once riding a train to work, years after his divorce, he spotted Celia with a new husband and a young son at a train station. The old man points out that people always move on from their mistakes, and Rory will too.  Daniella continues to pressure Hammond for more details. He reveals that the old man dies not long after Rory’s second meeting with him along with the secret about who the manuscript's author really is. Daniella deduces that ''The Words'' is actually an auto-biographical book, with Rory as Hammond's surrogate, and kisses him, reassuring him that people move on from their mistakes, but he pulls away. She asks him what he really wants, life or fiction. The film flashes to Dora reminiscing about her life with Rory, remembering happier times, and ends by telling him that "we're going to be fine."

Wrath of the Titans
 [[Perseus]] ([[Sam Worthington]]), a son of [[Zeus]] ([[Liam Neeson]]), lives as a fisherman after the death of his wife, [[Io (mythology)|Io]] (portrayed by [[Gemma Arterton]] in the previous film), with his young son, [[Heleus|Helius]] ([[John Bell (Scottish actor)|John Bell]]). Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal. They can no longer sustain the walls of [[Tartarus]] which are crumbling, and the imprisoned [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus|Kronos]] will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get involved.  Zeus meets his brothers [[Hades]] ([[Ralph Fiennes]]) and [[Poseidon]] ([[Danny Huston]]), and his son [[Ares]] ([[Édgar Ramírez]]) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to make a deal with Kronos: in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's [[Ichor|divine power]] to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world.  After killing a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his Demigod son [[Agenor]] ([[Toby Kebbell]]) who will lead him to [[Hephaestus]], who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his [[trident]] and succumbs to the injuries he sustained when meeting Hades. Perseus, [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] ([[Rosamund Pike]]), and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. Agenor explains that Hephaestus created three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's thunderbolt, Hades's [[bident|pitchfork]], and Poseidon's trident, and that these weapons can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. After an encounter with [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], the travelers eventually meet the now mortal Hephaestus ([[Bill Nighy]]) and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to Tartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to enable Perseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the labyrinth.  The group eventually enters Tartarus. Meanwhile, Zeus has been almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens. Zeus apologizes to Hades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has forgiven Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos in contrast to Ares, who still wants to proceed to the former's revival. Perseus arrives and frees Zeus. Ares wounds Zeus with Hades' pitchfork, allowing Perseus to obtain it before he and the others escape Tartarus with Zeus.  Aiming to retrieve Zeus' thunderbolt from Ares in order to defeat Kronos, Perseus challenges him to a duel. Ares accepts. Meanwhile, Andromeda's army is overwhelmed by the [[Machai|Makhai]]. Hades revives Zeus and together they defeat the creatures. Kronos appears and begins to attack Andromeda's army. Zeus and Hades hold off Kronos while Perseus duels Ares eventually killing him with the thunderbolt. Combining the gods' weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus destroys Kronos, traveling to his heart and throwing the spear into it.  Zeus reconciles with Perseus and then dies of his wounds. Hades tells Perseus that now he is powerless and leaves. Perseus kisses Andromeda. Helius tells his father that he wants to return to his life as a fisherman, but Perseus tells him they can't. Perseus encourages Helius to be proud of himself, as his son and the grandson of Zeus. The film ends with Perseus giving his sword to Helius.

Wreck-It Ralph
  When Litwak's Family Fun Center & [[Amusement arcade|Arcade]] closes at night, the various [[video game]] characters leave their normal in-game roles and socialize in a [[power strip]]. Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of the game ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'', is ostracized by its other characters for just doing his job, while the titular hero Felix is praised and rewarded medals for protecting the inhabitants from Ralph. Tired of being mistreated, Ralph announces at the game's thirtieth anniversary party that he will earn his neighbors' respect by winning a medal.  Ralph learns he can obtain a medal from the [[first-person shooter]], ''Hero's Duty''. After disrupting a game session, Ralph scales the game's central beacon and obtains a medal, only to hatch a Cy-Bug, one of the game's monsters, which can adapt to other environments and incorporate the artifacts that it devours from those places into its body. Ralph and the Cy-Bug stumble into an [[escape pod]], which is launched out of the game, and crash land in ''Sugar Rush'', a candy-themed [[kart racing game]].  With Ralph missing, his game is labelled as malfunctioning and faces being unplugged. Felix, upon learning from [[Q*bert]] that Ralph has left his game, ventures to ''Hero's Duty'' and allies with the game's heroine, Sergeant Calhoun, to retrieve Ralph and the Cy-Bug. Felix explains to Calhoun that he fears Ralph has "gone Turbo", an idiom the arcade inhabitants use in reference to a racer named "Turbo" who abandoned his [[Racing video game|auto-racing game]] and attempted to take over a more popular title, glitching them and resulting in both being unplugged.  A little girl, Vanellope von Schweetz, steals Ralph's medal to buy her way into the nightly race to determine which characters players can choose as their avatar. King Candy, the ruler of ''Sugar Rush'', forbids her from racing because she has [[Glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]] that cause her to [[Teleportation|teleport]] erratically. Ralph and Vanellope agree to work together to retrieve his medal and help her win a race. They build a kart and hide out at Diet Cola Mountain, an unfinished race track, where Ralph teaches her to drive. King Candy [[Hacker culture|hacks]] the game's code to obtain Ralph's medal, and offers it to Ralph in exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He claims that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches will be brought to the attention of players and ''Sugar Rush'' will be unplugged; the glitched Vanellope cannot leave her game, and she will be left to die while King Candy and his subjects become homeless in the arcade. Ralph reluctantly agrees and destroys Vanellope's kart. On returning to his own game, which has been evacuated in anticipation of it being unplugged the next morning, he notices Vanellope's image on the side of the ''Sugar Rush'' cabinet and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.  Meanwhile, Felix and Calhoun search ''Sugar Rush'' for Ralph. Felix falls in love with Calhoun, but she abandons him when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fiancé. Felix is later imprisoned in King Candy's castle, but Ralph frees him and Vanellope, and Felix fixes the kart. Calhoun discovers a swarm of Cy-Bug eggs underground, which hatch and start devouring the game.  Vanellope participates in the race, but is attacked by King Candy. Vanellope's glitch reveals he is actually Turbo, who took over ''Sugar Rush'', displacing Vanellope as the main character. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope is trapped due to her glitches. When Calhoun points out that the Cy-Bugs can be destroyed by a beacon of light as in ''Hero's Duty'', Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain erupt to replicate it. During his attempts Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with the Cy-Bug that devoured him. Ralph makes the mountain erupt and falls into its depths, but Vanellope saves him using her glitch. The volcanic beacon destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo.  Vanellope crosses the finish line, rebooting ''Sugar Rush'' and restoring her status and memory as Princess Vanellope, the main character of the game. Ralph and Felix return home and their game is spared. Felix and Calhoun marry, Vanellope gains popularity as a playable character due to her teleporting glitch, and a content Ralph gains respect from his fellow characters.  
Would You Rather (film)
 Iris, a young woman caring for her sick brother Raleigh, is unable to afford the costs of his treatment for [[leukemia]]. Her brother's [[oncologist]], Dr. Barden, introduces Iris to Shepard Lambrick, a philanthropist, who offers her a deal: if she wins a parlor game at a dinner party, his charitable foundation will pay for Raleigh's treatment and locate a bone marrow donor for him immediately. Dr. Barden was a former winner of the game. Iris reluctantly accepts.  The next day at Lambrick's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, a [[Paraplegia|paralyzed]] elderly woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Cal; Amy; and Conway, an alcoholic debtor.  A steak and foie gras dinner is served but Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepard then offers her $10,000 to compromise her principles; she accepts his offer and eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers him $10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines, Shepard offers him $50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch. Conway accepts the $50,000 and reluctantly drinks the Scotch.  After dinner ends, the game begins. Shepard reveals it to be a version of the party game "[[would you rather|Would you rather...?]]", in which players must choose between two options. Shepard gives his guests the opportunity to leave without playing, but everyone stays. After Shepard's butler, a former MI5 agent named Bevans, wheels in an electric shock machine, the drunken Conway attempts to leave but is shot dead. Each contestant is then given 15 seconds to choose between shocking themselves or another person. Cal shocks himself instead of Amy. Amy shocks Linda, who temporarily passes out. Linda shocks Peter, who attempts to leave but is threatened by Bevans. Lucas is shocked next by Travis; then Lucas refuses to shock Iris, instead, shocking himself for the second time in a row and passing out. Iris then chooses to shock herself instead of Cal. During the break, Travis and Julian get into an argument.  In the second round, each contestant has 30 seconds to choose between stabbing someone in the thigh with an [[ice pick]] or whipping Travis three times with a [[sjambok]]. After Iris debates her options of stabbing Cal or whipping Travis, Travis willingly submits to being whipped by Iris and Lucas to save anyone from being stabbed. Julian smirks and snickers as Travis is whipped, revealing that Julian is behind Travis' fate. Travis is then given the option to either stab Lucas or take three lashes from Bevans. He chooses to take the lashings, despite Lucas' attempts to stop him from doing so. Knowing Travis will not survive another whipping, Peter stabs and accidentally kills Linda when he hits her [[femoral artery]]. Linda stabs Amy right before she dies, and Amy elbows her in the nose. Amy, who is more focused on eliminating everyone else, is allowed to stab any player she likes and chooses Iris. Instead of stabbing Iris in the leg she stabs her on her side, close to her lung, trying to get Iris eliminated by killing her. With Travis and Lucas' help, Iris lives. Cal chooses to whip Travis so he'll have a higher chance of winning by rendering Travis unresponsive.  Lucas causes a distraction, and everyone but Amy attempts to escape the room. Cal advances on Shepard with the sjambok as Lucas attacks the guards and Iris escapes. After Shepard shoots and kills Cal, the others surrender. Shepard sends Bevans and Julian after Iris. Julian finds Iris first and attempts to rape her, but she stabs him with the ice pick. Dr. Barden, who has had second thoughts about sending Iris to Shepard, breaks into the mansion to save her. Drawn by her cries, Barden and Bevans converge on her. Bevans kills Barden, escorts Iris back to the game, and sends Julian upstairs.  After Bevans and Shepard apologize to Iris for Julian's behavior, the third round begins a 30 second choice between getting dunked in a barrel for two minutes or an unknown task written on a card sealed until after the player chooses. Peter chooses his card, which requires him to light a firecracker in his hand. Shepard has Bevans secure a quarter stick of dynamite in place with duct tape. The explosion destroys Peter's hand, causing a heart attack, and he dies. Lucas' card forces him to slit open his own eye within 30 seconds. Iris chooses the barrel and survives; her card is revealed to have been the extraction of all of her teeth. Amy, whose ex-husband drowned her daughter, chooses her card and finds that she must be dunked for four minutes. Amy drowns.  Only Iris and Lucas remain for the fourth round. Iris wins a coin toss to go first. She is given the choice to either shoot and kill Lucas to win the game, or spare him which would result in both walking away empty-handed. As Lucas attempts to talk her into sparing him and explains the struggles of his family, she abruptly shoots and kills him. Shepard crowns her the champion, gives her a bag full of money and explains that a donor has already been located for her brother and he will have surgery later that week as well as financial support to her continuing her studies. At home, Iris finds Raleigh asleep on his bed so she heads to shower the blood off her. After the shower, she goes to her brother's room only to find Raleigh was not sleeping but had committed suicide by overdosing on his medication, and Iris cries out in anguish.

Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines
  After The Hillicker Brothers (Three Finger, Saw Tooth and One Eye) [[Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings|escape from the Glensville Sanatorium]], now along with the help of serial killer Maynard Odets (later called the "Old Man" from the first two films) start a murderous rampage near the city of Fairlake, Greenbrier County, West Virginia, where they first murder news reporter Kaleen Webber.  Meanwhile, five friends, Billy (Simon Ginty), his girlfriend Cruz (Amy Lennox), Lita ([[Roxanne McKee]]), her boyfriend, Gus (Paul Luebke), and Julian (Oliver Hoare), are on their way to Fairlake, West Virginia to celebrate the Mountain Man Music Festival for Halloween. Along the way to the town, they almost run over Maynard, who was standing in the middle of the road, and crash their car into a tree while trying to avoid hitting him. As they get out of the car to check if he is alive, he suddenly tries to cut one of them. Billy, Gus, and Julian attack Maynard out of self-defense. Sheriff Angela Carter ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]) and her partner, Deputy Biggs (Kyle Redman Jones), drive by, witness them kicking Maynard, and apprehend the entire group, including Lita and Cruz. While Angela leaves to take them to the police station, she asks Deputy Biggs to stay back with their crashed car until a tow comes. As soon as the Sheriff leaves, the cannibals appear and kill Deputy Biggs.  After being locked up in the police station, Billy confesses to Angela that he owns the drugs and convinces her to let the others go. He stays at the police station while they are released. Meanwhile, Angela discovers Maynard is a fugitive wanted for murder and makes arrangements to turn him over to the proper authorities the next morning. Maynard promises her she won't live that long.   Elsewhere, the cannibals use their truck to pull down a phone pole, taking out service to the town.  They then proceed to the power plant, where they kill a guard and shut down the town's electricity.  Most of the townspeople are attending the festival in a nearby town.  The teens register at a motel. On her way to visit Billy in the holding cell at the police station, Cruz is chased by Three Finger, who kills her. Julian heads to the police station a short time later but doesn't notice Cruz being eviscerated down a side street; he arrives uneventfully, only to learn Cruz never made it.  At the motel, Gus is captured when he answers the door. Lita is attacked by Saw Tooth but manages to escape. The cannibals proceed to break Gus's legs, then dump him in front of Angela's  office. Angela attempts to save him, but the cannibals run over him with their pick-up truck, killing him. Angela frees Billy and gives him, Julian and prisoner Mose ([[Duncan Wisbey]]) shotguns after deputizing them.  Angela manages to communicate with someone via shortwave radio asking them to call for backup, but the man on the other end thinks the message is a joke. Lita manages to make it to Angela's office but is almost killed when Mose shoots through the door as she tries to open it. Angela warns Julian and Billy not to go looking for Cruz, but they ignore her warning and go in search of her anyway. They wander the streets and find Cruz's dead body; while trying to get the body to Angela's office, they encounter the cannibals, get captured, and are placed in a soccer field where Three Finger kills them with a snow blower. Angela sends Mose to search for the deputies, but he unknowingly runs over barbed wire in the road and crashes. He awakens to find himself captured by the cannibals, who burn him alive.  After hearing Mose's accident over the radio, Angela tries to go for help but discovers her husband bound in a car and tries to help him. She discovers too late that it's a trap, and he dies; she is then knocked out and captured by Three Finger. After Angela leaves, Maynard convinces Lita that if she releases him, he will let her live. However, after releasing him, Maynard proceeds to stab Lita's eyes out and threatens to rape her. Maynard leaves the jail to meet up with "his boys," and Lita stumbles out the opened door. Carter awakens in the jail cell with her hands tied to the ceiling; Maynard gives Carter the option of her death:  being burned alive or killed by a shotgun with its trigger tied to her feet, which will go off if she steps down. They then proceed to burn down the cell.  As her feet begin to burn, Angela eventually triggers the shotgun, killing herself.

He escapes the villainous slave trader Moreno (voiced by [[Thierry Frémont]]) and comes across a young giraffe and its mother. Moreno catches up to Maki and kills the mother giraffe. Maki promises the calf’s mother that he’ll protect and nurture her. Just as Moreno is about to take him to his slave camp, Hassan, a [[Bedouin]] nomad ([[Simon Abkarian]]), intervenes and saves his life. Maki follows Hassan as soon as he takes the giraffe with him. Hassan names the giraffe [[Zarafa (giraffe)|Zarafa]] (Arabic for “giraffe”) and reluctantly agrees to take care of Maki and Zarafa.  They come across a merchant, Mahmoud, who gives them two [[Dzo|Tibetan cow]]s, Mounh and Sounh. Maki discovers Soula being forced into slave labor by Moreno. When the evil man turns his attention on Maki, Soula hits him with a palm leaf, but before Moreno can beat her with his whip, Maki cries out for her and Hassan steps in. Maki thanks Hassan for saving him.  Hassan is on a mission to the [[Pasha of Egypt]], [[Mehemet Ali]], who wants to offer a young giraffe to the [[King of France]], [[Charles X]], to convince him to unite his country against the Turks besieging Alexandria. Maki and Hassan join together with the [[aeronaut]] Malaterre (voiced by [[François-Xavier Demaison]]), who agrees to take Zarafa to Paris via a hot air balloon. Hassan convinces Maki to leave Zarafa, but Malaterre thinks otherwise, seeing Maki’s determination, and takes the boy with them. The basket gets heavy, so the cows jump overboard, and Hassan unwittingly tosses Maki after them, as Maki is hidden in a bale of hay. Maki and the two cows land on a pirate ship, where they come across the pirate queen Bouboulina and her ragtag crew. Maki explains that he is in pursuit of a treasure of great value aboard the balloon. Instead of taking him prisoner, Bouboulina welcomes Maki to her crew. Meanwhile, Moreno is determined to hunt down Maki and arrives on shore with Soula in tow. Bouboulina and her crew rescue Maki and scare off Moreno and his henchmen. The group continues on their journey. During a perilous crossing of the mountains where the balloon crashed, one of the cows is taken by a pack of wolves.  Hassan, Maki, Malaterre, and the surviving cow eventually reach Paris. The cynical King Charles accepts the gift but refuses to help the Pasha. Zarafa is shut away in [[Jardin des Plantes|the city zoo]], and Maki stays firm about returning the giraffe to her home. Moreno kidnaps him and forces him to work in his household. Hassan is ashamed that he had failed his mission and mortified to have lost Maki, so he sinks into despair and alcohol. As several years pass, Zarafa’s appearance causes "giraffe mania" and she grows up. Maki finds himself at zoo with Soula. King Charles is receiving a new hippopotamus, and, remembering an experience he had with one before meeting Hassan, Maki tells Soula to hold up her parasol. Maki does the same and the hippo squirts a colossal pile of dung onto King Charles and his subjects, giving the children enough time to make a getaway. They manage to find Malaterre and Maki plans to escape with Zarafa in the hot air balloon. The trio locate Hassan, but the nomad is unable to help them, since he has become an alcoholic. They rush to free Zarafa, but now she is too large to fit into the balloon. Maki realizes that he must give up Zarafa and escape with Soula. Moreno appears and prepares to kill Maki, but Hassan steps in to protect them and is shot. Aided by Malaterre, Maki and Soula escape in the balloon. Moreno gives chase, but the two friends bite him and he falls off the basket and into an enclosure where he is devoured by a polar bear. Maki and Soula return home, marry, and found a flourishing new village. Hassan, treated at the hospital, survives his wounds and falls in love with Bouboulina. As it turns out, the storyteller is actually Maki himself.  
Zombibi

Curious, they leave the station, and zombies attack them; Kim saves them, and they return to the station.   Television broadcasts reveal that a Russian space probe, contaminated with a green slime, has caused the residents of Amsterdam-West to turn into zombies.  Aziz becomes worried when he sees that the probe crashed into his office building, and when he receives a call for help from Tess, he insists that they go there to rescue her.  The others refuse and instead suggest that they go to a designated shelter.  After they loot a sporting goods store for equipment, Aziz sets off on his own to rescue Tess, and Kim reluctantly accompanies him, equally impressed and annoyed with his dedication to Tess.  They do not get far before they are swamped by zombies, and they rejoin the rest of the group, who have accidentally killed [[Ben Saunders (singer)|Ben Saunders]].  The group retreats to a chop shop, where the mechanics demonstrate that the green slime is an energy source.  When the mechanics turn into zombies, the group splits up: Aziz and Kim set off to rescue Tess, and Joris convinces the others to rob a bank.

Caught between his brother and his girlfriend, Aziz decides to first help his brother.  Kim and Aziz rescue Jeffrey and Mo, but they end up stranded at a playground.  They are rescued by the Barachi brothers, who, in a video game sequence, defeat the zombies and then leave.  When the group arrives at the shelter, soldiers refuse to assist Aziz in rescuing Tess, and he steals a truck.  The others join him, and they set off for the office building.  Jeffrey, now armed with a minigun, holds off the zombie hordes while Aziz, Mo, and Kim work their way up the building, only to find out that Tess was already rescued by a former lover.   Furious at the pointlessness, Kim leaves on her own and randomly encounters Tess, who has now transformed into a zombie.  At the same time, Aziz and Mo reach the building's roof, where a Russian commando explains his plan to blow up the building.  Before he can, he is bitten, turns into a zombie, and bites Mo, who decides to stay behind and use the detonator.  Aziz finds Kim just as she beheads Tess, and Aziz hurriedly explains about the explosives.  Jeffrey, who has climbed the entire building while toting his minigun, follows them back down the staircase.  As zombies swarm Mo, he triggers the explosives, and the building collapses; Aziz, Kim, and Jeffrey escape with the help of the Barachi brothers.  When they triumphantly return to the shelter, they see the soldiers suck the blood from survivors.  Aziz says that he hates vampires, and they prepare for another fight.  
Zero Dark Thirty
 Maya ([[Jessica Chastain]]) is a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] analyst, recruited "out of high school" around 1999, tasked with finding the [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] ([[Ricky Sekhon]]). In 2003 she is stationed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|U.S. embassy in Pakistan]]. She and fellow officer Dan ([[Jason Clarke]]), attend the [[blacksite]] interrogations of [[Ammar al-Baluchi|Ammar]] ([[Reda Kateb]]), a detainee with suspected links to several of the 2001 [[hijackers in the September 11 attacks]], who is subjected to [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|approved torture interrogation techniques]]. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in [[Saudi Arabia]], but does reveal to Maya the previously unknown name of the personal courier for bin Laden, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]]. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] (Yoav Levi) and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; she interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.  In 2009, during the [[Camp Chapman attack]], Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica ([[Jennifer Ehle]]) is killed. On the same day a case manager that likes the Abu Ahmed lead, shares with her an interrogation with a Jordanian detainee claiming to have personally buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier, that Morocco caught Ibrihim Sayeed traveling under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]]. She speculates that the CIA's photograph of "Abu Ahmed" is that of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make all of the brothers look alike. This would explain Ammar's account of Abu Ahmed's "death" in 2001.  Maya wants the telephone number of Ibrihim Sayeed's mother, and it comes from a Kuwaiti prince for the price of a [[Lamborghini]]. CIA operatives use electronic methods to pinpoint a caller in a vehicle who persistently exhibits [[tradecraft]] behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity. The vehicle is physically tracked to a large urban compound in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan, near the [[Pakistan Military Academy]]. Gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle; the action indicates to the agency that her cover is blown, so she is recalled to Washington, D.C.  When the compound is put under surveillance, the habits and culture of the inhabitants are analyzed but no conclusive photographic identification of bin Laden is obtained. The President's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Two [[stealth helicopter]]s from [[Area 51]] are flown by the Army's [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] to enter Pakistan, insert members of [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU]] and the CIA's [[Special Activities Division|SAD/SOG]] and raid the compound. Before briefing President [[Barack Obama]], the CIA Director ([[James Gandolfini]]) holds a meeting of his senior officers, who assess that bin Laden being there is a chance of 60–80%, rather than another high-value target. Maya, also in attendance, uses the "habits" intelligence to shore-up her conclusion to 100% that bin Laden is there.  The raid is approved and is [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Execution of the operation|executed on May 2, 2011]]. A helicopter crashes, the SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people within the compound—among them a man in the building who is believed to be bin Laden. At a U.S. base in [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, Maya visually confirms the identity of the corpse. Maya is seen boarding a military transport to return to the U.S.; the only passenger in the vast interior. The pilot asks her the destination; she does not reply.  As the plane's cargo-hold door closes, Maya begins to cry softly.<ref></ref>

 Samuel Peters ([[Edward Furlong]]), once an ordinary man, dabbles in the laws of [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] to bring his wife back from the grave. He soon encounters the god of malevolence, [[Kalfu]] ([[Corey Feldman]]), and makes a pact with him to destroy the underworld and bring chaos to earth. In return, he will become the Zombie King and walk the earth for eternity with his late wife. But as the growing horde of zombies begins to wipe out a countryside town, the government creates a perimeter around the town and employs a shoot-on-sight policy. Trapped within the town, the locals, an unlikely bunch of misfits, must fight for their lives and unite in order to survive.
