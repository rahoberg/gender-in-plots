8 Women
 The film is set in the 1950s in a large country residence as a family and its servants are preparing for [[Christmas]]. When the master of the house is discovered dead in his bed with a dagger in his back, it is presumed that the murderer must be one of the eight women in the house. Over the course of the investigation, each woman has a tale to tell and secrets to hide.  The scene opens with Suzon returning from school for Christmas break, finding her mother Gaby, her younger sister Catherine, and her [[wheelchair]]-bound grandmother Mamy in the living room, where most of the action of the film takes place. Their conversation drifts to the subject of the patriarch of the family, Marcel, and Catherine leads the first song of the film, "Papa t'es plus dans le coup" (roughly, "Dad, you're out of touch"). The singing wakes up Suzon and Catherine's aunt Augustine, who initiates arguments with the rest of the family and the two servants (Madame Chanel and Louise), eventually returning upstairs and threatening to commit [[suicide]]. Mamy jumps out of her wheelchair trying to stop her, haphazardly explaining her ability to walk as a "Christmas miracle." Augustine is eventually calmed down, and she sings her song of longing, "[[Message personnel]]" (Personal Message).  The maid takes a tray upstairs, finds Marcel's stabbed body, and screams. Catherine goes up to see what has happened and locks the door. The others finally go up to Marcel's room to see him stabbed in the back. Catherine tells the others that they should not disturb the room until the police arrive, so they re-lock the door. Realizing that the dogs did not bark the night before the incident, it becomes clear that the murderer was known to the dogs and therefore must be one of the women in the house. Attempting to call the authorities, they find that the telephone line has been cut, so they will have to go in person to the police station. Before they can do so, the women are distracted by the announcement that someone is roaming the garden, someone whom the guard dogs are not chasing. The person turns out to be Marcel's sister Pierrette, a [[nightclub singer]] who is also rumored to be a prostitute, and who has not been allowed into the house before due to Gaby's dislike for her. When questioned, she claims that she received a mysterious telephone call in which she was informed her that her brother was dead. She sings "A quoi sert de vivre libre" (What's the point of living free?), commenting on her sexual freedom.  It is realized that she has been to the house before, as the dogs did not bark and she knew immediately which room belonged to her brother, making her the eighth potential killer. The women try to start the car, and find that it has been sabotaged, cutting them off from help until the storm subsides and they can hitchhike to town. The women spend their time trying to identify the murderer amongst them. It is learned that Suzon returned the night before to tell her father in secret that she was [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. She sings a song to Catherine, "Mon Amour, Mon Ami" (My Lover, My Friend), about her lover; however, she was sexually abused by her father. We later learn that Suzon is not Marcel's child but is the child of Gaby's first great love who was killed not long after the child was conceived; every time Gaby looks at Suzon she is reminded of her love for him.  Suspicion then swings to Madame Chanel, the housekeeper, whose actions the night before seem suspicious. It is revealed that she had been having an affair with Pierrette, who went to see her brother that night to ask for money to pay off her debts. When some members of the family react in outrage to the fact that she is a [[lesbian]], Madame Chanel retreats to the kitchen, and sings "Pour ne pas vivre seul" (So as to not live alone).  In the meantime we find out that Mamy, Suzon and Catherine's "old and sick" grandmother, not only can walk but also possesses some valuable stock shares that could have saved Marcel from his bankruptcy. Out of greed, she lied that her shares had been stolen by someone who knew where she was hiding them. The spotlight moves to Louise, the new maid, who is found out to be Marcel's mistress. She declares affection for Gaby, but also expresses disappointment in her for her weakness and indecision. She sings "Pile ou Face" (literally Heads or Tails, but referring to the Ups and Downs of life), and removes the symbols of her servitude, her maid's cap and apron, asserting herself as an equal to the other women. Gaby sings "Toi Jamais" (Never You), about Marcel, saying that he never paid enough attention to her, while other men did. It is revealed that she had an affair with Marcel's business partner, Jacques Farneaux, the same man who has been having an affair with Pierrette. The two women get into a fight that turns into a passionate make-out session on the living room floor, a scene which the others walk in on and are stunned by.  Eventually, Madame Chanel discovers the solution to the mystery, but she is silenced by a gunshot. While not struck by the bullet, she becomes mute out of shock. Catherine takes the lead, revealing that she hid in her father's closet from where she saw all the other women talk to Marcel the night before. She explains the mystery: Marcel faked his own death, with her help, to see what was really going on in his house. She says that he is now free of the other women's clutches and rushes to his bedroom only to witness Marcel shoot himself in the head. Mamy closes the film with the song "Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux" (There is no happy love) as the women clasp hands and face the audience.  
8 Mile (film)

Although encouraged by his friends, Jimmy worries about his potential as a rapper. He falters during a [[Battle rap|rap battle]] one night at a local venue, the Shelter, and he leaves the stage humiliated.  Jimmy works at a car factory. When he asks for extra shifts, his supervisor laughs and dismisses his request on account of his habitual lateness. Jimmy befriends a woman named Alex. Over time, Jimmy begins to take more responsibility for the direction of his life. When he exhibits an improved attitude and performance at work, his supervisor grants him the extra shifts he requested.  Stephanie receives a notice evicting her and the family as she cannot pay rent. Despite Stephanie's best attempts to keep the eviction notice a secret, Greg finds out about it. A fight ensues between him and Jimmy, and Greg leaves Stephanie for good. Jimmy's friendship with Wink, a radio DJ with ties to a record label promoter, becomes strained after he discovers that Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, a rap group known as the "Leaders of the Free World." At one point, Jimmy and his friends get into a violent brawl with the Leaders, which is disrupted when Jimmy's friend Cheddar Bob pulls out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg; he survives but is confined to crutches.  At work one day when on lunch break, Jimmy witnesses a rap battle in which an employee insults a gay co-worker, Paul. Jimmy joins the battle and defends Paul. Alex is impressed by Jimmy's actions; they have sex in the factory. Wink arranges for Jimmy to meet with producers at a recording studio, but Jimmy finds Wink and Alex engaging in intercourse. Enraged, Jimmy attacks Wink as Alex tries to break up their altercation. In retaliation, Wink and the Leaders of the Free World assault Jimmy outside his mother's trailer. The leader of the gang, Papa Doc, holds Jimmy at gunpoint, threatening to kill him before being dissuaded by Wink.  Jimmy's best friend and battle host, Future, pushes him to get revenge by competing against the Leaders of the Free World at the next rap battle. However, Jimmy's late-night shift conflicts with the timing of the next battle tournament. A goodbye visit from Alex, who is moving to New York, changes his mind about competing, and Paul agrees to cover his shift at work as a favor while Jimmy goes to the battle.  In all rounds of the rap battle, Jimmy has to compete against one member of "the Leaders." After winning the first two rounds, he has to challenge Papa Doc. He wins by exposing his opponent's weaknesses as well as his own. With nothing to say in rebuttal, Papa Doc hands the microphone back to Future, embarrassed. After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Jimmy is offered a position by Future, hosting battles at The Shelter. Jimmy declines, saying he has to get back to work and to find success his own way.

24 Hour Party People
 In 1976 television presenter [[Tony Wilson]] sees [[the Sex Pistols]] perform at the [[Free Trade Hall|Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall]] for the first time. Inspired, Wilson starts a weekly series of [[punk rock]] shows at a Manchester club, where the newly formed [[Joy Division]] perform, led by the erratic, brooding [[Ian Curtis]].  Wilson founds a record label, [[Factory Records]], and signs Joy Division as the first band; the contract is written in Wilson's blood and gives the Factory artists full control over their music. He hires irascible producer [[Martin Hannett]] to record Joy Division, and soon the band and label have a hit record. In 1980, just before Joy Division is to tour the United States, Curtis hangs himself. Joy Division rename themselves [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and record a hit single, "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]".  Wilson opens a nightclub, [[The HaÃ§ienda]]; business is slow at first, but eventually the club is packed each night. Wilson signs another hit band, [[Happy Mondays]], led by [[Shaun Ryder]], and the [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]-fuelled [[rave]] culture is born.  Despite the apparent success, Factory Records is losing money. Every copy of "Blue Monday" sold loses five pence, as the intricately designed packaging by [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]] costs more than the single's sale price. Wilson pays for New Order to record [[Technique (album)|a new album]] in Ibiza, but after two years, they still have not delivered a record. He pays for the Happy Mondays to record their [[Yes Please!|fourth studio album]] in Barbados, but Ryder spends all the recording money on drugs. When Wilson finally receives the finished album, he finds that Ryder has refused to record vocals, and all the tracks are instrumentals. At the HaÃ§ienda, ecstasy use is curbing alcohol sales and attracting gang violence.  The Factory partners try to save the business by selling the label to [[London Records]] but when Wilson reveals that the label does not hold binding contracts with any of its artists, the deal falls through. While smoking [[marijuana]] on the roof of HaÃ§ienda after its closing night, Wilson has a vision of God who assures Wilson he has earned a place in history.  
25th Hour
 A canary yellow vintage [[Super Bee]] pulls up short on a [[New York City]] street, and Montgomery "Monty" Brogan gets out with his buddy Kostya to look at a dog lying in the road. The animal was mauled in a [[Dog fighting|dogfight]] so Monty intends to shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye. Monty decides to take the dog to a nearby clinic instead.  Fast forward to late 2002. Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, on his last day of freedom. He plans to meet childhood friends Frank Slaughtery and Jacob Elinsky at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle. Frank is a hotshot [[Trader (finance)|trader]] on [[Financial market|Wall Street]]; Jacob is an introverted high school teacher with a crush on 17-year-old Mary, one of his students.  Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic who owns a bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. Monty's drug money helped James keep the bar, so a remorseful James sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone else: all the New York stereotypes he can think of, from the cabbies to the firefighters, the corner grocers to the mobsters, as if he hates them all. Finally, he turns on himself, revealing that he is actually angry for getting greedy and having not given up drug dealing before he was caught.  In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] detectives come to Monty's apartment while he's still there. They find the drugs immediately and not after any real search, suggesting that Monty had been betrayed. Monty sold drugs for Uncle Nikolai, a [[Russian Mafia|Russian mobster]]. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who turned him in,  since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to [[turn state's evidence]] against Nikolai, but he's not sure what Nikolai will do at the club that night. Monty remembers how he met Naturelle when she was 18, hanging around his old school, and how happy they were. He asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him.  Jacob sees Mary outside the club, so Monty invites her inside with them. Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together, even though he told Jacob he believes Monty's life is over, and that Monty deserves his sentence for dealing drugs. Frank accuses Naturelle of living high on Monty's money, not caring where it came from, but she reminds Frank that he knew as well and said nothing. The argument culminates in Frank's insulting Naturelle's ethnicity, followed by her slapping Frank and leaving. Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both appear to be in [[acute stress reaction|shock]] afterwards and go their separate ways.  Monty and Kostya go see Uncle Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai then reveals it was Kostya, not Naturelle, who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father's bar. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that he had asked Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters.  Monty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. At the park, he transfers custody of Doyle to Jacob. Then he admits that he is terrified of being [[Prison Rape|raped]] in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to brutally beat him, saying if he goes in ugly he might have a chance at survival. Frank refuses, so Monty deliberately provokes him. Frank is goaded into taking out his frustration, leaving Monty bruised and bloody, with a broken nose. Frank is in tears as Monty gets up and goes home.  Naturelle tries to comfort him as Monty's father arrives to take him to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville]]. On the drive to prison, James suggests they go west, into hiding, giving Monty one last vision of freedom. Once again Monty sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city, followed by a vision of a future where Monty avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old. As the fantasy ends, we see Monty, his eyes closed and face still bruised, sitting in the passenger's seat of the car, which has driven past the bridge to the west and towards prison.

16 December (film)
 A four-member teamâVir Vijay Singh ([[Danny Denzongpa]]), Vikram ([[Milind Soman]]), Sheeba ([[Dipannita Sharma]]), and Victor ([[Sushant Singh]]) who are [[Indian Revenue Service]] officers belonging to the [[Directorate of Revenue Intelligence|Department of Revenue Intelligence]], who have been wrongly implicated in the killing of their corrupt superior officer and removed from service, are hired by the Chief of the same agency to investigate a series of large [[Money Laundering]]s. The team members Vikram ([[Milind Soman]]) and Sheeba ([[Dipannita Sharma]]) are in love with each other.The team is equipped with hi-tech equipment such as mini spy cameras, computers, internet and other communication devices. Through various encounters they discover that the money is being transferred to a [[Swiss Bank]] account. By means of an Indian employee, Sonal Joshi (Aditi Govitrikar) working in the Auckland (New Zealand) branch of the same bank, they investigate the account in New Zealand and, with her help, find that the money is being transferred to an international terrorist organization named KAALA KHANJAR. This organization, working in conjunction with Dost Khan (Gulshan Grover), manages to smuggle a Russian-made nuclear bomb into India. Dost Khan plans to explode the nuclear bomb on the same day, '16 December'.  Although the ruling dictator of Pakistan surrendered unconditionally to India, some of the hard-lined Pakistani soldiers were bitter and angry at the surrender, as they wanted to continue fighting the Indians until their last breath. They retreated in silent and later came together to form their own groups of communal soldiers to carry out terrorists attacks against neighboring India.  Led by Dost Khan, a hardliner Pakistani army officer, who against his wishes had to surrender after the end of 1971 war, the terrorists planned to take a revenge by having a nuclear explosion in the heart of [[New Delhi]]. They transport it into a music competition disguised as a musical instrument. When Vir Vijay Singh comes to know about the plan, he plans to find out the location of the nuclear bomb as soon as possible by taking the help of Remote Radiation Sensors in satellites and innumerable beggars in the city. This helps the team zero in on the location.  After they overpower most of the terrorists in a commando operation, Dost Khan comes to know about it and sets the nuclear bomb to explode in a few minutes. This creates a lot of problem for Vijay Vir Singh, as the bomb can be defused only by exclusive voice command of Dost Khan saying: ''Dulhan Ki Vidaai Ka Waqt Badalna Hai''. They adopt a novel way to do it by speaking to Dost Khan and making him say fragments of this sentence without making him realize that it was being done to defuse the bomb. After the conversation was over, they synthesize the sentence to defuse the bomb just in time.

28 Days Later
 In [[Cambridge]], three animal liberation activists break into a medical research laboratory. A scientist in the lab desperately warns them against releasing the captive chimpanzees, which are infected with a highly contagious rage-inducing virus. Ignoring his pleas, the activists release a chimp, which infects a female activist. She then attacks and infects everyone else present.  28 days later, in [[London]], Jim, a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma in [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. He finds the entire hospital deserted. He wanders the streets of London, finding it deserted as well, with signs of catastrophe everywhere. Jim enters a church where a mass suicide has taken place, aside from two infected who are alerted by him saying "Hello?" He then finds a priest, who turns out to be infected. Jim flees, attracting attention of more infected, but survivors Selena and Mark rescue him. At their shelter, they explain to Jim that while he was in a coma, a virus had spread quickly among the populace, resulting in [[societal collapse]]. They claim the virus had been reported in [[Paris]] and [[New York City]] as well, suggesting the infection has spread worldwide.  The next day, Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house in Deptford, where he discovers they committed suicide in bed together. That night, the three are attacked by more infected. Mark is bitten, and Selena kills him. She curtly explains that the virus spreads through blood and saliva and overwhelms its victims in 10 to 20 seconds. She warns that should Jim become infected, she will kill him "in a heartbeat". The two see some blinking [[Christmas]] lights from [[Balfron Tower]] and head there. They discover two more survivors â cab driver Frank and his daughter Hannah â who allow them to take shelter. The next day, Frank informs them that their supplies â particularly water â are dwindling. He plays them a pre-recorded radio broadcast from a military blockade near [[Manchester]], claiming they have "the answer to infection" and promises to protect any survivors who reach them.  The group board Frank's cab and head to Manchester, bonding with one another during the trip. At the deserted blockade, Frank is infected when a drop of blood falls into his eye. He is killed by the arriving soldiers, who take the remaining survivors to a fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West. West reveals to Jim that his "answer to infection" entails waiting for the infected to starve to death and luring female survivors into sexual slavery to repopulate the world. The group attempts to flee, but Jim is captured and chained next to Sergeant Farrell, a dissenting soldier. Farrell shares with Jim his speculation that the virus has not spread beyond [[Great Britain]] and that the country is being quarantined.  The next day, the soldiers prepare the girls for gang rape, while two soldiers lead Jim and Farrell to execution. When his executioners argue after killing Farrell, Jim escapes. Jim lures West and another soldier to the blockade, where Jim kills the latter and leaves West stranded for arriving infected. He runs back to the mansion and releases Mailer, an infected soldier West kept for observation. Mailer quickly spreads the infection among the soldiers in the mansion. In the confusion, Corporal Mitchell drags Selena upstairs to rape her, but Jim interrupts and kills him. The two reunite with Hannah and run to Frank's cab. Jim is shot by West, who has been waiting inside the cab. Mailer grabs West through the rear window of the cab and kills him. The trio finally leave the mansion.  Another 28 days later, Jim is recovering at a remote cottage. Downstairs, he finds Selena sewing large swaths of fabric when Hannah appears. The three rush outside and unfurl a huge cloth banner, adding the final letter to the word "HELLO" laid out on the meadow. A lone fighter jet flies over the three survivors, the infected are shown dying of starvation, and the pilot calls in a rescue helicopter.

Matt's co-workers make many unsuccessful attempts to persuade him to have sex in order to win the pool, and as the days pass Matt's obsession with sex grows. At one point he angrily grabs a pornographic magazine from an office desk and begins to march towards a toilet stall in order to masturbate, but his co-workers stop him and convince him to maintain his pledge.  Despite the range of increasingly powerful cultural incentives to sex and orgasm surrounding Mattâscantily-dressed women, billboards, et ceteraâMatt's commitment holds, and begins to frustrate a lot of the people around him who had fully expected him to break it long before he could get close to his goal. In the meantime, Erica and Matt are falling in love, and they plan a special encounter for the 40th night to celebrate his successfully completing his vow. On the 40th day, a newly single Nicole learns of the [[betting pool]], makes a large bet and then [[rape by gender#Rape of males by females|rapes]] Matt while he is asleep.  Erica subsequently believes Matt dishonored his vow and was unfaithful to her, but Matt wins Erica back by reminding her of the special moments they shared during their relationship. The two reconcile in Matt's bedroom for many hours, with his co-workers making a new betting pool on the duration of their stamina. Upon seeing this, he kicks them out of his apartment and shuts the door.

999-9999
 Sun ([[Hugo (musician)|Hugo Chakrabongse]]) is a student in an international school in [[Phuket city|Phuket]]. Not academically inclined, he considers himself as "his own man" who doesn't believe in love, and is the head of a [[clique]] of pranksters consisting of the attractive but selfish Meena ([[Paula Taylor]]), geeky Chi (Thepparit Raiwin), smart but timid Wawa (Norajan Sangigern) and fun-loving Rajit (Titinun Keatanakon). The overweight Moo Priew (Ramit Romon) aspires to join Sun's clique but is rejected every time.  One day Sun and his friends notice a beautiful and mysterious new transfer student nicknamed Rainbow ([[Sririta Jensen]]), who is beautiful and mysterious. Rainbow was transferred from a high school in [[Chiang Mai]] where a student had been impaled on the school's flagpole. When asked how it happened, Rainbow says it involved a demon call from the phone number 999-9999. If one calls it after [[midnight]] and says a wish, the wish shall be granted later, but as a consequence, death will come to the caller. None of the clique members believe this and Rajit calls it after midnight in front of the others and wishes for a [[Ferrari]]. He wakes up the next morning receiving exactly what he wished for by luck.  Rajit soon dies from a combination of scorpion attack and malfunctioning car wash machine which slashes his throat with a spinning blade. The rest of the friends still don't believe in Rainbow's story, and even make wishes themselves, prioritizing only the first part of the deal. Meena wishes to be a [[Channel V]] Thailand [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]], only to be killed by a hanging noose at a party afterwards.  Soon after Meena's death, Sun begins to investigate about the deadly call and spends more time with Rainbow. However, the other members of his clique continue to make wishes. Chi wishes not to be a geek anymore, and is burned by a fire. Moo Priew wants to lose weight, only to die by falling out of a window with his organs pulled out (thus making him thinner). Wawa wishes to be an astronaut student and sharp gears split her head in two.  Sun calls the number, wishing for something he believes couldn't be granted: love. Rainbow then kisses him, and he realizes that his wish was granted as Rainbow's affection for him. To avoid the possibility of her being killed with him, Sun locks Rainbow in the tower where his clique usually hung out.  While watching Rainbow via cameras, Sun realizes that Rainbow is the one causing the deaths of his friends by introducing them to the number, making her a devil's apprentice. When he returns to the tower, Rainbow vanishes and the number calls Sun, telling him he's going to die. A heavy box falls from the top of the tower, but Sun manages to avoid it, only to fall on a pipe which pierces through his chest, killing him. A flashback set in Rainbow's former school shows Rainbow telling the girls there about the number, hence causing the deaths there later on, including the girl who was impaled on a flagpole.<ref></ref>

He is fruitless at first. Then finally, he delivers to Hope's apartment in a women's residence. She comes to the door in tears, not at all the way Sam remembers her. She refuses to talk about her pain and hurries Sam away. Now Sam gives himself a new task: find out how Hope "lost her smile" and give it back to her.  While trying to cheer her up, he meets various people in the building: Tanya - a junior reporter devoted to herself and her career; Gretchen - his piercing-obsessed ex-girlfriend; Mr. Willens - the disgusting, unhygienic and lecherous building manager; and finally Annie - an ex-[[Chocoholism|chocoholic]] who has lost a great deal of weight and agrees to assist him in his search. Along the way, he takes advice from his cousin Holden, an overweight sex addict whose pornography obsession has left him to graduate to the hardest of hardcore magazines including "Stump Monthly" (amputees), "Older & Bolder" (elderly women), and "Moist and Midget" (short women in pools).  While on his search, he is harassed by a mystery girl who wants him to give up. She drops a vase near him and sticks him and Holden penis-to-penis in a Chinese finger trap. She leaves an imprint in wet plaster that shows a scar on her butt. He then sets out to find the girl with that scar. Investigating Hope's room on subsequent trips, he finds a torn album cover and a sad note in Hope's diary. Further investigating both, leads him nowhere.  Along the way, he begins to fall in love with Annie. When Hope is served with an eviction notice, Sam sits outside her door drawing. Annie comes up and they talk for a while. He makes her laugh with faces drawn on various body parts. They kiss and start a relationship. She ends it quickly, however, as he refuses to stop trying to help Hope, seeing it as the duty of a friend.  Sam then goes to Hope's room one last time. She thanks him for his help and kisses him. He then finds the scar on her butt - she was the mystery woman with the help and encouragement of Annie. She tells him her story of sadness. The night they first met, her friend Jesse picked her up. They have known each other since grade school and were best friends. But then he makes a move on her, forcing himself when she refuses. He says that guys don't want girls as friends, they only want girlfriends. She escapes through the sunroof, cutting her butt on a sharp metal piece. Sam and Hope get together. Annie consoles her and says she will help her find out if Sam is a true friend. The narration ends here.  Later, though, Hope notices that Sam has once again lost his smile. He feels bad about Hope and Annie tricking him and for hurting Annie. Annie won't speak to him and has turned to chocolate, her comfort food. Hope realizes that he loves Annie too, and says he should figure out which one he wants to be with. Looking at his drawings of the two, he realizes that the smiling face he always drew was Annie, his one true love. She still refuses to talk to him. Sam takes his drawings to make a cartoon for her. Willens, who Sam had turned in for peeping on the residents, scatters them. All the residents help him pick them up, showing their love for him.  Sam then displays his cartoon of their relationship to her from her window. Hope tells Annie to realize that Sam loves her and that she loves him. She takes a while, but comes around and laughs raucously at the bizarre antics of their characters. Sam runs to her apartment and she jumps into his arms.  
2009: Lost Memories
 In 2009, the [[Korean Peninsula]] (Chosun) is still [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Imperial Japanese rule]] and [[Law enforcement in Japan|Japanese Bureau of Investigation]] (JBI) agents Masayuki Sakamoto and Shojiro Saigo thwart a hostage crisis at a museum in [[Names of Seoul|Keijo]] by a terrorist group known as the Hureisenjin. The exact motivation for the hostage situation is unknown, but during the investigation, Sakamoto discovers a museum artifact, a crescent-shaped rock known as the "Lunar Soul", found by one of the slain terrorists. After discovering that the Hureisenjin has a long history of targeting the Inoue Foundation, a group founded around the artifacts collected by the second [[Governor-General of Korea]], Sakamoto begins to suspect the Hureisenjin were attempting to steal the Lunar Soul, although both he and Saigo are puzzled as to why a terrorist group would put so much effort into stealing historical artifacts. The Hureisenjin ambush the convoy shipping the foundation's artifacts back to Japan and take the Lunar Soul. The terrorists confront Sakamoto and Saigo in a gunfight, where Sakamoto encounters Oh Hye-rin, the organization's female leader.  Sakamoto's questioning and accusations against the influential Inoue Foundation lead to him being thrown off the case, with the execution of Sakamoto's father as a traitor for aiding in a thwarted attack by the Hurisenjin on a cargo ship in [[Vladivostok]] in 1985 being cited by his suspicious superiors. Sakamoto pursues the investigation, traveling to [[Harbin]] to learn more about the Lunar Soul, and is then suspended from the JBI. That night, an unknown assailant murders Sakamoto's mentor, Takahashi, at his apartment and he is arrested for the crime. Sakamoto, however, escapes from the JBI with the help of Saigo, who vows to be his enemy the next time they meet.  A wounded Sakamoto stumbles into the Hureisenjin's hideout and Saigo is visited by the head of the Inoue Foundation, with both learning the truth: that they are living in an [[alternate history|alternate timeline]]. In 2009, a large stone temple uncovered by a joint Chinese-Korean-Japanese archaeological expedition, is found to facilitate [[time travel]], and through its exploitation by the Japanese right-wing nationalist group [[Uyoku dantai]], a man named Inoue travels back in time exactly 100 years and prevents the assassination of Resident-General [[ItÅ Hirobumi]] on October 26, 1909. ItÅ's survival and Inoue's knowledge of future events allows for Japan, instead of being defeated with the other Axis Powers in [[World War II]], to instead ally with the United States against [[Nazi Germany]]; The war ends in 1945, following the atomic bombing of Berlin (instead of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]). As one of the victorious powers, Japan becomes a military and economic superpower with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]], with its [[Empire of Japan|colonial empire]] intact. Inoue goes on to become the second Governor-General of Korea and his descendants found the Inoue Foundation, which keeps knowledge of the altered timeline limited to only the highest levels of Japan's government. However, a Korean female researcher who followed Inoue and attempted to stop him becomes the founder of Hureisenjin and passes along the story of the truth of the altered timeline, with the hope that the original timeline can somehow be restored.  Knowing about the altered history, Sakamoto allies with the Hureisenjin, who have located the temple stone and are planning their final attack. However, the JBI raid their hideout and kill almost everyone before being wiped out by an improvised explosive. Carrying the Lunar Soul with them, Sakamoto and Hye-rin escape to a tanker ship where the Inoue Foundation's artifacts are being held. They find the temple stone and place the Lunar Soul in it, which activates in the middle of a gunfight with the JBI. Hye-rin is killed, leaving Sakamoto as the only person left to fix the timeline. Sakamoto sends himself to Harbin in 1909, but is pursued by Saigo, who wants to retain the current timeline (Saigo is warned that if the original timeline is restored, his wife's family will almost certainly die in the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]). Sakamoto wounds Saigo before heading to the railway station where the assassination is supposed to occur. He is about to stop Inoue from killing An, but Saigo once again confronts him. Sakamoto kills Inoue, then guns down Saigo to prevent him from shooting An; An then assassinates ItÅ, as in the original timeline. Later, Sakamoto is seen planting explosives to destroy the temple stone, when Hye-rin walks up to him. It then becomes clear that she was a female Korean researcher in the original timeline, who had followed Inoue when he traveled back in time. Although this Hye-rin (as opposed to the Hye-rin in the alternate timeline) and Sakamoto have never met, they immediately form a special bond.  Back in 2009, it becomes clear that the original timeline has been restored, and at the [[Independence Hall of Korea]], a young boy Sakamoto had met in the alternate timeline sees numerous pictures of Korean heroes and leaders, including one of Sakamoto and Hye-rin together smiling.

Rajput send them to get Dr. Siddiqui. Vishwas senses that Elias is in danger and Arjun and Vishwas double back to the training center to save him. Rajput starts to harass Elias by tickling him to force him to reveal the answer. In the action, Elias falls of the balcony and dies. Unable to bear the shock of the death, Neha pulls a gun on Rajput and threatens to reveal everything to the police if he does not leave her and the other two alone. Rajput notifies Neha that all these acts were done under her training, and he is spotless. Unable to bear this fact, Neha shoots herself, just as Vishwas and Arjun return after hearing loud screams.  Both men gang up on Rajput and try to attack him. Once Rajput realises that the men are ignorant about the jewels, he starts shooting them. The police arrive, and confusion ensues. Vishwas and Arjun come out and claim that Rajput is abusing them while he claims that there is a big conspiracy involving the two men, Neha and Elias. Unable to believe that blind men can ransack a bank and amidst Rajput's impassioned defence, the police start getting suspicious. In the heat of defending himself, Rajput reveals that he had sent over Elias, thus confessing his crime.  In the end Rajput is locked away. Vishwas and Arjun decide to take care of Rahul and ultimately find the jewels&nbsp;â they were hidden in Elias' musical instrument.  === Alternate ending === In an alternate ending for overseas viewers<ref></ref> Rajput bribes the cop ([[Aditya Pancholi]]) and is set free. Vishwas and Arjun are sitting in a train (waiting for it to depart) and Rajput is standing on the platform with a smile on his face. He then warns them that "A dangerous game is about to begin", after which Vishwas and Arjun both draw their guns, and the film ends.

About Schmidt
 Warren Schmidt is retiring from his position as an [[actuary]] with [[WoodmenLife|Woodmen of the World]], a life insurance company in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. After a retirement dinner, Schmidt finds it hard to adjust to his new life, feeling useless. He sees a television advertisement about a foster program for African children, [[Plan USA]], and decides to sponsor a child. He soon receives an information package with a photo of his foster child, a small [[Tanzania]]n boy named Ndugu Umbo, to whom he relates his life in a series of candid, rambling letters.  Schmidt visits his young successor to offer his help, but the offer is politely declined. As he leaves the building, Schmidt sees the contents and files of his office, the sum of his entire career, set out for garbage collectors.  He describes to Ndugu his longtime alienation from Helen, his wife, who suddenly dies from a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] in her brain just after their purchase of a [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] Adventurer motor home. Jeannie, his only daughter, and her fiancÃ© Randall Hertzel arrive from [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. They console him at the funeral, but Jeannie later berates him for taking his wife for granted, such as by refusing to fully pay for the Winnebago (he wanted the cheaper Minnie Winnie) and burying her in a cheap casket. He asks her to move back to take care of him, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Randall tries to entice him into a [[pyramid scheme]].  Schmidt feels his daughter could do better than Randall, a [[waterbed]] salesman. After the couple leaves, Schmidt is overcome by loneliness. He stops showering, sleeps in front of the television, and goes shopping with a coat over pajamas to load up on frozen foods. In his wife's closet he discovers some hidden love letters disclosing her long-ago affair with Ray, a mutual friend, whom Schmidt angrily confronts.  He decides to take a journey alone in his new Winnebago to visit his daughter and convince her not to marry Randall. He tells Jeannie he is leaving early for the wedding, but she makes it clear she does not want him there until right before the ceremony. Schmidt decides to visit places from his past, including his college campus and fraternity at [[University of Kansas]] and his [[Holdrege, Nebraska|hometown in Nebraska]]. His childhood home has been replaced by a tire shop. While at a trailer campground, he is invited to dinner by a friendly and sympathetic couple. When the man leaves to buy some beer, Schmidt makes a pass at the wife, and flees in terror when she adamantly rejects his advance.  Sitting on the roof of his RV on a starry night, Schmidt forgives his departed wife for her affair and apologizes to her for his own failings as a husband. At that moment, he is amazed to see a bright meteor streak across the sky as a possible sign from Helen that she forgives him.  Feeling full of purpose and energetic renewal, Schmidt arrives in Denver, where he stays at the home of Roberta, Randall's mother. He is appalled by Randall's eccentric, socially odd family and tries unsuccessfully to dissuade Jeannie from the marriage. Schmidt throws out his back after sleeping on Randall's waterbed, infuriating Jeannie. Roberta assures Schmidt that a soak in her hot tub will help his back, but he flees after a nude Roberta makes a pass at him in the tub. The next day, Schmidt, under the influence of [[Oxycodone/aspirin|Percodan]] to soothe his back pain, attends the wedding and delivers a kind speech at the reception, hiding his disapproval.  On his way home from Denver, Schmidt composes a letter to Ndugu. Schmidt questions what he has accomplished in life, lamenting that he will soon be dead, that his life has made no difference to anyone, and that eventually it will be as if he has never existed at all.  A pile of mail is waiting for him at home. Schmidt opens a letter from Tanzania. It is from a nun, who writes that Ndugu is six years old and unable to read and reply to Schmidt's letters on his own, but appreciates them and Schmidt's financial support very much. A crayon drawing by Ndugu is enclosed, showing two smiling stick figures, one large and one small, holding hands on a sunny day. Schmidt is moved to tears as the film ends.

However, much to the students' surprise, Cinta didn't win. The grand prize in the contest is awarded to a boy named Rangga ([[Nicholas Saputra]]), whose name is rarely heard of in the school. However, Rangga, rather than going to the podium to receive his prize, took offence and retreated to a hiding spot. Cinta is somewhat jealous of Rangga's unexpected victory, but is careful not to show it. This leads Cinta to search for Rangga and request an interview for the school bulletin. However, Rangga immediately detects insincerity in Cinta's congratulations and walks away, leaving Cinta to be irritated by his perceived arrogance. As it turns out, Rangga never entered his poem for the contest; it was submitted on his behalf by his only best friend, the school janitor Mr. Wardiman ([[:id: Mang Diman|Mang Diman]]).  Cinta and Rangga starts to dislike each other ever since, and so does her friends. They briefly warm up to each other after Rangga thank Cinta for returning his book.

They starts to become friends when Cinta visits Rangga to his house, where she discovers that Rangga lives in a lower-middle-class neighbourhood with his father Yusrizal, whose outspokenness has led to bomb threats from pro-government thugs. Moreover, his parents divorced because of his father's disengagement from the government office for exposing government corruption. Alya, who regularly tells Cinta her broken home problems, is the only one Cinta told that she's having a budding closeness with Rangga.  The secret friendship causes changes in Cinta's behaviour, resulting in problems with Cinta's group of girl friends. She starts to regularly lie to her friends in order to spend more time with Rangga. The problem reach its climax when Cinta ignores Alya's desperate request to talk with her because she is going on a date with Rangga. When she come home, she is told that Alya is in the hospital because she attempted suicide. At the hospital, the friends realize that she has been lying all along, straining their friendship. Thinking it was all her fault, Cinta then shut Rangga out, hurting him. When Alya recover, she discuss Rangga with Cinta, in which Karmen, Maura, and Milly overhears and finally discover the formerly budding relationship between Cinta and Rangga. Cinta apologizes to them and Maura advises her to forget Rangga.  Cinta did so, and she goes on with her life. Meanwhile, Karmen sees Rangga gives Mr. Wardiman a goodbye hug. Noticing that Cinta turns quiet and uncommunicative, her friends realize the error in their ways and Cinta confess that she is in love with Rangga, but not ready to admit it. Karmen tell her she didn't have much time since she saw Rangga left. Mr. Wardiman tell the girls that Rangga is heading to the airport. In rush, they forces their nerdy schoolmate Mamet ([[:id:Dennis Adhiswara|Dennis Adhiswara]]), whom they ridicule throughout the film, to lend his car to the airport.

Before departing, Rangga gives Cinta a book and tell her to read the last page. They bid each other one last farewell, and he boards the plane.

An orphaned young man of considerable means, Embry had purchased two tickets to [[Crete]] before his disappearance; the tickets had never been used and Embry's financial assets had not been touched since his disappearance. With the official reopening of the Larkin case, however, Katie begins to see Embry lurking around campus, seemingly stalking her.  Reporting this back to Detective Handler, who dismisses her as he believes Embry to be dead, Katie is not convinced but nevertheless returns to school. Falling asleep in the college library while studying, upon waking she finds a number carved into the wood of the desk. Upon investigation, she discovers it references a library book: ''The Inferno''. There she finds Embry staring back at her from the other side of the book stack.

Attempting to reason with Katie before telling her she can not come with him to New Hampshire, Handler takes notice of something at the bottom of the water. Realizing that it is the skeleton of Embry Larkin, Handler is suddenly struck from behind and falls into the water, echoing Embry's murder two years prior. The epilogue reveals that the dormitory is to be demolished for the construction of a new structure on the site, thus cementing the permanent disappearance of Embry Larkin and Wade Handler.

Will realizes that the one thing that means something to him is Marcus, and decides to help him. He crashes a meeting of the single parents support group to find Fiona and beg her not to commit suicide. She assures him that she has no plans to do so and reveals that Marcus has decided to sing at the school show that day.  Will realizes this will be a huge embarrassment for Marcus and rushes with Fiona to the school to stop him, but Marcus is steadfast in his decision to perform, believing it will be the only thing that will make his mother happy. When Marcus steps on stage and sings his mother's favorite songâ"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]"âthe student body starts to taunt him. Suddenly, Will appears onstage with a guitar to accompany Marcus for the rest of the song, earning themselves a modest applause. Will performs an unnecessary solo immediately afterward, turning himself into the butt of the joke and rescuing Marcus from humiliation and even social suicide.  The following Christmas, Will is back with Rachel and hosts a celebration at his place with his new extended family. The idea of Will marrying Rachel is brought up and Marcus seems unenthusiastic.  But Marcus reveals in voiceover that he is not against Will and Rachel marrying, merely that he believes that couples do not work on their own and that everyone needs an extended support system like he now has, concluding "No man is an island."<ref>A passage from [[Devotions upon Emergent Occasions]] written by [[John Donne]].</ref>

The Adventures of Pluto Nash
  In 2080, there is a colony on the Moon called Little America. A retired smuggler and ex-convict named Pluto Nash ([[Eddie Murphy]]) buys a nightclub in an attempt to fulfill a long-time wish of his. Additionally, this prevents the murder by ingestion of battery acid of the club's previous owner Anthony Frankowski ([[Jay Mohr]]), a Polish polka dancer, by mobsters Gino ([[Burt Young]]) and Larry ([[Lillo Brancato]]) whom Anthony owed money to. Pluto rebuilds the club and establishes it as "Club Pluto". In the next seven years, Club Pluto becomes a very popular Little America nightclub. Its staff consists of Pluto himself, a Hispanic assistant, and an android named Bruno ([[Randy Quaid]]), an inferior 63 Deluxe model.  In 2087, Pluto is approached by a young woman named Dina Lake ([[Rosario Dawson]]), who has become stranded on the Moon and desires to earn some money by which to pay for transport back to Earth to [[Salt Lake City]]. Because her father "Nicky Sticks" was a friend of Pluto's, she seeks help from Pluto, offering her skills as a singer. Pluto instead gives her a job as a server at his club and allows her to remain inside to sleep after its nightly closure to the public. During the same night, Pluto is accosted thrice by Mogan ([[Joe Pantoliano]]) and Kelp ([[Victor Varnado]]), messengers of a mysterious entrepreneur called Rex Crater. They tell Pluto that Rex wishes to buy Club Pluto and convert it into a gambling casino. Pluto refuses and Rex Crater's minions destroy the club. Pluto, Dina and Bruno escape.  Determined to get his club back, Pluto decides to investigate Rex Crater, of whom very few people know anything. From Rowland ([[Peter Boyle]]), a retired police officer with connections to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] who is a friend of his mother's, Pluto learns that Rex Crater is never seen outside of a penthouse in the city of Moon Beach, and that he was involved with a geneticist called Runa Pendankin, who specialized in human cloning before her mysterious death.  Pluto and Dina visit Dr. Runa Pendankin's apprentice Mona Zimmer ([[Illeana Douglas]]), who operates a cosmetic surgery station. They pose as a married couple attempting to revive their infatuation for one another by having their figures altered. After having seen, and adapted to their liking, several examples of commonly preferred bodily shapes and contours, they reveal that they have come for information regarding Dr. Pendankin's death. Mona Zimmer, having been intimidated by Pluto's bluffs, reveals that shortly prior to her death Dr. Pendankin had worked for or with an Earth criminal whose initials, inscribed on his briefcase, appear to have been "WZW".  Pluto and Dina return to the motel and meet Pluto's mother Flura Nash ([[Pam Grier]]), who comes there, and has Bruno recharged in his room. They are subsequently attacked by Rex Crater's assassins, who have tracked them to the hotel. Upon hijacking a limo with a holographic chauffeur named James ([[John Cleese]]), Pluto takes Dina and Bruno to an old refuge outside of the colonies of his from his smuggling days.  At the hideout, Pluto searches online for information regarding any Earth criminal with the initials "WZW". When this yields nothing, Dina suggests that the initials are in fact "MZM", having been seen upside-down by Mona Zimmer. Pluto searches for "MZM" and discovers a criminal called Michael Zoroaster Marucci ([[Alec Baldwin]]). Pluto suspects that Michael Marucci and Rex Crater are one and the same. Abruptly, he is contacted by his mother, who tells him that Rowland has been killed by a fellow police officer and the hideout is attacked by Rex Crater's agents. A chase ensues and the heroes escape, but their car is damaged and explodes, causing them to be presumed dead by the agents. They manage to get out in their astronaut suits but soon run out of oxygen and pass out. Bruno carries them through the Moon desert, but soon, his battery runs out.  They are eventually rescued and taken to Moon Beach by Felix Laranga ([[Luis GuzmÃ¡n]]), a local smuggler who idolizes Pluto Nash. They infiltrate Rex Crater's casino/hotel. Bruno ends up running afoul of a robot slot machine whose lever he accidentally breaks. When Bruno is taken away by security, Pluto sends Dina to pay for the damages and get Bruno out.  Pluto meets with Anthony, who is now going under the name Tony Francis, a famous intergalactic singer. While in an elevator he stalled, Pluto asks Tony if there is a way up to Rex Crater's penthouse. Pluto is told that the only way is to climb up via the elevator ropes. When they leave the elevator after Pluto asks about a Plan B, Rex's assistant Belcher ([[James Rebhorn]]) and some men attack. They knock Tony out while Pluto is stunned, which was Belcher's version of "Plan B". Meanwhile, Dina approaches the security guard at the place where the robots are locked up. When the guard tells Dina that the repairs on the robot slot machine aren't done yet, Bruno manages to trick the guard into letting him out and then knocks him out. Just then, Dina and Bruno are captured by Mogan, Kelp, and some of Rex's men, and taken to Rex's penthouse.  Upon being un-stunned by Belcher, Pluto accuses Rex Crater of being Michael Marucci. At this, Rex Crater turns his chair around and reveals himself to be a clone of Pluto. Rex (also Eddie Murphy) and Belcher explain that Rex was created by Runa Pendankin from Pluto's removed [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] to act as the public face of Michael Marucci's illegal activities. However, Rex has killed both Marucci and Runa and established his own criminal enterprise. He also states that he was the one who told his henchmen where Pluto was hiding out due to him also inheriting Pluto's memories.  When his henchmen arrive and see both Rex and Pluto, Rex kills Mogan and Kelp for their incompetence. He and Pluto then fight while the others are uncertain which is which. Pluto shoots Bruno, and Belcher (who assumes that Pluto would not damage his own robot) shoots Rex. Pluto orders his men to leave and reveals his identity to Dina by speaking of her employment to him, then knocks out Belcher who has realized his mistake in shooting the wrong person. Bruno is shown to have survived unharmed since he was wearing a bulletproof shirt, but Rex is revealed to have worn one also. Rex attempts to garotte Pluto, but is thrown through a window and dies upon hitting the card table below.  The movie ends with the heroes celebrating in the rebuilt Club Pluto with Nash as the owner, Dina as the lead singer and Bruno as the new club manager (as Pluto has bought a new model 78 robot as his new bodyguard). Pluto looks at Dina singing on the stage and smiles, smoking a cigar.

 Three British seamen (Scousers) working as waiters on a transatlantic liner in 1927 are given a chance to work for the [[Al Capone]] gang, after running booze (bootlegging) into America which had Prohibition in place.  {{quote|Quote 1999<ref>Mersey Nights</ref>âI was told a story by a gentleman called Leo White and after doing some research ,found to be true(though I never doubted it- Scousers get everywhere don,t they!)   Subsequently Vic Gibson wrote an article in the Liverpool Echo- the response was both dramatic and energising.I received letters and phone calls from people scattered throughout the Merseyside area, confirming that their Great Uncles or Grandfathers were Al Capone's bodyguards or bootleggers.  This confirmation of authenticity led me to pen the story and with the addition of a little artistic licence, to develop the musical play-"Al,s Lads"                                                  - Marc Gee}}

American Psycho 2
 The film starts with a 12-year-old girl whose babysitter is on a date with serial killer [[Patrick Bateman]]. After Bateman kills and starts to dissect her babysitter, the girl stabs him with an ice pick. Fast forward to the present day and the girl, who is named Rachael Newman, is now a college student studying criminology under Professor Starkman, a former [[FBI]] agent. Rachael aspires to join the FBI and is determined to get the teaching assistant position under Starkman, which would make her a [[shoo-in]] for the FBI training program.  Tough competition for the position stands in her way, and Rachael proceeds to kill off classmates one by one. During her killing spree, she decides to see the school psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Daniels. Realizing that Rachael is a textbook [[Psychopathy|sociopath]], Daniels tries to warn Starkman, who mistakenly thinks the psycho student is Cassandra Blaire, with whom he had an extramarital affair. When Cassandra reveals that her affair with Professor Starkman has guaranteed her the [[Teaching assistant|TA]] position, Rachael decides to murder her as well. After she does so, Professor Starkman discovers Cassandra's body and calls Daniels to tell him that "she's dead". But he does not identify the victim, and Daniels assumes it must be Rachael. Distraught, Professor Starkman leaves his teaching position, which angers the obsessed Rachael. She reveals that she is not Rachael Newman; she killed the real Rachael at the beginning of the semester and assumed her identity.  During spring break, Rachael stays on campus and locates an intoxicated Starkman, impaired by the effects of Valium and alcohol, and tries to seduce him to get the job. However, Starkman sees she is wearing a dress and necklace he had given to Cassandra. She then confesses her crimes to him, her "crush" on him, and that she knew about his affairs with various women (which included her former babysitter, whom he indirectly killed, since he had told her about Bateman and she decided to track him down), as he backs up towards the window in a state of confusion and fear. Rachael blows him a kiss, and he falls out the window to his death. As she leaves, Rachael realizes a janitor has witnessed Starkman's death, and she murders the janitor, too. Driving away from campus with Starkman in her car, Rachael is stopped by campus security, whom she stabs to death with an ice pick.  As the film reaches its conclusion, Daniels and two cops pursue Rachael in a car chase, started when she sped by the cops who had Daniels in the car. It ends with Rachael driving off a cliff, resulting in the car exploding. At this point, she is presumed to be dead by the cops who witnessed the event and the media.  Two years later, Dr. Daniels is giving a lecture on Rachael's mind and how he wrote a book about her. When he looks up from speaking with a student, he sees Rachael, who has not died after all; she indirectly reveals that she killed Starkman's last assistant, Elizabeth McGuire, and stole her identity to get into Quantico. She allows Dr. Daniels to know because she believes there is no point in committing the perfect crime if no one knows about it and she is confident he will not divulge this information because it would make a farce of his best-selling book in which he proclaimed to completely understand her and witnessed her death in the fiery car. The body that was in the car was the real Rachael, whose decaying body had been kept in the killer's dorm closet. As Rachel walks out of his class, Dr. Daniels is visibly shaken by what he had just learned.

Amen.
 During [[World War II]], [[Kurt Gerstein]] ([[Ulrich Tukur]]), a [[Waffen-SS]] officer employed in the SS Hygiene Institute, designs programs for the purification of water and the destruction of vermin. He is shocked to learn that the process he has developed to eradicate [[typhus]], by using a [[hydrogen cyanide]] mixture called [[Zyklon B]], is now being used for killing [[Jew]]s and other "undesirables" in [[extermination camp]]s. Gerstein attempts to notify [[Pope Pius XII]] ([[Marcel IureÅ]]) about the gassings, but is appalled by the lack of response he gets from the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] hierarchy. The only person moved is Riccardo Fontana ([[Mathieu Kassovitz]]), a young [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest. Fontana and Gerstein attempt to raise awareness about what is happening to the Jews in Europe but even after Fontana appealing to the pope himself, the Vatican makes only a timid and vague condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]].  Eventually Gerstein travels to Rome to speak to the Pope himself but when he arrives the Germans are taking control of [[Rome]] and begin rounding up the [[Jews of Rome]] to be sent to concentration camps. Fontana begs the Pope to force the Germans to stop the deportation by appearing at the train station in person but the Pope refuses, saying that doing so will cause hardship for the Christians living under Nazi Germany. In disgust and sorrow Fontana puts a [[Yellow badge]] on himself and allows himself to be taken on the train of Jews going to the concentration camps. When he arrives at the camp Fontana is interrogated by the head of the camp, a 'friend' of [[Kurt Gerstein]] known simply as the Doctor (who is believed to be Dr. [[Josef Mengele]]), who despite knowing that the war is lost and that Fontana is a Catholic priest allows Fontana to stay with the Jews and be gassed.  Gerstein attempts to save Fontana but he will not leave. The Doctor escorts Gerstein out of the camp after Fontana and most of the Jews are killed; they drive by German soldiers digging up and burning the bodies of Jews in a mass grave near the camp and the Doctor asks Gerstein if he knows any contacts to help get him out of Germany. Gerstein returns home and gathers all his evidence that documents the Nazi atrocities and takes them to the Allies. Despite accepting his evidence he is still arrested and after reading the charges against him he is found hanged in his cell. Afterward the Doctor is seen speaking to a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] in Rome asking for help leaving the country saying "I'm a doctor, just a physician" and the cardinal agrees to help send him to [[Argentina]].  While the character of Kurt Gerstein is historical, the character of the young priest is fictional. Although based on the action of Gerstein to stop and bring global awareness to the Holocaust, the plot is largely fictitious.  
Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony
 In the film, South African musicians, [[playwright]]s, [[poets]] and [[activists]] recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of [[interview]]s,  musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Vusi Mahlasela]] and others.<ref>Scott, A.

Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the 20th century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung ''a cappella''. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.<ref>Olwage, Grant.

American Gun (2002 film)
  The film tells the story of Martin Tillman (Coburn), a [[World War II]] [[veteran]] on a cross-country journey to trace the origin of the gun used to kill his daughter Penny (Madsen). On the way he seeks for his granddaughter Mia (Holden).  Writer/director Alan Jacobs was inspired by a visit to the Smith & Wesson factory in Massachusetts, where he saw an obituary for a young girl above the workbench where a man was assembling guns.  He wondered if the worker had perhaps assembled the gun that killed the girl.  "At that moment it clicked," Jacobs said.  "I had recently read a book called Lethal Passage by the journalist [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]] who tracked down the history of a submachine gun that ended up in the hands of a kid who took it to school one day.  That put the idea in my head that a gun could have a history."<ref>Robert Knott, Santa Fe New Mexican Film Festival Guide, 2002</ref>

Analyze That
 Near the completion of his sentence in [[Sing Sing]] prison, Paul Vitti's life is threatened by assassins and corrupt guards while incarcerated. He starts singing showtunes from ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' to get the attention of Ben Sobel, who previously hung up on him while attending his father's funeral. The FBI calls in Ben to see if Vitti is really insane. This appears to be the case, and the FBI approves Ben taking Vitti out of prison, into his own custody, for further therapy. On their way out in Sobel's car, Vitti reveals that he faked it. Needing some therapy himself after his father's death, a grieving Sobel talks Vitti into finding a regular job (as requested by the FBI). Vitti attempts to find a legitimate job (he tries a car dealer, a restaurant, and a jewelry store), but his rude manners and paranoia only complicate things further. This ends up in him getting fired each time.  At the same time, Vitti is told by de facto boss Patti LoPresti that the Rigazzi family wants him dead. He responds to this by telling the Rigazzis that he is "out" and seeking a new line of employment. He eventually finds employment working as a technical advisor on the set of a ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]''-like mafia [[Television program|TV series]]. Meanwhile, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents inform Sobel that Vitti has his former crew back together, and may be planning something major. This rouses Sobel's suspicion, and he visits Vitti. Both get caught up in a car chase with Rigazzi hitmen, which ends up with Vitti escaping. The FBI blames Sobel, and gives him 24 hours to locate Vitti.  After locating Vitti (through Sobel's son Michael, who is now working as Vitti's chauffeur), Sobel discovers Vitti is planning a big armored car heist with LoPresti as a partner. He attempts to intervene and talk Vitti out of it but Vitti proceeds and Sobel is forced to go along as well. The crew ambushes the armored car with smoke grenades, and lift it over a fence in the midst of the confusion. They extract $20 million of [[Precious metal#Bullion|gold bullion]], but LoPresti's thugs take over, revealing themselves to actually have been working for Rigazzi. Sobel, in a fit of anger, beats one of them and Vitti's men take care of the rest. They use the gold bullion to frame the Rigazzi family, leaving three Rigazzi goons locked in the armored truck suspended from the crane. This leads to the arrest of the entire Rigazzi family, and in turn, prevents a mob war.  Sobel meets with Vitti and Jelly near bridges on the New York waterfront, and they part ways again as friends, singing [[Somewhere (song)|another]] ''West Side Story'' showtune together.

The Anarchist Cookbook (film)
  ===Puck's introduction=== The story is narrated by the protagonist, Puck, who opens with a monologue describing the basic reasoning underlying his philosophy, as well as the film's general interpretation of [[Anarchism]], as he walks through the commune he lives in, while events of his daily life are presented.  Other members of the commune include Johnny Red, a 1960s [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] who constantly refers to [[Sweden]] as an ideal society; Gin, Red's [[hippie]] girlfriend; Karla, a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] with issues of [[misandry]]; Sweeney, a [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] DJ who worked at a local record store; Double D, an unintelligent but goodhearted commune member, and Puck's best friend; and "The Trolls", a ragtag group of "crunchy types" who lived in tents in the backyard of the house and [[homeschooling|home schooled]] about a dozen children. The commune, referred to as "Sam", is funded by a collective Anarchist bookstore, where the members take turns operating the front desk. Throughout the film, this group is referred to as "The Family", and their way of life is described as peaceful and happy, until the day Johnny Black, a mysterious, militant [[Nihilism|nihilist]] with a forceful personality, appears.  Johnny Black shares much of the rebellious philosophy of "The Family" when he shows up, however he disrespects what he sees as the narrow minded and shortsighted protest tactics Johnny Red espouses. However, politically weak within the framework of the Family, Black cannot challenge Red's authority for the time being.  Frustrated and unhappy with his social life and lack of direction, Puck seeks a girlfriend. He eventually meets a young woman at a night club, Jody, who he learns is a young Republican college student. However, when his new observations of Jody's political beliefs and academic success causes him greater internal conflict and personal embarrassment, Puck decides to temporarily leave the Family and ventures out to find a new job and home. Still unhappy and directionless, Puck opts to return to the Family.  ===The rise of Johnny Black=== In the time that has transpired in Puck's absence, Black's influence over the family has steadily grown. Encouraging the group to forge alliances with "like-minded" organizations, over time, Black undergoes a more militant shift in personality. At a meeting for a planned protest demonstration against a [[petrochemical]] plant, Black denounces the peaceful, non-violent approach most of the attendants support, and presents two tools to be used in their attack on the plant: [[semtex]] and ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]''.  Johnny Red describes the book as "a relic from the past... it taught you how to make bombs, how to make drugs... and it meant something once." He also accurately mentions that the author, [[William Powell (author)|William Powell]], has disavowed the book. He continues, commenting, "the book's not the problem. The problem is the kind of people who look to it for answers."  A few days afterward, Johnny Black discovers Red's private journal, in which he admits to being [[Pederasty|sexually attracted to young boys]]. He places this in the open for Gin to discover, and after reading a passage in which Red admits to his [[pedophilia]], she dumps him. Following this, Red's personality becomes more anxious and submissive to Black.  One day, while carrying science kits, Puck, Double D, and Sweeney are approached by a police officer who randomly stops them and requests to inspect their contents. After complying, they receive a ride from the officer to Sam, explaining that their run down house is in fact an orphanage the kits are intended for. The officer decides to visit the building, and enters to discover Karla in the midst of using cocaine with Johnny Black. The entire group, except for Johnny Red, is promptly arrested and brought to trial, the presiding judge ironically being a spurned, former lover of Karla. The flop house, Sam, is shut down by the city; Johnny Black receives time at a medium security prison, with the possibility for parole in four months; Sweeney and Double D each receive 250 hours of community service; Karla, aside from being insulted by the judge, is made to receive a mandatory psychiatric evaluation; and Puck is placed under house arrest for 180 days, and forced to move into his parent's home in the city of [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], [[Texas]]. Puck chafes in his suburban life, but comes to accept it with Jody's encouragement, until Johnny Black is paroled after four months. Black appears in Puck's apartment and easily convinces Puck to remove the ankle bracelet that tracks him and rejoin the Family.  ===Escalation and Puck's resolution=== Puck soon discovers that Karla, Sweeney, and Double D are all suffering from [[drug addiction]], and have relocated to a new squat which they name "[[Son of Sam (disambiguation)|Son of Sam]]". The next stage of Johnny Black's strategy for his movement is the creation of a coalition of organizations which agree with any facet of his goals. However, these include extremist groups, such as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazis]] and [[Militia (United States)#Extralegal/private militia organizations|militia men]].  Black offers ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as an instructional booklet to the other groups, while they pledge to offer various arms and explosives, and plans a "joint mission" to attack a local university. Puck attempts to leave the organization, but is under constant surveillance. He commits to remaining in the group, so as to watch over Double D, for whom he feels responsible. This situation eventually ends in tragedy when Double D overdoses on [[diazepam]]. Puck finally resolves to escape from the group and prevent the mission, and convinces a sober Sweeney and Johnny Red to help. Together, they devise a plan to intoxicate the extremist group members with pancakes laced with the very drugs Double D overdosed on.  Once the entire organization is unconscious, the surviving members of the Family split up. Alone, Puck decides that once the group awakens he'd be in immediate danger, and so decides to report the organization and cooperate fully with the FBI, for which he receives a reward of $200,000. Immediately afterward, Puck considers his options and realizing that he now has the money and time to commit to his future, decides to take Jody's advice and return to college. Alone, he begins to hitchhike to California to join Jody as she [[intern]]s at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]]. Receiving a ride from a truck driver, Puck is asked what his name is, and after some internal thinking, decides to accept his legal name and chosen name together: "Peter Puck." The final monologue by Puck meditates over his new perspective on life and his personal philosophy, and renounces the concept of "freedom without responsibility," which contrasts with his idealistic opening-sequence monologue.

He finally leaves the home at age 14. After living out on the streets for the next few years, he decides to join the U.S. Navy to make something out of his life.   The rough life he had as a child has caused him to have a violent temper; after getting into a fight with a fellow sailor, Antwone is sentenced at a captain's [[Mast (naval)|mast]] to be demoted, fined, and restricted to the ship for 45 days. His commanding officer also orders him to go to psychiatric treatment. Antwone goes in to meet Dr. Jerome Davenport ([[Denzel Washington]]), who attempts to get him to open up. Antwone is at first extremely resistant, but gradually comes to trust Davenport and opens up about his traumatic childhood. Meanwhile, Antwone develops feelings for fellow Navy sailor Cheryl ([[Joy Bryant]]). With Antwone still getting into altercations, Davenport tries to explore his feelings for Cheryl in order to channel Antwone's feelings into something positive.

While on leave in Mexico, Antwone gets into a fight with a sailor who insinuates that he is gay, and is thrown into jail.

At a [[Thanksgiving]] dinner, Davenport advises Antwone to find his real family. Antwone refuses, but thanks Davenport before inviting him to a graduation ceremony. Following the graduation ceremony, Davenport tells Antwone he's ending the sessions and feels Antwone needs to progress on his own. Antwone breaks down, feeling everyone has abandoned him. He reveals his best friend Jesse ([[De'Angelo Wilson]]) was killed during an attempted robbery, and that he resents Jesse for leaving him behind. Realizing he needs to find his parents to find closure, Antwone asks Cheryl to go with him to Cleveland. After a dead end at social services, Antwone decides to return to the Tate household. There he confronts Nadine and Mrs. Tate about their abuse. Mrs. Tate ultimately reveals Antwone's father's name: Edward Elkins.  After looking through multiple telephone books, Antwone comes into contact with his aunt Annette ([[Vernee Watson-Johnson]]) and visits her. Antwone learns his mother ([[Viola Davis]]) lives nearby, and goes to visit her. Antwone finds closure, forgives her, and leaves. When he returns to the Elkins household, he finds a feast prepared for him and finds the family he lost.  Antwone visits Davenport and thanks him for everything. Davenport then replies that it is he who should be thanking Antwone. Davenport confesses that he had been failing to deal with his own problems, and that treating Antwone prompted him to finally confront his demons. The film draws to a close as Davenport and Antwone go to eat.

Aram (2002 film)
   Aram Sarkissian ([[Simon Abkarian]]) is a young [[France|French]]-[[Armenian People|Armenian]] member of AGJSA, an Armenian [[militant]] organization, who leaves his family in [[Paris]] to fight in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In October 1993, Aram returns to France to live a ânormal lifeâ again, but finds his younger brother Levon ([[Mathieu Demy]]) preparing the assassination of Azbalan Djelik, a [[general (rank)|general]] of the [[Turkish Army]] visiting France. Aram opposes the assassination, claiming the Armenian struggle lies in Nagorno-Karabakh, however, Levon considers Aram to be a coward, who then reluctantly agrees. One evening, General Djelik is killed when his car is ambushed by 3 masked gunmen, who shoot and kill three of the four passengers. The survivor, Djelik's [[aide-de-camp]] Colonel Talaat Sonlez ([[Serge AvÃ©dikian]]), shoots Levon after he pretended to be dead. Levon is immobilized and enters a [[coma]], and Sonlez is shot by the Armenians before they flee. AGJSA claims responsibility for the attack, justifying it as General Djelik was a high-ranking member of the Black Wolves, a Turkish [[ultranationalist]] organization. Talaat survives again, and searches for the assassins by asking Monsieur Paul (Gilles Arbona), a French [[counter-terrorism]] policeman monitoring the activities of AGJSA, who does not reveal their identities.  By January, 2001, Levon is [[paralyzed]] and bound to a [[wheelchair]]. Their father, Mihran Sarkissian (Alan Motte), is bitter and blames Levon's disabilities on Aram, who has not been seen by the family since the attack. Additionally, their younger sister Meline (Ljubna Azabal) becomes [[engaged]] to Stephan, a [[French people|French]] man, which their father approves reluctantly and is frowned upon by his friends. Meanwhile in [[Germany]], the leader of the AGJSA, Vartan, negotiates an arms deal with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] militants to buy a large shipment [[sniper rifle]]s to be used by Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Kurds are represented by Midzametin, the head of the [[Kurdistan Workers Party|PKK]] in Europe, and his right-hand man Djalal, who is vocally against the deal. The Kurds change their deal, offering cheaper guns in exchange for support in assassinating Turkish diplomats if the Turkish Army launches a new offensive against the PKK, which Vartan accepts. Aram arrives back in France through [[Calais]] after returning from hiding in [[Karabakh]], where he is photographed by Virgil, an agent of Paul. Aram reveals his reservations over Vartan's promises to the Kurds supporting assassinations of Turkish diplomats, believing they are ineffective and undesirable for the Armenian cause. En route to the weapons exchange Talaat and Djalal, who is working for the Turks, ambush the Kurds, and later shoot at the Armenians waiting the meeting point on a beach at night. Aram is wounded but kills Djalal without realizing his identity before escaping. Unaware of Djalal's betrayal, Aram first suspects Kervedjian, a diplomat of the [[Republic of Artsakh|Nagorono-Karabakh Republic]] in Paris, who he abducts and [[interrogate]]s. Paul, knowing of Talaat's involvement, visits him at a [[Turkish bath]] and reminds him he was told in 1993 not to come back to France. Talaat states he is an [[attachÃ©]] of the [[Government of Turkey|Turkish government]] as part of an official [[diplomatic mission]], but Paul reveals his knowledge that Talaat is a member of the Black Wolves and is involved in the [[Turkish mafia|Turkish Mafia]]. Aram seeks the help of his friend, Fodil Boushaour, who provides him with [[handguns]], a car, a fake [[driver's license]], and backup from his friends, Saad and Mamad. In Paris, Mihran and Meline argue over Aram, with Mihran expressing his bitterness towards him, while Meline shows her sympathy. Kervedjian informs Aram of Djalal's betrayal and cooperation with the Turkish government, and that there is a new deal with the Kurds to deliver weapons. Aram is assigned to task of killing the Turks involved in the betrayal and to escort the new weapons to Karabakh. Aram tracks down Talaat and kills several of his men and his girlfriend, but fails to kill him and his aide Mehmet - furious, Talaat instructs Mehmet to find Aram and kill him. Meline invites Aram to her wedding in an attempt to reconcile with their father, while Kervedjian provides Aram details to collect the Kurdish weapons at the port in [[Dunkirk]], and to escort the weapons to Karabakh via [[Athens]].   Talaat meets with Paul and Virgil, offering information [[terrorist]] networks in exchange for the identity of the person trying to kill him. Paul declines the offer, but later Mehmet and his gang abduct Virgil. Aram visits his family in Paris where his father asks him to leave, striking him with his [[walking stick|cane]], and Aram leaves without explaining his side of the story. Upon leaving, Aram is chased by Paul and another agent who have been tracking him to positively identify him, as Aram was officially [[killed in action]] in Karabakh, but he manages to escape. At the counter-terrorism office, Paul receives a package from Talaat containing an amputated [[finger]] of Virgil, and he calls the Turkish embassy revealing the identities of Aram and his associates. Paul speaks privately with Fodil, who claims that the last he heard from Aram was 7 years ago, and that he is buried in [[Shahumian]] in Karabakh. Despite this, Paul informs Fodil that Talaat now knows about Aram's identity and is hunting him. Fodil warns Aram, who is riding with Saad and Mamad on the way to the party after Meline and Stephan's marriage. Talaat and Mehmet appear at the party, and the two ambush Mihran and Levon in the restroom, but Aram shoots Talaat and Mehmet. Aram rushes to Dunkirk to leave France to avoid [[murder]] charges, but cars of the secret police with Paul and Mihran pull up. Aram and his father say goodbye without words, quietly redeeming his son. Instead of arresting Aram, Paul asks him to leave and to never return to France.

In the meantime the police is looking for Bruno Le Roux, a former [[leftist]] revolutionary who has escaped from [[prison]], this means that they have to tail Jeanne Rivet, a colleague of AgnÃ¨s in the same [[high school]] where they work as teachers. In their search for Le Roux they also go to the house of Mme. Guiot, the mother of Jean-Jean, a former associate of Le Roux's, she tells them that he has gone to look for a job out of the city. [[File:Seilbahn-Grenoble.JPG|thumb|right|"Les Bulles"]] Later on that same day, Manise arrives home to find AgnÃ¨s ready to leave for the party but he says that he cannot go and promises that he shall go the next time. That same night, while [[Detective|investigating]] the [[murder]] of a man (who turns out to be Freddy), Manise is approached by Jacquillat, he lets Manise know that the murder can be pinned on Le Roux, they have an unsettled score consisting in a former association where the leaders of the People's Army (including Le Roux) were arrested 15 years ago, the leaders think that it was Jacquillat who betrayed them but he denies it, it was someone else; Manise cannot turn his back on that information because the case is still open, but the reason Jacquillat tells him that is because he wants Le Roux killed during detention by the police, Manise refuses, therefore Jacquillat uses an [[ace]] in his [[sleeve]]: Pascal shall not receive any [[morphine]] for his addicted wife until he kills his man. Manise gets a call from CÃ©cile: AgnÃ¨s has [[Syncope (medicine)|fainted]] at the party, he takes her home and shoots her up himself with the last fix he has, she apologizes and dozes off.  The next day Manise takes part in a school [[debate]] regarding [[drugs]], he plays the tough cop who is only concerned for the law, during the conversation, Dr. Colinet, a friend of the Costes, tells the class about alternatives for drug users such as substitute drugs. After the debate, CÃ©cile asks Manise to tail her husband Alain Coste, because he has been hiding something from her. He asks for a [[photo]] and inquires if he was ever involved in [[politics]] before they married or at the [[university]], she denies it. Manise investigates Alain but seems more interested in CÃ©cile, he checks the files on the People's Army and he concludes that Alain is clean other than having a few [[speeding]] tickets. He cuts him off the photo and keeps the half with CÃ©cile on it. Manise is called, there has been a fire where the firemen have found lots of [[guns]], in the ensuing investigation they conclude that it was Le Roux, he has left a bunch of evidence behind him and a neighbour gives a full description.  The next day Pascal follows Alain who meets with a younger woman, but when he describes her to CÃ©cile, she recognizes her own daughter, he must start all over again. In the meantime AgnÃ¨s has been increasingly ill due to [[opioid withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]], Manise has been watching from outside the [[apartment]] and even tries to score some dope from a colleague at the [[police station]] to no avail. He comes in and AgnÃ¨s is desperate she asks him to buy some drugs from a dealer but he refuses: their understanding was that he would never buy drugs from a dealer. She tells him that he does not love her anymore, otherwise he would not have forgotten the morphine because she and drugs are one and the same. A call comes in: there has been a bomb attack in the [[Court House]] and all men are called in.  Early the next day Manise has Jeanne arrested, while interrogating her she says nothing and has to keep her in isolation. AgnÃ¨s is distressed because the students in the high school have gone on [[student strike|strike]] to [[protest]] for Jeanne's arrest, this is further aggravated by the fact that AgnÃ¨s has been more than 24 hours without her drugs. Manise goes to Alain's office and poses as a member of the [[financial]] branch of the Police, he suggests that he is looking for evidence against Alain's questionable business but his [[personal assistant|PA]] does not believe him. AgnÃ¨s confronts Pascal and tells her that she cannot face the pain anymore but Pascal sets his foot down and asks her to resist for 5 days without any drugs, she agrees and throws him out of the apartment. When walking out he runs into CÃ©cile, she has come to ask him to stop his investigations on Alain, he tells her that he only wanted to compare the PA's hair to a sample that he found in Alain's [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]. CÃ©cile gives Manise a ride to the Police Station.  In the meantime AgnÃ¨s has gone out looking for a fix, she tries to buy dope from Banane, a petty [[drug dealer]], she is so desperate that she even offers sex in exchange for a score but he refuses. She attacks Banane but he gets the upper hand until he is stopped by a man who points a [[gun]] at him, the stranger allows AgnÃ¨s to take all the drugs she wants and she goes into the [[street]] but finds that the Police have blockaded the entire neighbourhood, she throws all she has and escapes back to Banane's selling post. The man is furious to see her back but remains calm when she tells him about the Police. They stay and she figures out that the Police is looking for him, she offers her apartment to hide if he brings her in, her husband is a cop and no one shall look for him there. Back at the Police Station, Manise talks with Francis Rivet, husband of Jeanne, who is willing to make the necessary statements to get her out of jail, during this conversation it turns out that it was Francis who betrayed the People's Army to the Police and if Jeanne has been able to live her life is because the government has nothing on her.  Pascal lets Jeanne go, he asks why none of AgnÃ¨s' friends shall talk to him, for the first time Jeanne answers and lets him know that it is because he is a cop. As she leaves, he catches up with her and offers to drive her home because he spotted a [[silver]] [[car]] that has been following him around. Manise confronts Jacquillat about his spies and demands that they stop following him and his [[witness]]es. Jacquillat agrees, calls off his [[henchmen]] and inquires about AgnÃ¨s, Manise is very distressed and offers some of his [[information]] in exchange for a fix but Jacquillat refuses and he reveals that Le Roux has been with his wife when they assaulted one of his dealers, they drive to his place. Meanwhile, AgnÃ¨s is overdozing and is saved by the stranger that helped her to get the only fix she managed to save for herself. Manise walks in unnoticed on a conversation between the stranger (Le Roux) and his wife where he promises to get her the drugs she needs, Manise hides as Le Roux takes AgnÃ¨s to her bed. Manise tells Jacquillat that Le Roux was not there and even offers to pay for the morphine but Jacquillat refuses and leaves.  [[File:La bastille.JPG|thumb|left|Bastille hill from the town]]  Manise spends the night in his car outside the Costes' house where he sees Alain and CÃ©cile drive off to the train station, he notices that Alain walks into the [[train station]] and comes out again and takes a [[taxicab|taxi]]. AgnÃ¨s wakes up and finds that she cannot remember most of yesterday, she gets ready to leave for school and arranges with Le Roux, who poses as Pierre, to meet at a parking lot later that day. Pascal, having lost track of Alain, goes to the hospital where Dr. Colinet works, he runs into him at the parking lot, where he inquires about the alternative treatment that he spoke about earlier, but it turns out that the doctor only mentioned a theory. Once in school, the [[faculty (university)|faculty]] is having a [[Party|celebration]] for Jeanne's liberation. AgnÃ¨s asks CÃ©cile to borrow her car and tells her that she met someone and wants to use her chalet for a romantic ''rendez-vous''. CÃ©cile is bewildered and reluctantly gives her keys to her car and the chalet. AgnÃ¨s makes copies of the keys and goes to the parking lot where she meets with "Pierre", they drive to the chalet where they have breakfast. She asks "Pierre" if he got her some dope but he says that so far he has nothing, she becomes angry and leaves but he stops her and offers an explanation of his actions, she refuses to know and tells him that word are just words, actions are what count. She drives back but stops in the middle of the road and ponders on how low she has sunk.  Back at the police station, Dr. Colinet reports Alain's disappearance. On a hunch, Manise parks in front of Claire's (Alain's [[Personal Assistant|PA]]) place and sees them walk into the house. Back at her place, AgnÃ¨s learns the truth about Le Roux in the [[radio]] [[news]]; Manise confronts her about her relationship with Le Roux and finally lets her know: as long as Le Roux is alive, she shall have no drugs. When asked about Le Roux's whereabouts she refuses to tell him, he unwittingly lets her know about all his known safe-houses and the stake outs that have been set up for him. As Manise walks out he spots the silver car again and manages to get the driver into his trunk, he drives off to a car stop far away from the city and tells the henchman that Jacquillat leave him and his friends alone, the henchman tells him that accidents happen all the time, Manise is enfuriated and hits the man with his gun and leaves. That night AgnÃ¨s [[Theft|steal]]s CÃ©cile's car with the copies that she made and goes to the chalet looking for Le Roux but he is not there. She leaves a note explaining that he should avoid his known hide outs. She then drives around the city and frustrates the stake outs. Olivier, a friend of Pascal's, tells her to avoid going to a [[public square]] where there has been a shoot out, most probably linked with Le Roux. She goes there and sees Manise investigating the many deaths of innocent by-standers but sees that Le Roux is still alive.  Manise drives to CÃ©cile Coste's place and tells her that Alain is at Claire's, they drive there but she has found nothing, he spots a man spying on them and he runs to him, he presses his gun against his head and tells him that the next time he will shoot, CÃ©cile asks him to let him go, the man is Claire's boyfriend. Back in his car he confesses to CÃ©cile that AgnÃ¨s' dealer has been blackmailing him, she understands and asks him to drive her to her chalet. She walks in but comes back out after a very shot while, before they get in his car he tells her that he loves her and she slaps him in the face. He leaves. Manise goes to the hospital and asks Dr. Colinet for morphine but the doctor refuses and demands that he leaves despite his physical threats. Back in his place he talks with AgnÃ¨s and she tells him that he does not love her anymore because he cannot stop her pain. Someone calls at the door, he opens, it is Jeanne, she has come to tell him about Le Roux's whereabouts. Manise goes to Jacquillat's and tells him where to find Le Roux, as the henchmen leave, he calls on his radio to the police and lets them know where to find him too.

Austin Powers in Goldmember
  In his new headquarters behind the famous [[Hollywood]] sign, [[Dr. Evil]] plans to travel back in time to 1975 and bring back [[Johan van der Smut]], aka "Goldmember", who developed a [[cold fusion]] unit for a [[tractor beam]] which Dr. Evil names "[[Preparation H]]". He intends to use the tractor beam to pull a meteor into the Earth, striking the polar ice caps and causing a global flood. Moments after this plan is revealed, [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] and the British Secret Service attack the base and arrest Dr. Evil. Austin is knighted for his services, but is disappointed when his father, the famous super-spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event. [[Basil Exposition]] later informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped, and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold.  Austin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil, who tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction. Time-travelling to 1975, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's [[roller disco]] club and is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra, who is undercover as a disco singer. With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father, but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day. Foxxy wants revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit. In the present, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence [[mole (espionage)|mole]] named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near Tokyo. Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]], who is now a [[sumo wrestling|sumo wrestler]], but still does work for Dr. Evil. Fat Bastard explains that a Japanese business man, [[Nobu Matsuhisa|Mr. Roboto]], is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember.  Austin and Foxxy later meet with Mr. Roboto, who pleads ignorance about Nigel's whereabouts. Unconvinced, Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember's car, and Roboto hands Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel, but Goldmember escapes with the command unit and flees to Dr. Evil's submarine. Unable to settle their differences, Nigel and Austin part ways when they disagree on how to deal with the situation. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's son, [[Scott Evil]], has become increasingly evil in an attempt to prove himself to his father, to the point that he too is going bald. Scott presents his father with sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, a request that had gone unfulfilled in [[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery|the first film]]. Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son; the rejected Mini-Me defects and joins Austin.  Austin, Foxxy and Mini-Me (now a miniature version of Austin) infiltrate the submarine, but Austin is captured. Dr. Evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but Foxxy has stolen the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are both his sons, telling them that when they were babies, he and their mother took them to Belgium for a family holiday and he stepped out of the car to have a tinkle in the bushes when their car exploded. Dr. Evil tells him that his parents died in that car accident, but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought at first that only Austin survived and didn't know that Dr. Evil survived too until after the two Belgians made him evil. Dr. Evil and Austin embrace, enraging Scott, who flees to pursue his own vengeance, whilst Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his pants to reveal his gold-covered genitals to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world. The heroes arrest Goldmember, who turns to the camera to reveal the entire string of events was [[story within a story|adapted into a film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Austin, [[Kevin Spacey]] as Dr. Evil, [[Danny DeVito]] as Mini-Me, and [[John Travolta]] as Goldmember. Austin, Foxxy, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Nigel are in the audience of a Hollywood theater watching the film. Upon exiting the theater they run into Fat Bastard, now thinner but flabby, thanks to the [[Subway diet]]. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, Scott â now completely bald, dressed like and laughing in a manner similar to his father â declares he will get his revenge on Austin and begins dancing like [[Michael Jackson]].

In Gaul, two Roman legionnaires challenge protagonist Asterix, who drinks the potion and defeats one Roman; whereupon Obelix fells the other. They are joined by Numerobis, whom they guide to Getafix.

Luo's father turns out to be a dentist who had once fitted a false tooth for [[Chiang Kai-shek]], while Ma's father is a doctor. The Chief also examines the boys' luggage and burns a cookbook, which he claims to be bourgeois. He is about to throw Ma's violin into the fire as well before he is stopped by Luo, who lies that the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Divertimento KV 334'' Ma plays is a "mountain song" titled ''Mozart is Thinking of Chairman Mao''.  The two boys are allocated a house and immediately join in the labours of the locals, which include transporting buckets of human waste used for fertilizer as well as working in the coal mine. One day, a young girl, granddaughter of a tailor from the neighbouring village and known to everyone as the Little Seamstress ([[Zhou Xun]]), comes by with her grandfather to listen to Ma play violin. Luo and Ma befriend the Little Seamstress and soon both fall in love with her. The girl, illiterate but hungry for knowledge, and the boys, vowing to transform her, devise a plan to steal a suitcase filled with banned translated Western novels from Four-Eyes ([[Wang Hongwei]]), another boy undergoing re-education in the village but bound to return to the city. Luo begins to read to the Little Seamstress every day, books including those by [[Stendhal]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]].

Ma travels to the city to find a gynecologist who knows his father and begs the latter for help. The gynecologist is moved and agrees to travel to the village to perform a secret abortion. Upon Luo's return, life resumes as before.

However, his efforts are futile and he brings back only a video recording of the village and the people, including the now aged Chief. As Ma meets up with his old friend Luo in Shanghai, the latter confesses an earlier failed attempt to search for the Little Seamstress in [[Shenzhen]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The film ends with a news clip of the flooded towns and villages and a scene of the three, back to their youth years, also submerged in water.

Balto tells Aleu the truth about her wolf heritage, causing her to run away, hoping to find her place in the world. Balto then goes out into the Alaskan wilderness to find her. At the same time, Balto has been struggling with strange dreams of a raven and a pack of wolves, and he cannot understand their meaning. Balto resolves to find the meaning of these dreams as he searches for Aleu. His friends Boris, Muk and Luk attempt to join him, but after they are halted by some unknown force, they realize that this journey is meant only for the father and daughter themselves.  Taking refuge in a cave, Aleu meets the field mouse Muru, who explains that Aleu should not be ashamed of her lineage, which tells her what she is but not who she is. Muru reveals himself to be Aleu's spirit guide, and tells her to go on a journey of self-discovery. Balto and Aleu reunite and reconcile, and find their way to the ocean, where they are attacked by a group of starving wolves led by Niju. The confrontation is defused by the elderly Nava, the true leader of the pack, who welcomes Balto and Aleu. Nava announces to his pack that the wolf spirit Aniu has contacted him in "dream visions". Aniu has told him that the caribou herd they depend on during the winter has moved across the ocean and will not return, and that they will soon be led by a new leader, "the one who is wolf but does not know". Nava believes that Balto, who is half wolf himself, is the chosen one that Aniu was speaking of. However, Niju refuses to abandon his homeland, and takes control of the pack, and plots to steal from other animal clans in the area to survive the winter.  Aleu has a "dream vision" of the caribou herd crossing a bridge made of ice floes. The next morning, Niju prepares to lead an attack on a clan of bears, but is stopped by Balto just as a large group of ice floes in the ocean come together to form a land bridge. Balto then leads the pack across the bridge until Nava falls behind. When Aleu attempts to help Nava, Niju attacks, and Balto doubles back to save them, leaving the pack leaderless. Nava cannot make the journey across the ice in his old age, and Balto tells Niju to go lead the clan. Niju refuses, too afraid to leave his home, and soon returns to the shore. Balto prepares to go to the pack, but Aleu realizes that her true place is to take leadership of the pack as Nava foretold. Balto and Aleu say goodbye to each other before Aleu rejoins the pack and takes over as leader. Back on shore, Nava bids farewell to Balto before going to look for Niju so they can survive together. The raven appears to Balto again, and transforms into Aniu, revealing herself to be his mother before he begins to make his way home.

Barbie as Rapunzel
 Barbie tells a story to her little sister Kelly, who doesn't have confidence in her painting abilities.  Rapunzel lives as a servant to the evil witch Gothel, who resides in a manor isolated in the woods. She grows up believing that Gothel saved her from abandonment as an infant. Rapunzel finds companionship in Penelope, an outgoing [[dragon]], and Hobie, a worrisome and anxious [[rabbit]]. Rapunzel spends what free time she has painting beautiful pictures of places she dreams of going when she is free one day.  However, Gothel disapproves of Rapunzel's hobbies and accuses her of not appreciating everything that Gothel has done for her.  While preparing tea for Gothel, Penelope accidentally finds a secret staircase which leads to an old room below the manor. In it they discover a gift from her parents who allegedly deserted her: a silver hairbrush engraved with a message from her mother and father. Later, she also discovers a tunnel leading to the nearby village. Rapunzel takes this path to the small kingdom and is able to rescue a young princess named Katrina from a pitfall.  Soon after, Rapunzel is introduced to Katrina's older brother, Prince Stefan. He explains to her that the trap Katrina managed to escape was put there by King Wilhelm, the ruler of an opposing kingdom. Enchanted by the mysterious maiden, Stefan asks to meet her again, to which she agrees, though their meeting is ended abruptly before Stefan can tell her his name. Rapunzel quickly rushes back to the woods to avoid being discovered by Gothel. Unknown to Rapunzel, Gothel's pet [[ferrett]], Otto, has witnessed the entire exchange. A furious Gothel demands Rapunzel to tell her the prince's name. Rapunzel insists that she does not know it, but Gothel does not believe her, thinking Rapunzel has been lying. Rapunzel tells her that she cannot keep her locked away forever to which Gothel responds, ''Watch me.'' Gothel destroys Rapunzel's paints and paintings before transforming the bedroom into a more secure, seemingly escape-proof [[tower]] and stations Hugo, Penelope's father, outside. Gothel refuses to let Rapunzel go until she tells her the name of the boy she met.  That night, Rapunzel has a dream that Prince Stefan found her tower. He came up by climbing her long hair. When up there, they are about to kiss, but Gothel shows up and separates them. Rapunzel then wakes up and reads the engraving on the hairbrush. She realizes that there is still hope. Going back to sleep, a shower of light turns the hairbrush into a paintbrush. Rapunzel is left alone with Hobie and Penelope, who cheer her up with new paint to replace the ones taken away from by Gothel. Hobie discovers the [[paintbrush]], and Rapunzel begins to paint. It soon becomes clear that she doesn't need paint, and whatever she paints becomes real. Rapunzel paints the village and then uses the painting as a portal, arriving at the palace [[garden]]s and meeting Stefan. She shows him the brush and asks for help to find its maker, but insists that he never tell her his name, worrying that Gothel will find out. She meets a silversmith who says his brother, who lives in King Wilhelm's kingdom, made it. The silversmith has not seen his brother in years, making him very upset. Stefan realizes that the feud is hurting the villagers more than he realized.  Afterward, Stefan asks Rapunzel to a masked ball. She replies that she will meet him there.  He tells that her hair is a 'beautiful give-away.' Penelope soon arrives via the painting and explains that Gothel is coming, and they must leave so that Hugo will not be punished. Rapunzel leaves, painting a way out. When back at the tower, Rapunzel uses the paintbrush to paint herself a beautiful gown. Hobie and Penelope provide a mask. Unfortunately, the paintbrush's magic light can be seen and Otto sneaks in. He quickly steals the invitation without their notice and presents it to Gothel. Gothel arrives at the tower, cuts off Rapunzel's hair, and shatters the paintbrush. She also manages to destroy the painting of the village. Because she thinks Rapunzel refused to tell the truth, Gothel angrily puts a spell on her tower, which eternally holds people who lie. Gothel then storms to King Fredrick and Stefan's castle. Back at the tower, Rapunzel manages to escape with the help of Penelope and Hugo, as the spell only works if the prisoner is a liar, which Rapunzel is not, so it allows her to leave. She then rushes to save Stefan and his family by riding on Penelope who finally overcome her fear of heights.  Stefan is lured away from the party by Gothel, disguised as Rapunzel. Gothel reveals herself and begins her attack. King Wilhelm comes before King Fredrick, hoping to end the feud by force. It is revealed that the source of the feud is that Wilhelm believes Fredrick kidnapped his daughter, who has been missing since she was an infant. Fredrick replies that he planned nothing of the sort and he has no idea where Wilhelm's daughter is, to which Gothel reveals that she took Rapunzel because Wilhelm "loved" her but married another woman; he saw Gothel only as a friend; and the overall plot was to cause the kingdoms to destroy each other. Rapunzel arrives just in time to stop them from fighting, and King Wilhelm immediately recognizes her as his daughter. The witch attacks Rapunzel with magic. As Rapunzel runs into the royal maze, she remembers the magic painting of the tower that is still there and tricks Gothel into running into it. Gothel finds herself in Rapunzel's tower, where Hugo reminds her she can't escape, as she has a lying heart.  Rapunzel is reunited with her biological parents, and marries Stefan, thus ending the feud as well as uniting the two kingdoms. Hugo, Penelope, and Hobie live in their castle with them. It's revealed that Otto now serves Gothel, forever trapped in the tower. A shot is seen of Rapunzel and Stefan walking along a beach, the same one that Rapunzel painted with a castle in the distance, implying her dreams came true. The scene becomes the painting Barbie had been working on.  Kelly now feels better and begins painting with blue, after Barbie reminds her that creativity is the true magic in art.

 Jesminder "Jess" Bhamra ([[Parminder Nagra]]) is the 18-year-old daughter of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] living in [[Hounslow]], London. Juliette "Jules" Paxton ([[Keira Knightley]]) is the same age and the daughter of a native English family. Jess is infatuated with football, but because she is a woman, her conservative family won't let her play. However, she sometimes plays in the park with boys, including her best friend, Tony ([[Ameet Chana]]), a closeted gay man.  Whilst on a jog through the park, Jules discovers Jess's skills, befriends her, and invites her to try out for the local women's football team, the Hounslow Harriers coached by Joe ([[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]). Jess is extremely happy and excited about the tryouts, even though Joe is sceptical about a new player joining the team. After seeing Jess's skills, Joe accepts her on the team and Jess lies to Joe about her parents being cool with the idea.  Jess's parents ([[Anupam Kher]] and [[Shaheen Khan]]) eventually discover that Jess has been playing football behind their backs. They become more strict and forbid Jess to play in any more matches. The elder Bhamras are also distracted by their elaborate wedding plans for Jess's older sister, Pinky ([[Archie Panjabi]]). Thanks to the skills of Jess and Jules, the Harriers reach the finals of the league tournament. Unfortunately, the finals and Pinky's wedding fall on the same day.  Joe pleads with Mr Bhamra to allow Jess to play, but Mr Bhamra refuses, which reveals that he does not want Jess to suffer the way he did when he was excluded from a cricket club because of being Indian. Jess develops an attraction toward Joe, and when the team plays in [[Hamburg|Hamburg, Germany]] and goes out clubbing, they're caught by Jules when about to kiss. Jules also has a crush on Joe, and this sours the two girls' friendship, as Jules is adamant that she had told Jess about her crush. When Jess goes to Jules's house to try to patch up their friendship, Jules's mother ([[Juliet Stevenson]]) is misled and thinks they're hiding a lesbian relationship.  Joe accepts that Jess is not allowed to play and the final begins without her. But halfway through Pinky's wedding, Tony convinces Mr Bhamra to let Jess go. He agrees, and Tony drives Jess to the game, where the Harriers are losing 1â0 with half an hour left. Jess and Jules tie the score, and when Jess is awarded a free kick, she must bend the ball around the wall of players to score. She succeeds and the Harriers win the tournament. Jess and Jules are offered sports scholarships at [[Santa Clara University]] in [[California]], which Jules tells her parents immediately, whereas Jess has trouble telling hers. Jules and her mother arrive at Pinky's wedding so that Jules can celebrate with Jess. When Mrs Paxton accuses Jess of being a hypocrite and a lesbian, Jules grabs her mother and runs off in shame.  Jess has still not told her parents about the scholarship â she is afraid they might not allow her to go to the United States on her own. Tony, out of friendship for Jess, decides to lie to the family and tell them he is engaged to Jess as long as she gets to go to any college she wants. Jess reveals the lie and her mother blames Jess's father for allowing her to play. Jess's father convinces her mother to accept Jess's wishes after telling her he doesn't want Jess to suffer as he did. Jess flees to the football field to tell Joe of her parents' decision. The two almost kiss, but Jess pulls away, saying her parents would object, and that although they had come far enough to let her go to America to play, she doesn't think they would be able to handle another cultural rebellion from her.  On the day of Jess and Jules's flight to America, Jules's mother gives her daughter a football jersey and wishes her good luck, this being her way of telling her daughter that she has accepted Jules's decision. The two are about to board the plane when Joe arrives and confesses his love for Jess. The two kiss and Jess agrees to sort out their relationship (and her parents) when she returns for Christmas. While at the airport, they see David Beckham with his wife Victoria, which Jules takes as a sign. Jess and Jules send their parents a team photograph, and it is revealed that Pinky is pregnant.

 Lena has an absent Irish father she longs to see and an Aboriginal mother she finds disgusting. When she breaks away, she meets up with petty criminal Vaughn who's just escaped from low security prison to reluctantly visit his dying mother. Blonde and light-skinned, Lena remains in denial about her Aboriginal heritage; Vaughn is an angry young man with a grudge against all whites. An uneasy relationship begins to form as they hit the road heading to Sydney, taking them on a journey that's as emotional as it is physical, as revealing as it is desperate.  Initially the two reluctant travelling companions are suspicious and wary of each other, but their journey, mostly by foot and the odd lift, builds an understanding between them. The film follows its creator's (Ivan Sen's) own experiences growing up in Inverell, NSW with an Aboriginal mother and a European father who was not around.

Below (film)
 USS ''Tiger Shark'' is a U.S. Navy submarine on patrol in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II in August 1943. She receives orders to pick up survivors spotted adrift by a British [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] patrol plane. She retrieves three survivors &ndash; the British nurse Claire Paige ([[Olivia Williams]]) and two men, one of them wounded &ndash; from the British [[hospital ship]] ''Fort James'', which had been sunk two days earlier; one of the survivors blames the sinking on a German [[U-boat]] that he briefly saw on the surface just before ''Fort James'' suffered a [[torpedo]] hit. As they pick up the survivors, the crew of ''Tiger Shark'' spots a German [[destroyer]] bearing down on them. The submarine has several encounters with the German destroyer and suffers damage from [[depth charge]]s in the process. Later, the commanding officer of ''Tiger Shark'', Lieutenant Brice ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), discovers that the wounded survivor is actually a German [[prisoner-of-war]], Bernhard Schillings ([[Jonathan Hartman]]). Brice confronts him because he thinks Schillings has been making noises to betray ''Tiger Shark''s position to the German warship.  Brice shoots Schillings dead when the German panics and grabs a [[scalpel]] to defend himself.  Brice reveals to Paige that ''Tiger Shark'' had sunk a German [[submarine tender]] recently and that her previous commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Winters ([[Nick Hobbs]]), had died after ''Tiger Shark'' surfaced to confirm the sinking. According to Brice, Winters was using a [[boathook]] to try to obtain a souvenir from the [[flotsam]] left behind by the sunken German ship when ''Tiger Shark'' struck a submerged object, causing Winters to hit his head while reaching for his souvenir, fall overboard, and drown before he could be rescued. Brice then assumed command of ''Tiger Shark''.  Soon after the death of the German prisoner, those aboard ''Tiger Shark'' begin to hear disembodied voices and experience other eerie events. While working in one of ''Tiger Shark''s [[ballast tank]]s, two of the submarine's officers, Lieutenant Steven Coors ([[Scott Foley]]) and Ensign Douglas Odell ([[Matthew Davis]]) have a conversation in which Odell questions the story about Winters hitting his head and falling overboard after ''Tiger Shark'' struck a submerged object, saying that he had felt no such impact. Coors tells Odell that the real story of Winters' death is darker. Winters, on deck with only Brice, Coors, and Lieutenant Paul Loomis ([[Holt McCallany]]), had ordered them to have a gunnery party come on deck to machine-gun the survivors of the sunken German ship in the water. When Brice, Loomis, and Coors objected, a heated argument had broken out and escalated into a physical altercation during which Winters hit his head and fell overboard. In order to protect Winters' reputation, Coors asks Odell not to tell anyone. Before they leave the ballast tank, Coors dies in a mysterious accident. Soon afterwards, Loomis sees Winters' ghost aboard ''Tiger Shark''. He escapes from the submarine via an [[escape trunk]] while the submarine is underwater, and dies when he is impaled on an outside railing.   A series of bizarre mechanical problems causes the crew of ''Tiger Shark'' to lose control of the submarine, and the submarine turns back towards the site of her sinking of the German ship, apparently of her own volition. Meanwhile, crewmen die in accidents at an alarming rate.  The eerie phenomena seem related to the death of Winters, and the crew begins to suspect a supernatural influence is behind all of ''Tiger Shark''s mishaps and to question Brice's version of how and why Winters died.  Paige and Odell discover that ''Tiger Shark'' mistook ''Fort James'' for the German submarine tender and sank ''Fort James'' instead; they also learn that Brice, Loomis, and Coors believed that they could not afford this drastic mistake to appear on their records and conspired to suppress the story, killing Winters on the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] of ''Tiger Shark'' as he tried to save the survivors of ''Fort James''.   ''Tiger Shark'' ultimately is crippled by a mounting number of accidents, and only five of those aboard remain alive: Brice, Odell, Paige, Stumbo ([[Jason Flemyng]]), and "Weird" Wally ([[Zach Galifianakis]]). Wally concludes that ''Tiger Shark'' is haunted by a "malediction" that must be satisfied in order to escape its netherworld between heaven and hell. After ''Tiger Shark'' arrives at the location of the sinking of ''Fort James'', she surfaces in a disabled condition and those aboard her detect a [[Surface combatant|surface ship]] nearby. Brice prevents the surviving crew of ''Tiger Shark'' from radioing the nearby ship, but Paige sneaks out on deck and tries to signal the ship with a flashlight. Brice confronts her and holds her at gunpoint. His remorse over the accident overcomes him; he admits the entire cover-up to Paige and then shoots himself in the head, falling dead into the ocean.  The ship Paige is signaling turns out to be British and picks up the four survivors of ''Tiger Shark''. As they look on, ''Tiger Shark'' sinks, coming to rest on the ocean floor next to the wreck of ''Fort James''.  
Ben and Arthur
 Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Sam Mraovich) are a gay couple eagerly awaiting the legalization of [[gay marriage]] in [[Hawaii]] so that they may travel there for their dream wedding. After a news bulletin that a judge has made [[Baehr v. Miike|a ruling that will allow gay marriages to take place]], the men purchase plane tickets and prepare to depart; however, before they leave, they discover that a challenge to the judge's ruling has resulted in a suspension of gay marriage in Hawaii, pending further judicial review. Ben takes advantage of the delay to inform Arthur that he is actually already married to a woman named Tammy (Julie Belknap), whom he wed out of societal pressure before he came to terms with his homosexuality and from whom he has been separated since before he and Arthur met. Arthur becomes angry, but decides to stay with Ben anyway. Shortly thereafter, Ben contacts Tammy, finally [[coming out|comes out]] to her, and asks her for a divorce.  After the disappointment of their near-wedding, Ben and Arthur resume their daily life, working in a small diner in Los Angeles, where Ben is a dishwasher and Arthur is a waiter. Although Benâa former nurse who quit to pursue a music careerâenjoys the manual labor and hours, Arthur has grown impatient with servitude and putting up with needy customers. One night, Arthur decides to quit and go back to college, so that he can earn an [[MBA]] and open up his own [[sex shop]]. Although the loss of income to the household means that Ben will have to quit and return to being a nurse, he agrees to do so in order to help Arthur pursue his dream.  To finance his education, Arthur tracks down his estranged brother, Victor (Michael Haboush), whom he hasn't spoken to for seven years. Victor is a [[religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] who believes that Arthur's homosexuality is a sign of [[demonic possession]], although Victor himself appears to be [[wikt:flamboyance|flamboyantly gay]]âeven greeting Arthur in a pink feathered bathrobe. Although Victor lashes out at Arthur for his failure to [[ex-gay|turn straight]], he nonetheless offers to give Arthur money for college if he will bring Ben by the apartment and allow him to [[evangelize]].  While Arthur considers Victor's offer, he and Ben hire an attorney (Gina Aguilar) to consult for advice on getting married. Despite Ben's still being legally married to Tammy, the attorney counsels them to travel to [[Vermont]], be wed in a [[civil union]], and then return to California and attempt to be recognized as members of a domestic partnership. The two take her advice, and are wed in a private ceremony in Vermont.   Suspicious of Arthur's lack of response to his monetary offer, Victor hires a [[private investigator]] to tail Ben and Arthur. The PI tells Victor about the men's marriage and their attempts to get their union recognized in California. In response, Victor follows the attorney home one evening and shoots her to death in her apartment's parking garage. At the same time, Tammy arrives at Arthur's apartment and tries to force Ben to take her back at gunpoint, but Ben successfully disarms her and throws her out.  Following their attorney's death, Ben and Arthur agree to come to Victor's apartment. Rather than evangelize, Victor and another congregant from his church, Stan (Richard Hitchcock), lash out at the couple with homophobic insults and slurs. When Ben and Arthur leave, Victor and Stan start making plans to [[exorcism|exorcise]] the couple by feeding them [[Holy Water]] that Stan has cooked in his kitchen. The plot fails, and Ben and Arthur leave town to enjoy a honeymoon in Hawaii and allow the tension with Victor to blow over. In Ben and Arthur's absence, Victor is summoned to church by his priest, Father Rabin (Bill Hindley). Rabin informs him that he is being [[excommunication|excommunicated]] because the congregation does not want the relative of a gay person attending church services, fearful that he will bring them [[karma|bad karma]] and [[Energy (esotericism)|negative energy]]. A dejected Victor reaches out to Stan for help, who helps Victor come to an agreement with Father Rabin that Victor will be permitted to rejoin the church if he successfully murders Ben and Arthur. To this end, they hire a [[hitman]] named Scott (Nick Bennet), whom Father Rabin has apparently used to kill gay people in the past.  When Ben and Arthur return from Hawaii, Ben is [[gay bashing|gay bashed]] by Victor and Scott; the attack fails to kill him, and Ben is hospitalized. Suspecting his brother's involvement, Arthur breaks into Victor's apartment and [[Telephone tapping|taps his phone]]. After intercepting a call implicating Victor and Father Rabin, Arthur goes to Victor's church, chloroforms Father Rabin, and then murders him by burning the church down with him still inside.  After Ben has sufficiently recovered, Arthur takes him back home to their apartment. Deciding that the next attempt on the men's lives must be more drastic, Victor and Scott go Ben and Arthur's apartment with guns; at the last minute, Victor tells Scott that he wants to kill them himself and sends him away. Victor rings the apartment's doorbell, and when Ben answers, he fatally shoots him. He then forces Arthur to strip naked at gunpoint and performs an impromptu [[baptism]] in the bathtub.  While Victor contemplates what he's done, Arthur slips away and gets the gun that Ben had earlier confiscated from Tammy. Dressed in a bathrobe and briefs, a hysterical Arthurâreenacting one of the final scenes of ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''âpropositions Victor while holding him at gunpoint, accusing him of lashing out to try to combat his own repressed homosexuality. When Arthur fires a warning shot, Victor pulls out his own gun and shoots Arthur in the chest and back several times. In turn, Arthur manages to fire off a single shot which hits Victor in the forehead and instantly kills him, before Arthur dies of his own wounds.

As Marty finally arrives at the studio, he witnesses Jason kidnapping his stuffed monkey toy. After a chase across the studio, Marty catches Jason and retrieves his toy. He mocks Jason and tells him he will never reveal the truth to anyone while admitting that he stole Jason's paper and turned it into ''Big Fat Liar''.

Better Luck Tomorrow
  Ben Manibag and Virgil Hu are stereotypical overachieving Asian-Americans whose singular goal is to gain acceptance into highly prestigious [[Ivy League]] universities. Ben engages in perfectionistic pursuits including learning a new SAT word daily, and trying to best [[Calvin Murphy]]'s record for free-throw shooting percentage. Ben reveals that his perfectionism cloaks another side of his life, including toilet-papering houses with Virgil and other petty crimes including the theft and return of computer equipment with Virgil and his cousin Han Hu to earn easy money. Ben is involved in many school clubs, mainly to pad his college application. He makes the basketball team, though he ends up receiving only token playing time. At the same time, Ben develops a crush on his new lab partner, Stephanie Vandergosh, a girl of Asian descent adopted by a white family.  After meeting Daric Loo, senior valedictorian and president of nearly every student club, Ben becomes part of a school-wide cheat sheet operation. Ben pays Jesus, another student, to steal the tests from the school office, which are then sold off to students. Ben also brings in Virgil and Han into the operation, and the four of them make a small fortune. Meanwhile, Ben has fallen for  Stephanie. He discovers that her boyfriend, Steve Choe, seems to take her for granted. Steve discovers Ben's crush and offers to let him take her to the Winter Formal.  As a member of the Academic Decathlon team with Daric, Virgil and Han, the team practices at Daric's house with the practices devolving into drinking parties. After Daric mistakenly thinks he is going on a date with Stephanie, the group gets intoxicated and arrives at a party, where they are accosted by a football player who mocks them. A fight results in Daric pulling out a gun, stopping the fight.  At school the following Monday, news of the fight spreads around school and the groupâs notoriety increases. They gradually expand into more dangerous scams, such as the theft of computer parts from the school and eventually selling drugs. They become users themselves, with Ben developing a heavy cocaine habit. Ben feels increasingly conflicted as he feels stifled by the expectations that others have of him. On his birthday, he wakes up with a nosebleed as a result of his cocaine use, which scares him into changing his life. He tells the group that he wants to quit.

He also begins spending more time with Stephanie, who reveals a wild side of her own when she gives him a CD that she shoplifted. He eventually asks Stephanie to the formal, to which she agrees. During a trip to the Academic Decathlon championships in Las Vegas, Daric hires a prostitute for the guys, with Ben losing his virginity in the process. During his turn, Virgil pulls a gun on the prostitute and she storms off, leading to a fight between Virgil and Han. Despite the turmoil, the team wins the competition.  Ben and Stephanie attend the winter formal together and cultivate their friendship.The situation is made clear to Ben when Steve is seen outside of the formal, waiting to take Stephanie home. Steve meets Ben and tells him that he has information on a possible score. The group is stunned when Steve wants them to rob his parents' house. He refers to it as a wake-up call. Ben and Han are against the plan, but Daric convinces them to participate, saying that this would be the perfect opportunity to teach Steve a lesson. They agree to Steveâs plan and practice constantly, even agreeing to purchase a gun for Steve.  On New Year's Eve, the four meet Steve at Jesus' house under the pretense of robbing Steve's parents' house, where they begin attacking Steve instead. In the ensuing struggle the gun goes off. Ben beats Steve nearly to death in the confusion. Thinking Steve is dead, the group convinces Jesus to agree to bury the body in his backyard for $300. Steve begins to twitch, but Daric suffocates Steve with a gasoline-soaked rag while a tearful Virgil clutches him. Afterwards, the four go to a New Year's Eve party, where Ben and Stephanie kiss at midnight.  On a hot sunny day, Ben and Virgil discover Steve's body buried in the backyard. Ben debates on whether to report Steve's murder to the police. The guilt over Steve's murder is too much for Virgil, who attempts to commit suicide, but suffers potential brain damage in the process. At the hospital, Daric makes a flippant remark about Virgil's injuries that angers Han. Daric expresses concern about Han or Virgil revealing their secret, but Ben simply resolves to do nothing and walks away.  Separated from the group, Ben is alone at school. He encounters Stephanie one day on the way home. She asks him whether he has seen Steve lately, and expresses some concern that he has not called. They kiss, implying the resumption of their relationship. Ben's voice-over tells the audience that he has no idea about what the future holds, but all he knows is that there is no turning back.  
Big Trouble (2002 film)
  In a high-school game of "[[Killer:_The_Game_of_Assassination|Killer]]" (in which a student must shoot another with a squirt gun), Matt Arnold has to "kill" classmate Jenny Herk, and decides to sneak up on her at home. By [[coincidence]], hitmen are also there to assassinate Arthur Herk, who has secretly embezzled money from his company, Penultra Corp. When the fake [[assassination]] attempt crosses paths with the real one, police officers Monica Romero and Walter Kramitz are called out to the resulting disturbance. During the chaos of the assassination attempts, Matt's friend, Andrew, called Eliot Arnold, Matt's father. Upon arriving to pick up Matt from the Herks', Eliot immediately feels a mutual attraction to Anne Herk, Jenny's mother, as Matt and Jenny begin to feel attracted to each other as well. The Herks' housemaid, Nina, meanwhile, falls in love with a young homeless man named Puggy, who lives in a tree on their property, after she runs from the shootings and he saves her from the hitmen.  Realizing that he is the intended victim, Arthur visits arms dealers to buy a rocket but is sold a [[Suitcase bomb|suitcase nuclear bomb]] because the dealer claims to be out of rockets and doesn't tell him that it is a nuclear weapon. Escaped convicts Snake and Eddie, who were previously kicked out of the bar for disorderly conduct, hold up the bar and kidnap Arthur and Puggy (who is an employee there) and take the suitcase, not knowing its contents.  Meanwhile, Matt tries to "kill" Jenny in a mall parking lot, but a security guard thinks that Matt's [[Water gun|gun]] is real and opens fire on them. Matt and Jenny run away and eventually return to the Herk house, followed by officers Monica and Walter, who stumble across the confusion. Eliot is called over once again.  The convicts force Arthur to return to his home, where they capture everyone and tie them up. Taking Puggy and kidnapping Jenny, they leave (with the suitcase) for the Airport. Nina, who was hiding in her room, frees everyone except for Monica and Arthur (who were handcuffed to an entertainment system). Shortly after, the house is visited by two [[FBI]] agents who are tracking the bomb. They free Monica and have her lead them to the airport (leaving Arthur, as he was poisoned by a [[Psychoactive toads|hallucinogenic toad]], causing him to think that his dog is possessed by [[Martha Stewart]]).  The criminals pass through security with Puggy and Jenny, where the bomb is inadvertently triggered and its 45-minute timer begins; Puggy manages to escape in the confusion of boarding the plane. The FBI agents tell everyone that unless the bomb is retrieved soon, the plane must be shot down. Puggy leads the group to the criminals' plane, which Eliot sneaks onto. Meanwhile, the two hitmen get out of the traffic jam (caused by Snake and Eddie) and reach the airport. They bump into Officer Romero, and Special Agents Greer and Seitz, knocking the hitmen's Remington sniper rifle out of their golf bag in the process. Romero grabs the rifle, removes its bolt (rendering it useless), and returns it.  Eliot, having sneaked onto the plane, attacks the criminals by knocking Eddie out with a fire extinguisher and blasting the extinguisher at Snake. On hearing the case is a bomb, Eliot hurls it out of the still open rear door, only for Snake to leap after it. In a memorable feat of dumb luck, Snake manages to cling onto the door's steps. Despite Eliot's insistence that the case is a bomb, Snake opens fire on him which prompts Eliot to pull the emergency lever which decouples the door. Snake plunges into the ocean with a defiant smile, still clinging to the bomb, which explodes safely in the water. Eliot is congratulated by the FBI, promised he will receive presidential cowboy boots and a hat, and told the events that took place are strictly top secret.  The last scene reveals what happens to the main characters: after chasing down a plane, subduing two criminals, and saving Miami from a nuclear disaster, Eliot finally won Matt's respect. Anne and Eliot get married a week after Anne gets divorced from Arthur. Walter, after a forced strip search by the airport guards, becomes a male stripper and marries. The two hitmen manage to escape Miami after a series of very weird events. They claim their Miami job was the lowest point in their careers. They were surrounded by the fans of [[Florida Gators]] on their plane home (which was a constant joke in the film). Eddie goes back to jail in a prison outside of [[Jacksonville]], but becomes friends with another dimwitted inmate who shares the same affinity for crude jokes as Eddie does. Arthur is last seen still handcuffed and tormented by his dog.

Black Hawk Down (film)
 In 1993, following the ousting of the central government and start of a civil war, a major United Nations military operation in [[Somalia]] is authorized with a peacekeeping mandate. After the bulk of the peacekeepers are withdrawn, the Mogadishu-based militia loyal to [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]] declares war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, the U.S. Army deploys three of its [[Special forces|special operations forces]] &ndash; [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Rangers]], [[Delta Force]] counter-terrorist operators, and [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th SOAR - Night Stalkers]] aviators &ndash; to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president of the country.  To consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments, while the UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture [[Osman Atto|Osman Ali Atto]], a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. A mission is planned to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers.  The U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including 18-year-old PFC Todd Blackburn and a desk clerk, SPC Grimes, going on his first mission. When his lieutenant is removed from duty after having an epileptic seizure, Staff Sergeant Matthew Eversmann is placed in command of Ranger [[Chalk (military)|Chalk]] Four, his first command.  The operation begins and Delta Force operators capture Aidid's advisers inside the target building. The Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire, while Eversmann's Chalk Four is dropped a block away by mistake. Blackburn is severely injured when he falls from one of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters, so three Humvees led by [[Staff Sergeant#United States|SSG]] [[Jeff Struecker]] are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held [[Mogadishu Airport]].  SGT Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column departs, and shortly thereafter Black Hawk ''Super Six-One'', piloted by CWO Clifton "Elvis" Wolcott crashes when shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. Both Wolcott and his co-pilot Dan Briley are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and one Delta Force sniper Busch on board escapes in an [[MH-6 Little Bird]] helicopter, although Busch dies later from injuries.  The ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site. The Somali militia erects roadblocks, and LTC Danny McKnight's Humvee column is unable to reach the crash area while sustaining heavy casualties including Joyce, Alphabet and Wex. Meanwhile, two Ranger Chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach ''Super-Six One''s crash site and set up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, ''Super Six-Four'', piloted by CWO [[Michael Durant]], is also shot down by an RPG and crashes several blocks away.  With CPT [[Michael D. Steele|Mike Steele]]'s Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach ''Super Six-Four''s crash site nor reinforce the Rangers defending ''Super Six-One''. Two Delta Force snipers, SFC [[Randy Shughart]] and MSG [[Gary Gordon]] are inserted by helicopter to ''Super Six-Four''s crash site, where they find Durant still alive. The site is eventually overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured by Aidid's militia before the angry mob of Somali civilians can kill him as well.  McKnight's column relinquish their attempt to reach ''Six-One''s crash site and return to base with their prisoners and the casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the Rangers and the fallen pilots, and MG Garrison sends LTC Joe Cribbs to ask for reinforcements from the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], including Malaysian and Pakistani armored units from the UN coalition.  As night falls, Aidid's militia launch a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at ''Super Six-One''s crash site. Jamie Smith is killed while covering for his team mate when he gets shot in the leg and bleeds out despite everyone trying to help him. The militants are held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|AH-6J Little Bird]] helicopter gunships, until the 10th Mountain Division's relief column is able to reach and save the American soldiers. The wounded and casualties are evacuated in the vehicles, but a few of Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are [[Mogadishu Mile|forced to run on foot]] from the crash site; after fighting through militia forces, they eventually reach the Pakistani Compound UN Safe Zone. Steele visits his dying friend Ruiz as all the wounded are tended to.  The end titles detail the immediate aftermath of the mission and end of military operations in Somalia: Michael Durant was released after 11 days of captivity, after which President Bill Clinton withdrew all US forces from Somalia. Mohamed Farah Aidid was killed in 1996.  
Blade II
 Two years after the events of [[Blade (film)|''Blade'']], a pandemic known as the "Reaper virus" has spread through the vampire community. Infected vampires are turned into 'Reapers', a mutation of vampires, immune to all vampire weaknesses with the exception of ultraviolet light, who kill humans and turn any vampires they feed on into more Reapers. Unable to contain the Reapers, Vampire Lord Eli Damaskinos sends two emissaries, Asad and his daughter Nyssa, to seek the aid of vampire hunter Blade and his team, consisting of weaponsmith Abraham Whistler and Blade's new assistant Scud. Blade has since recovered Whistler, who had been held captive  and tortured by the group of vampires for 2 years (since the end of the previous film). Whistler had been turned into a vampire by them, and after returning to their headquarters, Blade gives Whistler an anti-virus vampire serum to revert him back to human. After meeting with Damaskinos and his human familiar, lawyer Karel Kounen, they cautiously agree to help due to the danger of the Reapers' uncontrollable hunger and rapid mutation. Asad then introduces Blade and his group to The Bloodpack; a group of vampires trained for the sole purpose of killing Blade. In addition to Asad and Nyssa, The Bloodpack consists of Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Verlaine, her lover Lighthammer, and Priest. To keep them in line and after Reinhardt's racially charged remark, Blade humiliates Reinhardt and plants an explosive charge on the back of Reinhardt's head.  On Blade's advice, the team starts by investigating a [[Prague]] located nightclub frequented by vampires. When they do encounter Reapers, they soon discover their weapons and powers are completely ineffective. Blade is forced to kill Priest after he becomes infected, Lighthammer is wounded (and infected but he keeps this to himself), Whistler deserts his post, and Scud barely survives a Reaper attack by using UV lights to scare them off. Jared Nomak, 'Patient Zero' of the Reaper strain, attacks and nearly kills Blade before a burst of sunlight forces him to retreat. Whistler appears, and says he has been tracking the Reapers to a central nest in the sewers.  The dissection of a Reaper corpse which was trapped by an electronic hatch reveals that most Reapers tend to burn out within twelve hours if they do not feed, as well as having an additional layer of bone, which surrounds and protects their heart. Having learned of this 'Achilles heel', prime weakness, he and Scud create UV projectors for the team.  While searching for the nest, Lighthammer succumbs to the infection, killing Snowman and chasing Verlaine up a manhole ladder before both die of light exposure when Verlaine removes the manhole cover. Chupa turns on Whistler and attacks him, only to die when a group of Reapers attracted to his scent tear him apart. Whistler survives an encounter with Nomak only because he reveals the truth of his condition and situation to Whistler so he can inform Blade. Asad is ambushed, dragged underwater, and killed. Using a special UV emitter bomb pack, Blade kills all of the Reapers with the exception of Nomak and rescues Reinhardt and Nyssa, but is betrayed by Damaskinos and his people, who stun Blade unconscious.  After Damaskinos' betrayal, he reveals that he created The Reaper virus in order to create a new race of vampires based on Blade and that Nomak is in fact his son. Scud turns out to be a familiar loyal to Damaskinos, who also works with Reinhardt. Blade turns the table on Scud, saying he always knew of Scud's true allegiance, and kills him with the bomb he had placed on Reinhardt, earlier. Damaskinos then orders his scientists to dissect Blade so they can learn how to replicate his abilities. After escaping his captors, Whistler brings Blade to a blood pool, where he regains enough strength to kill Reinhardt and his men.  Seeking revenge, Nomak tracks Damaskinos to his private heliport and kills him. He then bites Nyssa, infecting her with the virus while drinking her blood. Blade confronts Nomak, and after a ferocious battle, defeats him. With his now-broken sword, Blade stabs it through the side of Nomak's chest and into his bone-protected heart, slipping it through the bone plates on the side. Nomak then commits suicide to end his suffering by shoving the sword all the way into his wounded heart. Fulfilling Nyssa's dying wish, Blade takes her outside, where she dies while watching the sun rise before she can fully change. The movie ends with Blade in [[London]], where he kills Rush, a vampire he encountered earlier in the movie.  
Blissfully Yours
 Min is an illegal [[Myanmar|Burmese]] immigrant living in [[Thailand]] who has contracted a mysterious [[rash]] that is painful and covers the upper part of his body. His girlfriend, Roong, and an older woman, Orn, take him to see a doctor. Min pretends that he cannot speak because he is not fluent in Thai and speaking would reveal him to be an illegal immigrant. The doctor treats him, but because he does not have proper ID documents, the doctor refuses to supply him with the medical papers necessary to get a work permit. Orn's prescribed medication is also mentioned, and it is unclear whether she is taking pain killers or anti-depressants.  Orn brings Min to her husband's work and instead of using the prescription she got for Min's rash, Orn prepares a homemade concoction, a mix of finely chopped vegetables and store-bought skin creams. Orn also mentions to her husband that she'd like to have another child. Her husband is sympathetic, but is afraid to try again because their first-born child died. While waiting in silence, Min is approached by a man who places his hand on Min's lap suggestively.  Roong works in a factory, painting ceramic figurines. She does not want to work after having worked overtime the day before. Min and Orn drive over to the factory, and Roong feigns an illness and takes off with Min.

They are suddenly interrupted when the motorcycle is stolen. The man chases after the thief and disappears, leaving Orn in anxious solitude. She ends up lost in the woods, and eventually stumbles upon the young lovers by the river while Roong is engaging in fellatio with Min.  Orn approaches the young couple after they finish.

Maddy ([[Debbie Rochon]]) is interviewed by Shawn and gets the job. That night, while Maddy is having dinner at her apartment, she appears to be talking to imaginary people and seemingly receives a letter from her parents, whom she previously claimed were dead, congratulating her on her new job. When she goes to sleep, she dreams of two deaths and awakens in fear.  Shawn and Maddy get closer, go on a date, and end up having sex. In the morning Shawn invites Maddy to a pool party, to which she agrees. At the pool party we are introduced to Keith ( Barry Bedwell ), Karen ( Anne Star ) and the host Tillie (Orly Tepper), Maddy arrives and meets Shawn's other friends Chris (Allen Nabours), Peter (Ronny Gene Blevins) and Laura (Laura Nativo). Later, the remaining people at the party start talking about a "murder club". In confusion, Maddy leaves, disturbed by Chris's words to her: "You never know when you'll need the club's help". Karen and Keith are then seen having hardcore bondage sex when the killer enters the bedroom and strangles them. In her sleep, Maddy has a flashback of when she had an abortion. As a result, her mother ([[Brinke Stevens]]) had kicked her out of the house, calling Maddy a "murderer". Her father ([[Lloyd Kaufman]]) had tried to stop her, to no avail.  During one of Maddy's shopping trips, she starts a heated argument with a woman, eventually killing her by smashing her head against a large post. Maddy then awakes at home, covered in blood. She realizes what she has done and calls Shawn. He races over and tells her not to worry, as he'll give her an alibi. The next day, on her way to Tillie's house, Maddy hears Shawn, Tillie, Peter and Laura talking amongst each other. She then discovers that the "Murder Club" was all a joke. Shawn tries to convince the others to give Maddy an alibi. Chris agrees, and Peter and Laura want to ignore everything, though Tillie believes they should head to the police. Maddy heads home, upset by the revelation. She later has a dream of Peter and Laura being killed.  She visits Tillie's home again but hides to avoid being seen. Tillie talks to Shawn about finding Peter and Laura's bodies. Maddy then blacks out and has a vision of Tillie's death. When she awakes, she goes to Tillie's home and finds her dead. She goes to Chris's home, believing Shawn to be responsible for the deaths. Then she races over to Laura and Peter's home. There, she finds the dead bodies and tells Chris that she believes Shawn is behind the deaths. She heads back home and Shawn arrives. She attempts to attack him but he retaliates and tells Maddy that Chris is the real murderer. He shows a mask and knife, saying he found them in Chris's home. Just then, Chris kills him by impaling him with an axe. A shocked Maddy demands an explanation. Chris admits to the murders, saying that he did so he could have Maddy. The first death was the owner of the company. Killing him made Shawn head and gave Maddy a place to work. He then killed the various people who wanted to stop Maddy from being with him.  A small chase begins, with Maddy stuck in the bathroom of her home. Chris starts to chop down the door with his axe, but before he can reach Maddy, she hits him with a set of scales and flees. She then becomes trapped in the bedroom and the scene cuts to black. The next scene shows Chris heading to Las Vegas. He pulls over to a car stuck on the side of the road.  The man inside asks for a tire-iron. Chris considers killing him, until he sees that the man has a wife. After helping them and watching the couple head off, Chris heads back to the trunk.

Then she's shows her baby to them, who is possessed by Satan. The next person is a man who says kids have been disappearing in the woods, comparing the disappearances to the magic acts of David Copperfield. The next person they interview is an unhelpful pirate.  Then they move on to interviewing the famous one-eyed thumb, who says "ee-hoo!"  The next person they interviews is a local fisherman that says part of the Legend of the Blair Thumb:  "There are these twins, the Briarly twins, I think they're twins. 'Twins should look alike.' They went into the woods, been there hundreds of times, but this time they got lost. Couldn't find their way. Then they saw this woman...she was up in the air, floatin'. She took their heads, switched them, like it was a sick game. Then she took their bodies, she switched them too. They came out looking zacly' the same, but we all knew, they've been all switched up."  With enough information to go into the woods, Jish makes a pit stop to get some food.  A gigantic marshmallow in his case.  Now in the woods, Vic and Jish are shown taking a piss.  Stressy cries, "What are you doing?"  Vic says, "You told us to." Stressy replies, "No, I didn't, I said "kiss" before the first shot we kiss the slate!"  Jish starts laughing.  Vic replies, "Sorry, ok?  I heard you wrong.  Kiss, what's the difference?"  Vic looks at the slate covered in piss. Stressy makes a video about a graveyard, wondering how the bodies got under the grave stones and what "freakish creature" carved and engraved them. They finally arrive at the woods.  After walking a little ways, Vic and Jish start freaking out because Stressy doesn't have a real map.  After calming them down, Stressy moves onward.  Once they are at Hangnail Rock, Stressy tells the next part of the Legend of the Blair Thumb:  "The search party went into the woods, in search of the five lost victims.  Upon reaching Hangnail Rock, the torture inflicted on these brave men unfolded.  Each was bound to each other, positioned one behind the next.  Each man's hand was in the next man's pants.  The men promptly turned and asked the search party to leave, and mind their own business.  Hours later the men were found, decapitated, and very tired.  The search party left to find a sheriff, but upon return the bodies were gone.  All that was found, was a Streisand CD, and a mini-disk single of "It's Rainin' Men."  That night, the three hear weird noises, and they are chased by a shark. The shark tries to bite off Stressy's arm, and then moves over and attacks Vic. The next day, while they are walking, Jish notices that he has a weird substance on his stuff. Vic claims that Jish has been singled out and that he's glad it's not him. Further on, chaos ensues when it becomes apparent that Stressy has lost her fake map.  Soon, they begin to think that they're going in circles.  Then they discover that someone took Stressy's car. Soon after, they see the Blair Thumb's symbol made from a giant stick.  Everything instantly becomes dark.  That night, in the tent, Jish plays a prank on Stressy and Vic by shaking a bush. He explains that there were sticks in the trees, some kids ripped off their car went for a joy ride and says there is no Blair Thumb. However, after this he is kidnapped by something and Vic and Stressy chase after him. In the dark Vic and Stressy stand still and quiet hoping not to get kidnapped and Vic feels up Stressy.  The next day, Stressy and Vic find Jish's body.  He has been cut in half; only his legs and groin area remain.  That night, Stressy makes a video notice of her. Crying she says she's scared and apologizes to Vic's mom because he's scared, freaked out, and to Jish's mom, because he's "dismembered and everything". She says she loves her parents and Ricky Martin and says she's scared to close and open her eyes, squint and cross them. Then, Stressy and Vic hear Jish's voice and head after it.  They pass by a sign that says "Dead House --->" without a second thought.  They enter the house and Jish's voice says he's upstairs, so they head upstairs.  Once they're upstairs, Jish's voice says he's downstairs.  The two get separated on the way down. As Vic says something he gargles like something had killed him. Stressy screams and heads down the stairs still screaming.  Then, Vic says, "Jeez, can't a guy even take a leak?"  Frankenthumb then appears, and the two mistake him for the Blair Thumb.  They ask if they can go, and he replies, "No, I kill.  We party first?"  They agree and a disco ball comes down.  They dance.  Jish's torso shows up, then the credits begin.

Blue Crush
 Anne Marie ([[Kate Bosworth]]), Eden ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]) and Lena ([[Sanoe Lake]]) are best friends. They raised Anne Marie's 14-year-old sister, Penny ([[Mika Boorem]]), ever since their mother took off to Las Vegas with a boyfriend who was uncomfortable with the idea of having the two girls come along. While Penny is at school, Anne Marie, Eden and Lena work as maids at a large resort hotel, but more importantly, they are surfers. Anne Marie rises every morning before dawn to train for her surfing comeback, and was once considered a rising star in women's surfing and competed as a youth, but an extreme wipeout and near-drowning incident temporarily halted her career, and left her with deep-seated fears. Her friends, especially Eden, have encouraged her to try it again.  Anne Marie has been invited to join in an upcoming surf competition at the famed [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] surf spot, [[Banzai Pipeline|Pipeline]]. She hopes to gain the attention of sponsors and get herself and her friends out of the near-poverty they are living in. As the Pipeline competition gets closer, she struggles to keep Penny under control and deal with her own personal issues.  At work, Anne Marie meets and catches the eye of Matt Tollman ([[Matthew Davis]]), a [[National Football League]] [[quarterback]] in Hawaii for the [[Pro Bowl]] (it is hinted that he plays for the [[Minnesota Vikings]]). Matt is there with several of his rowdy teammates and instantly becomes attracted to the surfer. Through a series of "chance" encounters, she agrees to teach him how to surf for $150 per hour, and brings Lena, Eden and Penny along for the ride. When she goes to Matt's hotel room to get the money, they kiss as a call comes and Anne suspects that it is his wife but he promises it is his niece. Later they sleep together. Her acceptance of a non-local begins to cause friction between her and many of the young men in her surfing social circle. Anne Marie faces more problems when she and Eden argue about Anne Marie's lack of dedication to training for the Pipeline contest due to the sudden appearance of Matt. She also has to hear demeaning comments from several of the other football players' wives and girlfriends staying at the hotel about how she is undergoing the "Matt Tollman makeover" while attending a [[luau]] at the resort.  Anne Marie confronts Matt about their situation and soon resolves to step up her game, as she finally commits herself to the Pipeline Masters. On the day of Pipeline, Anne Marie wipes out during her first heat, but advances to the next heat after narrowly beating pro surfer Kate Skarratt. She is shaken, but Matt tells her a story about his first game as an NFL quarterback and helps her regain her wavering confidence. Determined, but still afraid, Anne Marie returns to the water. Competing in the same heat is [[Keala Kennelly]], one of the first professional female surfers, playing herself. While Keala surfs the first few sets of waves without wipe-outs, Anne Marie still has inhibitions about riding one, visions of another near-drowning incident holding her back. Keala finishes her turn, then paddles out and takes Anne Marie under her wing and encourages her to take the best wave of the day, on which Anne Marie manages to score perfectly. Although she does not advance to the next heat, she has regained her lost confidence, but also attracted the notice of sponsors, one of which includes an offer to join the [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]] women's surf team.

 In a month with [[Blue moon|two full moons]], [[Austria]]n petty criminal Johnny Pichler is hired to carry a bag of cash to the [[Slovakia]]n border and deliver it to a gangster. Johnny arrives late in a battered taxi. He is forced into the car behind the gangster's beautiful but unhappy escort. Shirley, who is no bimbo, squirts the gangster with an incapacitating spray, kicks him out of the car and races away with Johnny and the cash. The pair makes a series of unsuccessful attempts to sell the obviously stolen car. In a Slovak hotel Johnny offers to buy Shirley's share of the car with his share of the cash. She refuses but when he returns from the bar, she is gone.  Lonely Johnny teams up with Ignaz Springer, an [[East Germany|East German]] con man who is having trouble adapting to post-Communist Europe, but claims to have business interests in [[Ukraine]]: shoe import-export. Springer introduces Johnny to a couple of Slovak waitresses and then disappears after selling the car without Johnny's knowledge. Johnny hitchhikes to [[Ukraine]] looking for Shirley with only the town [[Lviv]] stamped on a strip of photographs as a guide. In Lviv he meets a taxi driver who differs from Shirley only in her hair colour. Jana reveals that she is Shirley's twin sister and they soon become lovers. Jana tells him that Shirley's real name is Dana and that she had left Lviv some months ago after a bout of craziness. Johnny soon discovers that Jana is not being entirely honest with him. And the city is hardly welcoming: a gang force him to buy an ordinary brick from them with all the money that he has. He follows Jana to [[Kiev]] and finally to [[Odessa]] on the [[Black Sea]], where he is also reunited with Springer. The movie ends on a ferry as the blue moon rises and the final scene explains the enigmatic opening scene on the Odessa Steps (made famous by ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'').  Dusl sees the love that develops between Johnny and Jana as a metaphor for the relationship between the east and the west. More inspiration for the film may have come from a transatlantic romantic entanglement with an American whom she visited before going into production.<ref name="Chiari">[http://www.cineuropa.org/interview.aspx?lang=en&documentID=9345 Chiari, Valeria.

Bollywood/Hollywood
 ''Bollywood/Hollywood'' centres on the character of Rahul Seth, a young, rich, Indo-Canadian living in Toronto whose widowed mother is eager to get him married after the freak-accidental death of his white pop singer girlfriend, Kimberly. Rahul's mother disapproved of her son's relationship with a non-Indian woman. Furthermore, the mother proclaims that the impending wedding of her daughter Twinky and Bobby will not take place until Rahul has found himself an Indian bride first. The pressure mounts on Rahul as he finds out that Twinky must get married to preserve the family's reputation because she is pregnant.  Rahul goes to a bar and there meets Sue. Thinking she is a Spanish escort (non-sexual companion), he hires her to pose as his fiancÃ©e because she looks Indian. Rahul eventually discovers that Sue is actually Indian (her name is short for Sunita). Despite his initial anger at her lie, the two grow closerâdue in no small part to a confidence boost Sue gave to Rahul's tormented younger brother, Govind, who incorrectly believes that no one cares about his welfare. Rahul and Sue eventually consider one another a fit match. Pleased, Mrs. Seth agrees to sanction Twinky's wedding.  Rahul and Sue grow more intimate, sharing stories about their pasts. It is revealed that Sue was once offered as a bride to the well-meaning but dim-witted professional wrestler Killer Khalsa; offended that her parents would even consider such a match, she has been playing mischief in revenge. This mischief is not fully explained, but her liking for it is suggested by her audacity. Sue is quite immune to social norms; she speaks bluntly to all, particularly to Rocky, Rahul's driver, who she knows (but does not reveal to others) is a famous drag queen.  The blossoming romance is shaken, when a drunken friend at Bobby's bachelor party states that Sue is a prostitute, and that he himself has paid her for sex in the past. Rahul is uncertain, causing Sue to be so hurt that he would question her honesty and integrity that she leaves him. He is forced to confess to his family that he never really courted Sue but merely bribed her to act the part of his fiancÃ©e. His mother is forced to postpone Twinky's wedding until Rahul can find a new bride, becoming despondent that Twinky's pregnancy will make the family social outcasts, for which Rahul calls her out for being a hypocrite. Twinky enters the room and tells her mother to stop crying, as Twinky and Bobby have eloped. Twinky thanks Rahul for doing so much to help her.  Prodded by Rocky ("Sue ma'am is special. Anyone who can keep a secret deserves the best"), by his insightful, Shakespeare-quoting grandmother and by the ghosts of his father and Kimberly, Rahul goes after Sue. In a balcony scene facilitated by Sue's father and mother, Rahul professes his true love to Sue, who abruptly leaves him standing outside her balcony. Rahul initially leaves in his limo, then tells Rocky to return to Sue's house, only to find that Sue has replaced Rocky in the driver's seat.  All parties, including ghosts and the film's crew, join in the closing-credits dance.

 In the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italian fishermen rescue an unconscious American ([[Matt Damon]]) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, and when the man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative [[amnesia]]. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a [[safe deposit box]] in [[ZÃ¼rich]]. Upon landing in [[Imperia|Imperia, Italy]], the American heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. He finds it contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use the name on the American passport, [[Jason Bourne]].  After Bourne's departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[black operation|black ops]] program. Treadstone's head, Alexander Conklin ([[Chris Cooper]]), activates three agents to take down BourneâCastel (Nicky Naude), Manheim (Russell Levy), and the Professor ([[Clive Owen]])âwhile also issuing alerts to local police to capture him.  Meanwhile, CIA [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Ward Abbott ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]). Conklin promises Abbott that he will deal with the Treadstone agent who failed.  Bourne attempts to evade the Swiss police by using his U.S. passport to enter the American [[Consul (representative)#Consulates and embassies|consulate]], but he is caught by guards. He evades capture, and escapes the consulate, giving a German woman, Marie Kreutz ([[Franka Potente]]), $20,000 to drive him to an address in [[Paris]] listed on his French driving license. At the address, an apartment, he hits redial on the phone and reaches a hotel. He inquires about the names on his passports there, learning that a "John Michael Kane" had been registered but died two weeks prior in a car crash. Castel ambushes Bourne and Marie in the apartment, but Bourne gets the upper hand. Instead of allowing himself to be interrogated, Castel throws himself out of a window to his death. Marie finds wanted posters of Bourne and herself, and after agonizing, agrees to continue to help Bourne.  After a chase in which Bourne evades Paris police in Marie's car, the two fugitives spend the night together in a Paris hotel.  Meanwhile, Wombosi continues to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted a body in the Paris morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes that he was the assailant. He and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of her old friend Eamon ([[Tim Dutton]]) and his children. Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor there, but Bourne shoots him twice with Eamon's [[shotgun]], mortally wounding him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone. Conklin agrees to meet Bourne, alone, in Paris. From a rooftop near the arranged location Bourne sees Conklin has not come alone, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's [[safe house]] in Paris.  Bourne breaks in and holds Conklin and logistics technician Nicolette "Nicky" Parsons ([[Julia Stiles]]) at gunpoint. When Conklin begins pressing him to remember his past, Bourne recalls his attempt to assassinate Wombosi through successive [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s. As Kane, and working under orders from Treadstone, Bourne infiltrated Wombosi's yacht but could not bring himself to kill Wombosi while Wombosi's children were present, and instead fled, being shot during his escape. Bourne announces he is resigning from Treadstone and is not to be followed. As agents descend on the safe house, Bourne fights his way free. When Conklin leaves the safe house, he encounters Manheim, who kills him under Abbott's orders. Abbott then shuts down Treadstone.  Abbott reports to an oversight committee that Treadstone is "all but decommissioned" before discussion turns to a new project codenamed "[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|Blackbriar]]". In the final scene, Bourne finds Marie renting out [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]s to tourists on [[Mykonos]], and the two reunite.

He decides to quit his job and start his own record company, focusing on bringing back the real hip hop that his generation fell in love with. Reese, however, is not understanding and thus not supportive of this venture. Additionally, as Sidney draws closer to Dre due to their partnership in the label, jealousy develops over Dre and Sidney's friendship.  Sidney, who also has begun to live her life with a budding relationship with Kelby ([[Boris Kodjoe]]) receives a proposal from her boyfriend which she accepts. Turmoil ensues when Dre finds out Reese has been having secret liaisons with a man from the gym (who texts Reese to confirm a rendezvous). Dre brings Sid to bust her in the act. This leads to a night of shared passion between Dre and Sid and opens Sid's eyes to the fact she is not prepared to get married to Kelby. She calls off the engagement and while searching for Dre sees Reese and Dre in a parting embrace that she misconstrues as more.  While at [[WQHT|Hot 97]] waiting for Cavi's first single to play on the Angie Martinez show, Dre hears Sid talking about her new book ''I Used to Love H.I.M.'' Though based on her love affair with hip-hop, it really is a chronicled timeline of her love affair with Dre. He recognizes this and rushes over to the station to confront his feelings, as well. Meanwhile, in the production booth, Sid's cousin Francine finally asks Cavi out on a date, which is something he has been trying for since their first meeting.  The film ends with Cavi's song playing in the same park where their love of hip-hop began.  
The Brady Bunch in the White House
 The film begins with Bobby finding a winning lottery ticket but Mike insists that it be returned to the rightful owner. Mike then invites people to the house to prove they are the owner but none are able to answer correctly what the original wrote on the back of the ticket. A local newscaster hears the story and Mike agrees to an interview in hopes of finding the original owner.  As a montage of multiple stations discussing the Brady story, the original owner is being sentenced to execution on death row and is unable to claim his winnings. Since he is not able to find the original owner, Mike decides to donate the money to charity, which attracts the attention of the president of the United States, President Randolph.  President Randolph then invites him to a press conference where the president is asked about his dealings with an oil drilling company that has been abusing the environment. President Randolph insists that he has never had any dealing with the company and swears to resign if he is disproven. The press then asks who will be his running mate and Carol suggests Mike. President Randolph agrees to pick Mike as his running mate and they are shown to win the election. However, just before the president and Mike are to be sworn in, evidence reveals that President Randolph has made dealings with the oil company and is thus forced to resign which makes Mike the new president.  Mike then needs to select a new vice president, and he picks Carol. He asks Congress for permission to appoint her and initially, the speaker of the house, Sal Astor, is skeptical of Carol's abilities but she wins Congress over with a song and dance number. Mike settles in nicely as president and pushes to make the country even greater without playing into petty politics. Meanwhile, Veronica Dotwebb grumbles to Astor that he should be president and the two plot to overthrow Mike and Carol by ruining their image. Greg develops a crush on Veronica and she exploits him to divulge any useful information on his family. The Bradys are good and innocent but Veronica manages to spin their most innocent moments into huge scandals. She claims Mike is still involved with a woman from his past; Carol is accused of being a radical hippie when she protests the destruction of a park; Marcia is called promiscuous because she wrote about a fictional erotic encounter with [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] in her diary; Greg accused of underage smoking because a cigarette container was found in his coat; Peter accused of bribery for getting a better grade after he compliments his teacher; Jan accused of cheating for getting a better grade on an essay; and Alice accused of drugging the food so the Bradys stay happy all the time. Although this plan garners significant news coverage, it is not enough to impeach the Bradys. Veronica and Sal devise a second plan to trick Mike Brady into informing the public that a world-ending asteroid is about to hit Earth. They succeed by switching a report from [[NASA]] regarding data from a space probe with Peter's science project.  Mike address the public telling them he received a report from NASA that confirms a massive meteor is on a course and will cause global devastation. The Bradys are then transported to a secret bunker underneath the White House that will protect them from the ensuing danger. Sal Astor then seizes the opportunity to take power by calling an official press conference as acting president and mocks Mike Brady for falling for the hoax. Embarrassed, the public demands Mike's impeachment but Cindy overhears Sal and Veronica plotting and she informs the family so they can stop them. The Bradys break out of the bunker and interrupt the press conference to tell the truth. Mike then address the public saying they deserve to know the truth, and goes on to start telling the story of the lottery ticket and how he got to be president.

Bubba Ho-Tep
 An elderly man ([[Bruce Campbell]]) at The Shady Rest Retirement Home in [[East Texas]] is known to the staff as Sebastian Haff, but claims to be the real [[Elvis Presley]]. He explains that during the 1970s, he grew tired of the demands of his fame and switched places with an [[Elvis impersonator]] named Sebastian Haff (also Campbell). He claims it was Haff who eventually died in 1977, while he, the real Elvis, lived in quiet, happy anonymity and made a living pretending to be himself. After a propane explosion destroyed documentation which was the only proof that he was actually Elvis, he was unable to return to his old lifestyle.  A hip injury during a performance causes him to get an infection and slip into a coma. Twenty years later and living at the retirement home as the film opens, he is contemplating his age, frailty, loss of dignity, impotence, and "A growth on [his] pecker". Elvis's only friend is a black man named Jack ([[Ossie Davis]]) who insists he is President [[John F. Kennedy]], claiming to have been dyed black after an [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] attempt, and abandoned by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] in a nursing home. Initially skeptical of Jack's story, Elvis does spot a mysterious scar on the back of Jack's head. It could be from the head wound seen in the [[Zapruder film]], but then it might not be.  Eventually, Elvis and Jack face off against a re-animated [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[mummy]] that was stolen during a U.S. museum tour, and then lost during a severe storm in East Texas when the thieves' bus veered into a river near the nursing home. The mummy strangely takes on the garb of a cowboy and feeds on the souls of the residents of the home. It is dubbed 'Bubba Ho-Tep' by Elvis, who is given a [[telepathic]] flashback of the mummy's life and death when he looks into its eyes. The slow, plodding mummy is a real and credible threat, as instead of going against young adults who could potentially outrun or overpower it, the mummy gives chase to the elderly. Jack and Elvis lack mobility and need a [[Wheelchair#Power Chairs|motorized wheelchair]] and a walker to get around the grounds.  Elvis and Jack create an elaborate plan to destroy the mummy. Destruction of the mummy would release the trapped souls of their dead friends, and they would be able to go to their final resting place. Elvis and Jack battle the mummy in the middle of the night, with Jack in an electric wheelchair and Elvis wielding a makeshift flamethrower. Jack is knocked out of his wheelchair by the mummy and is about to have his soul sucked. Elvis hops in the wheelchair, zooms into the mummy to save Jack, and damages the flamethrower, getting a large gash in his abdomen in the process. Jack dies from a heart attack. Elvis becomes committed to getting rid of the mummy, and he throws the gasoline on him and then throws matches at him, killing the mummy.  Elvis lies on a hill near the river bank, dying from the blood loss from the gash and broken ribs. He talks in his mind about how he doesn't fear death, knowing that he still had his soul and that he saved all of the fellow people at the Shady Rest Retirement Home. As he reflects upon this, the stars align into a message for Elvis, saying: "all is well". With a dying "Thank you, thank you very much", Elvis passes away.

Jeff, who has been hiding out and drinking in the woods, returns to the cabin the next day.

As he raises his arms in victory, Winston shoots him and burns his body with the others.

The Cat Returns
 The story is of a girl named Haru Yoshioka, a quiet and shy high school student who has a suppressed ability to talk with cats. One day, she saves a black cat from being hit by a truck on a busy road. The cat's name is Lune, Prince of the Cat Kingdom. As a thanks, the cats give Haru gifts of catnip and mice, and she is offered the Prince's hand in marriage. Her mixed reply is taken as a yes.  Wanting none of this, Haru hears a kind, female voice, which tells her to seek Muta, a large white cat and to seek directions for the cat business office from him. Muta leads her there to meet Baron (the same Baron from ''[[Whisper of the Heart (film)|Whisper of the Heart]]''), who is a cat figurine given life by the work of his artist, and Toto, a stone raven who comes to life much like the Baron. Soon after meeting them, Haru and Muta are forcefully taken to the Cat Kingdom, leaving Toto and the Baron in the human world to follow the group from the air. The Baron and his crow friend find the entrance to the Cat Kingdom on Earth: Five lakes forming a cat's paw.  Haru is treated to a feast at the castle of the Cat Kingdom and she begins to slowly turn into a cat with tan paws, ears and whiskers, though still mainly human, so that she will make a suitable bride for the Prince. At the feast, the Baron (in disguise) dances with Haru as part of the entertainment, and reveals to her that the more she loses herself in the kingdom, the more cat-like she will become, and that she has to discover her true self. When the Baron is discovered and is forced to fight the guards, he and Haru are helped by Yuki, a white female cat who works as a servant in the palace and who had tried to warn Haru to leave the Cat Kingdom before she was taken to the castle. After Yuki shows them an escape tunnel, Haru, the Baron, and Muta move through a maze to a tower, which contains a portal to Haru's world. The King goes through a series of efforts to keep them in the Cat Kingdom long enough for Haru to remain trapped in the form of a cat and have her as his daughter-in-law.  Lune and his guards return to the Cat Kingdom to reveal the King was not acting on his behalf and that he has no desire to marry Haru; he has instead planned on proposing to Yuki. Muta is revealed to be a notorious criminal in the Kingdom (having devoured a whole lake of fish in one session), and Yuki as being the strange voice who had advised Haru to go to the Cat Bureau. In her childhood, Haru had saved Yuki from starvation by giving her the [[fish crackers]] she was eating, and Yuki has now repaid her kindness. Muta, or as he is known as the infamous criminal Renaldo Moon, tells Haru "I respect a woman who stands up for herself" after she rejects the King's marriage proposal outrightly and proceeds to help her escape from the King's soldiers.  Eventually Baron, Haru and Muta escape the realm of cats, with the aid of Prince Lune and Toto, and Haru discovers her true self and tells the Baron how she has come to like him. He tells her, "Just for the record, I admire a young woman who speaks from the heart," and that when she needs them, the doors of the Cat Bureau will be open for her again. Haru returns to the human world with more confidence in herself; after learning from her friend that her former crush has broken up with his girlfriend, she simply replies "it doesn't matter anymore."

Chance is annoyed when Rory, a struggling actor with whom Chance had a one-night stand, appears at her door and becomes emotional trying to convince her that they have a connection beyond just sex because they really talked afterward. Chance and Simon spin a story about meeting in a mental institution, which makes Rory uncomfortable enough to stop crying and to leave.  Simon tricks Chance into answering a phone call from her mother by telling her that it's a man named Jack whom she was immediately attracted to when she met at a nightclub. Her mother, Desiree, is calling to tell her that she is coming to visit. Trying to escape spending time with her mother, Chance persuades Simon to switch roles with her for the weekend and Simon spends time with Desiree pretending to be Chance until Desiree tells Simon that she needs to talk to Chance about something in particular. Desiree tells Chance that she is divorcing Chance's father, Malcolm, because he is in a relationship with another woman named Heidi.  Upset, Chance tells Simon about her parents' divorce and reveals that Desiree wants to stay with them for a while. Chance is suspicious when Simon tries to offer some comfort, and he begs again for $200 to pay off some unpaid parking tickets. Though hesitant to loan anyone money because of a bad experience with her first serious boyfriend, Chance agrees to give him the money for playing along with her charade for her mother.  Uncomfortable with the idea of her mother living with her, Chance arranges for Desiree and her to have dinner with Malcolm and Heidi.

Chance brings Sara home with her, and after spending a day in bed together, Sara suggests that they take some drugs. Chance refuses and takes the drugs away.

Afterward, the two quickly begin to fight about the significance of the sex and Simon leaves the apartment.  The next morning Chance awakes to find Sara, alive, sitting at the kitchen table. Sara tells her that she wasn't dead, just "resting." She thanks Chance for the place to sleep and then leaves. Chance then realizes that Simon never came home.  Simon has run into Jack, who recognizes him from the nightclub. The two make small talk until Simon realizes that Jack is hitting on him. Simon begins laughing and at Jack's confusion tells him that Chance has a huge crush on him and thinks that he is straight. Simon then tells Jack about what had happened the night before and about his frustration and attraction to Chance. Jack tells Simon that, even though he is gay, he sometimes has sex with women because he needs the contact with human beings, and Simon realizes that he needs that human contact too. Simon returns to Chance's apartment, and Chance is happy to see him, greeting him with a hug. They apologize for their actions and both admit that they are ready to try a relationship.

On the same morning that Gipson drives to a hearing to try to regain custody of his children, a successful, European-American, young [[Wall Street]] [[Lawyer|attorney]], Gavin Banek, is distracted while driving and collides his new [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class|Mercedes CLK320]] with Gipson's older [[Toyota Corolla]]. Banek was in a rush to get to court to file a [[power of appointment]] document, which will prove a dead man signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. Gipson was also in a rush to get to a hearing to argue for joint custody of his sons with his estranged wife. Banek tries to brush Gipson off with a [[blank check]], rather than exchanging insurance information, thereby disobeying the law. Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to "do this right", but Banek, whose car is still drivable, insists upon leaving immediately.  He leaves Gipson stranded, telling him, "better luck next time". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that the judge ruled against him in his absence, giving sole custody of the boys to Gipson's wife and allowing her to proceed with a plan to move to Oregon, never knowing that Gipson was about to buy a house locally and give it to his wife and children as part of his effort to make joint custody workable for everyone.  When Banek gets to court, he realizes that he dropped the crucial power of appointment file at the scene of the accident, and the judge gives him until the end of the day to retrieve it. Gipson, who scooped up the file, is torn, and initially refuses to return the file. Banek, who is desperate to get his papers back, goes to a "fixer", a shady computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], and gets him to switch off Gipson's credit, which destroy's Gipson's chance for a home loan to keep his family together. Gipson is distraught when he finds out his credit has been ruined and he comes close to drinking again. Determined to get back at Banek, Gipson removes several bolts from one of Banek's wheels, and Banek suffers some minor injuries after his car crashes on the highway. Enraged, Banek goes to the elementary school of Gipson's children and tells school officials that Gipson plans to kidnap the boys, so Gipson is arrested and jailed.  His enraged wife declares her intention to move forward with taking their sons to Oregon and says that Gipson will never see them again.  Both men, shaken by the consequences of their actions, start to reconsider their desire for vengeance and try to find a way out. Although it appears unlikely that either man will achieve what he had hoped, both resolve to let go and do what is right, and the two men apologize to each other. Gipson returns the file containing the power of attorney, which Banek has since learned was obtained illegally, and he uses it to blackmail his boss to conduct business honestly and get approval to represent Gipson pro bono to resolve his legal troubles. Banek also visits Gipson's wife to explain everything. The film ends with Gipson's wife and children smiling at him from across the street.

Chicago (2002 film)
 In 1924, [[Roxie Hart]] sees star Velma Kelly perform ("Overture/All That Jazz") at a Chicago theater. Wanting stardom for herself, she begins an affair with Fred Casely, who claims to know the manager. After the show, Velma is arrested for killing her husband Charlie and sister Veronica, who were in bed together.  A month later, Casely admits to Roxie that he has no showbiz connections and just wanted her body. Enraged, she shoots him dead. She convinces her husband, Amos, to take the blame, telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. As Amos confesses to the detective, Roxie fantasizes that she is singing a song devoted to her husband ("Funny Honey"). However, when the detective brings up evidence that Roxie and Casely were having an affair, Amos recants; Roxie furiously admits what really happened and is arrested. Ambitious District Attorney Harrison announces he will seek the death penalty.  At [[Cook County Jail]], Roxie is sent to Murderess' Row, under the care of the corrupt Matron "Mama" Morton ("When You're Good to Mama"). Roxie meets her idol Velma, but her friendship is rudely rebuffed. She learns the backstories of the other women there, including Velma ("Cell Block Tango"). On Morton's advice, Roxie engages Velma's lawyer, the brilliant Billy Flynn ("All I Care About"). Flynn and Roxie manipulate the press, reinventing Roxie's identity as an originally virtuous woman turned bad by the fast life of the city; she claims she had the affair with Casely because Amos was always working, but repented and dumped him for Amos, and Casely jealously attacked her ("We Both Reached for the Gun"). The press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, Roxie becomes an overnight sensation ("Roxie"). Velma, unhappy at losing the public's attention, tries to convince Roxie to join her act, replacing the sister that she murdered ("I Can't Do It Alone"), but Roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her just as Velma originally did.  Meanwhile, Kitty Baxter, a wealthy heiress, is arrested for murdering her husband and his two lovers, and the press and Flynn pay more attention to her. To Velma's surprise, Roxie quickly steals back the fame by claiming to be pregnant. Amos is ignored by the press ("Mister Cellophane"), and Flynn, to create more sympathy for Roxie, convinces him that the child is Casely's, and that he should divorce Roxie in the middle of her predicament. Roxie over-confidently fires Flynn, believing she can now win on her own. However, when Katalin Helinszki, a Hungarian woman from Murderess' Row, becomes the first woman in Cook County history to be executed by hanging, Roxie realizes the gravity of the situation and rehires Flynn.  Roxie's trial begins, and Billy turns it into a media spectacle ("Razzle Dazzle") with the help of the sensationalist newspaper reporters and radio personality Mary Sunshine. Billy discredits witnesses, manipulates evidence, and even stages a public reconciliation between Amos and Roxie when she says the child is his. The trial seems to be going Roxie's way until Velma appears with Roxie's diary: she reads incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. Billy discredits the diary, implying that Harrison was the one who planted the evidence ("A Tap Dance"). Roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer just outside the courthouse. Flynn tells her to accept it, and admits that he tampered with her diary himself, in order to incriminate the district attorney and also free two clients at once. Amos remains loyal and excited to be a father, but Roxie cruelly rejects him, revealing that she is not pregnant, and he finally leaves her.  Roxie does become a vaudeville performer, but is very unsuccessful ("Nowadays"). Velma is just as unsuccessful, and again approaches Roxie to suggest performing together: a double act consisting of two murderers. Roxie initially refuses, but later accepts when Velma points out that they can perform together despite their resentment for each other. The two stage a spectacular performance that earns them the love of the audience and the press ("Nowadays / Hot Honey Rag"). The film concludes with Roxie and Velma receiving a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience, and proclaiming that, "We couldn't have done it without you".

She is later put in charge of the palace banquets and parties while the King and Prince Charming are away. A sharp and snobbish woman named Prudence, introduces Cinderella to her assigned [[Lady in waiting|ladies in waiting]]: Beatrice and Daphne. However, Cinderella is dissatisfied with the way the traditions are run, and ends up falling over when it becomes too much to handle. She goes into her room and the mice find her crying, after they comfort her, Cinderella realizes that she does not have to follow the usual traditions around the palace and decides to organize the upcoming party in her own way. Prudence is appalled by the changes and exclaims at one point "It simply isn't done!" (with Jaq making fun of her words and dancing around with Gus), Cinderella enters the village and hands out invitations to all the commoners, Prudence points out that the princess should be inviting dukes and aristocrats and Cinderella is intent on doing so in addition to inviting everyone in the village. Later, Prince Charming and his father arrive at the party. Although he seems to be shocked at seeing commoners, the King is satisfied with everything. While sitting on their thrones, Cinderella tells Prince Charming that someday she will get the "Princess thing" right and Charming replies with "I think that day is today". The two kiss, ending the segment.  The mice add that story to the book as Jaq gets some magical help from the Fairy Godmother opening a bottle of ink. Proclaiming that he does not like "that magic stuff," Gus reminds him of his last encounter with it. Looking to impress Mary, a mouse who he has feelings for, Jaq allows the Fairy Godmother to tell his story.  ===Tall Tail=== Jaq thinks he is too small to help Cinderella in the palace like he did in the [[Cinderella (1950 film)|first movie]]. The Fairy Godmother appears to help him out, and turns him into a human, six times taller than his height as a mouse so he can help out like everyone else. However, this does not stop Pom Pom, the palace's snobby cat (who became the mice's new nemesis as soon as they moved to the palace along with Cinderella), from chasing Jaq around. He is named "Sir Hugh", after coughing while trying to tell Cinderella that he is now human. After an incident with an elephant at a fair, he learns to be happy for who he is and is returned to his mouse form. Pom Pom makes a final attempt to eat Jaq but is picked up by a lady, who Jaq met as a human earlier, and had assumed Pom Pom to be his pet cat, she decides to find her "master" as Pom Pom tries to escape from her hold.  One of the mice uses the magic dust onto the art supplies, causing them to become animated. The supplies begin to almost destroy the nearly completed book until the Fairy Godmother puts a stop to it. As the mice survey the mess, they reminisce how they have seen worse and Jaq reminds them of the time Anastasia fell in love.  ===An Uncommon Romance=== Anastasia, one of Cinderella's stepsister, falls in love with a kind but common baker, which her mother Lady Tremaine and older sister Drizella disapprove of. Lady Tremaine tells her daughter to never speak to the baker as she forbids it. After a mishap in trying to get Anastasia and the Baker together again, Cinderella's mice friends (including Jaq and Gus) run into Lucifer and the minute he sees them; he starts chasing after them. Anastasia meets the baker again but the chase involving the mice and Lucifer, causes Anastasia to get kicked by a horse into the baker's shop. However, she is distraught by this and runs out of the baker's shop. A few villagers laugh at Anastasia upon seeing her covered in egg yokes and she retreats to a quiet area with a small fountain, Cinderella finds her and tries to convince her step sister to do what she wants and not continue to obey Lady Tremaine. Lucifer enters the palace while still chasing Cinderella's mice friends but stops once he spots Pom Pom and falls in love with her she sees him too but dislikes him. The mice decide to help their old nemesis. That is, if Lucifer promises to stop chasing mice. The next day, The baker buys a [[Flower Garland|flower garland]] to give to Anastasia who also buys one to give to him. As she heads near his shop, she sees him with another woman commenting on the garland. Anastasia assumes that the baker has left her for someone else and does not see the other lady's lover as she runs off in tears. When Lucifer and Pom Pom get together, Pom Pom goads Lucifer into breaking his promise and helping her catch the mice. In the ensuing chaos, a jug of water pours on Pom Pom and she leaves Lucifer. The baker goes after Anastasia but gives up and sits near a fountain (which is bigger than the one shown earlier), where Anastasia is. A goat appears and eats up most of his garland, reducing it to only a few flowers. The baker hears Anastasia crying and proves his love for her by placing one of the flowers from his garland into her hair, the moment between them is interrupted when Lady Tremaine and Drizella arrive. Cinderella; unknown to anyone else, arrives and secretly watches as Lady Tremaine berates Anastasia. She tries to pull Anastasia away from the baker again, but Anastasia finally stands up to her mother and declares that she and the baker are going to the ball together. Rather than argue with Anastasia's decision; Lady Tremaine makes her leave, shortly followed by Drizella. Later at the ball, Anastasia thanks Cinderella for helping her with Cinderella replying "Dreams do come true", the segment then ends.   The mice finish their book, and the Fairy Godmother asks if they are ready to show it to Cinderella. She is spotted out in the hallway and the mice follow after her with the book. They sing a reprise of "[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]", When they catch up with her (with some assistance by the Fairy Godmother), she asks them what it is, Gus telling her is a book about them all. Cinderella thinks it is wonderful and asks if the mice would like to read it together, to which the mice give a resounding "Yes!". The movie ends as they gather in front of the fire and Cinderella begins to read.

Chor Machaaye Shor
  Shyam (Bobby Deol) is a small thief who works as a security guard at a museum. He devises a plan with his three friends: Johnny (Rajpal Yadav), Titu (Ashish Vidyarthi) and Tony (Rajat Bedi) to steal a particular Nizam diamond. The foursome successfully manage to steal the diamond only for Shyam to double-cross Titu and Tony. Johnny and Shyam escape with the diamond. Johnny escapes but Shyam is apprehended, before which he hides the diamond in a air duct of a dilapidated building. Shyam is sentenced for 2 years in prison.  2 years have passed and a freshly released Shyam heads towards the dilapidated building which housed the diamond, but much to his amazement, a new police headquarters is built in place of the dilapidated building. Shyam decides to portray a fake police inspector Ram to enter the building to steal the diamond. He attracts the attention of ACP Ranvir Singh (Paresh Rawal) for his heroism and Inspector Pandey (Om Puri), an inspector who frequently suspects Ram of his true identity. Ram even manages to romance Inspector Ranjita (Bipasha Basu). In the midst of all this, Shyam tries his best to locate the diamond but is forced to enact as a cop to subdue criminals, such as Kalia Anthony (Razzak Khan) and his own friend Johnny. Before Johnny is arrested, Johnny calls Ram as Shyam which causes Pandey to become suspicious of Inspector Ram.  Ram later reveals that Shyam is actually his "twin" brother who is a rascal. Ranvir Singh makes it his job to reform Shyam, so Shyam is forced to balance both Inspector Ram and Shyam (who is employed as the driver of Ranvir) and he even manages to romance Ranvir's daughter Kajal (Shilpa Shetty). Shyam's other friend Guru (Shekhar Suman) is forced to enact as Shyam/Ram's mother as Pandey keeps on suspecting Shyam/Ram while Ranvir seems oblivious to what is happening. Meanwhile Titu and Tony come to know of Shyam's release and they come to know that the diamond is hidden somewhere inside the police headquarters. Posing as tea-boys, they threaten Shyam but Shyam retaliates and attacks causing them to retreat. Shyam and his other croonies devise a plan to convince Ranvir that doppelgangers (twins) exist, so they refer Ranvir as Raghu, who is a wanted drug smuggler.  Kajal, however, is the only one who finds out the real truth about Shyam/Ram. Then Ranvir finds out and gets enraged. Unaware, Tito and Tony find the actual doppelganger of Ranvir, Raghu Swami (also Paresh Rawal). And they threaten to make him pose as Ranvir so that it makes it easier to steal the diamond. Shyam finds out about this and thwarts Tito and Tony's plans. Shyam escapes with the diamond and ends up in a car retailer shop with both Tito and Tony following him. A fight ensues, however, the cops arrive to arrest Shyam, Tito and Tony. Johnny then appears and presuambly shoots Shyam which in turn Shyam shoots Johnny. Both presumably dies. Tito and Tony are arrested while the ever suspicious Pandey finds out that the gun was fake which meant that Johnny and Shyam did not really kill each other.  At the airport, Pandey and Ranvir bid farewell to Kajal who is going to London. Pandey and Ranvir are then confronted by three Sikhs, which is actually Guru, Shyam and Johnny is disguise (this also confirms that Johnny and Shyam are still alive). Pandey once again suspects them to be Shyam and refuses to believe that twins exist, but the tables turn when Pandey meets his own doppelganger, a Punjabi tourist, for a short while. The film ends with Shyam (disguised as a Sikh) who gifts Kajal a diamond ring which reveals that Kajal was going to get married to Shyam in London.  
City of God (2002 film)
  The film begins with a scene of chickens being prepared for a meal. A chicken escapes and an armed gang chases after it in a ''[[favela]]'' called the ''Cidade de Deus'' ("City of God"). The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (BuscapÃ©). A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s.  In the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the "Tender Trio" â Shaggy (Cabeleira), Clipper (Alicate), and Goose (Marreco) â rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's older brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as a lookout. Instead, after the Li'l Dice falsely warns the trio that the police are coming, he guns down the motel inhabitants. The massacre is brought to the police's attention, forcing the trio to split up: Clipper joins the church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the ''favela'', and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking the thieving boy's money while Li'l Dice's friend Benny (BenÃ©), who is Shaggy's brother, watches.  In the 1970s, the favela has been transformed into an urban jungle. Rocket has joined a group of young [[hippie]]s. He enjoys [[photography]] and likes one girl, Angelica, but his attempt to get close to her are ruined by a gang of petty criminal kids known as "The Runts". Li'l Dice now calls himself "Li'l ZÃ©" (''"ZÃ© Pequeno"''). With Benny, he has established a drug empire by eliminating all of the competition, except for a dealer named Carrot. Carrot is a good friend of Benny's and Benny convinces Lil ZÃ© not to go after him. Lil ZÃ© takes over 'the apartment', a known drug distribution center, and forces Carrot's manager Blackie (Neguinho) to work for him instead. Coincidently, Rocket is visiting the apartment to get some drugs off Blacky (who is an old classmate of Rocket's) during the apartment raid and is caught in the middle of it. Through narration, Rocket tells the viewer that he momentarily considers attempting to kill Lil ZÃ© to avenge his brother but decides against it. He is let go after Benny tells Lil ZÃ© that Rocket is Goose's brother.  Some time later, a relative peace comes over the City of God under the reign of Li'l ZÃ©, who manages to avoid police attention. Benny decides to branch out of the drug dealer crowd and convinces Tiago, Angelica's ex-boyfriend, to get him some new clothes. Tiago also introduces Benny to his (and Rocket's) group of friends, and Benny and Angelica begin dating.  Together, they decide to leave the City and the drug trade. During Benny's farewell party, ZÃ© and Benny get into an argument and Blackie accidentally kills Benny while trying to shoot Li'l ZÃ©. As Benny was the only man holding Lil ZÃ© back from taking over Carrot's business, his death leaves Lil ZÃ© unchecked, and Carrot kills Blackie for endangering his life. Following Benny's death, Lil ZÃ© and a group of his soldiers start to make their way to Carrot's hideout with the intention of killing him. On the way, Lil ZÃ© stops to hit on a girl who dismisses him. ZÃ© follows the girl and beats up her boyfriend, a peaceful man named Knockout Ned (Mane Galinha), and rapes her. After Ned's brother stabs Lil ZÃ©, his gang retaliates by killing his brother and uncle. Ned, looking for revenge, sides with Carrot, and a war breaks out between Carrot and Lil ZÃ©.  A year later in the early 1980s, the war continues and even the reason for the war is forgotten. Both sides enlist more "soldiers" and Lil ZÃ© specifically gives the Runts weapons. One day, Lil ZÃ© has Rocket take photos of him and his gang. After Rocket leaves his film with a friend who works at a newspaper office downtown, a female reporter publishes one of the prints, a major scoop since nobody is able to safely enter the City of God anymore. Rocket believes his life is endangered, as he thinks Lil ZÃ© will kill him for publishing the photo of him and his gang. The reporter takes Rocket in for the night, and he loses his virginity to her. Unbeknownst to him, Lil ZÃ© is excited about the picture being published, as he believes that now, people will finally know who he is.  Rocket agrees to continue taking photographs, not realizing that Lil ZÃ© is pleased with his increased notoriety. Rocket returns to the City for more photographs, which brings the film back to its opening scene. Confronted by the gang, Rocket is surprised that ZÃ© asks him to take pictures, but as he prepares to take the photo, the police arrive, then drive off when Carrot arrives. In the ensuing gunfight, Ned is killed by a boy who has infiltrated his gang to avenge his father, a civilian whom Ned has shot. The police capture Li'l ZÃ© and Carrot and plan to show Carrot off to the media. Since Lil ZÃ© has been bribing the police, they take Lil ZÃ©'s money and let him go, but Rocket secretly photographs the scene. Lil ZÃ© is immediately murdered by the Runts who intend to run the criminal enterprise themselves. The death is also out of revenge for the Runt that Lil ZÃ¨ had one of his initiates kill. Rocket photographs ZÃ©'s dead body and brings both pictures to the newspaper.  Rocket contemplates whether to publish the photo of the cops, exposing corruption and becoming famous, or the photo of Li'l ZÃ©'s body, which will get him an internship at the newspaper. He decides on the latter and the film ends with the Runts walking around the City of God, making a hit list of the dealers they plan to kill to take over the drug business, including the ''[[Comando Vermelho|Red Brigade]]'', as well as people they simply don't like.

Civil Brand
  Sabrina Downs ([[Da Brat]]) narrates an experience that she had while serving time as a convict in the Whitehead Correctional Institute. Her story begins as she meets Frances Shephard ([[LisaRaye McCoy]]), a timid woman that is new to the prison system, during their bus ride to the correctional facility. The women arrive at the prison, where they meet Captain Alan Dease ([[Clifton Powell]]), who proceeds to line them up and exclaim the rules of the prison and consequences for not abiding by them.  As Frances is escorted by an officer to the jail cell she will be living in, she enters to a scene of female convicts gambling, smoking, and talking amongst themselves. She attempts to move in with her cellmate Nikki Barnes ([[N'Bushe Wright]]), who is presumed to be the leader amongst the convicts, but is denied and instead lives with Lilâ Mama ([[Lark Voorhies]]), a 17-year-old pregnant convict who is deeply involved in Christianity and befriends Frances. Lilâ Mama introduces Frances to another inmate named Wet ([[Monica Calhoun]]), who informs her on the different crews in the prison. When asked what crime she committed, Frances confesses that she accidentally murdered her abusive husband in an effort to protect herself. The next day, Frances is familiarized with the inmatesâ daily routine of hard labor in what the other convicts refer to as a âsweatshop.â  Michael Meadows ([[Mos Def]]), a law student who is hired as the new correctional officer at Whitehead, enters Deaseâs office and introduces himself. They have a brief conversation before Dease is called to stop a fight that has occurred between Nikki and Aisha ([[Tichina Arnold]]), who the other inmates claim to be Deaseâs secret mistress and informer. After two officers take Aisha away for starting the fight, Dease has an intimidating conversation with Michael, informing him that he runs the prison, not Nelson ([[Reed R. McCants]]), the warden. Nelson approaches Dease and they collaborate about their plans to increase their profit off the prison.  Aisha enters Deaseâs office to discuss her fight with Nicki and Dease slaps her in the face, telling her how unimportant she is. He presents Aisha with a gift, but refuses to give it to her until she provides him with any information about the other convicts. Dease then turns off the surveillance camera and forces Aisha to perform oral sex on him. After she leaves the office, Aisha finds Frances, punches her in the face for confessing that Aisha caused the fight, and steals her necklace. Aisha leaves around the corner and is surprised by Nikki, who stabs her and takes Francesâ necklace. After the incident, Michael takes Frances to Deaseâs office where Nelson questions her, but Frances provides no information about what she saw and is let go. Later that night, Dease and the other officers enter Nikkiâs cell and beat her, claiming that they know she stabbed Aisha. According to Sabrinaâs narration, however, Dease secretly loves Aisha and abuses her because she does not return the feelings.  Michael enters the break room where Dease and the other guards are. They begin to discuss the possible closing of the prison and John Banks ([[Robert Archer Lynn]]), a white officer, is concerned about finding a new job. Dease claims that the loss of jobs is associated with untrained students, such as Michael, stealing their jobs, which creates tension between the other officers and Michael. As Michael attempts to defend himself and the mistreated female inmates, Dease proceeds to yell at him that these women have no respect for society and therefore, deserved to be treated poorly. Later, Michael does his own research on the prison system and discovers that these female convicts are being exploited for cheap labor.  At night, Lilâ Mama becomes very ill and the other convicts are concerned about her and her childâs health. No officers come to help and Frances, who was a nurse, takes care of Lilâ Mama throughout the night. During that night, Frances has a connecting conversation with both Nikki and Wet about why they were in jail. Wet shot a track runner who was sleeping with her boyfriend/husband in broad daylight and in front of 12 witnesses. Frances is then asked why she is in there and she explains that her husband was beating her, so she had finally had enough and shot him, landing her in prison. As Wet argues Frances' innocence, Nikki comments on why she was locked up for protecting herself.  The next day in the sweatshop, Nikki thanks Frances for helping Lilâ Mama and returns her necklace. The ladies receive bad news that Frances was denied an appeal, Nikkiâs children would not come to visit, and Wet gets a citation for creating a petition to end the prisonâs harsh working conditions. Also, Aisha returns after recovering from being stabbed. She and Nikki have an exchange of words when Aisha makes an insulting comment about Nikki's mother, tempting Nikki to fight her but is quickly broken up by close guards.  Frances, Nikki, Lilâ Mama, and Wet, now friends, sneak off to the kitchen where they share food and wine. They witness Dease secretly place a small bomb in the kitchen which goes off and alarms the other officers. As a result, Dease blames the incident on the inmates and has the kitchen rebuilt. After placing the prison on lockdown, Nelson approaches Dease, angry about the explosion and Wetâs petition. Nelson states that he was informed that Dease created the explosion and threatens to fire Dease if he attempts any secret plans again.  During a cell search, Officer Banks enters Wetâs room and begins to damage her belongings, causing an altercation between Wet and Banks and Wet being taken to solitary confinement. When she returns, Wet and the other inmates collaborate and create another petition in a few days to present to Miller ([[Chris Dodson]]), a man that Nelson hopes will invest in the prisonâs cheap labor. When Miller arrives to the workstation where the inmates are, Frances stands and reads the inmatesâ demands for better working conditions and Nikki proceeds in giving the petition to Miller. Dease and Banks begin to hit Frances and Nikki and take them to solitary confinement where they stay for 6 days. During this period, they share stories and Frances helps Nikki overcome the temptation of snorting the cocaine that Dease takes to her room. They are let out and return to their routine. During a visit from her sister, Frances discovers that her daughter Maxine has been killed in a gang shooting.  After returning from suicide watch, Frances and the other inmates devise a plan to get back at Dease with the help from Michael and Aisha, who is fed up with Dease for beating her. While Lilâ Mama cleans Deaseâs office, Aisha enters and seduces Dease, who kicks out Lilâ Mama and turns off the surveillance camera. After Lilâ Mama returns briefly and turns the camera back on, Aisha makes it appear as if Dease is raping her. Caught on video, the ladies plan on giving the evidence to the governor. When Lilâ Mama attempts to take the tape in Deaseâs office, Dease harasses and rapes her. When she returns to the jail cell, bleeding profusely and in terrible pain, the other inmates rush her to the infirmary where she suffers a miscarriage and dies. The inmates, who are violently upset, attack the doctor as he attempts to call Dease to have them escorted back to their jail cells. They hold the doctor at gunpoint and handcuff Michael to a chair. Wet shoots Dease as he enters and he in return fires a shot and hits the doctor. Nelson, informed of the situation, refuses to call the governor for assistance and instead orders the officers to be ready at the scene. In the infirmary, the convicts release Michael, handcuff the wounded Dease, and call Nelson, telling him he has one hour to get the governor on the phone. Nelson demands to speak with Dease in order to ensure that he is alive. The inmates put Dease on the phone and force him to tell Nelson that he raped Lilâ Mama. When her back is turned, Dease attacks Frances and Nikki shoots Dease several times, killing him. Sergeant Cervantes ([[MC Lyte]]), the officer in charge, orders the inmates to surrender and Wet goes outside and kills an officer, after which Wer is shot and killed. After much thought, Frances and Nikki decide to exit the infirmary and are killed by the officers.  Meanwhile, Aisha sneaks into Deaseâs office and retrieves the tape. During her final narration, Sabrina explains that after taking the evidence to a lawyer, the women file a lawsuit against the prison for their abuse and win the case. The prison is shut down and Nelson is indicted for making corrupt business deals and using the prison for his profit. Aisha is killed in a prison fight shortly after. Sabrina, now free, dedicates the inmatesâ victory to Nikki, Frances, Lilâ Mama, and Wet for their courage.

Clockstoppers
 The [[National Security Agency|NSA]]-funded Quantum Tech (QT) Corporation has slated a project to develop [[Hypertime]], a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears in standstill. NSA ends the project due to its high amount of risk. However, QT's CEO Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give his lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, Earl being in Hypertime for too long has resulted in him aging rapidly in real time, with his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down.  However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to his former colleague Dr. George Gibbs. Gibbs' son Zak, with whom he has a strained relationship, discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun. Zak wins the heart of Francesca, a new Venezuelan girl at the school. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he sends his henchmen after Zak, who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in.  A chase ensues, with Zak crashing the van into a river, thus damaging the watch. He awakes in the hospital and barely evades Jay and Richard. He then goes in search of a hiding spot, after having been accused of stealing a van by the police. In a bid to retrieve the watch, QT Corporation enlists the help of national security agencies and portray Zak, his father and Dopleras wanted fugitives. Zak goes on the run with Francesca, locating the hotel that Gibbs was staying at, with Dopler also in pursuit of Gibbs. However, QT reach Gibbs first and kidnap him.  Zak and Francesca wander the streets aimlessly before being captured by Dopler in the garbage truck. However, Francesca knocks Dopler out and she and Zak take Dopler hostage. Dopler reluctantly agrees to help save Gibbs, helps mend the broken watch, and creates guns which can take someone out of Hypertime and back into normal time. The guns are loaded with paintballs filled with frozen nitrogen, and the low temperature "freezes" a person back into normal time.  With Dopler's help, Zak and Francesca break in, but get caught by QT. The two are thrown in a cell with Zak's dad. Zak accelerates while in Hypertime and becomes "light", helping the others break out as NSA Agents arrive and defeat Gates' goons. Gates knocks Francesca out of Hypertime and prepares to do the same to Zak and his dad until Dopler arrives and defeats him. Gates and his henchmen are arrested, and the watches are confiscated.  Dopler uses the machine he was building to reverse his aging effects of Hypertime, but it inadvertently changes him back into a teenager ([[Miko Hughes]]), meaning he will have to live with the Gibbs family for a few years, though he still has the voice of his full grown self. Zak enters a relationship with Francesca, reconciles with his father, reunites with his family, and earns a car he wanted. As Zak speeds off in his car with his sister Kelly, girlfriend, and younger Dopler, it is revealed that he has not returned the watch and continues to have fun in Hypertime.

He leaves for [[Israel]] to work on a project combining science with his love of [[philosophy]].  Six years later he returns to an [[United States|America]] now governed by an administration that has brought in strong anti-privacy laws.  He is carrying a disc containing the fruits of his research to give to a former student, John Davis ([[Jim Fitzpatrick (actor)|Jim Fitzpatrick]]), when [[Black operation|black ops]] agents track him down with a view to obtaining the disc and killing him.  He manages to hide the disc and make a phone call to John before the agents catch up with him.  In subsequent police interviews with Davis he is able to assure them he did not know what was going on, a situation that changes after he listens to his phone messages.  The professor had been working on a code in [[Israel]] based on the [[Pentateuch]], the first five books in the [[Bible]], and had found answers to some of life's most basic questions. The formula he has discovered can also solve problems yet to be formulated.  John's [[software]] company is pleased with the research since it helps them with their current anti-government privacy project: keyless [[encryption]].  Before he is able to complete the sale and distribution of the [[software]] to a major company, government agents raid his home and company, confiscating all his [[computers]], [[File folder|files]] and [[computer programs]].  While trying to leave the area with his family and move to a more congenial environment, his wife and children are killed in a plane crash.  In shock, he turns to friends who help him to escape undetected.  Not only American agents but the [[Mossad]] give chase as he flees to the [[Bahamas]].  
Collateral Damage (film)
 A bomb detonates in the plaza of the [[Colombia]]n Consulate building in [[Los Angeles]], killing nine people, including a caravan of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents. Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of [[Los Angeles City Fire Department|LAFD]] firefighter, Captain Gordon "Gordy" Brewer, who was injured in the explosion. A tape is sent to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], in which a masked man calling himself ''"El Lobo"'' (''The Wolf'') claims responsibility, explaining it was in retaliation for the oppression of Colombia by the United States. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] believes ''El Lobo'' is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Special Agent Peter Brandt, the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Oversight Committee]], which promptly terminates all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to [[Santa Cruz de Mompox|MompÃ³s]] and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio.  Frustrated at the political [[red tape]] regarding the investigation, Brewer travels to MompÃ³s to personally hunt down Claudio but is quickly arrested for illegal entry. The guerrillas stage a prison break to free their comrades and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia but arrive too late. Brewer escapes the prison, avoids being captured, and secures a guerrilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong. Armstrong introduces him to drug runner Felix Ramirez, the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas. Pretending to be a mechanic, Brewer rigs several [[improvised explosive device|improvised explosives]] and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Brewer's eyes. Brewer infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him, but he is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, Selena, from being caught in the blast radius along with her son, Mauro. At Claudio's home compound, Selena reveals she is Claudio's wife. She and Claudio once lost their own child during an American attack, which compelled Claudio to become a terrorist; Selena found and adopted Mauro, whose parents were killed in the attack. Nevertheless, Selena sympathizes with Brewer and admits that Claudio is planning another bombing in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Meanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Selena helps free Brewer and, along with Brandt, travels back to the State Department in Washington, D.C. to help the search effort for Claudio. Selena identifies [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] as the target, and the FBI investigates. On the pretense of using the lavatory, Selena excuses herself from the command room and becomes irritated when Mauro refuses to come with her. When Brewer sees Selena make the same gesture as the masked man who claimed to be El Lobo in the tape, he realizes that she was the Wolf all along, and Claudio serves as her figurehead, and that the entire motive behind their cause is personal revenge for the death of their daughter at the hands of the US. Furthermore, Brewer surmises the real target is the State Department, and that he was used to help Selena get past the building's security. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's toy dinosaur, which is carrying a bomb, out a window moments before it explodes. Brandt, realizing Brewer's suspicions, is shot and killed trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building.  Brewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the underground tunnels on a motorcycle. Brewer finds the tunnel control console and shuts the gates, preventing their escape. Brewer chops open some gas lines along the walls of the tunnel and, as they ride back, Selena shoots at Brewer, igniting the gas. Brewer jumps through a doorway just as the entire tunnel explodes. Selena and Claudio survive the blast, however, and attack him simultaneously. After a short, hand-to-hand fight, Selena is electrocuted by being tossed on the exposed circuitry of the control panel, and Claudio is finally killed when Brewer throws an axe into his chest.   In the aftermath, Brewer carries Mauro in his arms as they leave the State Department. A newscast voiceover explains that Brewer will receive the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for preventing one of the worst terrorist attacks in U.S. history from taking place.

The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 film)
  [[File:Azure Window April 2003.jpg|thumb|The [[Azure Window]] of [[Gozo]] appears in the background of some scenes (picture from 2003)<ref name="guardiancollapse"></ref>]]  In 1815, [[Edmond DantÃ©s]], [[Second Mate]] of a French merchant vessel, and his friend Fernand Mondego, representative of the shipping company, seek medical help at [[Elba]] for their ailing captain. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], having kept his guardians from killing the pair, exchanges his physicianâs services with Edmond for the delivery of a letter.  Edmond is sworn to its secrecy, but the exchange is witnessed by Fernand.  In [[Marseille]], the company owner Morrell commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over [[First Mate]] Danglars, who had given Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba. Edmond thereafter states his intention to marry his girlfriend, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, whom Fernand lusts after.  Fernand and Danglar inform on Edmond regarding Bonaparte's letter.  Villefort, the city's magistrate, has Edmond arrested, but initially prepares to exonerate Edmond until he learns the letter is addressed to Villefort's father, a [[Bonapartist]].  He burns the letter and orders Edmond imprisoned in [[ChÃ¢teau d'If]]. Edmond escapes, and turns to Fernand for help, but Fernand instead turns him over to the pursuing Gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac. Villefort has Fernand assassinate his father in exchange for persuading MercÃ©dÃ¨s that Edmond has been executed for treason and that she should take comfort in Fernand.  Six years later, Edmond is startled in his cell by an eruption in the ground revealing another prisoner. [[AbbÃ© Faria]], who has been imprisoned for 11 years after he refused to tell Bonaparte the whereabouts of the treasure of Spada, has dug an escape tunnel. However, upon seeing that he is in Edmond's cell, he realizes he dug in the wrong direction. In exchange for his help digging a new escape tunnel, Edmond is educated by Faria in all manner of scholarship and swordplay for the next 7 years.  Faria dies in a tunnel cave-in but before expiring he reveals a map to the treasure.  Edmond escapes by switching himself for Faria's body in the body bag, and is thrown into the sea, pulling Dorleac along with him, whom he drowns.  Floating ashore, Edmond encounters a band of pirates preparing to execute a fellow pirate, Jacopo, ([[Luis GuzmÃ¡n]]).  Their leader, Luigi Vampa, decides justice and entertainment would be better served by pitting Edmond and Jacopo in a knife fight. Edmond wins, but spares Jacopo, who swears himself to Edmond for life, and they both work for the pirates until they arrive in Marseille.  Edmond learns from Morrell, who does not recognize him, that Fernand and Danglars are complicit in his betrayal, and that Fernand and MercÃ©dÃ¨s have wed. With Jacopo, he locates Faria's treasure, and using his newfound wealth and comprehensive education, he establishes himself in Parisian society as "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Edmond ingratiates himself to the Mondegos by staging the kidnap and rescue of their son, Albert ([[Henry Cavill]]). He lures Fernand, Villefort and Danglars into a trap by letting slip the notion that he has located the treasure of Spada, and is shipping it through Marseille. Danglars is caught red-handed in the act of theft. Villefort is tricked into revealing his role in his father's death and is arrested.  Fernand is ruined as Edmond has his gambling debts called in.  Even though his appearance has dramatically changed, Edmond is recognized by MercÃ©dÃ¨s. Eventually, he softens her, and they rekindle their relationship. As Fernand prepares to flee, MercÃ©dÃ¨s reveals the only reason she married him was that she was pregnant with Albert, who is really Edmondâs son.  Edmond ambushes Fernand in the ruins of his family's country estate, having led Fernand to believe that the treasure of Spada would be waiting for him. Albert intervenes when Edmond attempts to kill Fernand, but MercÃ©dÃ¨s tells him of his true parentage. Fernand attempts to flee, but changes his mind upon realizing that he has nothing left to live for, and challenges Edmond to a fight to death; Edmond prevails.  Edmond purchases ChÃ¢teau d'If, intending to raze it, but instead leaves it standing as he swears to Faria to use his vast resources for good.

Chuck is given permission to pitch the concept for ''[[The Dating Game]]'' at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. He is given $7,500 to create a [[television pilot]], but ABC abandons the idea in favor of ''[[Hootenanny (US TV series)|Hootenanny]]''.  One night after Barris is kicked out of a bar for fighting, he is approached by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Jim Byrd, who recruits him as an assassin. Returning from a mission in Mexico, Barris finds that Penny has become a hippie. Meanwhile, ABC [[green-light]]s ''The Dating Game'', and by 1967 the show is a phenomenon.

At the end of the ceremony, he sees some of the people he killed in the crowd. Distraught, he confesses to her his double life as a CIA assassin, but she merely laughs, assuming he is joking, and he decides not to correct her.  
The Country Bears
   The Country Bears are an all-bear country rock band who have disbanded in 1991 after years of popularity. Beary Barrington (voiced by [[Haley Joel Osment]]), a large admirer of the band and a young bear raised by a human family, feels disowned for being different. His father ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]) tells him that his family will love him unconditionally regardless, and that differences lead everyone to their purposes. But Beary's older brother, Dex ([[Eli Marienthal]]), tells him the truth about his background.  Angry and embarrassed, Beary leaves home and ventures out to Country Bear Hall, the former concert hall of the Country Bears. Beary learns from the [[property caretaker]] Big Al (voiced by [[James Gammon]]) and the band's manager Henry Dixen Taylor (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) that Country Bear Hall is threatened with destruction by greedy banker Reed Thimple ([[Christopher Walken]]). After many attempts to raise $20,000 to save Country Bear Hall, Beary suggests to Henry to hold a benefit concert and the two of them set out to reunite the group with the band's [[bus driver]] and drummer Roadie ([[M. C. Gainey|M.C. Gainey]]). Meanwhile, the Barringtons have enlisted police officers named Officer Cheets ([[Diedrich Bader]]) and Officer Hamm ([[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]]) to find Beary.  First, they approach Fred Bedderhead (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]), the harmonica and electric bass player. Fred is working as a security guard on the set of [[Krystal Harris|Krystal]]'s latest music video and agrees to return for the concert. Henry needs promotion and Beary suggests the group's former promoter Rip Holland ([[Alex Rocco]]) whom Henry claimed had "stolen" the Country Bears from him. Henry phones Rip, who gladly agrees to promote the show. After the phone call, it is revealed that Rip was in an office display of a store as he is told to leave. Fred then mentions a talent show history where they defeated an armpit musician named Benny Boggswaggle (Michael Lawrence Morgan) in a talent competition which caused Benny to strike Zeb Zoober on the head with a chair. Meanwhile, Big Al is approached by Reed who learns about the Country Bears' plan and about Rip Holland promoting the show. When Big Al realizes that he is talking to Reed, he has Reed look in one direction. By the time Reed looks back, Big Al is on the steps of Country Bear Hall stating "I'm chubby, but I'm quick." Reed then moves on to his next plan.  Next, they approach the band's fiddler Zeb Zoober (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]), who has spent all of his years drinking honey at the Swarming Hive Honey Bar restaurant and owes $500.00 to the owner named "Cha-Cha" ([[Queen Latifah]]). Zeb wants to return, but cannot do so without paying his debt. Beary places a bet to let Zeb off the hook by beating the house band in a playoff. Zeb starts his performance off by sounding rusty, but warms up and eventually wins. Meanwhile, Officer Cheets and Officer Hamm approach Big Al for directions to where Beary went. Because Big Al does not mention that Beary is friends with them and has joined them, the officers think that the bears have kidnapped Beary.  They then approach Tennessee O'Neal (voiced by [[Toby Huss]]), the one-string guitar player, who is reluctant because he wants nothing more than to reconcile with his ex-girlfriend Trixie St. Claire, the band's keyboard player. At a restaurant, the Country Bears meet a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] ([[Jennifer Paige]]) who is working to become a singer as she sings her upbeat version of "Kick It Into Gear." Afterwards, a news bulletin is seen on television as a television reporter ([[Paul Rugg]]) covers a story where the Country Bears and Roadie have "kidnapped" Beary. After being chased by Officers Cheets and Hamm through a car wash, the Country Bears stop at a motel where Beary learns that Trixie St. Claire (voiced by [[Candy Ford]]) is performing at the motel's bar. Beary informs Tennessee about this and he goes in to reunite with her where they sing "Can Love Stand the Test" together. She subsequently comes with the band to their reunion.  They finally head out to find Ted Bedderhead (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]), the group's lead vocalist and guitarist. Ted is supposedly very wealthy now when they find a mansion where they learn from a [[gardener]] (who Zeb claims to look like [[Elton John]]) that Ted is still at the local [[country club]] working at the wedding. After Ted has the other Country Bears members leave, Fred eventually finds out that he is nothing more than a wedding singer as he sings "[[It's Not Unusual]]." Ted is knocked unconscious by Fred and forcefully dragged onto the bus. Meanwhile, Officers Cheets and Hamm return to the Barringtons and set up equipment to prepare for when the Country Bears call in their "demands."  The Country Bears learn that Ted had been performing at weddings and birthday parties as he mentions that the "gardener" that they met was indeed Elton John and that Ted rented a room over John's garage. Zeb claims Ted to be the reason for the band's disestablishment, but Ted claims that he held them together and that no one was grateful, as the other members were all busy drinking honey (a habit of Zeb), blubbering (a habit of Tennessee), and staring into space (a habit of Fred). Beary reminds them that they claimed each other to be family, but Ted claims it to be meaningless publicity. Beary realizes the real meaning of family and returns home.  After various petty arguments, the Country Bears read Beary's school essay about them and they realize that Beary was right and decide that they must perform the gig. Reconciling with Beary, Ted insists that they allow him to join them during the concert. But Reed Thimple kidnaps the rest of the Country Bears and steals the bus. Dex suggests that they use part of Beary's tracking device to find them. Reed Thimple reveals to the Bears that he is really Benny Boggswaggle and is wreaking his vengeance on the bears for stealing his one chance at fame. Beary, his family, and Ted track down and rescue the band and head to the concert together.  When they arrive at Country Bear Hall, they discover that Reed Thimple has paid Rip to not promote the show, so the concert appears to be headed for failure. Rip even explains his reasons involving business with him ending with the fact that some of it was Reed Thimple's idea. As the other Country Bears restrain Henry from attacking Rip, Big Al arrives and asks if the Country Bears are continuing with their concert as planned. When Fred states that nobody arrived, Big Al reveals that everyone had parked in the back field because he did not want any automobiles out on the front lawn. Big Al then opens the doors and a surge of people rush in as Reed Thimple is flushed out vowing to the Country Bears that their feud is not over. The money raised from the concert is revealed to be enough to save the hall and the Country Bears perform with Beary as member of the band. The group performs their song "Straight to the Heart of Love" as the rest of the Barringtons and the audience watch the concert.  During the credits, a documentary about the Country Bears is shown with interviews with various celebrity musicians, Officer Cheets, and Roadie.  In the post-credits, a scene following the car wash scene had Officer Cheets explaining to Officer Hamm about everyone at the police station wearing a fake mustache as they get to their police car and let the water out of it.  
Crackerjack (2002 film)
 Jack Simpson is a wise-cracking, directionless layabout who works at an inner-city telemarketing firm. For years, he has been a member at the Cityside Lawn Bowls Club (in fact he has three memberships). But he has never played a single game, having only joined to get the free parking spaces from which he makes extra cash by renting them to his work-mates. But Cityside is in dire financial trouble and a greedy developer, Bernie Fowler, wants to turn it into a soul-less pokies venue. The Club President, Len, decides that all existing members must now play and Jack reluctantly has to turn up on Saturdays to take part in the bowling matches. Jack proves to be a natural player but he soon annoys and upsets the older club members with his brashness and lack of tact. Veteran player Stan, sensing that Jack only needs some guidance, both in the game and in life, takes him under his wing, trying to teach him to think of other people apart from himself.  After losing his job and his girlfriend, the Bowls Club suddenly becomes all Jack has in his life and, despite himself, he grows fond of the older members. His flatmate Dave joins the club and he starts a relationship with Nancy, a journalist. Bernie, determined to take over the club, investigates Jack and exposes his illegal car-park hiring scam, which almost gets him expelled. Cityside enters a major tournament at Bernie's glitzy club, the prize money from which will save their independence. Jack's selfish show-boating almost costs them the first round but Stan and the others make Jack finally realize he is part of a team.  Police arrive to arrest Len as (in a tip-off from Bernie), they discovered marijuana stored at the club. The greenkeeper has been secretly growing it but Jack is blamed by the other members. Dave and two of the ladies Gwen and Eileen approach the State Governor and convince her to over-turn a lifetime ban on Cliff Carew, the club's best player, and the latter takes Len's place. Cityside fights their way into the lead and Stan throws the winning shot but he suffers a severe heart-attack as he does so and Bernie lodges a protest, meaning the shot is dis-allowed. Jack insists that the rules allows the team a re-shot and he takes his special shot- the 'Flipper'- which wins the tournament. To rub salt into the wounds, Nancy proves that, whilst spying on the club, Bernie paid Jack for one of his car-park spaces, an illegal act for which Bernie must be dismissed.  Cityside is saved and can continue in its old form. Stan passes away and the club names the green in his honour. The pot-growing greenkeeper is sacked and Jack takes over his job and he and Nancy begin a new life with their friends at the club. The film's end-credits feature a postscript with still images and a narration by Jack describing the later exploits of all the characters.  
*Corpus Callosum
 This film does not possess a linear plot as most do, but is rather a jumble of images stuck together in an apparently meaningless sequence.  Office workers in this film continue about their day-to-day business, all while their surrounding constantly shift without their knowledge. Workers clothing changes on their bodies without them noticing, people they are conversing with disappear. At one point, office workers engaging in a meeting suddenly stick together as if drawn to one another by electricity. Other men in the room begin to contort otherâs bodies, tying each other into knots with their own limbs. At this point, two men are pictures shaking hands outside. When their hands touch, both men melt in to one another, emerging after a few seconds having reversed all physical characteristics. People who work in the office also seem to have god-like powers, changing things as simple as the lighting in the room, to as impossible as causing people to walk on the ceiling rather than the floor â all by changing settings on their computers.  <ref></ref>  Aside from documenting the technology driven disaster which is the workplace, the home is also pictured as a war zone in Snowâs film. The home consists of a mother, a father, and a boy. The three sit on their sofa, completely enthralled by what they are watching on the television as everything around them shifts. The sofa changes colours, so do the walls, the photos, their clothing etc. The living room they sit in is filthy. Scattered about are empty and full cups, pizza and takeout containers which also shift with no apparent notice from the family members. At a point within this sequence within the home, the end credits of the film are played on the screen, leading the viewer to believe that the film is over. After the credits finish, the film continues playing the same scene, the family sitting in their living room just as they were before the credits.  The final scene to this film is a couple who go to a movie in a theater. The movie plays, and the couple watches the film, which is of themselves from another perspective.

  On a Friday evening, just before closing time Alain Coste is in his office and gets ready to leave, Claire, his [[personal assistant|PA]], manages to stall him a couple of minutes, he goes out and she steals his keys just before he comes back for his jacket. Claire calls CÃ©cile Coste to report that Alain has left. Alain goes to see Georges Colinet, his physician who tells him that he has [[tennis elbow]] and must have an operation. Alain becomes very worried that this operation shall take his life despite all assurances to the contrary. Later on Alain goes to a park and he starts a series of [[Will (law)|will]] projects that he dictates in a pocket [[tape recorder]] that he carries around, the first will distributes his [[assets]] 50/50% to his wife and children, 98% of his company shall go to his children and the remaining 2% to Claire and some moneys that he has in a Swiss [[bank]]-account shall go to the Fund for [[Cancer]] Research.  At home CÃ©cile is worried that Alain is not back yet and assumes that the worst has happened (which she does all the time). It is clear that she is preparing a surprise [[birthday]] party for Alain, her daughter Louise is there with her [[boyfriend]] Henry helping in the [[kitchen]]. Police lights are visible from the kitchen and CÃ©cile goes to the door, but it is [[Police]] [[Inspector]] Pascal Manise who arrives to drop his wife AgnÃ¨s. The [[doorbell]] rings, it is [[physician|Dr.]] Colinet who arrives. In the meantime Alain is lost in his own [[neighbourhood]], he cannot find his [[house]] and comes close to having a car accident with Manise; when finally home he tells CÃ©cile that he was late because he gave Claire a ride home. The party begins and RÃ©my and Louise sing "[[Les roses blanches]]" to him instead of "[[Happy Birthday to You]]". When AgnÃ¨s congratulates Alain she says "''may you have more days like this''", which he takes as a dark [[omen]]. Georges assures him that nothing is wrong with him and gives him back his [[key (lock)|key]]s to a [[chalet]] Alain owns in the nearby [[mountain]]s, which he used for a romantic escapade.  When alone at the kitchen, CÃ©cile confronts Alain and tells him that it is not true that he gave Claire a ride home and he then says that he actually had a car accident, as she is about to check out the car, AgnÃ¨s faints; Alain uses that opportunity to create the "accident" that he had, which means hitting his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] with a [[hammer]]. Meanwhile CÃ©cile has reached Manise over the phone and tells him that AgnÃ¨s is sick. He arrives and takes her away. While waiting for Manise, CÃ©cile sees that the car has not had the [[exhaust system|exhaust]] changed as Alain had said earlier.  The next day after a debate at [[school]], CÃ©cile asks Pascal to tail Alain because he is hiding something from her. Manise tells her that it is preferable to be honest and ask her husband directly but she refuses. Meanwhile in his office Alain has a sudden [[spasm]] and begins dictating his ever growing symptoms in his recorder, he leaves the office (which Claire reports to CÃ©cile, who has been keeping a record of all his comings and goings) and goes to the [[park]] where he meets Louise, who tells her father that Henry dumped her because she cheated on him. Manise is close by and all he sees is that Alain is meeting with a younger woman, but when he reports it to CÃ©cile she recognizes her daughter and is relieved that there is not another woman. At school AgnÃ¨s is very worried because Manise had to arrest Jeanne, a colleague [[teacher]] and [[friend]].  Manise asks CÃ©cile to check the bank accounts for unusual charges, she does so despite Claire's warnings that Alain shall notice, they find nothing. During [[lunch]] Alain is designing several gadgets on a [[table mat]] and Manise is drinking coffee, he leaves the bar and says goodbye to everyone at the bar in a very French fashion which catches Alain's attention. Manise goes back to Alain's office and poses as a policeman from the financial branch, insinuating that Alain is involved in some questionable businesses, which Claire denies, however he manages to take a lock of Claire's [[hair]] without her noticing. On his way out he crosses Alain who is puzzled to see him again and asks Clair who he was and she says that he was a copying-machine representative. Alain sits at his desk and notices that things are not exactly where he left them and asks Claire to retrieve his [[newspaper]], which he forgot at the bar. When she leaves he redials the last phone and sees that Claire was not talking to her mother but to CÃ©cile. He also notices that Manise is still outside and manages to shake his tail, then he rushes home turning the house upside down looking for something and finds CÃ©cile's notes on him, he changes his will: nothing for CÃ©cile or Claire, all for the children with a warning not to trust their [[mother]].  That night CÃ©cile goes to Manise's place to confront him about scaring Claire, she does not know that Alain is following her. Manise however, notices that Alain is close by and makes it look as if CÃ©cile is having an affair with him and asks her to take him to the [[police station]]. Manise also reveals that AgnÃ¨s is addicted to [[drugs]] and that the day of the [[party]] she fainted due to [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]]. Before they can leave Alain is assaulted by thugs. Alain then goes to Claire's and forces a confession from her. Alain goes back home and tells CÃ©cile that he must go to Paris for a couple of days. [[File:Tramway citadis grenoble.JPG|thumb|left|Grenoble's train station]] The next day CÃ©cile drops Alain at the [[train station]] but he comes out a few seconds later to take a [[taxicab|taxi]], however Manise is still tailing him. While in the taxi Alain changes his will again: the money for the Cancer Research is diminished. The [[taxicab driver|taxi driver]] tells Alain that he is being followed and manages to lose Manise again, but Manise finds the taxi driver and shows him his [[badge]]. Meanwhile at the hospital Alain tells Georges about the person who is tailing him but Georges reassures him, Alain changes his will: the money for the Cancer Research fund is increased. As he gets an [[anesthetic]] shot from Georges' [[nurse]] who turns out to be the [[Sexual partner|lover]] that he took to the chalet, looks out the [[window]] and sees Manise talking to Dr. Colinet in the [[parking lot]]. He flees but no taxi shall take him.  As CÃ©cile is about to enter the school where she works, Manise tells her that Alain did not take the [[train]] to [[Paris]] and ventures that he is probably in a [[hotel]] with someone else. CÃ©cile goes to the school and finds that everyone is celebrating Jeanne's release from [[prison]]. AgnÃ¨s asks if she can borrow her car and if she can use the chalet, CÃ©cile angrily accepts. Meanwhile Alain has managed to get on the [[countryside]] by [[foot]] and calls for Claire to help him. When she arrives the anaesthetic has kicked in and Alain lies unconscious in the middle of the [[field (agriculture)|field]], Claire manages to wake him up. As they drive to the chalet Alain again drops asleep and drives off the [[road]] while drawing conclusions on the "[[Conspiracy (crime)|plot]]" against his life, he finally wakes up and steps out of the [[car]], he changes his will again: Claire gets her [[inheritance]] back. When backing up to the main road, Alain spots his wife's car with another car behind her. He follows and hears a man inside his chalet singing in Italian. He then assumes that his wife is connected to [[the Mafia]] and are plotting to kill him because of some of his inventions, Claire does not see the "connection". Meanwhile Dr. Colinet has reported Alain's disappearance to Manise. Alain and Claire go to the police but see Manise and Dr. Colinet walking out of the station together and conclude that they are together in the plot with his wife.  Alain and Claire go to their place, with Manise on their tail. She tells him that he must do something, but by then his [[paranoia]] has kicked in and he has begun adding up facts into a big scheme to kill him, which also involves his children, based on the song that they sang to him at his birthday and the changes that they made to fit him (the song involves the story of a poor boy who has to steal flowers for his dying mother in the hospital, only to find that when he finally arrives, she is already dead), Alain changes his will again: all goes to Claire. As they talk, enters Vincent, Claire's [[boyfriend]] and an [[employee]] of Alain's who is back home due to a [[working accident]], but Alain does not believe him since the [[Medical prescription|prescription]] is signed by Dr. Georges Colinet, thus Vincent is in the plot too. CÃ©cile comes back home and finds that Louise has moved back in, when she discovers the reason (Louise had cheated on her boyfriend and he dumped her) she is so angry that she slaps her daughter and also draws a conclusion that AgnÃ¨s is the one having an [[affair]] with Alain. She picks AgnÃ¨s at the street and drives up to the chalet but finds that a man named Pierre is there and it seems that AgnÃ¨s' story is true. CÃ©cile confronts Georges about the truth related to her husband's whereabouts but he does not betray anything and acts surprised when she tells him that Alain is not in Paris.  Alain has interrogated Vincent and although he does not get a confession, he ties Vincent to Claire's bed. They go to Alain's place where he connects his recording machine to the telephone to spy on CÃ©cile, he is discovered by Louise who then agrees to call him if anything strange happens related to CÃ©cile. During this conversation it is revealed that the only reason that his children sang "Les roses blanches" to him is because he sang that song all the time regardless of the occasion, because it was the only one he knew.  CÃ©cile arrives home and has another [[fight]] with Louise. She [[spends]] the night crying and close to dawn Manise tells her that Alain is at Claire's. As they leave, CÃ©cile notices that her car is gone but asks Manise not the release a police notice on it, she assumes that her daughter took it. They go to Claire's but cannot find Alain. As they leave, Claire asks Vincent to follow them, Manise notices it and beats Vincent, thinking he is one of a drug dealer's thugs who have been following him. Back in his car he tells CÃ©cile that he is being [[blackmail]]ed by AgnÃ¨s' dealer, CÃ©cile asks him to take her to her chalet, where she confronts Pierre, she believes that he is the [[drug dealer]], he tells her that Manise is a [[Domestic violence|wife beater]]. As they are about to leave, Manise tells CÃ©cile that he is in love with her. She becomes very angry and slaps him and explodes with all her cruelty to him and leaves.  Meanwhile, Alain is taking Vincent to the [[hospital]] but when he sees Dr. Colinet, he goes bezerk and crashes Vincent into the wall and beats Georges until the orderlies finally stop him. After he is restrained Alain gets a call from Louise, CÃ©cile has not shown up for work, he calls the police, Manise goes back for CÃ©cile and they go to her house. Alain finally reveals the reason for his secrecy and she is more at ease but not before she consults with Georges about the real gravity of his situation, a conversation that is spied by Alain through the window.  
Crossroads (2002 film)
 Lucy ([[Britney Spears]]), Kit ([[Zoe Saldana]]), and Mimi ([[Taryn Manning]]) are three friends who live in a small Georgia town. As young children, they bury a "wish box" and vow to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation and pledge to stay best friends forever. However, as they grow up, their friendship fades due to their different approaches of high school: Lucy becomes the introverted valedictorian, Kit becomes the most popular girl in school, and Mimi becomes an outcast from a trailer park who is facing teenage pregnancy. On the night of their high school graduation, they keep their promise and get together to open the "wish box". As they start talking again, they remember their old wishes while burying the box: Mimi wanted to travel to California, Lucy wanted to find her mother, and Kit wanted to get married. Mimi brings up going to Los Angeles to audition for a record company. Kit and Lucy try to convince Mimi to not go all the way to Los Angeles due to the fact that she is 5 months pregnant and anything dangerous can happen. However, the next morning they decide to go together but each doing something separate: Mimi going to the audition, Kit visiting her fiancÃ©, and Lucy finding her mother in Tucson, Arizona.  They set out on the road with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark convertible with a man named Ben ([[Anson Mount]]). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realize that together they don't have enough money for either the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that they sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go to the stage to perform. However, when the song starts, Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.  Shortly after the group checks into a motel, Kit tells the girls about a rumor that she had heard about Ben, commenting that he had recently been released from jail, after killing someone. The girls then spend most of the journey feeling uneasy around him until they confront him. Ben reveals that he was in jail for driving his stepsister across state borders without parental consent because his stepfather was abusing her. Having established that Ben was not the assassin that they imagined him to be, Lucy and Ben grow closer especially after she reads him a poem she wrote about growing up in life. The girls talk properly to each other for the first time since they were kids. Lucy reveals that her mother left her and her father when she was a child, but she is convinced that her mother wants to find her, but is too scared. Kit, who was overweight as a child, has an overbearing mother who sent her to "fat camp" but now cannot stand that her daughter is more beautiful than her. Mimi reveals that her baby's father is not her ex-boyfriend, but a guy who raped her after she got drunk at a party, and that she is planning to put the baby up for adoption.  After they arrive in Tucson, Lucy finds her mother Caroline; however, Caroline is not happy to see Lucy. She reveals that she has remarried, and that she now has two sons ages seven and ten. She reveals to Lucy that she was an unintended pregnancy and that she wants nothing to do with her, and Lucy leaves the house heartbroken. As she promptly arrives at the motel, Ben comforts her and impresses her by writing some music to her poem. The following day, Lucy rejoins the others and goes on to Los Angeles. When they arrive, Kit brings Mimi along to surprise her fiancÃ©, Dylan. While alone in the hotel, Lucy gives her virginity to Ben and they fall in love with each other. When Kit and Mimi arrive to Dylan's place, it is revealed that he is cheating on Kit after they see another girl in his apartment. Already upset, Kit suddenly realizes that it was Dylan who raped Mimi and got her pregnant, and she punches him. Scared, Mimi runs away and falls down the stairs. Consequently, she loses her baby. The girls comfort her as she comes to terms with her loss as she had decided to keep the baby.  Because of this, Lucy decides to call her father to take her and the girls back home. However, her father is still putting pressure on Lucy to do what he wants. Kit and Mimi tell her that they think she should go to the audition in Mimi's place. She initially declines, but when she gets into her father's car, after the entire journey, she realizes that everything that she has done has been to please her father instead of herself. Lucy tells her father to let her go and she runs after Ben, they embrace and kiss each other. She and the girls head off to the audition with Ben and receive a standing ovation after their performance of Lucy's song, "[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]".  In the end, the girls bury their âwish boxâ at the beach, this time deciding not to make any wishes in the future but instead to focus on the present and their friendship.<ref> Free Trailers, Plot Synopsis, Photos, Cast and Crew  MTV Movies|url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/movie/212004/moviemain.jhtml|website = www.mtv.com|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}</ref>  
The Crime of Father Amaro
 Newly ordained Padre Amaro arrives in Los Reyes, a small town in the fictional state of Aldama, to start his life serving the church. He is a protÃ©gÃ© of a ruthless political bishop, while the local priest, Father Benito, is having a long ongoing affair with a local restaurant owner. Benito is building a large hospital and recuperation center, which is partially funded by a [[drug cartel|cartel]]'s [[drug lord]]. Meanwhile, another priest in the area, Father Natalio, is under investigation for supporting left-wing insurgents in his secluded rural church area.  Amelia ([[Ana Claudia TalancÃ³n]]), a local 16-year-old girl, teaches [[catechism]] to the young children in the town, and is the daughter of Benito's mistress. At the start of the story, she is contemplating marriage to RubÃ©n ([[AndrÃ©s Montiel]]), a young journalist beginning his career, but tension is depicted as RubÃ©n is a non-believer and Amelia strongly Catholic. RubÃ©n's father is an avowed anti-clerical [[atheism|atheist]] who is unpopular within the town for his strong opinions.  Amaro soon becomes infatuated with Amelia, who is strongly attracted to him and asks awkward questions about love and sin in the confessional, admitting that she masturbates to Jesus. She later touches his hand while serving him at the restaurant. The newspaper is tipped off about Benito [[baptism|baptising]] the drug lord's newborn child, and RubÃ©n is asked to write about the scandals in his hometown. With the aid of mountains of evidence compiled by his father, he publishes a story about Benito's hospital being a front for [[money laundering]]. The church has Amaro write a denial and RubÃ©n is then sacked by the newspaper under pressure from the Catholic lobby. Amelia then phones RubÃ©n and dumps him, berating him with a string of obscenities. RubÃ©n's family home is vandalized by devout Catholics and when he returns home, he assaults Amaro when he sees him in the street. Amaro decides not to press charges, so RubÃ©n avoids jail time.  The film delves into the struggle priests have between desire and obedience. Amaro is plagued with guilt about his feelings for Amelia. When the local press begins to reveal the secrets of the parish, Amaro turns to his superior, Padre Benito ([[Sancho Gracia]]).  Amaro and Amelia start an affair, and Amaro cites verses from the [[Song of Songs]] as he seduces her. Later he drapes a robe meant for the statue of Virgin Mary over Amelia during a secret meeting. After Amelia becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with Amaro's child, he tries to convince her to leave town to protect him. Later, she decides to try to trick the town by trying to pass off RubÃ©n as the father. She tries to reunite with him and organize a wedding at short notice so that the baby can be attributed to him, but he tells her he is no longer interested. When Benito threatens to report Amaro, Amaro threatens to retaliate over Benito's affair. Eventually, Amaro arranges for a backstreet [[abortion]] in the middle of the night. It goes wrong and Amelia begins bleeding uncontrollably. Amaro drives her to the hospital in a large city, but she is already dead before he gets there. The lurid details of the case are suppressed; Benito and a cynical old woman know what has happened. A false story is passed around the town, blaming RubÃ©n for impregnating Amelia before marriage, and praising Amaro for breaking into the abortion clinic and liberating Amelia in a failed attempt to save her and her child. Amaro presides over Amelia's funeral; the church is packed with mourners. Benito, now using a wheelchair, leaves in disgust.  
The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course
 In outer space, a United States-owned [[satellite]] blows up and one of the last remaining pieces, a beacon, is sent hurdling towards Earth where it lands in Australia, only to be swallowed by a crocodile. Back at the CIA, Agent Buckwhiler and Deputy Director Reynolds reveal that, in the wrong hands, the beacon can change the axis of power in the world, so they send two agents, Robert Wheeler and Vaughn Archer, down to Australia to retrieve the beacon. Department Director Ansell also secretly hires an operative of his own, Jo Buckley, to go and retrieve the beacon before Wheeler and Archer, so Ansell can take Reynolds' job.  In Australia, the crocodile that swallowed the beacon lives in a river next to the house of Brozzie Drewitt, an obnoxious [[cattle station]] owner who is taking it in her own hands to kill the crocodile for preying on her cattle. Because of this, the Department of Fauna and Fisheries send one of its workers, Sam Flynn, to Drewitt's house. Sam attempts to convince Brozzie to hire some professionals to relocate the animal, instead of having her kill it, which is illegal. Despite Flynn's words, Brozzie attempts to kill the crocodile later that night, only to fail.  Meanwhile, the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and his wife Terri are filming a [[documentary]] about the "less-lovable of Australia's [[wildlife]]" when they are hired by Flynn to relocate the crocodile that has been bothering Brozzie. Steve successfully gets the crocodile in his boat. Wheeler and Archer are nearby using GPS technology to track the beacon. When the two agents see Steve and Terri zoom past them in their boat with the crocodile who swallowed the beacon on board, they are convinced that the Irwins have the beacon. They call up the CIA, who believe the Irwins plan to use the beacon to pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion to [[Australia Zoo]]. Steve and Terri board up the crocodile in a crate and put it in the back of the truck to drive to a new river system. Wheeler and Archer follow them from behind in a Land Rover, and when Wheeler hops on the top of the Irwins' truck, Steve believes them to be [[poacher]]s who are after the crocodile. Steve climbs up on the roof and, after a brief fistfight, manages to knock Wheeler off the truck. When the Irwins reach the river, Steve opens the crocodile's crate and discovers that the crocodile had defecated. In the poop, Steve sees a shiny metal object (the beacon) which he mistakes to be a misproperly discarded children's spinning top toy. Steve and Terri successfully get the crocodile in the river, but Wheeler and Archer show up again in a boat, determined to get the beacon. Jo Buckley shows up in an [[ultralight]] and throws sticks of [[dynamite]] down on Wheeler and Archer's boat, destroying it and knocking the two agents in the river. Steve believes that he and Terri are caught up in the middle of a "poacher war" and, not wanting the dynamite to hurt the newly relocated crocodile, gets a rope out of the boat and lassoes the aircraft, causing it to crash in the river and seemingly kill Buckley. It turns out Buckley did survive and she swims to shore to inform Ansell via a phone call that she failed to retrieve the beacon. Ansell informs Buckley that he is on the run from the CIA and the police for hiring her for the mission. He is found by police and is arrested for his crimes, ending the phone call.  Due to Wheeler and Archer's failure to retrieve the beacon, the CIA decides that it is time for drastic measures and they call up U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] in the [[White House]] to request permission to use military helicopters to fly to Australia and get the beacon.  Steve is ending his documentary by throwing the beacon in the air, when the military helicopters arrive. Steve hands them the beacon revealing that the whole predicament was a misunderstanding, and, in return, the CIA send Wheeler and Archer to work at the zoo as volunteers. Brozzie becomes a volunteer for the Department of Fauna and Fisheries.  
Crocodile 2: Death Swamp
 After a [[bank robbery]], four criminals try to escape to the village of Santo Cristo in [[Acapulco]], but they hijack the plane when a storm requires the pilot to start to turn around. They force the pilot to continue flying. After the copilot struggles with one of the hijackers, the plane's instrument panel is destroyed and it crashes. Most of the passengers and one of the hijackers die in the crash. The criminals gather the remaining passengers, killing those too injured to be of use, and force the rest to haul their loot through the swamp to the town they need to reach to finish their escape. While they gather the loot, a crocodile suddenly emerges from the water and eats the pilot. The criminals empty three guns into it, killing it.  As they travel through the swamp, they start falling prey to the dead crocodile's furious 30-foot mother (the crocodile from the [[Crocodile (2000 film)|first film]]). As the passengers struggle to survive crocodile, the only hope for rescue is in the hands of Zach, the boyfriend of one of the stewardesses and a tracker he runs into a bar that he hires to search for the crashed plane. Max (leader of the terrorists) forces the tracker to leave Mia (the stewardess) and Zach behind. But during the flight, Roland (the tracker) grabs Max's gun and shoots Max in the chest, killing him. When Roland tries to turn back, his chopper is grabbed by the crocodile. The croc leaves Roland to die in an explosion. Mia and Zach become the only survivors and kill the croc by using a life boat's gasoline and lighting it with her lighter, resulting in the croc blowing up. At the end of the film, Mia and Zach are at a resort swimming. As Mia jumps in the water the croc appears, she then wakes up with Zach, realizing that it was just a dream. A loud roar is heard as the camera zooms out the swamp, foreshadowing another beast of some sort.  
Crazy as Hell
 Psychiatrist Dr. Ty Adams ([[Michael Beach]]) comes to the Sedah State Mental Hospital to film a documentary. While coming across self-assured and overconfident, Adams is secretly haunted by the death of his daughter. He strikes up a friendship with the facility's administrator, Dr. Samuel Delazo ([[Ronny Cox]]), playing an ongoing chess game with him. Adams is intrigued by a patient named Barnett ([[Eriq La Salle]]) who claims to be Satan and takes a personal interest in his case.   When a patient goes to the roof to commit suicide, Adams arrogantly prevents the police from accessing the roof and attempts to talk her down himself. Barnett inexplicably appears on the rooftop and reveals jarring truths about Adams, and the patient subsequently jumps to her death. The incident calls a halt to the documentary. Adams declares Barnett a danger to the other patients and has him placed in solitary. Adams tracks down Barnett's mother and, satisfied that he had uncovered Barnett's real identity, prepares to move on from the facility. Adams and Dr. Delazo regretfully say their goodbyes, their chess game unfinished. Just before he leaves, Barnett's mother arrives and asks him to take a fruit basket to her son. She asks Adams if he believes in God, and he replies that he doesn't.   He takes one last look at Barnett straitjacketed in his cell, but when he is distracted by an orderly ([[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]]), he looks back into the room to find it empty. Turning back to the hallway, he sees Barnett's mother taking off a wig, revealing herself to be Barnett in women's clothes. Pursuing him, Adams stumbles into a bedroom where he finds his own bloody corpse, apparently having killed himself over his daughter's death. He suddenly is in a library where Dr. Delazo sits on a throne as the devil surrounded by the patients and staff, all horribly transformed. Delazo says, "Checkmate." Adams shouts that it isn't real, and that he knows who he is. Delazo asks "Who are you?" Adams says he's a good man. Delazo replies "Then why are you here?" As Adams keeps protesting that he's a good man, the screen fades to black.

Crime and Punishment (2002 Russian film)
 Though the story of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' was written and set in the 19th century, this film version takes place in the then-future setting of the early 21st century. Rodion Raskolnikov, a student in his twenties who lives in Moscow, has published a paper in which he argues that certain superior individuals can legitimately ignore laws, even those against murder. He acts out this arrogant theory by murdering an old woman, a pawnbroker and her sister, who accidentally witnesses the crime. In the aftermath, Raskolnikov is increasingly tortured by his conscience.  
Cube 2: Hypercube
 The film starts with a young woman named Becky (Greer Kent), shown to be trapped in the Cube. She enters another room, but unknown to her, the room has reversed gravity, as she is pulled up, and it is implied that she is killed.  Some time later, a woman named Kate ([[Kari Matchett]]), detective Simon ([[Geraint Wyn Davies]]), a blind girl named Sasha ([[Grace Lynn Kung]]), engineer Jerry ([[Neil Crone]]), game developer Max ([[Matthew Ferguson]]), lawyer Julia (Lindsey Connell), and an elderly woman named Mrs. Paley (Barbara Gordon) find themselves trapped in brightly lit cubes, each with a panel on each of the six sides, which are doors to other rooms. They come across Colonel Thomas Maguire ([[Bruce Gray]]), who says that they have to solve the code in order to leave the mysterious place. Just as he finishes, a wall begins to close in on the group. The group escapes while Thomas stays behind, while Kate and Simon watch in horror as Thomas is disintegrated by the wall. Later experiences around the cube reveal that gravity can operate in different directions in each room, while Mrs. Paley, who is revealed to be a retired theoretical mathematician, and Jerry, realize that they may be in a [[tesseract]], or a hypercube. Kate notices the numbers "60659" everywhere they go.  The group soon realizes they are connected to Izon, a defense contractor. While in conversation, Mrs. Paley opens a panel to reveal her being killed by Simon, who is decapitated soon after by crystal beams. Jerry thinks that it is a parallel universe, while Max and Julia think it is an optical illusion. Later, while the group is sleeping, Simon realizes that he is in the tesseract to look for Becky, a missing Izon worker and the first person revealed in the film. Meanwhile, Sasha hears a noise and awakens everyone, due to her acute hearing. The group finds a floating square in the middle of the room, which grows into shifting variations of a tesseract, before expanding into a lethal and rapidly spinning frame. The group flees into another room, but Jerry is injured by the tesseract. Trying to call Jerry, the rest of the group watches as Jerry is shredded by the tesseract, which grows rapidly. Kate remains to save Sasha, who is still trapped in the room, narrowly avoiding death as they group in one of the corners of the room where the tesseract can not reach, as the tesseract conforms back to a cube and disappears. Sasha and Kate are separated from the group, as a result.  Simon starts to suspect that Mrs. Paley is an undercover spy, so he gags and ties her up, but crystal beams start protruding from the walls. Simon tries to save Mrs. Paley, but when he sees that there is not enough time, as the clinging Mrs. Paley refuses to release him, he stabs her with his knife. Max and Julia, disturbed that Simon killed Mrs. Paley, leave and abandon him. Julia tells Max she must be dreaming, and then kisses him, because she says she would never kiss him in the real world. They begin to have sex, but unbeknownst to them, they are in a room that is zero-gravity and [[time dilation|time dilated]], and age prematurely and die, as Kate finds the corpses floating in the air later, still in mid-coitus. Simon, alone and hungry, goes insane. He encounters a parallel Jerry and the missing Becky, killing both of them.  Meanwhile, Kate finds grisly alternate realities of her death in other rooms, and is horrified. Sasha tells Kate that time and space are distorted where they are, that the tesseract will implode and reality is collapsing. She reveals that she is Alex Trusk, a computer hacker who is responsible for the creation of the tesseract, who also reveals that when she discovered that Izon was putting people inside the tesseract, she tried to stop their operation, but was pursued so she "fled into the only place they wouldn't follow": the tesseract. Kate, however, still believes that there is a way out. Kate then finds Simon and stabs him in the eye after he grabs her in another room, as Simon appears behind Alex, old and blind in one eye, proving Alex's space-time theory. Alex claims that they "are all dead", which causes Simon to snap her neck, believing that if they are all dead that it would not really matter if he kills her now.  Kate finds that the tesseract is shrinking, and kills Simon with the knife. She looks at the numerous duplicates of Jerry's watch and realizes that "60659" is the time that the tesseract will implode; 6:06:59. and that she is there to take back Alex's necklace which was filled with confidential information on Izon. The hypercube starts to wear away, and Kate opens a panel in the bottom, revealing a black void. At 6:06:59, she jumps in just when the Hypercube implodes.   Kate wakes up in the hands of Izon authorities in an unknown factory. She gives them the necklace, but because of their confidentiality, she is shot in the head and killed by one of the Izon operatives. An Izon authority reports to an anonymous and unidentified source that "Phase 2 is terminated", as the operatives leave the facility, and the film ends.  
Cypher (film)
 Morgan Sullivan (Northam), a recently unemployed accountant, is bored with his [[suburban]] life. Pressured by his wife to take a job with her father's company, he instead pursues a position in [[corporate espionage]]. Digicorp's Head of Security, Finster (Bennett), inducts Morgan and assigns him a new identity. As Jack Thursby, he is sent to [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] to secretly record presentations and transmit them to headquarters. Sullivan is soon haunted by recurring [[nightmares]] and neck pain. When he meets Rita Foster (Liu) from a competing corporation, his life starts to become complicated.  Rita gives him pills to cure his pain and nightmares and tells him not to transmit at the next convention. After the convention, Digicorp confirms the receipt of his transmission, though Morgan had sent nothing. Sure that something strange is going on, Morgan takes the pills Rita gave him and finds that they work. Confused by what is going on, and intrigued by Rita, he arranges to meet with her again. At the meeting, she tells him about Digicorp's deception and offers him an antidote&nbsp;â a green liquid in a large [[syringe]]. Morgan hesitantly accepts. She warns him that no matter what happens at the next convention he must not react.  Morgan discovers that all the convention attendees are spies as he is, all thinking themselves individual spies working for Digicorp. While they are drugged from the served drinks, plastic-clad scientists probe, inject and brainwash them. Individual headsets reinforce their new identities, preparing them to be used and then disposed of. Morgan manages to convince Digicorp that he believes his new identity. He is then recruited by Sunway Systems, a rival of Digicorp. Sunway's Head of Security, Callaway (Webber), encourages Morgan to act as a [[double agent]], feeding corrupted data to Digicorp. Morgan calls Rita, who warns him that Sunway is equally ruthless, and that he is in fact being used by Rita's boss, Sebastian Rooks. Morgan manages to steal the required information from Sunway Systems' [[bank vault|vault]], escaping with Rita's help.  Rita ultimately takes him to meet Rooks. When she temporarily leaves the room, a nervous Morgan calls Finster, and becomes even more distressed. He accidentally shoots Rita, who encourages him to ignore her and meet Rooks in the room next door. Morgan finds the room filled with objects which appear to be personal to him, including a [[photograph]] of him and Rita together. Realising that he is apparently Rooks, he turns to Rita in disbelief.  Before Rita can convince him, the apartment is invaded by armed men. Rita and Morgan escape to the roof of the skyscraper as the security teams of Digicorp and Sunway meet, led by Finster and Callaway. After a short [[Mexican standoff]] both sides realise they are after the same person, Sebastian Rooks, and rush to the roof, where they find Morgan and Rita in a helicopter. Rita cannot fly it, but, having designed it himself, Sebastian can after Rita encourages him to remember his past self, connecting through his love for her. He lifts off amid gunfire from the security teams. Finster and Callaway comment as the couple seem to have escaped:  :Callaway: "Did you get a look at him? Did you see Rooks' face?" :Finster: "Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn."  Looking up, they see the helicopter hovering and realise, too late, the true identity of Morgan Sullivan. Sebastian triggers a bomb, causing the whole roof to explode. On a boat in the South Pacific Ocean, Sebastian reveals the content of the stolen disc to Rita. Marked "[[terminate with extreme prejudice]]", it is the last copy of Rita's identity (after the one in the vault was destroyed). Sebastian throws the disc into the sea and says, "Now there's no copy at all."  
The Cuckoo (film)
 September 1944. Several days before [[Finland]], a co-belligerent of [[Nazi Germany]], pulls out of the [[Continuation War]] against the [[Soviet Union]], Veikko (Ville Haapasalo), a Finnish soldier, is turned in by his Finnish and German compatriots for being a [[pacifist]] and, in their eyes, a would-be [[deserter]]. As a punishment, the young man is placed in shackles, chained to a rock outcrop in a remote [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] forest, left with nothing but a few supplies, rifle and ammunition - effectively made a forced [[Kamikaze]] ''kukushka'' sniper. To ensure his willingness to fight, they dress him in the uniform of the [[Waffen-SS]], as Soviet soldiers felt little mercy towards SS men. Days pass, and after several failed attempts, Veikko succeeds in freeing himself and heads for safety, shackles still attached.  Meanwhile, Ivan (Viktor Bychkov), a Captain in the [[Red Army]] accused of anti-Soviet correspondence, is arrested by the [[NKVD]] secret police. En route to his court martial, Soviet planes accidentally bomb the vehicle carrying the disgraced captain, killing the driver and Ivan's guard. Veikko, at this stage still chained to the rock, witnesses the bombing through his riflescope.  Not far away is the farm of Anni ([[Anni-Kristiina Juuso]]), a [[Sami people|Sami]] reindeer farmer whose husband was taken away together with their whole reindeer herd by Germans four years earlier, never to return. Hungry and alone, the young and resourceful widow locates the bodies of Ivan and his captors while foraging for food. As she begins to bury the dead, Anni discovers that Ivan is still alive, but seriously hurt. She carries him to her wooden hut and nurses him back to health. Meanwhile, Veikko, in search of tools to remove his shackles, stumbles upon Anniâs farm. Thus World War II creates the unlikeliest of bonds.  Comic, and sometimes tragic, misunderstandings soon arise, resulting in a passionate and very human three-way relationship. Unable to communicate with the others and unaware that the war between the USSR and Finland is over, Ivan is convinced that Veikko is a German soldier gone astray. To Ivan, the German uniform the Finnish soldier was forced to wear is further proof. Ivan even refuses to tell his name to Veikko, answering only "''Poshol ty!''" (Â«ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ» ÑÑ!Â» "Get lost!") â as a result, the two others think his name is "Psholty". Veikko is unaware of Ivanâs hatred and just wants to cut off his shackles, return home and put the war behind him, but opts to stay on Anni's farm to avoid falling into enemy hands. The earthly and sensuous Anni, who has not been with a man in four years, could not be more delighted with her good fortune, language barrier be damned.  For Anni, Veikko and Ivan are not enemies, but just men. An uncommon and touching bond develops, as the three unlikely souls begin a domestic routine of hunting and gathering in preparation for the long Lapp winter. The two men do what they can to contribute to Anniâs well-being. Veikko builds a sauna and Ivan picks mushrooms. Veikko, Ivan and Anni communicate only with gestures. Starved for love and physical touch, Anni seduces young, strapping Veikko, much to the chagrin of jealous middle-aged Ivan.  Not long afterwards a Soviet biplane crashes in the forest near Anniâs hut, spilling leaflets announcing an armistice between Finland and USSR. Veikko thinks he can finally return home safely, but Ivan â who does not understand Finnish â manages to find a pistol in the wreckage and, still convinced that Veikko is a Fascist, shoots him when he seemingly tries to attack Ivan, really only trying to destroy his rifle. When Ivan reads the last line of the leaflet  the plane was dropping (written in Russian and instructing Soviet soldiers to allow the Finns to return home unharmed), he realizes that the war is over. Ivan is torn with remorse and, stumbling, carries Veikko back to the farm.  The nurturing Anni brings Veikko back from the brink of death through a series of ancient Sami magic rituals. With Veikko bedridden, Anniâs needs for companionship and sexual longing draw Ivan into her bed. Gradually, Ivan and Veikko, no longer separated by ethnic hate nor rivalry for the affections of Anni, become friends. As winter arrives and the two men head back to their respective homes in opposite directions, Anni is left behind with memories âand much moreâ of her two unlikely comrades in war and peace. In the final scene she narrates the story to her children, whom she named after their fathers: Veikko and Psholty.  
D-Tox
  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Jake Malloy is pursuing a serial killer who specializes in killing police officers. Malloy's former partner becomes one of the victims. While Malloy is at his partner's home, the murderer calls Malloy from Malloy's home while Mary, his girlfriend, is there. The killer tells Malloy that he pursued him four years before for a series of prostitute murders; he is holding a grudge and he's going to kill Mary. Malloy rushes home to find Mary dead. When the killer's hideout is found, Seattle police and the FBI blockade the area before Malloy arrives. Malloy pursues the killer only to find that he appears to have committed [[suicide]].  Three months later, Malloy descends into alcoholism over Mary's murder. After Malloy slits his wrists in an unsuccessful suicide attempt, his best friend and supervising officer, Agent Chuck Hendricks, enrolls Malloy in a rehabilitation program designed for law enforcement officers. The clinic was formerly an abandoned military base. Dr. John "Doc" Mitchell, a former cop and recovering alcoholic, established the rehab center as a way of dealing with his problems. Hendricks stays in Wyoming to ensure Malloy will be okay.  Malloy meets several other officers who are patients in the clinic, including Peter Noah, an arrogant and paranoid ex-SWAT officer, Frank Slater, a cynical, opinionated British police officer, Willie Jones, a religious homicide detective, Jaworski, an alcoholic narcotics cop who attempted suicide, Lopez, a foul-mouthed LAPD officer, and McKenzie, an elderly member of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] who saw his partner get killed. He meets several staff members, including Doc's assistant and mechanic Hank and compassionate resident psychiatrist and nurse Jenny Munroe, with whom Malloy develops a bond.  A blizzard seals everyone in the rehab center with no outside communication. The next day, Jenny finds the body of Connor, one of the troubled patients who apparently killed himself. Jenny suspects otherwise, believing Connor would have come to her. The next morning Hank finds the body of Carl Brandon, another patient. Brandon also seems to have killed himself, but Malloy deduces otherwise.  Doc locks up the surviving patients while he reviews their files. Jenny informs Doc that Jack Bennett, an orderly who was a former patient in the clinic, is missing along with a snowmobile. Malloy convinces Jenny to lock her room. After Doc is killed by a man wielding an axe, everyone but Malloy and Jenny think Jack is the killer. Malloy opens the safe and hands the surviving cops their sidearms. Hendricks finds a body in a frozen lake, and learns from the owner of a nearby fishing shop that the victim was a cop. Hendricks and the owner of the shop return to the clinic.  Hank, the clinic's cook Manny, and helper Gilbert, volunteer to drive through the blizzard in a pickup truck to get outside help. Malloy wants Jenny to leave as well, but she refuses. While driving away, Hank sees something in front of him and veers away from it. The truck slides off the icy road, crashing into a tree at the bottom of a ravine. Malloy and Jenny hear the crash, and Malloy hands a gun to Jenny before investigating. Malloy finds Manny murdered after he survived the crash. Malloy also finds Jack's body, the object that caused Hank to crash the truck. Malloy is startled by Gilbert approaching behind him. Gilbert, alive but scared, flees while Malloy rushes back to the clinic.  McKenzie, who is patrolling the old execution chamber, finds the machine activated. The killer electrocutes McKenzie, deactivating the building's power and heating system. Malloy forces everyone except Jenny to their cells as he realizes one of the cops is a killer impersonating a patient. Suspecting the man responsible is Mary's killer, Malloy exams Connor's body in the kitchen. Remembering the killer saying, "I see you, but you don't see me", Malloy looks inside Connor's eyelids and finds "I" on one eyelid and "CU" on the other. As Malloy and Jenny return to the cells, Hank, thinking Malloy might be the killer, knocks him out. He locks Malloy in Slater's cell and releases everyone else.  Malloy finds a vent, but as he uses a matchbook from Slater to light the cell, Malloy learns it came from a Seattle restaurant frequently visited by cops and Malloy himself, which reveals Slater as the killer as he watches policemen to learn about their habits and Malloy's. Malloy escapes the cell and finds the missing badges above Slater's room, which he collects as trophies. After establishing his innocence, Malloy has Jones and Lopez conduct patrol while Jaworski stays with Jenny in the patient room. Malloy heads into the tunnels beneath the facility.  Hank, Noah, and Slater go to the tunnels to retrieve logs for heating, with the other two unaware that Slater is the killer.  Slater convinces them to split up before killing each of them. As Malloy patrols the tunnels, Slater taunts him over a CB radio and lures Malloy to Noah's hanged body where he finds the other radio. Slater is about to leave the clinic, but hears Jenny calling out Malloy's name. Malloy learns that Slater is at the tunnel's trapdoor and rushes to save Jenny.  Outside the installation, Hendricks and the fishing shop owner find Gilbert alive and bring him inside the snowcat before arriving at the rehab center. Hendricks sees Jenny's footprints and follows them. Jenny runs to a nearby [[quansit hut]], hiding from Slater. Malloy arrives, telling Jenny to stay inside the shed. Slater catches Hendricks before Malloy catches him from behind. Slater jumps into the shed and knocks Jenny out and wounds Hendricks. Malloy and Slater confront each other, with Malloy ultimately killing Slater.  Jenny regains consciousness and helps the wounded Hendricks walk to the clinic with Malloy, whose left arm was stabbed during the fight, following them. Malloy stops for the moment and puts the ring he was planning to propose to Mary with on a tree branch before walking away from it.

Van Meter is Keough and Perry's superior who often has his subordinates fabricate stories and evidence. It is revealed that Perry killed the man that the Gun Board thinks Keough killed, meaning Perry and Keough perjured themselves. Later that night Van Meter goes to Orchard and Sidwell's house and takes the money the two stole from the safe, indicating that the two work for him. That night Keough is shown having sex with a woman who is also a police officer; they do not reveal their surnames to one another.  Van Meter tells Perry and Keough to investigate the convenience store robbery. Their investigation ends with them finding Orchard and Sidwell; when this is brought to Van Meter, he tells them to pin it on someone else and provides a false alibi for Orchard and Sidwell. Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Arthur Holland finds Perry's actions suspicious and also does not believe Keough killed the man he was charged with killing at the Gun Board hearing. He asks his assistant, Sergeant Beth Williamson, to help him. When Williamson is pulling files on Perry and Keough, she discovers the identity of her lover to be Keough.  That night, after obtaining a search warrant with underhanded techniques, a [[SWAT]] team raids the house of the ex-cons who are to be the fall guys.

Van Meter decides he wants Perry killed and calls Orchard and Sidwell to do the job.  Van Meter calls Perry and tells him that there is a witness at the address 12657 Juliet who has to be eliminated. Perry initially balks at this proposal, but finally accepts, and the call ends. Perry runs the address, and learns it is the address of Orchard and Sidwell. Shocked at this revelation, Perry ultimately decides to arm himself and head out to the address anyway, perhaps to kill Orchard and Sidwell.  Believing that Perry was sent by Van Meter to Orchard and Sidwell, Keough and Williamson also drive to 12657 Juliet. Turning a corner near Orchard and Sidwell's house, Perry sees Keough and Williamson and all three stop. This pause is only broken as Keough is killed by Orchard and Sidwell firing from the rooftop. Before dying, Keough tells Perry that he has ratted him out. Infuriated, Williamson blames Perry for what happened. Perry calls in the incident, hesitating briefly before stating his intention of pursuing Orchard and Sidwell.  As they are driving, Sidwell is dragged out of his car and beaten to death by rioters while Orchard is captured by Perry. Perry then heads to the police academy promotions ceremony, where he confesses about the corruption and implicates Van Meter. Van Meter attempts to discredit Perry, but ultimately fails as Perry volunteers himself to be arrested, and Holland orders an officer to do so. After the ceremony is adjourned, Perry and Holland chat briefly; Perry is well aware he will be incarcerated, and asks Holland to help him avoid the rougher prisons. Holland says he will see what he can do.  
The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys
 Set in the early 1970s in a suburban town in the [[Southern United States]], the film follows the lives of protagonist Francis Doyle, and three of his friends, Tim Sullivan, Wade Scalisi and Joey Anderson. The four boys all attend a private Catholic school named [[Agatha of Sicily|St. Agatha's]], which they detest. The boys rebel by smoking [[Marijuana|pot]], [[Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|drinking]], obsessing over girls, listening to [[hard rock]] music and playing pranks on their teachers, such as stealing their school's statue of St. Agatha and keeping it in their clubhouse. The four friends dedicate much of their time to a comic book of their own creation titled ''The Atomic Trinity'' in order to escape the monotony and avoid the difficulties in their own lives.  After receiving a love note from Francis, which was actually written by Tim, Margie Flynn becomes a major presence and weaves her way into the lives of these four friends. She and Francis have an obvious connection that progresses into much more. At times, Francis must choose between his friends and Margie, which causes the group of friends to fall apart. The boys' lives are also translated into segments of animation based on the characters of ''The Atomic Trinity'': Brakken, The Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Major Screw; Nunzilla, based on their peglegged, overly repressive Catholic school teacher Sister Assumpta; and Sorcerella, based on Margie Flynn.  After a school field trip to the zoo, Tim and Francis have the idea of playing another prank on Sister Assumpta. They decide to drug the cougar at the local zoo and then transport it to Sister Assumpta's office to scare her. When they learn how serious Tim and Francis are, the other half of the ''Atomic Trinity'' wimp out, which leaves an unlikely group of friends consisting of Margie, Tim and Francis. Francis soon learns that Margie had been [[Sibling abuse#Sexual abuse|sexually assaulted by her own brother]]. During gym class, Donny, Margie's older brother, bullies Tim during class. Tim, out of pressure and his own impulsive nature, insults Donny for molesting his own sister. He regrets telling Donny, who beats him up, and then tells Francis who becomes angry with him. Donny takes Tim and Francis's comic, ''The Atomic Trinity'', and gives it to the nun. The violent, blasphemous and inappropriate drawings in the notebook cause Tim and Francis to be suspended, pending expulsion from the school.  In an act of final retribution, Tim, Francis, Wade and Joey attempt to steal a cougar to place inside the school to cover up a wrecking of the school they did that night. At the zoo, a makeshift [[tranquilizer]] created from several narcotic drugs is used to put the cougar to sleep. The other three boys go down to the gate to retrieve the cougar in a cage, while Tim impulsively climbs over the fence into the cougar's den. He checks to see if the cougar is alive, and happily replies that it is. When the other boys reach the gate to retrieve the cougar, another cougar leaps at Tim, mauling him to death. At Tim's funeral, Francis quotes the poem "[[The Tyger]]" by [[William Blake]], whom Sister Assumpta earlier condemned as a "dangerous thinker". Francis places the book at the stolen statue of St. Agatha in their hideout, and starts a new comic series dedicated entirely to the character based on Tim, ''Skeleton Boy''.

Dark Side of the Moon (film)
  The first part tells in an apparently neutral way the inception of the [[NASA]]'s lunar program, emphasizing the issues related to its funding and the necessary public support to the program. NASA regards Stanley Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as the prototype of the show that the space program needs to be in order to gain this support, leading them to design the spacesuits and vessels in a "Hollywood"  fashion and even to hire 700 Hollywood technicians, making all of Hollywood stop working on other projects. But the outcome of [[Apollo 11]] is disappointing: although the landing is successful, [[Neil Armstrong]] makes a fool of himself and not a single shot of the moonwalk is usable.    The incapability of shooting images on the moon had been anticipated by [[Richard Nixon]] and his staff who decided to fake the pictures on the moon, using the set of ''2001'' that was still available in [[London]]. Kubrick had refused, then accepted and finally directed the fake footage himself, appalled by the lack of skills of the CIA crew. The [[KGB]] soon realized that "the whole thing was a hoax", that Apollo 11 had indeed landed but it was physically impossible to make pictures in the lunar environment. Besides, they had found a photo showing a portrait of Kubrick lying on the false lunar soil in the studio.    After the success of the fake footage, Nixon gets scared that the truth might be discovered, and in a drunken state asks CIA Colonel [[North by Northwest|George Kaplan]] to dispose of the whole film crew. The next morning he tries to cancel the order, but it is too late: meanwhile Kaplan has gone mad, sent his killers and disappeared. The death squad goes to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] where the film crew has sought refuge, but is immediately caught by the villagers: despite a perfect accent and disguise, their commanding officer was [[African Americans|black]]. Nixon reacts by sending 150,000 men and a half of the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] to find and kill the four members of the crew. They fail, and the CIA takes over and assassinates all but one of them, who takes shelter in a [[yeshiva]] in [[Brooklyn]] where he dies ten years later. Only Kubrick is spared.    Five years after Apollo 11, Kubrick calls NASA to borrow the top-secret wide-aperture [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] lens he needs to make ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''. As a result, Nixon's [[Gerald Ford|successor]] decides to get rid of him as the last witness of the conspiracy. Informed of the threat to his life, Kubrick locks himself up in his home and never leaves it until his death.    As a conclusion, General [[Vernon A. Walters|Vernon Walters]] accepts to reveal the secret of Kubrick's demise, but unexpectedly dies the next evening: he has accepted to break the CIA rule of silence and anonymity.    It is finally revealed that this is a mockumentary as the end credits roll over a montage of [[blooper]] reels, with the main participants laughing over their lines or over their inability to remember them.  
Darkness (2002 film)
 Forty years after an unfinished [[occult]] [[ritual]] resulted in the disappearance of six young children, an American family has moved into a never-before inhabited house in Spain. The mother, Maria (Olin), wants to get the place in order, while the father, Mark (Glen), goes to work, and their children, teenager Regina (Paquin) and her younger brother Paul (Enquist), try to settle into their daily routines.  It helps that Mark's doctor-father, Albert Rua (Giannini) has furnished them with their residence and is nearby, especially when Mark begins to suffer from seizures again due to the progression of his [[Huntington's disease]], which also causes him to become increasingly mentally unstable. Regina is not only worried about him, but also Paul who is now scared of the dark for the first time. The young boy has reason for that, however, as there seems to be some sort of supernatural entity beneath his bed. Furthermore, there are instances when ghostly figures of children are seen standing in the shadow and darkness, watching the family.  As Paul becomes more scared and their father continues to mentally deteriorate, Regina eventually figures out it must have something to do with their home where the power is lost every day. With the help of her new friend, Carlos (Martinez), the two eventually meet the man, Villalobos (Reixach), who designed the house, and learn that it was built for a supernatural ritual requiring the [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of seven children (each sacrificed by "hands that love them") to coincide with an [[eclipse]] that only occurs every forty years. With the next one quickly approaching, and now armed with the knowledge that the earlier occult ritual needs one more death to be completed, Regina races to make sure that Paul is not the final victim.   Stopping first at her grandfather Albert's house to warn him as well, Regina finds out that her grandfather is, in fact, a member of the cult which has been performing these [[Satanism|satanic]] rituals. Her grandfather explains that in the ritual forty years ago, there actually ''were'' seven children in the original ritual, the seventh child being none other than Regina's father, Mark. Albert did not sacrifice his son because at the last minute he realized that he did ''not'' love Mark. Waiting 40 years he has brought Mark and his family to the house with the intention of completing the ritual during this eclipse. Regina also discovers the target is not Paul but still Mark, who is to be sacrificed by "hands that love him."   Armed with this knowledge, Regina races back to her home to find her father in the midst of another attack, choking on pills as the eclipse begins. Maria tries to perform a [[tracheotomy]] on him, but is unable to bring herself to make the cut. Regina does instead, but Mark bleeds out and dies when the supernatural forces within the house hide the tube needed to complete the procedure. Since Regina genuinely loved Mark, the ritual is finally complete. The darkness then takes the form of Regina and Paul, convincing their mother to turn off the lights. The darkness kills Maria, and then takes the form of Regina's friend Carlos, who picks them up in his car; shortly after they leave, the real Carlos arrives at the house, and is likely killed. The movie ends as Carlos' [[doppelgÃ¤nger]] drives Regina and Paul into a dark tunnel, implying their doom.  
Dark Water (2002 film)
 Yoshimi Matsubara, in the midst of a [[divorce]] mediation, rents a run-down apartment with her daughter, Ikuko. She enrolls Ikuko in a nearby [[kindergarten]] and lands a job as a [[proofreader]], a job she held before she was married, but this time in a small publishing company with modest pay. The ceiling of their apartment has a leak that worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the [[building superintendent]] but he does nothing to fix the leak. When she tries to contact the apartment above, she gets no answer. However, as she leaves, she catches the glimpse of a mysterious long-haired girl peering out of the doorway, but upon returning, sees no sign of her.  Strange events recur: a red bag with a bunny logo reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets more glimpses of the mysterious girl around the complex. Yoshimi becomes regularly late in picking up Ikuko from school, and it stresses her more when her ex-husband tries to take Ikuko. Several of the incidents remind her of the time she was abandoned as a child, and she still remains scarred from the situation. During a game of hide-and-seek, Ikuko sees the long-haired girl in a yellow raincoat, and faints and becomes seriously ill. The leak gets even worse. Yoshimi discovers a flyer showing a missing girl named Mitsuko Kawai, and that she had attended the same kindergarten as Ikuko but had disappeared about a year ago. Mitsuko had worn a yellow raincoat and carried the red bag. Yoshimi then discovers the apartment upstairs is indeed Mitsuko's former apartment.  One day, Ikuko goes missing and Yoshimi finds her in the apartment upstairs. With the door now unlocked, the water has been constantly running out of the faucets and flooding the entire place. Yoshimi decides up pack up her belongings, but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position greatly in her divorce proceedings. Her lawyer shows the superintendent the upstairs room, and the superintendent agrees to finally renovate the apartment, and after the ceiling is patched, things seem to return to normal. But Yoshimi then finds that the red bag has reappeared, this time in Ikuko's school bag. She heads to the roof of the building, and is drawn to a [[water tank]]. She notices that it was last inspected â and thus opened â over a year ago, on the same day Mitsuko was last reported seen. She comes to the horrific realization via a vision that Mitsuko had fallen into the tank while trying to retrieve her red bag, and had thus drowned. Meanwhile, Ikuko, left alone in the apartment, attempts to turn off the bath tap, which has started to spurt filthy water. Mitsuko's spirit emerges from the flooded bathtub and attempts to drown her.  Yoshimi finds Ikuko unconscious on the bathroom floor. Intending to escape, she rushes into the elevator, apparently fleeing from the apparition of Mitsuko. But as the elevator door closes, she sees that the figure pursuing her is in fact her own daughter â and realizes she is carrying Mitsuko, who claims Yoshimi as her mother in a torrent of water. Yoshimi realizes that Mitsuko won't let her go and with Ikuko looking on in tears, Yoshimi sacrifices herself by staying in the elevator and pretending to be Mitsuko's mother to appease her spirit. The elevator ascends and Ikuko follows, but when the doors open, a flood of murky brown water rushes out and nobody emerges.  Ten years later, Ikuko, now in high school, revisits the now-abandoned block. She notices that her old apartment looks oddly clean and seems occupied. She then sees her mother, looking exactly as she did that fateful night, and they have a conversation. Her mother affirms that as long as Ikuko is all right, she is happy. Ikuko pleads to live with her mother, whom she thinks is alive, and though Yoshimi smiles, she tells Ikuko that it would be impossible and apologizes that they cannot be together. Sensing someone behind her, Ikuko turns, but sees no one (the audience though sees Mitsuko). When she turns back, Yoshimi has also disappeared. As she leaves, Ikuko realizes that her mother's spirit has been watching over her.  
Daughter from Danang
 Heidi Neville Bub was born on December 10, 1968 in [[Danang]] as Mai Thi Hiep. Her mother, Mai Thi Kim, already had three children and was estranged from her husband Do Huu Vinh, who had left her to fight with the [[Viet Cong]]. She was working at an American military base where she met Heidi's father, an American serviceman. He has had no contact with her since Heidi's birth. When the [[North Vietnam]]ese army came closer to Danang, Mai Thi Kim feared for Heidi's safety due to rumors of retaliation against mixed-race children. At the age of six, Heidi was sent to the [[United States]] and placed in an orphanage run by the [[Holt International Children's Services|Holt Adoption Agency]].  Heidi was soon adopted by Ann Neville, a single and strictly religious American woman who renamed her Heidi. They spent a year in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] before permanently settling in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]]. <ref name="WGBH">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/daughter/peopleevents/p_heidi.html People and Events: Biography of Heidi Bub] - [[WGBH-TV]], [[Boston]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Experience]]'' documentary series.</ref>   Heidi's adoptive mother told her that her parents had died in the war, and not to tell anyone she'd been born out of wedlock. She was also instructed to tell people she had been born in the US and not Vietnam, and that she was fully white and not biracial <ref>[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.china/2009-09/msg00036.html</ref>. As Heidi got older, her mother did not want her to date or have friends. She considered Heidi's leaving for college a betrayal and ungratefulness. During the summer before Heidi's sophomore year of college, Heidi returned home to find that her mother had packed up all of her belongings. She told Heidi to never come back and that she no longer had a daughter. It is revealed at the start of the documentary that Heidi is still estranged from her mother. <ref>[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.china/2009-09/msg00036.html]</ref>  Heidi is married and has two young daughters of her own, but the rejection from her adoptive mother is still painful. Heidi hopes that meeting her biological mother might help heal that pain. Heidi contacts the Holt Adoption Agency, and learns that her biological mother, Mai Thi Kim, sent them a letter in 1991 asking about Heidi's whereabouts.<ref name="WGBH"/> The agency had forwarded this information to Heidi's mother, but she never informed Heidi. Now that she knows her biological mother was trying to find her, Heidi decides to return to Vietnam, assisted by journalist Tran Tuong Nhu.  Upon meeting, Mai Thi and Heidi hug and cry tears of joy, but this reunion soon gives way to [[culture shock]]. Heidi has no prior knowledge of Vietnamese customs, food, language or culture. Mai Thi expects to spend every moment with Heidi, even sleeping beside her at night. Her other family members constantly want to touch or hug her. This rattles Heidi, as she grew up in a home with little affection. She is not used to the crowded conditions in the markets where she shops with Mai Thi. The constant invasion of her personal space makes Heidi feel suffocated and overwhelmed.   She also discovers that her family lives in abject poverty, and they have been taking care of Mai Thi for years. Mai Thi tells Heidi that she wants to live the rest of her life in America with her. Heidi's half-brother is the head of the family, and he informs her that it is now her turn to care for their mother. Heidi is blindsided by this request, as she didn't even know the family existed until a few months before. Heidi replies that taking Mai Thi to America is not feasible.  Her half-brother tells her that if she cannot take Mai Thi with her, then she is expected to send them money regularly. Heidi is shocked and walks out of their home in tears. Given the cultural differences, her family does not understand why the requests upset her, and one relative remarks that Heidi cries too much. Heidi's guide explains to her that it is common for most Vietnamese nationals who move to America to provide money for their families remaining in Vietnam. Heidi maintains that she does not really know her Vietnamese family, and feels she is being exploited. She had expected a family reunion and answers to her past, but instead thinks her family is only interested in her financial support. She decides to return to America ahead of schedule, feeling more emotional conflict than ever before.  Months after Heidi's visit, she says she occasionally gets letters from her family in Vietnam, but they are all requests for money. She has not replied to their letters.   As of mid-2012, Heidi and Mai Thi have not met again since her initial visit. She has chosen not to keep in touch with her Vietnamese family, since doing so brings her too much pain.<ref name="WGBH"/><ref>Rosenberg, Elinor B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu90JIcPIqQC&printsec=frontcover ''The Adoption Life Cycle : the children and their families through the years''], New York : Free Press ; Toronto : Maxwell Macmillan Canada ; New York : Maxwell Macmillan International, 1992. . University of Michigan Professor, Rosenberg, who is a psychiatric social worker, was interviewed by ''[[USA Today]]'' newspaper on March 13, 2003 about this film and said: "The outcomes of reunions with birth parents vary widely. Bub's quest might have been doomed from the start. Adults who dislike their adoptive parents tend to fare poorly with reunions. They often seek substitute parents. They want to be parented again, this time by their fantasy birth parent. But in most cases, birth parents have gone on with their own lives and aren't interested in trying to raise a child again. It's often difficult to reunite across vastly different cultures.[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2003-03-18-danang_x.htm]</ref><ref></ref>  
Dawg (film)
 Douglas "Dawg" Munford ([[Denis Leary]]) is the ultimate womanizer: he is selfish, rude and totally uncaring about what a woman thinks after they have sex. He arrives too late for his grandmother's funeral, but finds that she has left him a million dollars subject to one condition.  As explained by estate executor Anna Lockhart ([[Elizabeth Hurley]]), Douglas must contact at least a dozen of the scores of women he has seduced and left during his lifetime and beg for their forgiveness. Reluctantly, Dawg sets out on his odyssey which takes him, and the lawyer, to venues throughout [[California]]. Later, he falls for Anna.  
Deathwatch (2002 film)
  During the prologue, a squad of [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers is seen assaulting a German trench at night during [[World War I]]. Sergeant David Tate ([[Hugo Speer]]) is caught in the barbed wire and calls out to Private Charlie Shakespeare ([[Jamie Bell]]), a 16-year-old member of the squad, to rescue him from the entanglement. Shakespeare, however, has completely broken down from fear due to the chaos around him, and runs off into the fighting, only to be seemingly buried by shellfire moments later.  The next morning, the squad finds itself slowly advancing through a dense mist which, contrary to their fear, is not a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]]. As they emerge from it, they come across a complex, maze-like network of [[German Empire|German]] trenches, where they find an apparently besieged handful of terrified German soldiers, who at first ignore the cries of Private Willie McNess ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]) to surrender in apparent terror of something else further down the trenches. Private Thomas Quinn ([[Andy Serkis]]) shoots the first and attempts to shoot the second, but McNess stops him and the German stumbles down the trench. The third, Friedrich ([[Torben Liebrecht]]), surrenders. Convinced that they have broken through the enemy lines, the soldiers decide to secure the trenches. Doing so, they explore them and find ominous signs that something there has gone very wrong: rotting bodies litter the ground, apparently victims of in-fighting among the Germans due to barbed wire and German bayonets sticking out of many. While detonating charges to close off some passages, they hear a demon-like growl, and as they walk away they fail to notice vast amounts of blood pouring from the mud.   Later, while Private Jack Hawkstone ([[Hans Matheson]]) is exploring more of the trench, he is called away by the other soldiers. As he turns to leave, he notices a body covered in mud, leaning against the wall of the trench. It turns out to be the second German, who had escaped from their initial encounter. As Hawkstone calls for help, the German lunges at him with a makeshift weapon and Hawkstone is forced to shoot him, wounding him and resulting in a fistfight between the two in the mud. During the skirmish, Private Barry Starinski ([[Kris Marshall]]) runs up and shoots the German, who falls to his knees. Quinn taunts and then executes him with a pistol round to the skull.  The isolation and sinister nature of the trenches soon starts to exact a toll on the British.  Private Colin Chevasse ([[Ruaidhri Conroy]]) is slowly dying from a spinal injury he received during the prologue, and the German radio set they found cuts out after its first legible message, denying them any means to call for support. Angry and fearful of the strange environment, they vent their rage upon the German prisoner, who is abused by everyone except Shakespeare, who becomes disgusted by the behavior, and Chevasse, who is too injured to move. During their first night, Starinski, who has isolated himself in a secluded area of the trench and is masturbating to pornographic images he looted from the German dead, is distracted by strange sounds and led deeper into the trenches, where he finds three German corpses wrapped in barbed wire in a standing position. As he shouts to alert the others of the scene, one of the corpses suddenly comes to life and ambushes him, his screams audible to the others. By the time they reach him, they are too late, with Shakespeare finding Starinski's corpse lashed to the wall of the trench with barbed wire. Suspecting that German troops hiding in the dugouts are responsible, the men violently interrogate the prisoner. Shakespeare manages to translate his ramblings from French, saying that they will turn on each other and that there's "evil" in the trenches.  Later that night, Captain Bramwell Jennings ([[Laurence Fox]]), the commander of the battered company, begins to hear the sounds of artillery and an infantry attack, despite the fact that no one is in the area. In a panic, he stumbles through the trenches in search of Sergeant Tate, who has sent Hawkstone searching for the captain, finally stumbling into the central area of the trench, where the squad has piled the German dead into a massive mound. His nerves on edge, he turns and mistakenly shoots Hawkstone when he hears him coming from behind. Despite the Captain's manslaughter, Tate remains fiercely devoted to his orders and refuses to abandon the trench. That same day, the men, believing the attacks and the strange events to be perpetrated by Germans still hiding in the trench, rig and collapse sections of the trench with explosives to give them a more defensible position.  The next night, more strange noises are heard, and the men's morale and discipline deteriorates even further, with Quinn reaching near-homicidal insanity. After McNess is pursued by an eerie red mist and completely drenched in blood and fear, he climbs out of the trenches and runs into no-man's land, but is shot in the leg by Private Anthony Bradford ([[Hugh O'Conor]]). A rescue attempt is made by Corporal "Doc" Fairweather ([[Matthew Rhys]]), the company medic, but McNess, crawling across the ground, is pursued by a moving mud mound that drags him underground. Meanwhile, Bradford, who has been found by Shakespeare, is convinced that both he and the trenches are possessed by death. Convinced that he will kill others, he asks Shakespeare to shoot him. When the latter refuses, Bradford runs off.  In the morning, Quinn, having finally lost his sanity, crucifies the German prisoner, Friedrich, on a wooden beam in no-man's land, binding his arms and legs with barbed wire. He then proceeds to beat him with his spiked club,  daring any Germans there might be to shoot him and save their comrade. In the trench, Jennings, appearing to have also lost touch with reality, suddenly decides he wants a company inspection, and relieves Tate of duty when he refuses to comply. Fearing for the outcome of the standoff, both Shakespeare and Fairweather comply with the order, saving Tate from discipline. In the meantime, Jennings notices Friedrich screaming and moves off, going after Quinn. Apparently oblivious to Quinn's madness, he demands that he fall in for the inspection, but Quinn, already in a murderous frenzy, forces Jennings to his knees. Tate moves into no man's land and tries to stop him, and as he does so, Quinn tells Jennings to "make his peace", and stabs him to death with a knife. Tate attacks Quinn, and during the fight, Tate gets tangled in the barbed wire. Shakespeare rushes out of the trench to try and save Tate, but is too late, and Quinn kills Tate with the club. Shakespeare confronts him with his rifle raised, though he cannot bring himself to shoot him. Quinn taunts Shakespeare and, when he refuses to kill him, berates him as a coward. Shakespeare shouts that he at least isn't a murderer, to which Quinn replies that murder is all that soldiers do. Quinn raises the club and starts towards Shakespeare, but is stopped by living strands of barbed wire that rise up from the dirt and begin to wrap around and skewer him. Shakespeare then shoots Quinn, ending his torment, before cutting Friedrich loose.  Back in the trench, Shakespeare arms Friedrich, who has been crippled by Quinn's torture, with a rifle to defend himself. He then runs off, looking for Fairweather. Finding the paralysed Chevasse, now pale and pestered by flies, he discovers that he appears to be able to move his legs again. However, when Shakespeare lifts up the blanket that was covering him, he finds, to their horror, that rats have been eating Chevasse's legs. Horrified, Chevasse begins to scream uncontrollably, forcing Shakespeare to shoot him in the head to put him out of his misery. Shakespeare runs off again and finds the two remaining soldiers, Bradford and Fairweather. Bradford has tied Fairweather up with barbed wire, and both men plead Shakespeare to kill Bradford. Shakespeare refuses, and Bradford shoots Fairweather in the head. Shakespeare finally gives in and bayonets Bradford in the stomach before shooting him.  At that point, the soil under the German dead starts to cave in, while barbed wire blocks off every passage. Shakespeare tries to escape, but he stumbles and is sucked down into the darkness. He wakes up in a dark cave filled with corpses, at the end of which he finds living versions of the whole group while they were eating just the other night, including himself. He shouts defiantly that he isn't dead and runs off, reaching the surface of the trenches. Friedrich, now capable of walking and in perfect health, appears and points his rifle at him. Shakespeare, exasperated by the apparent betrayal, shouts in both English and French that he tried to help him. Friedrich acknowledges, in perfect English, that Shakespeare was indeed the only one who helped him, and, pointing to a ladder leading up into no-man's land, tells him that it is why he is free to go. Shakespeare asks what is out there, but Friedrich has already disappeared. Shakespeare climbs out of the trench and leaves to an unknown fate, disappearing into the mist.   Some time later, another team of British soldiers arrives at the trench. Seeing Friedrich sitting idly, they shout at him to surrender, to which he complies, lifting his hands. He makes an ominous stare before the screen fades.  
Death to Smoochy
 Randolph Smiley is the host of "The Rainbow Randolph Show", a popular children's TV show. Despite his friendly appearance on-stage, off-stage he is an arrogant and corrupt businessman who accepts bribes from parents who want to put their kids on his show. After an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sting exposes him, Randolph is fired and his show is cancelled. He is replaced with the "squeaky clean" Sheldon Mopes and his character, Smoochy the Rhino. Mopes is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality children's entertainment, and despite doubts from his hardened producer Nora Wells, his show quickly becomes tremendously popular. Meanwhile, Randolph turns to his former associate Marion Stokes and pleads to help him get his job back, but Stokes refuses. After several failed attempts to get Mopes fired, Randolph turns to his former partner Angelo Pike and asks if he can stay at his apartment, to which Angelo reluctantly agrees.  Mopes quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to Nora and with the help of his new agent Burke Bennett, Mopes renegotiates his contract and is named executive producer. [[Irish mob]] boss Tommy Cotter approaches Mopes and asks him to create a spot on his show for her cousin Spinner Dunn, a former boxer whose numerous head injuries have left him with [[brain damage]]. Mopes reluctantly adds Spinner to the show, first as a cowbell-wielding game warden, and later on as Smoochy's cousin Moochy.  Mopes is horrified to learn that Burke has signed him up to star in a Smoochy ice show, as he fears that the event will exploit children. Burke and Merv Green, the head of the corrupt charity running the ice show, warn Mopes not to back out of the event but he does so anyway. Soon afterward, a disguised Randolph tricks Mopes into performing a Smoochy act at a neo-Nazi rally. Mopes is branded a racist and loses his job and show, and Nora refuses to help him. However, when Randolph barges into Nora's apartment and tries to convince her to help him get his job back, he accidentally reveals that he set Mopes up. Tommy and her crew then barge into Angelo's apartment and force Randolph to confess that he tricked Mopes. As a result, Mopes' show is restored and Randolph is dubbed the most hated man in America by the media. To make matters worse, a fed up Angelo kicks Randolph out of his house. After telling him that his show is back on the air, Nora kisses Mopes and has sex with him.  Mopes then decides to perform in an ice show, but without the corrupt charities. Burke and Green retaliate by plotting to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming. Their plan backfires when, during a rehearsal, Green's men mistake Spinner in his Moochy costume for Mopes and murder him. When Tommy gets word of this, she retaliates by killing Green and his men. Meanwhile, Randolph corners Mopes and Nora in their penthouse and reveals to Mopes that Nora has had affairs with numerous children's show hosts, including Randolph himself. Mopes is hurt by this, but Nora insists that she has genuine feelings for him. They manage to calm Randolph down and discover that he genuinely misses entertaining children. Mopes offers to let him stay in the penthouse until he recovers.  Burke and Stokes decide to partner up after hearing of Green's death. They hire Buggy Ding Dong, another former kid show host, to assassinate Mopes during his ice show. Buggy steals a backstage pass to get inside, but before he can shoot Mopes he is confronted by Randolph. They struggle for the rifle until Buggy falls to his death in the ice rink. After Mopes realizes that Burke and Stokes set him up, he pulls a gun and threatens to kill Burke. Tommy and her men arrive and persuade him not to forfeit his high ideals. Tommy decides to take care of Burke and Stokes in her own way, Mopes and Nora share a kiss in Times Square, and Smoochy and Randolph launch a new show together.

Demon Under Glass
 Someone has been killing women in LA and leaving the bodies drained of blood.   The police planned a sting using a female officer, Detective Gwen Taylor ([[Denise Alessandria Hurd]]) however the killer was instead intercepted and captured by a group calling itself The Delphi Project.  The Delphi Project is a secret government group intent on capturing and studying a live vampire and as it turns out the killer that they are after is actually a thousand year old vampire going by the name Simon Molinar ([[Jason Carter (actor)|Jason Carter]]).  During the attempted capture Dr. Hirsch ([[James Kiberd]]) is killed by the vampire.  A replacement doctor, Dr. Joe McKay ([[Garett Maggart]]) takes his place in the group. Out of the entire group Dr. Joe McKay is the first to treat the vampire like a person and not just as something to be studied.  The group sets about a series of tests and experiments to study the vampire.  As the experiments become crueler Dr. Joe McKay is left to wonder who is the true monster?  The vampire or the very people he works for?  Unbeknownst to Dr. Mckay is that one of his superiors, Dr. Bassett ([[Jack Donner]]) has found out that Dr. McKay is one of the rare few who has the genetic predisposition to being able to be turned into a vampire. Dr. Bassett (without the rest of the team's knowledge) even provides Simon Molinar with a live victim.  Dr. Bassett, himself,  discarded the body.  When the body is found this gains the attention of the local police.  The group decides to destroy Simon Molinar once their experiments are finished but Dr. Bassett thinks it might be best to create a new vampire, one that has never killed before, to replace the vampire they intend to destroy.  Bassett locked Dr. McKay in a room with the vampire but Simon escaped instead of turning Dr. McKay into a vampire.  During his escape Simon ripped the [[caduceus]] necklace from Dr. McKay's neck. It's a necklace that Dr. McKay never takes off and wore as a sign of healing and his Hippocratic oath.  Simon Molinar stole this as a memento because of his growing fondness for Dr. McKay despite having been his prisoner.  
Demonlover
 Diane de Monx (Nielsen) is an executive trying to negotiate a deal to acquire the rights to the productions of a Japanese [[anime]] studio, which will soon include three-dimensional [[hentai]], for the Volf Corporation.  To facilitate the acquisition, she eliminates her superior, Karen (Dominique Reymond), and assumes control of her portfolio, her business partner HervÃ© (Berling), and her assistant Elise (Sevigny).  Elise, however, despises Diane and works to frustrate her negotiations at every opportunity. Diane and HervÃ© travel to Japan to close the deal, and they enjoy a sexual flirtation which is unfulfilled at that time and seem to grow to like one another.  Having acquired the rights, the Volf Corporation attempts to enter into a deal for distribution with an American Internet company called Demonlover, represented by Elaine Si Gibril (Gershon). Diane, however, has actually been a spy all along for Demonlover's main competition, Mangatronics, meeting with a mysterious handler on occasion to pass along information on the Demonlover deal. Meanwhile, Diane discovers that Elaine's company is a front for a website called the Hellfire Club, an [[interactive]] torture web site dealing with extreme [[sadomasochism]] broadcast in [[Real-time (media)|real-time]]. When confronted with these charges, Demonlover praises Hellfire Club but claims no ties to it whatsoever.  In order to seal the deal for Mangatronics, Diane is sent by her handler to steal data from the computer in Elaine's hotel room. Before Diane can download the information, Elaine enters the hotel room and notices Diane's presence. They struggle, eventually culminating in the suffocation of Elaine. Diane checks to see if she can make an escape, but then discovers Elaine's body is missing. Elaine, who was not dead, uses the last of her strength to club Diane over the head. Diane is knocked unconscious, and Elaine passes out due to blood loss sustained from injuries in the struggle. When Diane awakens, she is in Elaine's hotel room, and everything is completely cleaned up. There is no evidence of a murder, burglary, or struggle.  At this point, the narrative structure of the film more or less breaks down, although we do learn a great deal more about the characters. It is revealed that Demonlover does indeed own the Hellfire Club. It is also revealed that Elise, who it is suggested is a spy for Demonlover, actually works for HervÃ©, who is also likely associated with Demonlover and by extension the Hellfire Club. HervÃ© admits as much on a date with Diane later in the film. The two become intimate in bed, but HervÃ© goes too far and rapes Diane. However, the second time she is raped, Diane manages to reach over into her handbag, into which she had previously placed a pistol. Diane fires at HervÃ©'s temple and he dies instantly. In the end, Diane herself is forced into the Hellfire Club. She awakens in a dungeonlike room, on a mattress, dressed in a vinyl suit and with a wig. Beside the mattress there are pictures of [[Diana Rigg]] as [[Emma Peel|Mrs. Peel]] in [[The Avengers (TV series)|''The Avengers'']] (a 1960s television show, which had an episode entitled "The Hellfire Club" that was subsequently banned from American TV for the so-called "provocative" nature of Mrs. Peel's costume). Diane attempts to escape, and is almost successful. However, upon driving her getaway car she is involved in a car accident. The escape fails.  The final scene takes place in an American household. A teen-aged boy logs on to the Hellfire Club website using his father's credit card. He then fills out a detailed fantasy of what he would like done to the woman on the screen, who turns out to be Diane. He then allows it to play in the background as he does his science homework. Diane looks up at the camera in her room, helpless, but also, in a sense, suggesting an indictment of the character. The final shot pans from the computer screen â a window from which Diane looks out helplessly â to the boy's science homework â answering problems while handling a DNA model that he seems to have constructed.  
Dekada '70 (film)

In 1971 another protest took place in the [[University of the Philippines]] and Jules with his best friend Willy ([[Jhong Hilario]]) became activists that same year. Emmanuel begins to write illegal exposure and other kinds of banned literature. Jules and Wily joined a resistance movement and both of them made pledges. A large number of protesters started to demonstrate outside and they began to sing the Philippine National Anthem, "[[Lupang Hinirang]]", with raised clenched fists. The soldiers were outnumbered and the protesters were trying to push them away but they couldn't so they retreated back to their places. Just then a furious JuliÃ¡n explain to Jules and Willy and also learns that the [[habeas corpus|writ of habeas corpus]] was suspended by Marcos himself including the enforced disappearance of the student leader Charlie del Rosario. Gani explains to his father his plans to apply for a job in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] only to be overheard by Jules, who admonishes his actions as lack of patriotism for the Philippines. Gani angrily explains to him that working for the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] entitles one to a high salary with numerous benefits. JuliÃ¡n accepts the plan, thus making Gani the family's newest breadwinner. Another protest took place in the streets which was against the [[United States]], then one of the activists tied up their own comrade into a cross. Bingo pulls down a flying kite and Amanda discovers that the kite is made out of newspaper which is for activists. JuliÃ¡n also discovers that Jules is an activist and he sneaks up to his room to check his rebellious pamphlets. He convinces that when Marcos was not yet a president in the past, the government signed a treaty between the United States, and the Philippines has no other choice but to recognize that treaty.  In 1972, Marcos declared martial law on nationwide television. He also included curfew at night to round up people from going outside to be imprisoned, interrogated, and tortured to death. Gani accidentally impregnates his girlfriend Evelyn ([[Dimples Romana]]) and her sleeping in Gani's room was discovered by Amanda. Two police cars escort the Bartolomes to Evelyn's house. At the house, Evelyn's father speaks to the Bartolome couple before [[Shotgun wedding|blackmailing Gani into marrying her]].

Willy was tortured to death when he stayed out past curfew; the people who tortured him also stabbed him using their crowbars to kill him and he died some time later. Jules wanted to go to [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] to join the communist group the [[New People's Army|NPA]] for his exposure trip despite his mother's opposition.  In 1973, Evelyn gave birth to a baby girl and at the same day, Gani went to the United States after he was enlisted at the US Navy but at the same time, Evelyn went back to her mother. Emmanuel is going to the [[Bataan]] for his interview about the [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]] but JuliÃ¡n went so furious because he thinks that he started to forget the martial law and he might get caught also there were soldiers everywhere in one place. The next day, Emmanuel left for Bataan for his interview and then two days later the Bartolome family went to the beach in the afternoon.  In 1974, Jules' friend and was injured while being shot in the knee and the entire family is extracting the bullet out of his knee.

In 1976, a group of soldiers arrive at their house for the search and arrest order led by Jules, who had just become a political officer. The next day, Amanda and Bingo release two of their own pet birds to fly away for their freedom, but they know that those birds will come back to them.

He also survived from torture but instead he was electrified and made to sleep on and ice box while  in front of an electric fan while naked. At Christmas Day, Jason went home late from caroling and he learns that there was no curfew, but he wants to have a date with his girlfriend, Bernadette tomorrow but his mother told to him that he can have a date with her anytime but not during Christmas Day.  In 1977, Amanda learns that Jason was missing, she and her husband went to many police stations to look for their missing son all night long. And they learned that Jason was imprisoned for possession of marijuana but he was released for a few moments later and he was still missing.

When he came home silently, he engaged in a private talk with his father while a saddened Amanda sat down on the chair. While hearing loud cries, the young man was revealed to be Jason who was stabbed to death and Amanda faints. At his funeral, Gani recently came back from the United States to attend his wake, the three brothers went to his body crying. Bingo was still sad because he thought that he was still mad at him, he said that Bernadette wanted to introduce Jason to her parents during Christmas Day but he died.

Present day, a group of college students sail to a remote island for an annual Cinco de Mayo treasure hunt. There, every fraternity boy is handcuffed to a random sorority girl.

As they do so, they pick up a shovel, and get a bunch of underwear from a secret stash. The piÃ±ata picks up the shovel, and crushes Connie's head before turning on Larry. Lisa goes to the camp, and tells Paul and Monica about what she saw. The judges, unsure about whether they should believe her or not, go to look for Bob. While they do so, Jake and Julie see the piÃ±ata, and when Jake goes to open it, the piÃ±ata grabs him and rips out his testicles while it beats Julie to death. Paul is later killed, as Kyle and Tina reconcile. A new group of Kyle, Tina, Doug, Carmen, and Lisa now leave when they see Bob ripped in half on a tree. Doug is hanged by the piÃ±ata.

Desert Saints
 Arthur Banks ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) is an Ivy League-educated hitman for Latin American drug cartels who picks up solitary women, uses them as cover for a hit, then kills them. His trademark is a bullet with a tungsten core.  Over the years, he has become wary of the [[FBI]]'s attempts to catch him, including by use of satellite and security cameras, which leads him to mostly stay in rural desert areas when not working.  The FBI team is spearheaded by Agent George Scanlon ([[Jamey Sheridan]]), who lost five years of his career when Banks killed a witness he was guarding 15 years ago while leaving no evidence behind. In a desperation sting, Scanlon plants Agent Bennie Harper ([[Melora Walters]]), portraying a drifter, in Banks' path, and Banks picks her up for what he says will be his last job, a hit on a Mexican presidential candidate. Scanlon and Agent Donna Marbury ([[Leslie Stefanson]]), along with several support agents, follow Banks and Harper through the Southwest, but the scheme goes wrong when one of the tailing agents is spotted and caught by Banks.  Thinking quickly, the agent pretends to be Harper's jealous and abusive ex-husband, but this plan goes awry when Banks, who seems more interested in Harper than normal, kills the agent out of Harper's sight and then disposes of the body in a manner not witnessed by Harper (incineration), leaving the FBI once again with no evidence to arrest him.  That night, Banks and Harper become lovers at a remote motel. Scanlon decides to cancel the sting after the agent's death and to withdraw Harper, but Harper talks him out of it, pointing out that Banks is their only lead to his employers in the drug cartels. On the road, Banks confides to Harper that he hates his job but hasn't had a chance to get out of it for years until now.  In Mexico, Harper double-crosses both Banks and the FBI, first shooting Banks to stop him from committing the assassination and handcuffing him to the balcony, but then killing the thugs who hired him and taking their key for the payoff from the hit. She tells Banks that she expects the FBI will be so happy to catch and question him that she'll depart with the payoff without much problem, which is why she leaves him alive. However, by the time Scanlon responds to her call on Banks' location, he has escaped. Meanwhile, the FBI agents follow Agent Marbury's sighting of a fleeing Harper to the local airport, only to lose her there, because the "sighting" was actually Marbury herself in a disguise, which she sheds in a washroom, permitting Harper's undetected escape.  In the last scene, Harper and Marbury meet in the desert and kiss, while discussing their new wealth. In the distant brush, we see Banks' boots and bloody hand, unnoticed by the two women. After the screen goes black, we hear a single shot.

When Devdas was sent to England, Paro had lit an oil lamp to prompt his return and never allowed it to extinguish.  When Devdas returns, the childhood friendship between him and Paro turns to love. Everyone believes that Devdas and Paro will get married, but Devdas' scheming sister-in-law Kumud ([[Ananya Khare]]) reminds Kaushalya of Paro's maternal lineage of [[Nautch|nautch girls]] and [[Nautanki|nautanki performers]], which is inappropriate for the Mukherjee family. Sumitra publicly announces her desire for Devdas and Paro to marry, and Kaushalya rejects and humiliates her in public by saying that she is from a lower class. Devastated, Sumitra hastily arranges Paro's marriage to a man from a family wealthier than the Mukherjees: Thakur Bhuvan Chaudhry ([[Vijayendra Ghatge]]), a forty-year-old widower aristocrat with three grown children.  When Devdas' father also rejects Paro, Devdas leaves his parents' house and takes refuge at a [[brothel]]. He leaves a letter for Paro, falsely stating that love had never existed between them. At the brothel, he meets a good-hearted ''[[tawaif]]'' (courtesan) named Chandramukhi ([[Madhuri Dixit]]), who falls in love with him. Soon, Devdas realizes his mistake in abandoning Paro. He returns to her during her wedding and asks her to elope but Paro refuses, reminding him of the way he had discarded her so easily. Devdas vows to see her again before he dies.  Paro learns from her new husband that he has married her only to be mother to his children and lady of the estate, but that his love is only for his late first wife. She dutifully fulfills her responsibilities, while Devdas, heartbroken at having lost Paro, permanently moves to Chandramukhi's brothel and becomes an alcoholic. When Devdas' father is on his deathbed, he asks to see his son Devdas, but Devdas arrives later, at his father's funeralâshamefully and obviously drunk. He causes a scene and eventually passes out.  Eventually, Devdas becomes so ill that the slightest dose of alcohol could kill him. He returns to the family home to heal, and discovers that his sister-in-law has stolen his mother's keys to the family safe. He confronts her but Kumud tells his mother that Devdas had stolen the keys. His mother believes her and Devdas leaves, banished. Paro arrives at Chandramukhi's brothel, accusing her of driving Devdas to drink, but quickly realizes that Chandramukhi loves Devdas. Paro urges Devdas to stop drinking, but Devdas remains stubborn. He promises Paro that before he dies, he will come to her doorstep one last time.  Paro invites Chandramukhi to a celebration of [[Durga Puja]] at her husband's home and introduces her to her in-laws without revealing Chandramukhi's profession. However, Bhuvan's ill-natured son-in-law Kalibabu ([[Milind Gunaji]]), a frequent visitor to the brothel, reveals Chandramukhi's background and humiliates her in front of the guests. He also tells Bhuvan of Paro's relationship with Devdas. As a result, Bhuvan permanently forbids Paro from leaving the mansion. Devdas tells Chandramukhi that she must let him go, and decides to travel the country; on a train, he meets his old college friend Chunnibabu ([[Jackie Shroff]]), who urges him to drink in the name of friendship. Devdas drinks, knowing full well it will be fatal.  On the verge of death, Devdas travels to Paro's house to honor his promise, collapsing under a tree in front of the main gate. Paro runs through the mansion, attempting to reach him. Bhuvan sees this and orders the servants to shut the gates. Devdas sees a blurred image of Paro running towards him, but the gates close just before she can reach him, leaving her sobbing inside.

Die Another Day
 [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bondâ007âinfiltrates a [[North Korea]]n military base, where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African [[blood diamond|conflict diamond]]s.  After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent via an unknown source, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a [[hovercraft]] chase ensues, ending with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon.  After fourteen months of captivity and [[torture]], Bond is traded for Zao in a [[prisoner exchange]].  He is sedated and taken to meet [[M (James Bond)|M]], who informs him that his status as a [[00 Agent]] is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress.  Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a [[double agent]] in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal.  After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in [[Hong Kong]], where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in [[Cuba]].  In [[Havana]] Bond meets [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson, with whom he is intimate.  Later, Bond follows her to a [[gene therapy]] clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring.  Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but he escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth, celebrity, and philanthropy from its assets.  At [[Blades Club]] in [[London]] Bond meets Graves, along with his assistant [[List of James Bond henchmen in Die Another Day#Miranda Frost|Miranda Frost]], who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a [[fencing]] exercise (and a literal sword-fight), Bond is invited by Graves to [[Iceland]] for a scientific demonstration. Shortly afterwards, M tells Bond of MI6's doubts about Graves, restores Bond's Double-0 status and offers assistance in the investigation.  At his [[ice palace]] adjacent to the diamond mine site in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, "Icarus", which is able to focus [[solar energy]] on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development.  During the night, Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre, but is captured by Graves and Zao.  Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive.  Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, creating the identity of Gustav Graves and amassing his fortune from sale of the conflict diamonds.  [[File:Die Another Day - Aston Martin V12 Vanquish & Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo.jpg|thumb|Aston Martin V12 Vanquish and Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo used in the film]] Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves' facility. Bond then returns in his [[Aston Martin Vanquish]] to rescue Jinx, who has been captured once again within the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his own car. Bond kills Zao by causing a giant ice chandelier to fall onto him, and then revives Jinx after she has drowned.  Bond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the [[Korean peninsula]] and stow away on Graves' cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade [[South Korea]] and reunite the peninsula by force. Horrified at the fact that it would result in a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the United States, General Moon tries to turn the plan down, but he is murdered by his own son.  Bond attempts to shoot Graves, but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board.  In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the [[fuselage]], causing the plane to descend rapidly.  Bond engages Graves in a fist fight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane.  Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and into one of its engines, killing him and disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx then escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, carrying away Graves' stash of diamonds in the process. In the end, they are seen to have sex amidst diamonds in a South Korean Buddhist temple located in a valley.  
Dirty Pretty Things (film)
 Okwe is an illegal [[Nigeria]]n immigrant to the United Kingdom who drives a [[Hackney carriage|cab in London]] during the day and works at the front desk of a hotel at night. The hotel is staffed with many immigrants, both legal and illegal. Okwe keeps himself awake by chewing [[khat]], an herbal stimulant. A doctor in his home country, he was forced to flee after being falsely accused of murdering his wife. In London, he is pressed into giving medical treatment to other poor immigrants, including fellow cab drivers with [[venereal disease]]s. Okwe's friend Guo Yi, an employee at a hospital [[mortuary]], provides him with antibiotics under the table.  A prostitute known as Juliette, who plies her trade in the hotel, informs Okwe about a blocked toilet in one of the hotel rooms. He fishes out the blockage and finds a human heart. The manager of the hotel, Juan, runs an illegal operation at the hotel wherein immigrants [[Organ trade|swap kidneys for forged passports]].  After learning of Okwe's past as a doctor, Juan pressures him to join his operation as a surgeon, but Okwe refuses.  Senay is a Turkish Muslim seeking asylum, who also works at the hotel, as a cleaner. Her immigration status allows her to stay in the UK providing she does not work; the hotel is a perfect cover because she is not named on its books. She allows Okwe to sleep on her sofa when she is not home, her religion forbidding her from being alone with a man, other than a relative, at any time.   Senay is frightened after a visit from the Immigration service, and convinces Okwe to leave before the authorities find him in her home. The officials find a book of matches from the hotel and decide to inspect it before Senay arrives for her early morning shift. Okwe asks the doorman to intercept Senay; the officials don't catch her, but she can no longer work at the hotel. She begins working in a [[sweatshop]] making clothes, but the officials raid that site, too. The entire staff flee to the roof while the manager gets rid of the Immigration agents. The manager will let Senay keep her job and promises not to report her to the authorities only if she will perform oral sex on him. After a couple of such sessions, she refuses to cooperate and bites him, then flees with an expensive coat and some dresses.   Okwe finds her a place to stay at the hospital mortuary, but Senay panics. She asks him to raise money for her to travel to America by selling the stolen clothes and acting as a surgeon in Juan's organ business. Okwe refuses.  In desperation, Senay agrees to exchange a kidney for a passport. As a "deal maker", Juan takes her virginity as well, and later Juliette provides her with the [[Emergency contraception|morning-after pill]]. After learning of Senay's plan, Okwe tells Juan that he will perform the operation to ensure her safety, but only if Juan provides them both with passports under different names. After Juan delivers the passports, Okwe and Senay drug him, surgically remove his kidney, and sell it to Juan's contact.  Okwe plans to use his new identity to return to his young daughter in Nigeria, and Senay plans to start a new life in [[New York City]]. Before they part at [[Stansted Airport]], she gives him her cousin's address in New York. They mouth the words, "I love you", to each other. Senay boards her plane, and Okwe calls long-distance to his daughter to tell her he is coming home at last.  
Dil Hai Tumhaara
 Shalu ([[Preity Zinta]]) is a young, fun loving young woman living with her mother, Sarita ([[Rekha]]), and older sister, Nimmi ([[Mahima Chaudhry]]). Unknown to Shalu and Nimmi, they are half-sisters. Shalu is the daughter of Sarita's late husband Shekar and the woman with whom he had an affair. Fatally wounded in a car accident with Shalu's biological mother, Shekar begged Sarita to raise Shalu as her own.  Although Sarita adopted Shalu, she cannot forget the truth of Shalu's hidden parentage, and so gives her none of the love she shows to her real daughter, Nimmi. Shalu, on the other hand, loves Sarita, whom she believes is her real mother. She constantly craves her mother's affection but does not get it. She seeks attention and retaliates by being rebellious. Unlike their mother, Nimmi loves Shalu very much and constantly stands up for her, though she refuses to think ill of her mother or take sides.  Eventually a young man named Dev Khanna ([[Arjun Rampal]]) enters the sisters' lives. Dev and Shalu initially do not get along but slowly fall in love. However, circumstances make Nimmi believe that Dev is in love with her, not Shalu. Sarita, only aware of Nimmi's side of the story, offers a marriage proposal to Dev's father ([[Alok Nath]]) on Nimmi's behalf. Mr Khanna is taken aback, because he knows about the relationship between Dev and Shalu. When Sarita sees Dev and Shalu being affectionate, she jumps to the conclusion that Shalu has stolen Dev from Nimmi - just as Shalu's mother stole Shekar away from her. Sarita confronts Shalu in anger and reveals her true heritage in front of Nimmi. [[Image:Dil Hai Tumhaara1.jpg|thumb|left|Preity Zinta and Jimmy Shergill]] Shocked at her parentage, Shalu decides to sacrifice Dev to make her mother and sister happy. When Dev learns this from Shalu, he is confused and dismayed, but eventually agrees to marry Nimmi to make Shalu happy. Nimmi notices that something is wrong with Shalu, but Shalu deflects the question by saying that she has fallen in love with Samir ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]), her childhood friend who has been in love with her for years.  On the engagement day, Sarita's political rivals try to use Shalu's [[illegitimate]] heritage to threaten Nimmi's marriage to Dev, who is from a prominent family. Shalu takes matters into her own hands, rushing to Dev's house where she publicly announces to Dev's entire family that she was born out of wedlock, arguing that it is proof of Sarita's kindness and generosity that Shalu was adopted into her family. It would be an injustice if the marriage were cancelled solely because of her. Mr Khanna is impressed with Shalu's courage and promises that nothing will stop the marriage from taking place.  Sarita secretly witnesses Shalu's confession and is deeply touched. She is ashamed of how she has treated Shalu, and they share their first hug. Sarita tells her that she will ask Nimmi to step aside if Shalu and Dev are really in love. Shalu stops her from doing so, saying that now she has her mother's love and acceptance, she does not want anything else.  Nimmi is very happy that her mother has accepted Shalu, but she still feels that something is not quite right with her sister. She soon learns of the whole ruse from Samir, and gladly steps aside for Shalu and Dev to be united.

Dog Soldiers (film)
 A couple is seen camping in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. The woman gives the man a silver letter opener as a present; shortly afterward they are killed in their tent by  unseen assailants.   Meanwhile, a soldier named Private Cooper is seen running through a forest in [[North Wales]]. He attacks his pursuers, but is overwhelmed and wrestled to the ground. It is revealed that Cooper is trying to join a special forces unit but fails when he refuses to shoot a dog in cold blood. He is returned to his unit by Captain Richard Ryan.  Four weeks later, a squad of six British soldiers, including Cooper, are dropped into the Scottish Highlands, somewhat fed up about missing an EnglandâGermany [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] match. Expecting to carry out a training mission against a [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) unit, they only find the SAS unit's savaged remains.   A badly wounded Captain Ryan, the only survivor, makes cryptic references to what attacked them. Unseen predators then attack the troops.   While retreating, Bruce is impaled by a tree branch, killing him, and Sergeant Wells is attacked. He is rescued by Cooper and carried to a rural roadside where the group meets Megan, a zoologist who takes them to a lonely house belonging to an unknown family.   The soldiers who remain are Wells, Cooper, Spoon, Joe, and Terry. As darkness falls, the house is surrounded by the attackers: to the soldiers' incredulity, these are revealed to be [[Werewolf|werewolves]].  They try to get in the [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover]] but find it has been destroyed by the werewolves. The soldiers maintain a desperate defence against the creatures, believing that if they can make it to sunrise, the werewolves will revert to human form.   Cooper and Megan then treat Wells' wounds. After Terry is abducted and their ammunition runs short, they realize they will not last and decide to try to escape. Spoon creates a diversion while Joe tries to steal a Land Rover from the garage. When he gets in, Joe sees Terry in the garage being eaten alive by a werewolf, who rips off Terry's head and throws it at the windshield. Joe drives up to the house door, then realizes that a werewolf is hiding in the back seat, going down fighting.  Under interrogation, Ryan reveals that the government had sent him on a mission to capture a live werewolf, so that it could be studied and exploited as a weapon; Cooper's squad was supposed to be the bait. An enraged Wells and Cooper attempt to kill Ryan, but he transforms into a werewolf due to his wounds and escapes out of a window, running off into the forest. It is then revealed that the unknown family of the house are the werewolves.  The soldiers try blowing up the barn - where Megan told them the werewolves must be hiding - with petrol, gas canisters, matches, and the Land Rover. Once the structure has been destroyed, Megan reveals that not only were there no werewolves in the barn, but she had persuaded them to destroy their only means of transport. She is a werewolf, as well, and had been suppressing the metamorphosis until she gave in. She also reveals that she unlocked the back door to the house, allowing the werewolves to get inside.  Before she fully transforms, Wells runs into the room just in time and shoots her in the head. He and Cooper run upstairs, and Spoon runs to the kitchen, blocking the door. A werewolf breaks in, and Spoon runs out of ammo. He fights the werewolf and, using nearby surroundings to his advantage, gains the upper hand but is eventually killed when a second werewolf intervenes.  Wells and Cooper shoot through the floor upstairs to elude the werewolves, dropping into the kitchen, where they find Spoon's remains. Wells orders Cooper to take shelter in the cellar as he begins to transform into a werewolf, giving him a roll of photographic film (which was in a flashgun camera used to stun the werewolves) to prove what has happened. The werewolves break into the kitchen and confront Wells as he cuts a gas line and blows up the house, killing himself and the werewolves, including a now fully transformed Megan.   As the sun rises,  Cooper attempts to leave but Ryan, who also took shelter in the cellar, confronts him. After a brutal fight, Cooper stabs Ryan in the chest with the silver letter opener, weakening him enough to allow Cooper to shoot him in the head, killing him. Cooper and Megan's [[Border Collie]], Sam, emerge from the cellar and walk off into the woods.   The end credits show that Cooper reported his story to the newspapers, with photographs as proof, headlined under the title of "Werewolves ate my platoon".

Disappearance (2002 film)
 While driving through [[New Mexico]], the Henley family â Jim, his wife Patty, their daughter Kate, son Matt, along with Matt's friend Ethan â discover the whereabouts of Weaver, a ghost town, and decide to take a detour to it to take pictures. Stopping at a diner in the neighboring town of Two Wells, the family asks about Weaver but the patrons, all seeming dazed, claim not to have heard of the town, although a gas station attendant warns Jim to "stay on the pavement". The Henleys make their way to Weaver, where they find a wall with a mysterious symbol and a human-sized dried skin. They discover a videotape which shows previous visitors being taken by an unseen force, and then ending with a girl running from the unknown threat. Unnerved, the family try to leave but the SUV battery is dead and they are forced to spend the night in one of the abandoned buildings.  The next morning, the family discovers their SUV missing, along with a flashlight and Jim's sweater. Deciding to split up, Kate, Patty, and Matt remain in the building while Jim and Ethan set out for the diner. The two discover a large expanse of glass in the middle of the desert, a plaque in the center revealing it to be a 1948 neutron bomb test site called "Ground Zero". Ethan walks just ahead of Jim over a ridge, and when Jim makes his way over the ridge, Ethan is nowhere to be seen. Jim glimpses a car graveyard in the distance. He rushes there, hoping to find Ethan but instead discovers his SUV parked with other cars in the same pattern as the symbol on the wall.  Back in Weaver, Patty, away from the others to use the bathroom, senses something watching her, then falls through rotten boards into a mine shaft. She hears growling sounds from below, and climbs further up, discovering many discarded items including her husband's sweater. Matt and Kate search for their mother and Matt climbs down the mine to help her. The source of the growling rushes in the dark toward Patty and Matt. Patty fires a gun toward the sound which stops, although no body is discovered and it is uncertain if it was even harmed.  In the vehicle graveyard, as Jim salvages a battery for his SUV from another vehicle, he is stalked by one or more unseen creatures. He manages to evade them and successfully puts a replacement battery in, driving back to Weaver. He rescues his family, only for a seemingly driverless school bus and truck to block their way, forcing Jim to drive them both through a clapboard outbuilding to escape. They stop to use a telephone at the diner, but it is useless. Jim and Matt spot a dust cloud moving in their direction from the vicinity of Weaver.  Jim visits Sheriff Richards in the nearby town of Two Wells, telling him about Ethan's disappearance, the town of Weaver, where the townspeople vanished without a trace, and the unseen beings attacking them. Richards denies all knowledge of the town, but while he is away, Jim is pulled aside by an old inmate named Lester who says the town does exist and the unseen force is possibly the mutated, deformed offspring of the townspeople who refused evacuation before the bomb was dropped or the spirits of Indians interred in a burial ground under the town or even [[Area 51]], although he doesn't believe aliens are not necessarily the explanation for the unseen forces in Weaver. It's unclear if any of this is true or simply the ramblings of a madman.  Kate finds the girl from the video alive and working at the local Dairy Queen. When she returns with the rest of the family, the girl is nowhere to be seen and she told that she's "gone off-shift." The sheriff agrees to search for Ethan the next day. The family stays in a motel, but when Kate senses one of the beings watching them from the window, the family decides to leave at once. Meanwhile, Sheriff Richards takes the inmate Lester to the desert, lights a fire, and leaves him for "the beings".  As the Henleys attempt to flee, they are stopped by Sheriff Richards who tells them that he found Ethan. The four of them pick up Ethan from the Sheriff's, Jim noticing Lester's empty cell. As the five of them drive off, Ethan tells them he fell and does not remember anything else, while Matt questions the events. As Jim is distracted, the car hits an unseen creature, causing the SUV to flip over. The viewpoint of one of the unseen creatures makes its way to the wrecked car, and the Henleys are heard screaming.  Six months later, Jim is now the gas-station attendant, while Patty works as a waitress in the diner, all of them in the same dazed state as the other members of the town of Two Wells.  After Kate has served Sheriff Richards at the diner, the film ends with Kate feeding one of the crows as several bikers turn up at the diner, very possibly to begin the cycle all over again.  
Dolls (2002 film)
 The film features three primary sets of characters, each within their own distinct story:  * A young man (''Matsumoto'', played by [[Hidetoshi Nishijima (actor)|Hidetoshi Nishijima]]) who rejects his engagement to his fiancÃ©e (''Sawako'', played by [[Miho Kanno]]) to marry the daughter of his company's president. When his former fiancÃ©e attempts [[suicide]] and ends up in a semi-[[vegetative state]], he takes her out of the hospital and they run away. * Another young man (''Nukui'', played by [[Tsutomu Takeshige]]) is obsessed with the pop-star ''Haruna'' (played by [[Kyoko Fukada]]); he blinds himself when she is involved in a disfiguring car accident. * An aged [[yakuza]] (''Hiro'', played by [[Tatsuya Mihashi]]), who tries to meet a girlfriend from his youth (played by [[Chieko Matsubara]]).  These stories do have some incidental visual cross-over with each other in the film, but are mostly separate. The first story is the one on which the film centers. The film leads into it by opening with a performance of [[Bunraku]] theatre, and closes with a shot of dolls from the same. The performance is that of "[[The Courier for Hell]]" by [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], and it alludes to themes that reappear later in the film. Because the rest of the film itself (as Kitano himself has said) can be treated as Bunraku in film form, the film is quite [[symbol]]ic. In some cases, it is not clear whether a particular scene is meant to be taken literally. The film is also not in strict chronological order, but there is a strong visual emphasis on the changing of the seasons and the bonds of love over the progression of time (Matsumoto and Sawako spend most of the film physically connected by a red rope).  
Double Vision (2002 film)
 Police [[detective]] Huang Huo-tu, a ''Waisheng ren'' ([[Mainland Chinese]]) in Taiwan, has relegated himself to a mundane job as a Foreign Affairs Officer as self-punishment for blowing the whistle on corruption in the force, and his colleagues have turned their backs on him. His young daughter is left traumatized after being taken hostage in a gun battle, and his wife Ching-fang is filing for divorce. Huang is on the verge of a severe nervous breakdown.  A series of bizarre deaths in [[Taipei]] baffle local investigators, including a Catholic priest of foreign nationality found [[Disembowelment|disemboweled]]. The priest is involved in the Taiwan-US military trade, so [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Kevin Richter is called in to help. Huang, who can speak English, is made his liaison. Kevin, the topmost serial killer expert in the field, was previously investigating a series of murders in US in which all victims appeared willing to die.  The crime scenes imply the involvement of [[supernatural]] forces. In one case a businessman froze to death in his office in the middle of a heatwave; in another the mistress of a prominent official called the fire department and was later found burned to death - with no sign of a fire ever occurring in her apartment. Richter is skeptical but Huang, who is more receptive to supernatural possibilities, suggests they investigate a local cult. After consulting a scholar in [[Academia Sinica]], Huang and Kevin find that the killings follow a Taoist belief that one must fulfill five forms of suffering required to become a [[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]], an immortal being. According to legends, the one who can perform the five rituals is born with double pupils in one eye.  They also find that all victims have done something against their conscience, and that a kind of [[fungus]] was used to induce hallucination, pleasure and guilt which made the victims kill themselves. An advanced technology was used to spread the fungus, and the Police trace this technology to two bosses of an electronics company in [[Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park|Hsinchu Science Park]]. The men has spent their fortune and technology to move a Taoist temple into their company, where many cult believers gather. The police enter the temple, but the cultists perform a ritualistic massacre, killing many officers and cultists alike. After the massacre Kevin and Huang find a seemingly innocent girl who survived, and the case is closed.  The next day Huang finds Kevin dead, having pulled out his own tongue, which is the fifth suffering required. Huang finds that both he and Kevin were infected with the fungus by the girl. Huang begins to hallucinate, tormented by the guilt he feels for his wife and daughter, and returns to the temple to confront the girl survivor, who is revealed to be the cult's leader. The girl has the double double pupil in her eye and believes that by having Huang kill her, she can complete the fifth requirement and become immortal. Huang kills the girl and is nearly overwhelmed with hallucination and guilt, but in the end he is allowed to return to his wife and child.  The film ends with a Buddhist [[Gatha]], which in the late and DVD version is "å æçæ,å æçæ¼,è¥é é¢æè,ç¡æäº¦ç¡æ¼ã"(In Mainland China versions æ¼ becomes æ¯) but in earlier versions is "love is immortal" (ææä¸æ­»)  
Don't Ask Don't Tell (film)
 Scientist Doug Fartin (who insists that his name is pronounced âFar-''tan''â) is in charge of Operation Manhole, a project to eliminate all homosexuals in the military by luring them to a specific spot and then dropping a bomb on them.  The bomb, however, misses its target and instead obliterates part of the nearby town of [[inbreeding|Inbred]], [[Texas]].  The plane is then struck by an invisible force and crashes to earth, and its occupants â Dr. Fartin and the pilot â are presumed dead.  Fartin, however, was saved from the plane by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] with bulging eyeballs, who then performed an operation on him.  Fartin wanders back to the military base the next day, with no memory of how he survived the plane crash, and is beginning to exhibit [[stereotype|stereotypically]] gay behavior (e.g., he keeps using the word âfabulousâ).  Base commander Colonel Butz and [[surgeon]] Major Problemo talk to Dougâs wife, [[Vagina]], about her husbandâs new behavior; if she canât turn him back into âa real man,â heâll be included in the next bombing.  She tries her best to sexually arouse him, but he can only have sex with her while imagining that sheâs [[Ted Kennedy]].  The next day, Doug Fartin â whose security clearance has been revoked because of his new gayness â steals a piece of paper from a vault in Butzâs office.  Upon hearing of this, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Priggs tries to figure out what was stolen, which isnât easy because the vault is highly disorganized and mostly filled with take-out menus.  Priggs discovers a handful of [[marijuana]] on the floor in front of the vault, and immediately recognizes it as part of Fartinâs stash.  Doug arrives at [[Sodomy|Sodom]] Flats with the paper, but is caught and confronted by Priggs.  Doug punches Priggs out and tries to escape in his car, but a hallucination of bulging eyeballs causes him to run off the road and crash.  Regaining consciousness in the base infirmary, Fartin remembers what happened to him after the plane went down, and tells his story to Butz and the others:  The aliens, who are from [[Uranus]] (âan all-gay planetâ), have been the ones responsible for creating homosexuals on Earth and other planets.  Over the centuries, theyâve monitored these planets and tried to snuff out [[homophobia]].  The last time theyâd visited Earth was during [[World War II]], when their agents abducted [[Adolf Hitler]] and turned him into a [[cross-dressing]] [[lounge singer]] on another planet; the Germans set up an [[imposter]] in Hitlerâs place, but when the imposter ordered the invasion of [[Russia]], the aliens knew that [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] was doomed, so they left.  Now the aliens have returned, with a new mission: to build a machine whose transmissions will cause everyone on Earth to become homosexual.  They had ordered Fartin to return to the military base, steal from the vault the bottom half of page 32 from the original manuscript of ''[[Giovanni's Room]]'', and bring it to the aliensâ subterranean headquarters at Sodom Flats.  Fartin rightly concluded that thereâs something on the paper that the aliens needed to complete their machine and refused to cooperate, but the alien leader â the Super-Homo â [[hypnosis|hypnotized]] Doug to ensure his complicity.  After hearing Fartinâs story, Butz and his associates arenât sure about Dougâs sanity.  Later, Sheriff [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolino]] of Inbred (whoâs been turned into a bulging-eyed agent of the aliens) materializes in Fartinâs room and tells him that the aliens now need a power source for their machine; Fartin, who is now convinced that helping the aliens is the right thing to do, goes to the nearby [[power station]] and orders the technician, at gunpoint, to move certain levers and switches (one of which causes the camera filming this movie to temporarily falter).  Butz, Problemo, Priggs, Vagina, and others try to stop Doug, but theyâre too late; everyone looks out the window and witnesses a huge explosion, the radiation from which changes the sexuality of everyone on Earth, turning straight people gay and gay people â such as Doug Fartin â straight.  
Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary
 In 1897, a visitor from the East, Count Dracula, arrives in London and is inadvertently invited into the home of Lucy Westenra. She is bitten by Dracula, and taken by his curse. Lucy's behavior becomes more erratic leading her to bite her fiancÃ©. Lucy is immediately put under the care of Dr. Van Helsing. Van Helsing does blood tests on Lucy and declares "Vampyre!" as the source of the problem, and puts Lucy to bed adorned with garlic.  That night, Renfield, a mental patient who lives in the asylum next to Lucy's home, escapes from confinement and Lucy's house is broken into by demons. Lucy's mother awakens in the commotion. Panicked by the demons, Lucy's mother opens the door and inadvertently re-invites Dracula into the house. Both Lucy and her mother are killed in this incident and a funeral procession takes place. The next day, Renfield is recaptured and placed back into the mental hospital. Bizarre incidents begin to occur around the city with newspapers headlines proclaiming a "Bloofer Lady" who has been murdering infants. Renfield is interrogated and confesses that Dracula has brought Lucy back from the dead committing these deeds and the solution to the problem lies in the graveyard.  Van Helsing and Lucy's suitors go there and spy Dracula and the undead Lucy in a full romantic embrace. After Dracula leaves, Van Helsing declares, "We must destroy the false Lucy so the real one may live forever". When Van Helsing opens the Lucy's coffin, Lucy rises out and attacks the men. Lucy is eventually subdued by a piercing stab from Jonathan's long wooden stakes and a decapitation with a shovel by Van Helsing who then declares they must find and defeat the vampyre. Van Helsing and his men go to interrogate Renfield finding out that Dracula's next plan is to attack Lucy's best friend Mina.  Mina, who is in a convent, aids her injured fiancÃ©, Jonathon Harker. Harker had journeyed to Castle Dracula, where he had intended to finalize a land sale. Upon arriving, Harker was ravaged by three Brides of Dracula, who overpowered him.

In Castle Dracula, Dracula woos Mina, tempting her with offers of riches and eventually biting her on the neck, solidifying his curse. Harker, along with Van Helsing and his men, break into Dracula's castle and dispatch the Brides of Dracula with long wooden stakes. The men eventually stumble upon Mina and find the mark of Dracula's bite upon her. Attempting to root out Dracula, the men smash coffins and place Christian crosses in them. Dracula attacks the men.  After the battle, Dracula and Mina are the only two left conscious. Mina scurries to a window with a cross and pulls it open to stun Dracula with the sunlight. The men regain consciousness, surround Dracula, and stab him with their stakes. The castle is demolished by Van Helsing's men and everyone departs. Dracula is left hanging motionless, impaled on a giant stake.

Dracula (miniseries)
 At a ballroom of a hospital charity party in [[Budapest]], the successful [[United States|American]] lawyer Jonathan Harker (Hardy KrÃ¼ger Jr.) suddenly proposes to his girlfriend Mina (Stefania Rocca).  He wants to marry her within the week. Their friends Lucy (Muriel Baumeister), Quincy (Alessio Boni) and Arthur (Conrad Hornby) have been invited by Jonathan and have just arrived for the wedding, all without Mina's awareness. Meanwhile, they meet the promoter of the party, the psychiatrist Dr. Seward (Kai Wiesinger). Later in the same night, Jonathan is called by a rich client, Tepes (Patrick Bergin), who hires him to prepare the inventory of the wealth of his uncle, the count Vladislav Tepes (Patrick Bergin), in [[Romania]]. Jonathan travels to the Carpathian Mountains in his [[Porsche]], has an accident and finally arrives in the count's old [[castle]].  Vlad Tepes, here calling himself Count Vladislav Tepes, decides to leave his castle and move to the west. He says he feels tired from Romania's decline and the seclusion of his life.  In Budapest he discusses some illegal business with Harker.  He also wants Jonathan's help in turning his collection of paintings, jewels and his gold deposits to cash.  Jonathan's friends businessman Quincey Morris, specialising in money swindles, and Arthur Holmwood, a British diplomat who is in a debt, offer to help.  Though Jonathan and Arthur have their doubts about the deal Quincey convinces them that money is all that matters and its one true power that makes the world go around.  Dracula gets very interested in those young peopleâthe men, hungry for money and power; Lucy, who wants to sleep in many beds, in many cities, have new experiences and live for ever; and Mina, who wants to change the world and end human suffering.  Throughout the film Dracula tries to seduce all five of them into his own world, make them wish to become vampires.  Focusing again and again on how hypocritical morality is and promising them the loss of their consciences, he says survival of the fittest is the proper way and even the strong cannot save the weak.  He also references God's slaughters in the Bible to prove that humanity was created in his image, the image of a killer.  There to stop him is the researcher of the occult and Seward's teacher Dr. Enrico Valenzi the one who believes that Dracula can be defeated when he faces a strong will empowered by faith.  But throughout this film he raises more and more self-doubts and his will is almost broken by the end.  It is Mina, halfway through her transformation to a vampire, that manages to make Dracula trust her and kills him as he holds her in an embrace. The films end with Mina still having the vampire's mark and how that affects her remains a question.  
Dragonfly (2002 film)

Joe starts visiting EmilyÂ´s patients at the pediatric oncology unit in the hospital. One of his wife's patients is brought in unconscious. Joe hears the child calling his name and follows the staff who are trying to revive him without success - the childÂ´s heart flatlines. As Joe approaches the child, suddenly the heart begins beating again.  The following afternoon Joe returns to the child who asks him if he is "Emily's Joe" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross, but the boy doesn't know what the symbol means. The boy tells about his [[near death experience]], that he saw a light, and a woman showing him an image of Joe, and that the cross symbol was what he saw at the end of the rainbow.  Later, while passing by another child's room, Joe sees the same drawing. That boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must "go to the rainbow".  When Joe arrives at home, his parrot mysteriously goes into a rage breaking a pot making the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor. Joe spots a [[dragonfly]] flying outside the window, and briefly sees Emily reaching for him outside that same window. Joe's neighbour, Miriam Belmont, tries to talk him back into reality. Instead, he goes to Sister Madeline, a controversial nun who investigated near-death experiences. Sister Madeline advises Joe that Emily is indeed trying to contact him from the other side.  The breaking point occurs at the hospital when Joe is alone with a clinically dead patient. Joe hears his wife speaking through the patient, calling his name, but no one believes him. He decides to sell his home and go on vacation. While packing away his wife's belongings, the lightbulb in the room burns out. When he returns with a new bulb, all the belongings he had packed away are suddenly back in their original places. He enters his kitchen where a map has blown open, showing the mysterious curvy cross symbol at several places. He learns from a friend that the wiggly cross is the map symbol for a waterfall. Joe remembers and finds a photo of his wife posing in front of a waterfall with a rainbow behind her.  He takes a trip to the South American area where his wife died. Joe's pilot, Victor, takes him to the victims' graves near a tribe village. Joe shows the photo of his wife and asks his native guides if they know where his wife is buried. They start arguing with each other that he should be brought to the village. Joe's attention then shifts to the village and he runs off to it. He comes to a cliff and sees the bus far down below in the water. Joe jumps into the river and enters the semi-flooded bus, causing the bus to shift and becoming completely submerged. Joe is trapped inside but calms down when a bright glow fills the bus and his wife appears to him, reaching his hand. The events of her final hours flash before him, showing she survived the initial accident and was pulled to safety by nearby [[Yanomami]] villagers. He is then suddenly rescued out of the bus by Victor.  Joe runs to the village just to become surrounded by angry native men holding weapons. He holds up a photo of his wife. A native woman tells him they couldn't save her body but they saved her soul. Perplexed, he follows her into one of the huts, and inside is a female [[infant]] in a basket. The child his wife was carrying had survived the accident. The woman shows him a birthmark on the child in the shape of a dragonfly. As he embraces his daughter he realizes what his wife was trying to tell him.  The film ends with Joe playing with his daughter, who is now a toddler, having the same wavy blonde hair and who is the very image of his wife.

Duct Tape Forever
 When a developer's [[limousine]] gets stuck in a [[sink hole]] on [[Possum Lodge]]'s property and several attempts to recover it send it into the lake, the developer takes the matter to court.  The town council and the presiding judge, who have been looking for decades for a way to shut down the Lodge, fine the lodge $10,000 and give them thirty days to pay, and in default the Lodge reverts to the town.  Red's nephew Harold Green ([[Patrick McKenna]]) pleads with the judge for a change to the time limit and she agrees - she makes it ten days instead.  The Lodge members try to brainstorm a way out of the mess, but once again Harold is the only one with a viable idea - [[3M]] is running a [[duct tape]] [[sculpture]] contest in [[Minnesota]], with a third prize of [[Canadian dollar|$]]10,000 (which the members feel they have a shot at).  The members beg, borrow and steal (literally) enough duct tape to construct a [[goose]], and Red, Harold and Dalton Humphrey ([[Bob Bainborough]]) set off for the long ride to the contest.  However, sinister forces are at work.  The developer has convinced the town's [[sheriff]] ([[Darren Frost]]) to stop the trio by any means necessary.  The sheriff is accompanied by his beautiful deputy ([[Melissa DiMarco]]) who, against all logic, is smitten with Harold, although Harold is currently smitten with Dalton's indifferent daughter.  The sheriff attempts a number of dirty tricks in order to waylay Red.  At one point they flatten the Possum Van's tires, only to find out that Dalton has siphoned all the gas out of their police car, and that the nearest working gas pump is 20 miles away.  At another point, the sheriff digs a hole in the road with a [[backhoe]], but find their police car on the opposite side from the van.  In attempting to use the backhoe to move the police car to the other side of the hole, the sheriff instead drops the car into the hole, and the Possum Van drives right over it.  Eventually the developer takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Harold.  Red sends Dalton back for reinforcements, as he plans to get away with both Harold and the goose.  While Harold is suffering the company of the developer, the developer reveals that his father was also a lazy Possum Lodge member, and that his mother's frustration over this fact drove him to succeed at any cost.  He plans on buying Possum Lodge to convert it into a women's club called "Possum Landing."    At noon the next day, Red and the developer meet with Red backed by his lodge members, and the developer backed by a gang of thugs.  Just as the exchange is made, Red makes a getaway with Harold as the lodge members steal the cars of the thugs. Just as Red feels he has made his getaway, he finds that the developer is chasing him with the only vehicle left unstolen â the bus that brought his lodge members to the show down.  Nevertheless, Red and Harold manage to make it to the contest just before they award third prize, winning it when the goose (pulled behind the Possum Van on a small trailer) detaches and flies over the contest to land majestically with all of the other entries.  After the contest the members of the lodge gather in the meeting room to celebrate with a large cake. Harold has invited the developer to the meeting, which the man takes as an attempt to humiliate him, before realizing Harold has invited his elderly mother as well and the two reconcile. While the candles on the cake are lit, the sheriff's deputy entices Harold outside where they share a passionate kiss before the candles (which are revealed to be dynamite) explode. The film ends with a dazed Harold rejoining the group as Red asks for the duct tape to repair the damage.

Drumline (film)
 The film centers on Devon Miles ([[Nick Cannon|Cannon]]), a teen who has just graduated from a high school in [[New York City]]. Upon graduating, Devon heads to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] to attend the fictitious Atlanta A&T University (based on [[Southwest DeKalb High School]]), a college in the Atlanta area that takes enormous pride in its [[marching band]]. Devon was personally invited to attend on full scholarship by Dr. James Lee ([[Orlando Jones|Jones]]), head of the band, for his prodigious talents. The A&T band separates itself from its competitors by requiring all members to read music, by focusing on various styles of music rather than what music is currently popular on the radio, and dedication to the teamwork emphasized "one band, one sound" concept. The band has a preseason that is similar to an athletic team's induction in that it is very physically and mentally difficult. It challenges all recruits to push themselves past what they previously thought were their limits. At the end of preseason, the musicians audition for spots on the field, and Devon is the only freshman to make P1, the highest level player. While going through his rigorous process, Devon also finds time to romance an upperclassman dancer, Laila ([[Zoe Saldana|Saldana]]).  College life starts well for Devon, as he has the girl and a spot on the field. Things begin to turn sour when Sean ([[Leonard Roberts|Roberts]]), Devon's percussion leader, begins to grow weary of Devon's cocky attitude. Sean later challenges Devon to take a solo in his first game, believing the freshman will panic and be embarrassed in front of everyone. He is shocked when Devon takes the solo and is subsequently humiliated. This sets up some tension in the [[drumline]] which is exacerbated when Dr. Lee is told by President Wagner ([[Afemo Omilami|Afuma Dkembie]]), the school's president, to change his focus from music to entertainment or "There won't be a band program next year". Lee does not want to give Devon more playing time because he feels Devon's attitude and respect are lacking. The situation further deteriorates when it is revealed that Devon cannot read music. Devon is demoted to P4 by Dr. Lee until he learns, then later put back on P1 when Wagner pressures Dr. Lee to do so. The final straw comes at A&T's homecoming, when Devon incites a melee with the visiting band by leading his fellows in using their sticks to play on the visiting line's drums (a serious insult in drumline mythos).The melee results in the destruction of $99,000 worth of band equipment, 17 arrests, and the release of 31 white doves that were intended for the homecoming ceremony and 6 [[gazelle]]s. In addition, the melee is televised across the country, tarnishing the righteous reputation of not only the band, but the entire school. The entire percussion section is angry with Devon for his showboating and shun him. Devon runs to Dr. Lee telling him that his band mates are shunning him, but he is eventually dismissed the band by Dr. Lee.<ref>In the director's cut, when President Wagner asks Dr. Lee about Devon, Lee tells him "He's a P-Nothing". The scene was cut out of the film as the director felt that the scene was too sarcastic and re-shot the scene with Sean, the percussion leader, to reflect a more somber feel.</ref> The fight also harms his relationship with Laila as she is embarrassed to introduce him to her parents, who attended the game and thought of Devon as a [[Criminal|hoodlum]].  Acting as if he is not bothered by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon contacts A&T's rival school [[Morris Brown College]], to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A&T band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A&T. Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A&T's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.  At the Classic, the bands are shown performing a mixture of popular songs. Morris Brown's band even gets rapper [[Petey Pablo]] to perform during their routine. A&T is not fazed by this and performs their mix of retro and current sounds. A tie results and the Morris Brown and A&T drumlines face off. Dr. Lee tells Devon he can play for this face-off, showing his faith in Devon's improved character and in thanks for all the hard work he has done in getting the band ready for the Classic. Morris Brown goes first and A&T responds. Morris Brown's second cadence includes their snares moving forward and playing on the A&T drums (the same move that incited the fight at A&T's homecoming game, which resulted in Devon's expulsion from the band), then throwing down their sticks. The A&T line manages to hold their composure in the face of the insult. They play their cadence and in the middle throw down their drumsticks, mimicking the Morris Brown actions, but then the entire line pulls out another set of sticks and continues playing. They end their routine in the faces of the Morris Brown drumline, but instead of playing on their drums, the line all drop their sticks onto the other drumline's drums. The judges award the win to A&T.

Drowned Out
  The documentary follows the villagers of Jalsindhi â a village in Madhya Pradesh on the banks of the [[Narmada River]] about 10 miles upstream from the Sardar Sarovar project - through their battle against the dam. The lead character is Luharia Sonkaria, who is the villageâs medicine man, a role that was his fatherâs and grandfatherâs before him. The government provides them no viable alternatives - they offer unusable land a hundred miles away or a small sum of money in compensation for their river-side land. The film documents hunger strikes, rallies, and a six-year Supreme Court case, and finally follows the villagers as the dam fills and the river starts to rise. The documentary features [[Arundhati Roy]], who has been an outspoken activist bringing international attention to the controversy.  
Dweepa
 Located in the backwaters of a dam, Sita Parvata is an island slowly submerging due to the rains. The government succeeds in evacuating the residents by giving them compensation for the properties they own. The village temple priest Duggajja, his son Ganapa, and his daughter-in-law Nagi find it impossible to leave their homeland and make a living with the meagre compensation given by the government. They have but a small hut, which earns them a compensation of 25,000. In Ganapa's own words, the compensation can give them food and shelter, but cannot compensate for the love and respect of their people. On the island, they are important people, but outside, they would be one among hundreds of families struggling to make a living. Centered on this complex theme, the film narrates the struggles of the family and how ultimately in the end they manage to continue life on the island.

Eight Crazy Nights
 In the small town of Dukesberry, [[New Hampshire]], Davey Stone is a 33-year-old [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] troublemaker with a long [[criminal record]], whose antics have long earned him the animosity of the community.  Davey is arrested for refusing to pay his bill at Mr. Chang's Chinese restaurant, attempting to evade arrest ("Davey's Song"), stealing a snowmobile and destroying festive [[Ice sculpture|ice sculptures]] in the process. At Davey's trial, Whitey Duvall, a 70-year-old volunteer referee from Davey's former basketball league, intervenes. At Whitey's suggestion, the judge sentences Davey to [[community service]] as a referee-in-training for Whitey's Youth Basketball League. Under the terms of the community service, if Davey commits a crime before his sentence is completed, he will serve ten years in prison.  The next day, Davey's first game ends in disaster. After Davey causes disruptions, Whitey suffers a [[grand mal seizure]], and the game is abruptly brought to an end. Attempting to calm Davey down, Whitey takes him to the mall, where they meet Jennifer Friedman, Davey's childhood girlfriend, and her son Benjamin. Although Whitey reminds him that he lost his chance with Jennifer twenty years earlier, Davey still finds himself attracted to her.  As time progresses, Davey and Whitey's relationship becomes more strained. Whitey's various attempts to encourage Davey are met with humiliation and assault - including but not limited to Davey knocking Whitey into an outhouse and then spraying him when he falls out with a hose, causing Whitey to be frozen in defecation for several hours, before a group of grazing reindeer lick him out. Upon arriving home ("Long Ago"), Davey finds his trailer being burned down by a man who lost a basketball match to him earlier. Davey runs into the burning trailer to rescue a [[Hanukkah]] card from his late parents, then watches the trailer burn down. Whitey opens his home to Davey, who reluctantly accepts the invitation; also living in the house is Whitey's [[Diabetes|diabetic]] [[fraternal twin]] sister Eleanore. The Duvall household has many complex rules, to which Whitey refers as [[technical foul]]s ("Technical Foul"). Despite this, Davey seemingly overcomes them, and begins to turn his life around.  However, Davey's progress in reforming comes to a halt when Whitey recalls the events of what happened two decades ago: En route to one of Davey's basketball games, his parents were killed in a car accident when a truck skidded on [[black ice]] and swerved into them, and Davey learned of their deaths when the police showed up at the end of his game to inform him. Devastated by the loss of his loving parents and leaping from foster home to foster home, Davey spent the next 20 years numbing his pain with alcohol and petty crime. Uncomfortable with this reminder of his tragic and painful childhood, Davey loses his temper and insults both Whitey and Eleanore. As a result, Whitey revokes Davey's privilege to reside at his home, much to Davey's relief.  Davey spends the rest of the day drinking, and later that night breaks into the mall, which is closed. In a drunken stupor, he imagines the logos of various stores coming to life and confronting him about his inability to grieve for his parents, which they identify as the source of his alcoholism ("Intervention Song"). He finally opens his parents' Hanukkah card, which contains a message praising him for being a good son. Coming to terms with his loss, Davey finally cries. Just then, the police arrive to arrest Davey, but he escapes and boards a bus to [[New York City]], just as the police are searching for him across. En route, the bus is forced to stop when all eight tires are punctured by a single thumbtack in the road. Reminded of the Miracle of Hanukkah, Davey walks off the bus, intending to find Whitey and make amends with him.  Davey finds Whitey at the All-Star Banquet, an annual town celebration in which one member of the community is recognized for positive contributions to Dukesberry with the "Dukesberry All-Star Patch". Despite having vied for the award for over 35 years, Whitey is once again passed over. Heartbroken, he leaves, intending to move to [[Florida]], where he can live out the rest of his life in [[anonymity]]. Risking arrest, Davey enters the hall and informs everyone of the selfless contributions that Whitey has made to Dukesberry over the course of his life. Ashamed, the townspeople acknowledge the error of their decision ("Bum Biddy"). Davey leads the people to Whitey, who has gone to the mall with Eleanore to "speak to it" one more time. The townspeople thank Whitey for his service over the years and the Mayor officially grants him the Patch Award. All 34 previous recipients of the awards give theirs to Whitey. Davey and Jennifer reconcile, and Whitey goes into a seizure, which he calls "the happiest seizure of my life!".

The Emperor's Club
 William Hundert works at a boarding school for boys called Saint Benedict's in 1972. He is a passionate teacher of Classics who finds his tightly-controlled world shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom. Sedgewick Bell is the cocky son of a U.S. Senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles. After a dressing down from his father, Bell develops a close relationship with Hundert. After Hundert intentionally raises Bell's class rank by one place, Bell finishes in the top 3 in Hundert's class and qualifies for the traditional end of the year Mr. Julius Caesar contest. However, Hundert reconsiders his actions when he sees Martin Blythe, the rightful third place contestant, despondently withdrawn under a tree. The Mr. Julius Caesar competition is an event in front of the whole school, which is a series of questions about classics. However, when Hundert sees Bell using crib notes, the [[headmaster]] orders Hundert to ignore it. Hundert then asks a question on [[Hamilcar Barca]] which was not covered in class, but is answered by another contestant, Deepak Metha, who knew due to his personal interest in        [[military science]], and Metha is crowned Mr. Julius Caesar. The cheating is never publicized, but the trust Bell and Hundert had in each other is broken. Bell returns to his class clown ways and barely graduates in 1976, with Hundert remarking he had a sense of deep disappointment handing Bell the diploma.   Twenty-five years later, Hundert is poised to become the new headmaster, but resigns in shock when a less experienced teacher gets the position due to his fundraising ability. Hundert is later told that Sedgewick Bell will make a tremendous donation to Saint Benedict's, but that is contingent upon Hundert hosting a Mr. Julius Caesar contest at Bell's resort hotel on the [[Gold Coast (New Jersey)|Gold Coast]]. The now adult members of Hundert's 1972 class are also invited, and all enjoy the reunion, with Metha now working as a college professor of ancient history himself. However, when the competition progresses, Hundert sees Bell is being fed answers through an earpiece, echoing the original cheating. Hundert asks a question about [[Shutruk Nahunte]], who all the other men know about sans Bell. Metha answers correctly and once again wins. Afterwards Bell announces that he will be running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. While the men applaud, Hundert is aghast that he was used for political grandstanding.  Shortly after his announcement, Hundert and Bell run into each other in the men's room, where Hundert confronts Bell about his immorality. Bell goes on to tell Hundert that the "real world" is full of dishonesty, and Hundert has let life pass him by. However, the tirade was overheard by someone else in the bathroom, one of Bell's sons, who is shocked to learn his own father's true self. Wanting to atone for his own past wrongs, Hundert admits to Martin Blythe about the fudging of the first Mr. Julius Caesar competition. Blythe verbally forgives Hundert, but his body language is ambiguous. The following morning, the place is empty save for Bell starting his senatorial campaign. Hundert is then greeted by a [[surprise party]] of his 1972 class, and they present an award engraved with a quote about education. The men wave goodbye as Hundert's helicopter departs, and he reflects that while he failed with Bell, he succeeded with others.  Hundert decides to return to his old job teaching classics in the present-day Saint Benedict's, which is now coeducational and more diverse than the 1972 class. Echoing the start of the 1972 class, Hundert has one boy read a plaque on the wall. The boy is then shown to be the son of Martin Blythe, who gladly waves hello to his old teacher.  
Empire (2002 film)
  Victor Rosa (Leguizamo) is a drug dealer in [[New York City]] who sells a specific [[brand]] of heroin called "Empire". His territory is located in the South Bronx, where his other rivals all maintain an uneasy truce maintained because they all purchase their drugs from the same supplier, the [[drug lord]] La Colombiana ([[Isabella Rossellini]]).  Victor is invited to a chic white collar party by his girlfriend Carmen ([[Delilah Cotto]]).  The party is being thrown by her friend Trish ([[Denise Richards]]) and her boyfriend Jack (Sarsgaard), an investment banker. With a baby on the way, Vic decides to go straight, and begins to invest money with Jack, receiving significant returns. His friendship with Jack affords Vic a whole new lifestyle, and creates a rift between him and Carmen.  Jack offers Vic an investment opportunity for over 300% return, but there's a catch: the minimum buy-in is $4.5 million, $1.5 million more than Vic has. He approaches La Colombiana with an offer, in which she agrees to lend Vic the money he needs, if he gives her a 500% return and stops a feud between his best friend Jimmy ([[Vincent Laresca]]) and a rival dealer.  However, the feud escalates and Jimmy kills the dealer.  Vic receives his money and gives it to Jack, who disappears the next day.  Victor tracks him down and tries to get his money back, but kills Jack and Trish when they resist.  He escapes with Carmen and her family to [[Puerto Rico]] and opens a bar on the south side of the island with what little money he has left.  At the end of the movie, Vic is heading to the hospital to see the birth of his child when Rafael, La Colombiana's younger brother, shoots him in the head. The movie ends with Vic lying dead.  
The Emperor's New Clothes (2001 film)
 In 1821, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Holm), after six years in exile on the isle of [[St. Helena]], has a plan to escape.  Switching places with lowly French deckhand Eugene Lenormand (Holm again), Napoleon will make his way to Paris, at which time Eugene will announce the switch, allowing Napoleon to reclaim his throne.  However, the plan quickly goes awry: the ship Napoleon is serving on abruptly changes its itinerary and docks in [[Belgium]] instead of [[France]].  Having to make his way to France by land (and gaining an appalling look at the [[tourist trap]] the Battlefield of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] has become), he is finally met at the French border by a loyal agent, Sgt. Bommell ([[Clive Russell]]), formerly of the [[French Imperial Guard]].  Bommell gives him the name of another agent in Paris he can trust, Lt. Truchaut.  Arriving in Paris, Napoleon is surprised to find that Truchaut has recently died.  Passing himself off as an old comrade of the Lieutenant, Napoleon accepts the hospitality of Truchaut's widow, Nicole, whom everyone calls "Pumpkin" (Hjejle), and makes the acquaintance of her other lodger, Dr. Lambert (McInnerny) and her adopted young son, Gerard.  The crucial flaw in the plan reveals itself when, back on St. Helena, Eugene decides he likes living in the relative luxury of Napoleon's exile, and refuses to reveal the switch.  Napoleon's French entourage find themselves unexpectedly powerless, as Eugene stuffs his face with sweets, dictates his own bawdy version of Napoleon's official memoirs, and even manages to convince his British captors that he is the true Napoleon.  With no news from St. Helena, Napoleon is drawn into Pumpkin's life.  When her fruit-selling business is on the brink of failure, he applies his own talents for planning and organization, and the business becomes prosperous again.  As affection develops between Napoleon and Pumpkin, Dr. Lambert, who had designs on Pumpkin himself, jealously searches for some kind of dirt on "Eugene."  Going through his bedroom, Lambert is shocked to find a small [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] portrait of Napoleon's [[Napoleon II|young son]], and realizes who "Eugene" really is.  On St. Helena, Eugene abruptly drops dead of some kind of stomach complaint (in real-life, Napoleon reportedly died of gastric cancer).  Quickly realizing that the dead man on the island is not Napoleon, the British garrison commander lays out their options: either they announce the fraud, and commit themselves to heinous punishment, or else they maintain that "what we have here is a dead emperor" and so everything is well.  When "Napoleon's" death is announced throughout France, the real Napoleon abruptly remembers his original plan and announces to Pumpkin that it is time for him to take his rightful place on the French throne.  To his fury, Pumpkin is horrified and dismisses him as a delusional lunatic, pleading with him that she loves Eugene, and hates Napoleon.  With no loyalist agent in Paris to vouch for his identity, Napoleon finds himself an Emperor without an army, or a friend.  He is reduced to going to Dr. Lambert, who he realizes stole the portrait, and demanding it back.  When he demands to be told "who I am," Lambert retorts, "I will show you."  In revenge for being beaten to Pumpkin's affections, Lambert lures Napoleon onto the grounds of a [[sanitorium]], where it seems every patient is dressed up as Napoleon, and pretending to be him.  Lambert withdraws, expecting the real Napoleon to be rounded up by the attendants, but a shaken Napoleon escapes the grounds by climbing over the wall, suffering a nasty cut on his hand from the [[chevaux de frise]] on top.  Lambert drops the cameo down a sewer grate.  Emotionally and physically exhausted, Napoleon returns home to Pumpkin's house.  She lovingly tends his wounds, and whispers in his ear, "you are my Napoleon."  While Gerard is looking at a pictorial account of Napoleon's life on a [[magic lantern]], Napoleon tells him the story of what really happened.  It seems that Gerard, if no one else, believes Napoleon's story.  Deciding that he is happiest living a simple life with Pumpkin, Napoleon destroys all his mementos of his former life, except his old [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] uniform, which he leaves at the local military post as a gift for Sgt. Bommell, with a message that "Eugene Lenormand has moved on."  An after-note states that Napoleon Bonaparte lived out the rest of his life in Paris and was buried next to Pumpkin; while Eugene Lenormand's body was brought back to Paris and interred with high honors in [[Les Invalides]].

El Alamein: The Line of Fire
  The film opens in October 1942, when young [[Private (rank)|Private]] Serra ([[Paolo Briguglia]]), a university student from [[Palermo]] who has volunteered for the [[Royal Italian Army|Army]], is sent to join his assignment in the 28th Infantry Regiment of the [[17th Infantry Division Pavia]], deployed near Naqb Rala ([[El Alamein]]). Due to [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy|Fascist propaganda]], he is convinced that [[Alexandria]] will be conquered soon, and the Axis advance into [[Egypt]] will end in victory.  His certainties, however, soon start to crumble when he is confronted with the grim reality of the life in the [[Trench warfare|trench]]es during the [[desert warfare|desert war]]. [[Lieutenant]] Fiore ([[Emilio Solfrizzi]]), the [[platoon]] commander, is unimpressed by Serraâs enthusiasm, and shows little faith in the prospect of a rapid victory; as soon as Serra reaches his [[squad]], the [[corporal]] who has accompanied him is killed by an [[artillery]] shell, and all is left of him is an ear. Serra befriends some members of his platoon, Private Spagna ([[Luciano Scarpa]]), [[Corporal]] De Vita ([[Thomas Trabacchi]]), [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-man Tarozzi ([[Piero MaggiÃ²]]) and especially [[Sergeant]] Rizzo ([[Pierfrancesco Favino]]), his squad commander, a [[Veneto|Venetian]] veteran who has been in Africa for two years; they tell him that each soldier has three "miracles" to spend, before to die. Serraâs first "miracle" has been escaping unharmed the shelling that killed the corporal, while they have long spent their "miracles". The time at the [[front line]] passes among many hardships: the heat is unbearable, [[dysentery]] is rampant, the food is scarce, the little water available tastes like fuel oil; British artillery shells the Italian positions by day, only giving some rest at night, and vipers and scorpions add to the danger represented by the enemy.  One day, a British [[sniper]], lying in ambush behind the wreck of a vehicle, shoots two soldiers, and when two stretcher-bearers try to rescue them, they are shot as well, before Tarozzi kills the sniper with his mortar. On the following night, a British vehicle blows up a mine in the [[no man's land]], and Serra, Rizzo, De Vita and Spagna loot the corpses to retrieve some food. Serra steps on a mine, but it turns out to be an [[anti-tank mine]], calibrated for a much higher weight; his second "miracle".  Two trucks, having lost their way, reach the platoon; Lt. Fiore inspects them and finds out that their cargo consists of boxes of shoe polish and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s horse, in preparation for "the parade in Alexandria". Fiore angrily tells the driver that, if they want to conquer Alexandria, they need to send them weapons, water, ammunition, food, medicines and fresh troops; Tarozzi suggests to kill and eat the horse and Fiore agrees, but nobody feels like killing it, so they let the trucks go with the horse.  Serra, Rizzo, Spagna and De Vita are sent to pick up a truckload of water, 60&nbsp;km behind their lines. The truck driver ironically remarks that they should be given [[grappa]] instead, joking that this is what led to the [[Battle of the Piave River|Italian victory on the Piave river]] during [[World War I]]. On the way back to the frontline, Serra and the others take a detour, and they reach the coast, where they take a bath in the [[sea]] and then rest on the beach, before being discovered by sentries who tell them that they have run through a [[minefield]].  During the following night, while they are on watch, Rizzo tells Serra about how he was captured after the fall of [[Bengasi]], but evaded captivity and hid for three months in a [[brothel]] of Bengasi, before rejoining his company when the city was retaken by Axis forces. He states that being a [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] is a no-life and shameful for a soldier, and, as he had said previously, that he will not surrender again.  Serra discovers a [[camel]] near the trenches; he kills it and the carcass is slaughtered and cooked, allowing the soldiers to eat fresh meat for the first time in months, but when Lt. Fiore is informed, he calls for a [[Military engineering|Engineer]] unit: the animal has been sent by the British to clear a path through the Italian minefields, as is confirmed by the engineers. The engineers inform Fiore and his men that, according to information from the command, the [[Second battle of El Alamein|Allied offensive]] is about to start; they have been finding de-mined areas all along the front.  Serra and Sgt. Rizzo are sent on a mission to the [[Qattara Depression]], with orders to discover why a [[Bersaglieri]] [[outpost (military)|outpost]] has ceased all communications; they find that the squad manning the outpost has been entirely killed. They bury the bodies and they return to their lines. A British artillery bombardment kills or wounds over twenty members of the platoon; De Vita survives unscathed a shell that lands near him, but afterwards he starts behaving strangely, slowly losing his mind.  When the [[Second battle of El Alamein|battle]] begins, Lt. Fioreâs platoon is ordered to take position along the defense line, at "''Quota 105''" (as a reinforcement to the Ruspoli Group of the [[185th Airborne Division Folgore]]), placing themselves in holes dug in the ground, with [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and [[machine gun]]s. During the following night, their positions are subjected to heavy artillery shelling, and then assaulted by Allied [[tanks]] and infantry. The Italians respond with mortars, rifles and machine guns, and both sides suffer heavy casualties; Tarozzi is wounded in an eye, and De Vita, who occupies the same hole as Serra, snaps and climbs out of the hole, starting to walk apathetically; despite Serraâs calls for him to come back, he keeps walking until he disappears amid clouds of sand.  The British attack manages to breach the first line, but it is stopped by artillery and minefields, and then repelled ("maybe this was the third miracle", Serra later tells himself). On the following morning, Serra wanders around the battlefield, littered with corpses of Italian and British soldiers; he remembers that at school he was told that "[[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori|lucky is he who dies a hero]]", but, whilst looking at the corpses scattered on the ground, he reflects "I have seen many of these heroes: they are neither lucky nor unlucky: they are just dead. They rot at the bottom of a pit, without a shred of poetry. Death is only beautiful in schoolbooks: in real life it is pitiful, horrendous, and it stinks". Serra finds Spagna, who has been mortally wounded in the stomach and is being carried away on a stretcher; he, Fiore and Rizzo try to comfort him by lying and saying that, now that he has been wounded, he will go home.   At first, the orders are to hold the line at all costs, "Win or die"; after a few days, however, Lt. Fioreâs platoon is ordered to retreat to Qaret el Khadim, and starts a long march through the desert. During the march, a column of retreating German vehicles passes by without stopping; a German soldier warns the Italians that they "will die here". An overloaded Italian truck also passes by, again refusing to take anyone on board.  They encounter a [[general]] ([[Silvio Orlando]]), who is burying his [[orderly]], killed by an air strike. The general refuses any help, and is left alone; later, at sunset, he finishes burying his orderly and then commits [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head. The platoon reaches Qaret el Khadim, but only finds a [[field hospital]]; a [[medical officer]] ([[Giuseppe Cederna]]) informs them that the new orders are to retreat to [[Fukah|Fuka]] and says that he will wait for the Allies to come, because they will have better means to care for the wounded. The platoon manages to board a truck, but while on the road they are attacked and strafed by a [[Supermarine Spitfire]]; they stop near a shelter, push aside the sentries trying to stop them, and take shelter inside, finding there a [[colonel]] ([[Roberto Citran]]) who says that their retreat is a "strategic disengaging manoeuvre" and that "reinforcements will come". When they leave the shelter after the raid has ended, they discover that their truck has been destroyed.   Lt. Fioreâs platoon begin once more their march in the midst of the desert. A sudden cloudburst gives some relief to the [[dehydration|dehydrated]] men. They encounter a bersagliere on a [[motorcycle]], who tells them that the British forces have already occupied Fuka, and the order is now to retreat to [[Marsa Matruh]] â 100 more kilometres on foot through the desert. The platoon settles near an old [[cemetery]] for the night. During the following night, however, some [[Bren carrier]]s find them, and capture all the survivors except for Fiore, Rizzo, and Serra, who have placed themselves farther away, and are not noticed.  In the morning, the three start up again their march, but Fiore is weakened by an uncared wound, and can barely walk. They reach some vehicles abandoned in the desert; a truck turns out to be unusable, but Serra manages to power up a [[motorcycle]]. Fiore is in too bad a shape to get on the motorcycle, so he tells Rizzo and Serra to leave him and save themselves. Rizzo, however, decides not to abandon Fiore; when Serra says that he wonât go without them, Rizzo forces him to leave. Serra promises that he will find a vehicle and come back for them, then he departs. The film closes on Serra riding away on the motorcycle, while Rizzo waves him farewell and watches as he disappears in the distance.  A final sequence informs about the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] and is followed by images of the [[El Alamein#Italy|Italian War Memorial at El Alamein]]. Here, an aged Serra watches the tombs of Rizzo, Fiore, Spagna and De Vita.  
Enough (film)
 The film begins in a [[Los Angeles]] diner where a waitress, Slim, works with her best friend, Ginny ([[Juliette Lewis]]). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases her about her name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller, reveals that Robbie made a bet that he would be able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie.   Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him, and he admits it, also insisting Darcelle means nothing to him. Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who slaps and punches her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying that he makes the money and gets to do whatever he likes, implying he expects his [[infidelity]] to continue uncontested. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. He further intimidates her by saying "I'm a man. It's no contest."    The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother, and she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of [[physical abuse]] his mother is aware of, which his mother [[Victim blaming|blames on the victim]]. Ginny advises Slim to leave and press charges against Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch might have left town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo. During dinner that night, Mitch further insults Slim for confiding in his mother, while staying civil in front of Gracie.   Having had enough, Slim plans her escape with the help of her friends and [[Step parent|step-father]], Phil. During the late-night attempt, Mitch foils her plan by breaking out of a closet he is hiding in and grabbing her by the hair. He throws her to the ground and begins kicking her in the chest, while Gracie is asleep on the sofa. Slim's friends, waiting outside the house, hear the struggle and break in. Then Mitch threatens them with a gun, before Phil picks up Gracie to use as a witness while exhorting her to look at her father.   Unwilling to shoot the man with Gracie watching him, Mitch lets Slim escape. Slim retreats to a cheap motel, having had her credit cards frozen by Mitch. However, they are only there for a short time before Mitch tracks them down. Slim then goes on the run to [[Seattle]] where she briefly stays with her old boyfriend, Joe. Some of Mitch's friends, disguised as FBI agents, show up at Joe's house claiming to investigate a "kidnapping", implicitly threatening Joe and vandalizing his house.   She leaves Joe behind and, in need of money, goes to her father, Jupiter, who is a wealthy record executive and [[philanderer]]. He is unaware of Slim's existence, when she informs him she is his daughter, he doesn't believe them and gives them only $12, thinking they are homeless and just want money. Slim leaves, disheartened with Jupiter, and moves with Gracie to [[Michigan]]. However, after Jupiter is threatened by Mitch's men, he is piqued by the situation and decides to help. He sends them enough money for a house.  Slim buys a house and changes her name to Erin Ann Shleeter. Although their future looks bright after a visit from Joe, Mitch's friend tracks them down, passing the information on to Mitch. Mitch comes to the area, and hides in Slim's house. As she is going about her morning routine, to her horror, Mitch suddenly appears from the shadows in her hallway, saying he wants to reconcile with Slim, promising "it will be different."  When she refuses, he attacks, waking Gracie, who runs to help her mother, and jerks on his hair.    Mitch flings Gracie to the floor, which creates a diversion, and allows an opportunity for Slim to retaliate with pepper spray. Snatching up Gracie, as Mitch rolls on the floor in pain, she is prepared for a fast get-away, having an escape plan. A car chase ensues between Slim and Robbie, revealed earlier as Mitch's "[[wing man]]" during the encounter at the diner years before, while Gracie screams in the background. After escaping, Slim seeks legal advice from a local law firm. While the lawyer is sympathetic, he informs her that she cannot be legally protected.  Realizing she cannot live her life in fear, Slim goes into hiding in [[San Francisco]]. She hires a woman who looks like her to be a [[decoy]], and sends Gracie away to [[Hawaii]] with her best friend, Ginny, to get her out of harm's way. She prepares herself with a self-defense trainer, who teaches her [[Krav Maga]], since self-defense is not murder. During her training, he gives Slim the final lesson: if Mitch knocks her down, she is to hold on to his voice and awaken when he is about to attack or kick her.   She returns to Los Angeles, breaks into Mitch's new home and waits for him to return home from work. She hides his guns, and blocks the phone connections, so he cannot call the police. When he arrives, Slim makes her presence known once he realizes someone's there. She approaches him to begin fighting, but when he says he cannot hit her, she asks him why he could do it before when she was defenseless. She provokes him, and in the ensuing fight, Slim uses her new skills, beating Mitch until he becomes unconscious.   After an opportunity to kill him with a large brick, she cannot bear to do it and throws the brick away. She calls Ginny saying she cannot kill him, and while on the phone Mitch hits her from behind with a lamp. Slim puts into practice what she learned in her training and trips, beats and kicks him in the chest and sends him off a balcony to his death. She calls the police, who rule her actions as self-defense. With Mitch no longer a threat, Slim and Gracie go on to live a happy life in Seattle with Joe.  
Equilibrium (film)
  Libria, a [[totalitarian state|totalitarian]] city-state, was established by the survivors of [[World War III]], where all emotions and emotionally stimulating objects have been forbidden as they are believed to have led to the war. The population suppresses all emotion by injecting themselves daily with "Prozium II", and "Sense Offenders" â those who choose to experience unlawful emotions or possess objects likely to stimulate emotion â are put to death. Libria is governed by the [[Tetragrammaton]] Council, led by "Father", who is only seen on giant video screens throughout the city spreading propaganda messages. At the pinnacle of Librian law enforcement are the Grammaton Clerics, trained in the martial art of [[Gun fu|gun kata]]. Clerics frequently raid properties in the city and the "Nether" â regions outside the city â to search for and destroy illegal materials (art, literature, and music) and execute the people hiding them. A resistance movement, known as the "Underground", emerges with the goal of toppling Father and the Tetragrammaton Council.  [[File:Flag of Libria (Equilibrium).svg|thumb|left|The flag of Libria. The four Ts on the flag represent the Tetragrammaton Council.]] In 2072, John Preston is a high-ranking Cleric whose wife, Viviana, was executed as a Sense Offender, leaving him a single father of his daughter and son. Following a raid, Preston notices his partner, Errol Partridge, saves a book of poems instead of turning it in for incineration. After tracing Partridge to the Nether and finding him reading the book, Partridge explains that he gladly pays the heavy price of feeling emotions; Preston executes him as he slowly reaches for his gun.  Preston accidentally breaks his daily vial of Prozium but is unable to replace it before going on the next raid. He begins to experience brief episodes of emotion that evoke memories, stir feelings, and make him more aware of his surroundings; he intentionally skips more doses of Prozium and hides them behind the mirror in his bathroom.  Partridge is replaced with career-conscious Brandt, who expresses his admiration for Preston's "uncompromising" work as a cleric. On a raid, they arrest Mary O'Brien, a citizen identified as a Sense Offender. To Brandt's surprise, Preston prevents him from executing O'Brien on the spot, saying she should be kept alive for interrogation; he grows suspicious of Preston's hesitation to do his job completely. As Preston feels remorse for having killed Partridge, he develops an emotional relationship with O'Brien and uncovers clues that lead to meeting Jurgen: the leader of the Underground resistance who plans to have Prozium production disrupted -to spark a populace uprising- and convinces Preston that Father must be assassinated.  Vice-Counsel DuPont meets with Preston to reveal that there is a traitor in the upper ranks of the Clerics. Although DuPont appears to know it is Preston, he assigns him the task of uncovering and stopping the traitor. Relieved, Preston accepts and renews a promise to locate the Underground's leadership. O'Brien is set to be executed and Jurgen advises against interfering, as it could sabotage plans for the revolution but, unable to bear her death, Preston still unsuccessfully tries to stop it. As he has an emotional breakdown in the streets, Brandt arrests him and brings him before DuPont; however, Preston tricks DuPont into believing that Brandt is the traitor. Following Brandt's arrest, Preston is informed that a search of his home will take place as a formality. He rushes home to destroy the hidden vials, only to find his son âwho stopped taking Prozium after his mother diedâ already has.  Jurgen has Preston capture the leaders of the resistance to gain the government's trust and get close enough to Father to assassinate him. As Preston is granted an exclusive audience with Father â really just a projection of Father â he discovers that Brandt was not actually arrested, but was part of a ruse to expose Preston and the Underground. DuPont reveals that he is the real Father -having secretly replaced the original Father after his death- and that he does not take Prozium and can feel emotions. He taunts Preston, asking how it felt to betray the Underground. Enraged, Preston fights his way through an army of bodyguards to DuPont's office and kills Brandt in a [[katana]] battle. DuPont and Preston have a gun kata showdown; Preston wins and DuPont pleads for his life, reminding Preston that he represents life and feeling and asks, "Is it really worth the price?" Responding with Partridge's last words, "I pay it gladly", Preston kills DuPont. He destroys the command center that broadcasts the propaganda from Father; as the Underground carries out the destruction of Prozium manufacturing and storage facilities, he watches the revolution with satisfaction.

Extreme Ops
  Commercial director Ian, Hollywood producer Will, three extreme sports enthusiasts Chloe, Kittie and Silo, cinematographer Mark, and Ian's boss, Jeffery, take their trip to the [[Alps]] for seasonal practice and stunt filming in preparation for filming a daring, yet dangerous big-league advertisement against an actual avalanche. They are flown to a resort under construction for comfort by their helicopter pilot Zoran. On the first night of their stay, as Will and Silo are bluffing, they spot a man with a woman entering a room. Will and Silo, on a dare, secretly videotape the beginning of their affair, but are chased away by a pair of dogs. Will and the team are unaware that the man they videotaped is [[Serbia]]'s most wanted war criminal, Slobodan Pavlov, who was believed to be killed in a plane crash, and that the resort the enthusiasts are residing is actually his hideout; the woman with Pavle is his love interest, Yana (whom Jeffery had encountered on the train en route to the mountain). Pavlov is also accompanied by his henchmen, Ivo, Ratko, Goran, JakÅ¡a and Pavlov's son, Slavko. Will states later in the film that he read about Pavle in a newspaper article. On the second day of filming, the enthusiasts proceed to film the first controlled avalanche. At nightfall, as Will, Chloe, Kittie and Silo play truth or dare in a hot tub Will had heated up using coal, Slavko spies on them. Deducing they had videotaped his father and mistaking them to be members of the CIA, he reports this to Pavle, and recommends killing them swiftly, which Pavle agrees to do.  On the third day of filming, after Ian, Will, Chloe, Kittie, Silo, and Mark head to the mountain again, Jeffery is kidnapped by Slavko and Ivo and is brought before Pavlov. After finding Will's camera and seeing the footage containing the start of the affair, Slavko and Ivo hijack Zoran's helicopter when he returns to the resort, and force Zoran to tell where the group is filming. Once they land on the mountain, Slavko and Ivo confront and hold the group at gunpoint. However, when a perverted Slavko attempts to force Chloe and Kittie to engage in foreplay, a disgusted Ivo pulls a gun on him, which escalates into a Mexican standoff between the two. Mark, who had planted explosives high up the mountain, detonates them on Ian's cue, startling Slavko and Ivo, and causing them to accidentally shoot each other dead. After narrowly escaping an avalanche in the helicopter, the group realize that by accidentally videotaping Pavle, they have jeopardized their own lives and plan an escape.  They return to the resort, but they find Ratko, Goran and JakÅ¡a roving the compound. They manage to subdue Ratko and attempt to escape on a cable car, but Pavlov, having been alerted of the group's presence, takes control of the cable car and has it sent back to the dock. The group make a quick escape and ski further down slope as Pavlov and his henchmen open fire, during which Kittie is nearly shot when they shoot her snowboard apart. They are blocked off by a very steep cliff, and decide to tether down to a gap they intend to use as an escape route. As Will is trying to tether down, Pavlov and his henchmen, after recapturing and killing Zoran, arrive in his helicopter. After throwing Zoran's body out, they open fire upon Will, who parachutes to safety, before concentrating their fire on the rest of the group. Silo manages to throw his snowboard into the helicopter, hitting JakÅ¡a and causing him to fall to his death, but not before he shoots Silo in the abdomen. The remaining henchmen attempt to continue shooting at them, but the helicopter's low fuel lines and the time remaining until nightfall force them to return to the hideout to refuel and wait out the night. Kittie stays behind to tend Silo's wounds, armed with a rocket launcher with only one round while Ian, Chloe and Mark split up to escape.  At the hideout, Pavlov tells Yana he is determined to kill them in an effort to avenge Slavko and Ivo, but then slaps her, threatening to kill her when she negatively mentions his son. After Pavle leaves the room, Yana double crosses him and pleads with Jeffery to take her to New York. Jeffery agrees and they decide to wait until Pavlov and his remaining henchmen leave to track down the team again. Will, who has landed on a tree and stayed hidden throughout the day, manages to free himself and escape. As morning rises, Pavle and his henchmen resume their objective. Hearing the helicopter approaching them, Ian and Chloe escape through another gap while Mark stays behind to set a trap. At the same time, Kittie attempts to fire the rocket into the helicopter, but it misses and nearly hits a cable car carrying Jeffery and Yana. As the helicopter hovers below the edge of a cliff, Mark takes out a string of cable and when he ski-jumps off the cliff, jams the tail rotors with the cable in mid-air before safely landing his jump. This causes the helicopter to spiral out of control and crash on the ledge of a cliff, killing everyone on board. The sound of the explosion causes a massive avalanche, and Ian and Chloe ski for their lives while also successfully video taping it for the commercial by having Chloe ski in front of it. They narrowly manage to take cover behind a rock as the snow nearly engulfs them.  Back in the States, after viewing the commercial to Mr. Imahara and his assistant, Kana, the commercial is met with a positive response and agree to air it on television. Ian then receives a phone call from Kittie, and tells him to look out the window. When he does, he sees that Will, Chloe, Kittie and Silo are on top of a train performing stunts, something they also did at the beginning of the film when they were en route to the Alps. The film ends when the four enthusiasts let go of their skateboards and let them fly through the commercial's billboard, one of which goes through Chloe's mouth as Ian says "There we go again" while smiling.

The night before her discharge from hospital, she sees a shadowy figure accompanying a patient out of the room and the next morning the patient is pronounced dead.  Mun goes to see her doctor's nephew, Dr. Wah, a psychologist, about the strange entities that she has been seeing. He is skeptical at first, but as he gradually develops a closer relationship with her, he decides to accompany her on a trip to northern [[Thailand]] to find Ling, the eye donor. When they ask a village doctor about Ling and her family, he is unwilling to reveal anything but becomes more cooperative when Mun tells him that she sees what Ling used to see. Apparently, Ling had a psychic ability that allowed her to foresee death and disaster. However, her fellow villagers misunderstood her as a jinx and refused to trust her. Once, Ling tried to warn the people about an imminent disaster, but they drove her away in disbelief. When her vision came true, she felt guilty about the deaths and hanged herself. Ling's mother is both depressed and angry with her daughter and has never forgiven Ling for committing suicide, until one night Ling's spirit possesses Mun and attempts suicide.

On the return journey, their bus is caught in a traffic jam and Mun sees hundreds of ghostly figures lumbering on the road. Believing that a catastrophe is approaching, she runs out of the bus and tries to warn everyone to leave, but no one understands her and think that she is insane. In fact, the traffic jam is due to a tank truck that has toppled over and is blocking the road. The truck starts leaking natural gas but nobody notices it. A driver restarts his engine and ignites the gas, causing a chain explosion. Dr. Wah saves Mun from death by shielding her with his body, but Mun is already blinded by glass fragments. In the epilogue, a blind Mun is seen roaming the streets of Hong Kong. Although she has lost her sense of sight again, she is happy that she now has the support and friendship of Dr. Wah.  
Evelyn (film)
 Nine-year-old Evelyn Doyle ([[Sophie Vavasseur]]) and her two brothers, Maurice (Hugh MacDonagh) and Dermot (Niall Beagan) are motherless when their mother abandons the marriage to a drunkard out-of-work father [[Desmond Doyle]] ([[Pierce Brosnan]]). When Desmond's mother-in-law (Claire Mullan) reports the situation to the Irish authorities, a judge decides the children are prohibited by law to being left in broken homes; they are placed in [[Catholic Church|Church-run]] [[Industrial school|orphanages]].  Evelyn's grandfather (Frank Kelly) takes her to the girls orphanage and explains to her that rays of light created by the sun shining in a specific spot through the clouds are called "angel rays"; they indicate that a guardian angel is watching over her. Evelyn finds when she enters the orphanage that conditions are harsh and many have been there for years.  Desmond finds little hope in regaining custody of his children because he cannot afford a lawyer, turns to drink and assaults Father O'Malley. The father punches Desmond. Desmond is helped by the local part-time bartender and chemist, Bernadette (Julianna Margulies). Bernadette tells Desmond to go for help at her brother Michael's (Stephen Rea) office, a [[solicitor]]. He makes it clear to Desmond that he cannot help him until he gets his act togetherâregular income and orderly life. Desmond finds decorating jobs and spends nights singing for tips with his father in the pub where Bernadette works.  Desmond reads in a letter of Evelyn that she has not been adjusting well with Sister Bridget (Andrea Irvine) who beat her when the Sister's authority was questioned. Evelyn objected to Sister Bridget beating her friend who forgot Bible scripture, although the Bible scripture stated that "God is merciful" therefore God would not want Sister Bridget to beat the children for forgetting scripture. While seeking out Evelyn, he finds and shakes the Sister while threatening her never to touch his daughter again or he will "tear her limb from limb."  Desmond returns to drink and after several rampages Bernadette refuses to continue her relationship with him since he needs to shape up. Desmond reforms. The American Nick Barron (Aidan Quinn), and the injured rugby player and rebel lawyer Thomas Connolly (Alan Bates) argue Desmond's court plea for regaining custody of his children; it is rejected and no course of appeal until they decide to bring before the plea is rejected by the courts leading Desmond and his children heartbroken and separated. But, that night (the same night Desmond quits drinking) a gambler rigs Desmond to win copious amounts of money to pay for his legal bills. With nowhere to go though, the case seems hopeless until Connolly comes up with the idea of bringing an entirely new issue to the Supreme Court that the lack of the children's custody by a parent is contrary to the Irish Constitutionâan issue never successfully argued before the Court.  It takes public pressure for the case to be heard before the Court.  Desmond gives compelling testimony. The following day, Evelyn says in court that she told a false story about her bruised face because Sister Bridget exaggerated her interaction with Desmond. Evelyn works herself into a pickle when Angel rays come into the court through the windowsâa sign to her that her grandfather was watching over her. She recants her newly expressed explanation with comebacks that make people chuckle. She then finishes it off with a recitation of a prayer asking to forgive Sister Bridget and ensure the prospering of Ireland and its people. Two of the three judges side with Desmond, the children are returned to him and he falls in love with Bernadette. They are shown on Christmas Day, celebrating as a family. It is this court action that many children in Irish orphanages were returned to their parents after the Irish Children's Act is amended.

Gigi started out as a thief, but because she fell for him and gave him immense luck, Andy gained great success with his extreme good luck in mahjong games and became very rich.  However, he refused to marry Gigi because she, though a nice woman when with him, was a sore loser who threw temper tantrums when on the verge of losing mahjong games. She could not understand that he couldn't stand the way she behaved. As Andy said, her behaviour could be revealed by just playing a game of mahjong where when she lost: She would throw the tables.

FeardotCom
 Mike Reilly is an [[NYPD]] detective who is called to the scene of a mysterious death in the subway system. The victim, Polidori, exhibits bleeding from his eyes and other orifices and, by the frozen look on his face, appears to have seen something horrifying before being hit by a train. Department of Health researcher Terry Huston is intrigued by the find as well, particularly when several more victims show up with identical symptoms.  When a contagious virus is ruled out, Terry and Mike team up to discover what might be killing these people. Initially they are unable to find anything to connect the deaths together; after some more digging for clues, they eventually discover that all of the victims' computers crashed shortly before their passings. They send each of the victims' hard drives to Mike's friend, Denise Stone, who is a forensic specialist.  Denise discovers that all of the victims had visited a website called Feardotcom.com, which depicts [[Voyeurism|voyeuristic]] [[torture murder]]. Upon looking at the site herself, Denise is subjected to various sights and sounds of torture that eventually drive her insane, resulting in her falling to her death from her apartment window.  Mike feels guilty, thinking that he should have never gotten Denise involved in the case. Terry figures out that people who visit the website die within 48 hours, apparently from what they feared most in their lives. Despite such dangerous knowledge, both she and Mike visit the site in order to figure out what is happening.  As they begin to experience paranoia and hallucinations (like the deceased), including that of a young girl and her inflatable ball, they race against time to figure out if any of it has any connection to an extremely vicious serial killer, Alistair Pratt, who's been eluding Mike and the FBI for years.  It is revealed that Feardotcom is, in fact, a ghost site made by one of Pratt's first victims, who is seeking revenge because people watched her being tortured and murdered. She was tortured by Pratt for 48 hours before she begged him to kill her, which explains why the victims have 48 hours to live. Mike and Terry track down Pratt and release the spirit of the murdered girl from the website, which kills Pratt. However, Mike is also killed.  The ending scene shows Terry lying in her bed with her cat.  The phone rings but she hears no one on the line, only online static.  She hangs up and hugs the cat.  
Femme Fatale (2002 film)
 Mercenary thief Laure Ash ([[Rebecca Romijn]]) participates in a diamond heist in [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]. The plan is for Laure to steal valuable diamonds from the ensemble of a female attendant named Veronica ([[Rie Rasmussen]]) while in the middle of seducing her, during which her accomplices "Black Tie" ([[Eriq Ebouaney]]) and Racine (Ãdouard Montrouge) provide various support. However, Laure instead double-crosses her accomplices and escapes to Paris with the diamonds. In Paris, a series of events causes Laure to be mistaken for her own [[doppelgÃ¤nger]], a missing Parisian woman named "Lily" (also portrayed by Romijn) who had recently disappeared. While Laure luxuriates in a tub in Lily's home, the real Lily returns and commits suicide while Laure secretly watches, providing Laure the opportunity to take her identity for good, and she leaves the country for [[United States|America]].  Seven years later, Laure (in her identity as "Lily") resurfaces in Paris as the wife of Bruce Watts, the new American ambassador to France ([[Peter Coyote]]). After arriving in France, a Spanish [[paparazzo]] named Nicolas Bardo ([[Antonio Banderas]]) takes her picture. The picture is displayed around Paris, and Black Tie (who has coincidentally been released from prison seven years after being arrested for the heist) spots Bardo's photo while in the middle of killing a woman, seen talking earlier with Laure at a cafÃ©, by throwing her into the path of a speeding truck. With Laure exposed to her vengeful ex-accomplices, she decides to frame Bardo for her own (staged) kidnapping. Bardo is further manipulated by Laure into following through with the "kidnapping," and in the process, they begin a sexual relationship. The pair eventually meet with Bruce for a ransom exchange; however, Bardo has a crisis of conscience at the last moment and sabotages the scheme. In retaliation, Laure executes both Bruce and Bardo, only to be surprised by her ex-accomplices afterwards who promptly throw her off a bridge to her seeming death.  In an extended [[twist ending]], the entirety of the movie's events after Laure enters the tub in Lily's home are revealed to be a dream. Laure spies Lily entering the home as before, but this time stops her from committing suicide. Seven years later, Laure and Veronica, who is revealed to have been Laure's partner all along, chat about the success of their diamond caper. Black Tie and Racine arrive seeking revenge, but they are killed by the same truck that killed Veronica in Laure's dream. Bardo, witnessing all these events, introduces himself to Laure, swearing that he has met her before, with Laure replying "Only in my dreams."

One day he has a bet with his fianceÃ© and he kisses the hand of Meera who also studies there. Meera feels insulted and she goes to her brother Saud who is the "badmash" of the film.  Saud takes his men and goes to Momi's house and kills his brother and sets his house on fire. And then he kills Noman's sister as well. Since Meera thinks that she was responsible for making Momi's brother kiss her hand, Momi and Noman tries to file case against Saud but Saud hires a police officer who that police officer files a fake case of terrorism against Momi and his mother.

The son takes all four to the master of the tribe and there Momi and Noman tell their stories. Reema and Meera believe them and fall in love with them.  
Fellini: I'm a Born Liar
 [[File:Fellini on set6.jpg|thumb|left|Fellini: "[[Lie]]s are fascinating for what they reveal about the liar."]] A camera tracks crosswise alongside a wide, brightly appointed beach, in what appears to be the dead of winter. No bathers are in sight, only a rolling parade of empty cabanas, with a tranquil blue seascape in the distance beyond. The wistful, melancholy music of [[Nino Rota]] lends these vistas a dreamy familiarity. We then jump from color to luminous black & white, and a quick glimpse of Federico Fellini's 1963 masterpiece, ''[[8Â½]]'', in which the monumentally buxom harlot, La Saraghina, is preparing to perform her rumba on the beach for a flock of fugitive schoolboys. It's the very same beach we were just staring at, but magically denuded of 40 years of succeeding development, and made mythic through the eyes of a master.  From this point of departure, Pettigrew juxtaposes archival footage and fresh interviews with Fellini's collaborators, interspersed with classic clips and the fruits of his own present-day visits to the haunting locales where ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953), ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' (1957), ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960), ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]'' (1969) and other cinematic wonders first came to life. The goal is to fuse these ingredients thematically, to a degree that may better illuminate Fellini's conscience and philosophies. "I am a born liar," the maestro tells us. "For me, the things that are the most real are the ones I invented." In one way or another, Fellini's habit of honestly admitting falsehood is presented, and tested, as the key to his art, and even his spirituality.  Some of the contradictions in Fellini's accounts of himself are just plain funny. "I adore actors", he says. Cut to [[Donald Sutherland]], star of ''[[Fellini's Casanova]]'' (1976), who quietly seethes that "in his relations with actors, Federico was dreadful, a martinet, a tyrant". Yet Sutherland is close to a smile as he recalls and then offers an insight that deepens the film's argument: "Fellini is constantly threatened by his own [[superficiality]], and is constantly running away from it, in the same sense as [[Orson Welles]]. Orson Welles created a lie about himself that was in fact the truth, but he knew that it was a lie he'd created&nbsp;â and once everybody believed it, he found it insupportable."  As the film moves through its final third, the director's early manhood and lifelong collaboration with his actress wife, [[Giulietta Masina]], are evoked through a combination of interviews (particularly with Fellini's boyhood chum Titta Benzi) and clips from ''8Â½'' and ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]''.<ref>[[F. X. Feeney]] observes that "scenes of boyhood lust, grownup sexual mischief and the intimate, truthfully observed emotional life of a longtime married couple reoccur with a passionate regularity in Fellini's films". Quoted in press notes released by First Look Media in 2003.</ref> We tour the stagier sets and sample the less formally scripted scenes which characterize Fellini's later work. These scenes are balanced against the filmmaker's own latter-day musings in such a way that, even if one tends to resist Fellini's later films, one is better able to see and understand them on his terms as part of an inevitable, continuous growth on his part. "Faking things, constantly faking!" says Fellini as we observe in detail his skillfully crafted, openly false, studio-built seascapes.  The film ends full circle at the seascape where it began except that, now, the remnant of an abandoned camera-track is aimed straight into the sea. On the ambiguity of this final image, critic [[F. X. Feeney]] wrote: "Is this substitution of a real sea for the imaginary ones we've been sailing for the past hour and forty minutes a critique, a refutation of Fellini's beloved fakery? Or is it a validation&nbsp;â an invitation to enter the reality at which those fancies were ultimately aimed? In keeping with the maestro's elusive art, the image is a deliberate paradox."<ref name="autogenerated2003">Quoted in Feeney, ''Press Notes'' (First Look Media, 2003).</ref>  
Fine Dead Girls
 Iva and Marija, who are a [[lesbian]] couple, rent an apartment in Zagreb in a building that seems to be quiet and a safe environment for their love. But as time passes by, the atmosphere in the house gets more and more aggressive.   Elder Olga is dominating the house. Other tenants include her calm husband and her grown-up son Daniel (who has a crush on Iva), the prostitute Lidija, an abused housewife, a widower keeping the corpse of his newly deceased wife, a gynecologist performing abortions in one flat of the house and an ex-soldier who regularly plays martial music at night. The characters are meant to display the madness of the post [[Croatian War of Independence|war]] Croatian society.   The conservative religious father of Marija is secretly tracing his daughter and pays Lidija to try to seduce Iva, which fails.  After Olga finds out that Iva and Marija are lesbians, the situation escalates to rape, murder and kidnapping.  
The Final Curtain (film)
 The film begins with novelist Jonathan Stitch describing the story of veteran game show host and entertainer J. J. Curtis. Curtis receives the unwelcome news from his Harley Street doctor that he has cancer. Later that day while watching television, Curtis sees acclaimed novelist Jonathan Stitch's acceptance speech for an award he gained at a prestigious book awards ceremony. The speech that Stitch makes reminds Curtis of the fact that his time is short, and that immortality can be achieved through the printed word. Curtis then approaches Stitch and asks him to help him with the creation of a biography of his life. Stitch is initially reluctant, but is persuaded.  As Stitch delves into the veteran entertainer's life, he encounters some quite unsavory characteristics and events from the past, including the mysterious circumstances surrounding the injury of Monty Franklin, a fellow performer on a 1973 variety show bill.  Stitch later tries to resign from the task, but having been tricked into believing Curtis's doctor to be a stalker, and having hit him with a dustbin lid outside Curtis's home (resulting in a coma from which he does not recover) Curtis threatens to reveal Stitch's role if he doesn't complete the book.   An increasingly bitter rivalry develops between Curtis and Dave Turner, host of a downmarket game show called ''Current Account'', in which contestants are invited to subject family members to shocks of higher voltage in exchange for larger cash prizes.  Turner was originally introduced to a TV audience by Curtis at a royal variety performance some years earlier, and he therefore resents Turner's challenge in both a ratings war and as competition for a deal to syndicate their respective shows in America.

Febbre da cavallo - La mandrakata
     
The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest
 Garcia stars as Andy Kasper, a man who gives up his cushy marketing job to do something more fulfilling. He gets himself hired at LaHonda Research Institute where Francis Benoit ([[Enrico Colantoni]]) assigns him to design the PC99, a [[personal computer|PC]] to sell for $99. He moves into a run-down apartment building where he meets his lovely artist next-door neighbor Alisa ([[Rosario Dawson]]), and puts together a team of unassigned employees: Salman Fard ([[Anjul Nigam]]), a short, foreign man with an accent who is hacking into [[CIA]] files when Andy meets him; Curtis "Tiny" Russell ([[Ethan Suplee]]), a [[obesity|massively obese]], [[anthropophobia|anthropophobic]] man; and Darrell ([[Jake Busey]]), a tall, blond, pierced, scary, germophobic, deep-voiced man with personal space issues who regularly refers to himself in the third person.  The team finds many non-essential parts but cannot come close to the $99 mark. It is Salman's idea to put all the software on the [[internet]], eliminating the need for a [[hard drive]], [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], a [[CD-ROM]] drive, a [[floppy disk|floppy drive]], and anything that holds information. The computer has been reduced to a microprocessor, a monitor, a [[computer mouse|mouse]], a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], and the [[internet]], but it is still too expensive. Having seen the rest of his team watching a [[hologram]] of an attractive lady the day before, in a [[dream]] Andy is inspired to eliminate the monitor in favor of the cheaper holographic projector. The last few hundred dollars comes off when Darrell suggests using [[virtual reality]] gloves in place of a mouse and keyboard. Tiny then writes a "hypnotizer" code to link the gloves, the projector, and the [[internet]], and they're done.  But immediately before he finishes, the whole team (except for Tiny, who is still writing the code) quits LaHonda after being told that there are no more funds for their project, but sign a non-exclusive patent waiver, meaning that LaHonda will share the patent rights to any technology they had developed up to that point. After leaving LaHonda, they pitch their product to numerous companies, but do not get accepted, mainly because:  *the prototype emagi ('''e'''lectronic '''magi'''c) as it was now called, was ugly, and *something always seemed to go wrong during the demonstration of their product.  They have almost given up hope, when in comes the lovely next-door neighbor Alisa again, whose relationship with Andy has been growing steadily. She improves its look, and when called back by an executive from one of the companies they had pitched to, to whom they had said that their design teams were working on a cosmetic model that would be ready in a couple of days when she commented, "You haven't given much thought to the look of it."  After meeting with her, they agree to give her 51% of their company in exchange for getting their product manufactured and for getting Andy's Porsche bought back, which he had had to sell in order to raise money to build a new emagi after leaving LaHonda. Unfortunately, she then sells the [[patent rights]] to the emagi to Francis Benoit, who plans to sell the emagi at $999 a piece and reap a huge profit. The team interrupts the meeting in which Benoit is going to introduce the emagi to the world and introduces an even newer computer he and his team developed and manufactured at LaHonda, which was in a state of disaster when they arrived. It was a small silver tube that projected a [[hologram]] and [[lasers]] which would detect where the hands were, eliminating the need even for [[virtual reality]] gloves. Also, Andy reminds Benoit of the non-exclusive patent waiver, which had even been Benoit's idea in the first place.

Eight-year-old Garnet struggles to comprehend the world around him, while sixteen-year-old Flower seeks love with her new boyfriend. Forced to become a real parent to Garnet, Ed buys Garnet a gun and shows, for the first time, his real affection for the boy.  
The Flying Car
 While stuck in a traffic jam, Dante and Randal have another philosophical, pop culture-laden conversation â this one sparked when Randal asks Dante what he would [[Hypothesis|hypothetically]] sacrifice in exchange for marketing rights to a [[Flying car (fiction)|flying car]] from ''[[The Jetsons]].'' The hypothetical scenarios Randal continues to suggest grow increasingly ridiculous, culminating in Dante agreeing to have his foot cut off with a hacksaw, get knocked out, and get molested by the German inventor and his friends in exchange for the flying car. Randal expresses disgust that Dante would do it with a bunch of guys to get a car.  
The Formula (2002 film)
 The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled "Bond of the Force". Gregory (Abe Peterka) plays [[Jacen Solo]], and Jennifer (Rebecca Peterka) plays the offscreen voice of [[Jaina Solo]]. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for [[Anakin Solo]], but only encountering a [[Sith Lord]] named Darth Katai, played by Zarth (Justin Whitlock). The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom "[[Tom Servo|Servo]]" Harrison (Chris Hanel). Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'', with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project.  Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the [http://www.guzer.com/jokes/starwarspantsjoke.php Star Wars pants game]. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the [[trekkies]]âspecifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James (James Kropa) and Stewart (Michael Mulherin). The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm.  Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth sit around discussing ideas for a plot for their fanfilm, deciding against a story about a mischievous not-good-but-not-evil Jedi, a story about a post-''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' Boba Fett (sitting on his ass watching [[Jerry Springer]] all day), a story about all the sith in the galaxy competing for the master-and-apprentice positions, and a rock musical. Tom doesn't want to do just another lightsaber duel film, which had become a cliche in Star Wars fan films by that point, but because no one can agree on any of the other ideas, they decide to do a duel after all, much to Tom's frustration. Tom approaches the reluctant Trekkies to do the visual effects, offering them ten percent of his store credit (which was all already spent on the lightsabers). Tom ends up spending all his money on preproduction for the film, and finds himself no longer able to afford film school. He has a nightmare about his film being terrible, with poorly-rotoscoped lightsabers and a soundtrack by [[Meco]].  Back in the present, Zarth tells Tom he needs to "pull his head out". An irate Tom grabs a prop lightsaber, and the two enter a ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]''-inspired lightsaber duel fantasy sequence. When Zarth beats Tom, he asks him, "Do you think that's a ''real'' lightsaber you're holding?" Tom realizes he's been taking himself and the film too seriously, and has lost any sense of fun.  On their way back to Excalibur Games, Tom and Zarth are stopped by [[Greedo]]. Greedo and Tom begin to play out a homage to Greedo's scene in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', until Zarth interrupts and points out that the gag has already been doneâin ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20071109104800/http://www.theforce.net/fanfilms/shortfilms/crapisode/ Crapisode One]''. Back at Excalibur, the gang shows Greedo the scene in question. He flips out, complaining that a lightsaber fight is so overdone, but one Greedo scene is done before and suddenly it's off-limits. Jenny explains that a lightsaber duel is a formula, and can be personalized, but they can't add anything to a Greedo scene, because "in the end, you always wind up dead," which Greg then proves by shooting Greedo in the head.  Later that night, the gang is eating pizza, and Tom apologizes to the others for his behavior. When it is revealed that Tom had dressed up as [[Darth Maul]] for the midnight showing of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I â The Phantom Menace]]'', Tom recounts the story in a soliloquy reminiscent of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Tom then reveals how much he hated the movie, and how mad he was at George Lucas. Later, when he met his friends, he realized that no movie would have met his expectations. Now, he just wants to finish his fanfilm.  The gang finishes shooting the duel, and holds the premiere in the store. Everybody is excited watching the film. After everybody else goes home, Tom reflects on the point of making a Star Wars fanfilmâto have fun. Your film may not be perfect, but you shouldn't care what others think, because in the end, "it's only a movie."

Frida
 ''Frida'' begins just before the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic accident Frida Kahlo ([[Salma Hayek]]) suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through [[convalescence]], her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a [[live action]] scene with actors.  ''Frida'' also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the [[mural]]ist [[Diego Rivera]] ([[Alfred Molina]]). When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the [[bisexuality|bisexual]] Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera.  The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' at the [[Rockefeller Center]]. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a [[miscarriage]], and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his [[communist]] vision of the work to the needs of the patron, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] ([[Edward Norton]]); as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two.  Kahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their [[San Ãngel]] studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into [[alcoholism]]. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house [[Leon Trotsky]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]), who has been granted [[political asylum]] in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his [[CoyoacÃ¡n]] home.  Kahlo leaves for Paris after Diego realizes she was unfaithful to him with Trotsky; although Rivera had little problem with Kahlo's other affairs, Trotsky was too important to Rivera to be intimately involved with his wife. When she returns to Mexico, he asks for a divorce. Soon afterwards, Trotsky is murdered in [[Mexico City]]. Rivera is temporarily a suspect, and Kahlo is incarcerated in his place when he is not found. Rivera helps get her released.  Kahlo has her toes removed when they become [[gangrene|gangrenous]]. Rivera asks her to remarry him, and she agrees. Her health continues to worsen, including the amputation of a leg, and she ultimately dies after finally having a [[solo exhibition]] of her paintings in Mexico.

  A group of high school seniors decide to create a secret society and have fun cruising around campus, pulling pranks and having poker parties in an abandoned boiler room.   However, the circle decides to escalate things, by cheating on an exam.  They all get "A"'s, but Mr. Spencer Runcie is convinced that they cheated, but just cannot prove it.  The circle of friends and every other student who got an "A" are sent before an honor committee, where someone does name one name: Frazier, who is expelled.  Although Runcie will not say who the rat is, the circle suspects that it is the nerdy Faulkner.   His roommate and fellow circle member, Alex, who has been helping Faulkner impress a girl, Tess, with some love letters, assures his fellow circle members that Faulkner is not the rat.  However, one of the circle members is convinced that Faulker is the rat, and when Faulkner is found in the river and dies soon afterwards, Alex is convinced that he was murdered by someone in the circle.  His suspicions are rejected by the administration, until the police get involved, and one circle member, Jetson Harlow, is arrested, but later released. When the circle learns that Smitty was the rat, they decide to kidnap Smitty and force him to confess to the murder.  Smitty does so, and confesses to having dressed up as a lady and having some type of sexual relationship with Runcie.  Smitty killed Faulkner because he was convinced that Faulkner knew that he was the rat, and told Runcie about it after the fact.   Runcie is wounded in a fight between him and Smitty, and the police arrive in time to arrest Smitty, and to take Runcie to the hospital.  Having been able to avoid being expelled for cheating, the remaining circle of friends graduate.  
The Four Feathers (2002 film)
 Harry Faversham, a young British officer completing his training, celebrates his engagement to Ethne, in a ball with his fellow officers and father. When the Colonel announces that the regiment is being dispatched to Egyptian-ruled [[Sudan]] to rescue the British General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles "Chinese" Gordon]], young Faversham has serious ethical reservations about the war, and resigns his commission. Harry's father disowns him. Perceiving his resignation as cowardice, three of his friends and his fiancÃ©e each give him a [[white feather]], the symbol of cowardice. Ethne breaks off their engagement.  Harry learns that his best friend Jack and his former regiment have come under attack by rebels. Undertaking the perilous journey into the Sudan alone, he strikes up an alliance with Abou Fatma, a mercenary warrior. Harry disguises himself as an Arab. Harry and Abou Fatma follow a group of army workers he believes to be Mahdi spies, and reach the garrison of [[Abu-Klea]], which they realise has been overrun. Harry begs Abou Fatma to warn his friends that their destination is under siege and an attack is likely.  The regiment stopped its march to bury a group of British killed by the Mahdi. Abou Fatma is captured by Egyptian soldiers; believing he is an enemy scout, they bring him before the British officers. He tells the British that he has been sent by a British officer to warn them of the Mahdi's attack. He says that Muslims always bury their dead and that of the enemy, but that these bodies have been left to keep the British occupied. Faversham's comrades are worried, but ultimately they disregard Abou Fatma's warnings and he is flogged as a suspected spy.  The British and Egyptian troops are not prepared for battle. The Mahdi rebels attack with spearmen, riflemen and cavalry, while the British forces form a defensive square. Firing volley after volley, the British repel the initial Mahdi assault just as they spot British cavalry reinforcements in their distinctive red uniforms. A force of skirmishers is sent to pursue the retreating Sudanese, but they are ambushed by Mahdi rebels and forced to fight on foot. Soon the British discover that the cavalry whom they thought were reinforcements are Sudanese disguised in British uniforms. Among them is Faversham. The British square reorganises and fires a few volleys, in the process killing several [[skirmisher]]s who have not yet returned to the square, including Edward Castleton who had given Harry a feather. Jack attempts to rescue Castleton in the process but is blinded when his rifle misfires. The British issue an order for retreat.  Harry finds Jack during the battle and protects him after he was blinded. Harry finds letters from Ethne to Jack, but cares for his friend without identifying himself. Never knowing his rescuer, Jack is transported to England. He asks Ethne to marry him, but she does not answer and discusses it with Harry's father.  Tom, another officer, tells Jack that Harry had visited him in the Sudan and told him he had sent Abou to warn the British, and was bitter that his friends had not heeded him. Harry asked Tom for money and explained that he believes Trench lives on in the notorious Mahdi prison of [[Omdurman]], saying he believed Trench was being held in the Mahdi prison, and he was determined to rescue him. Abou advised Harry against this venture, but he goes anyway.  Later Abou rescues Harry and Trench by giving them a poison to fake their deaths. A suspicious guard follows the removal of the bodies, along with three other guards. Harry and Abou kill the four. Abou returns to the desert, and Harry escorts Trench back to Britain. Harry is acknowledged by his father and Ethne reclaims her feather, as Harry has proved his bravery. She has become engaged to Jack.  Jack learns that Harry was his rescuer when he happens to touch his face; he releases Ethne from their engagement. After a ceremony of remembrance, Harry and Ethne hold hands and are engaged again.  
Friday After Next
 The movie begins when a robber ([[Rickey Smiley]]), disguised as [[Santa Claus]], breaks into Craig ([[Ice Cube]]) and Day-Day's ([[Mike Epps]]) house at 3:37 AM on Christmas Eve. Craig fights with the robber, trashing their apartment while making frantic, futile attempts to wake Day-Day. The robber escapes with Craig and Day-Day's Christmas presents and rent money. The same morning, the police come over to get a report.   After the police leave, Ms. Pearly ([[Bebe Drake]]) comes in and says that if the two do not pay their rent money by the end of the day, she will evict them. Furthermore, she promises to send her [[homosexual]] [[ex-convict]] son, Damon ([[Terry Crews]]), who just got out of prison after twelve years, after them if they do not pay in a timely manner. The same day, Craig and Day-Day get jobs as "Top Flight Security Guards" from Moly ([[Maz Jobrani]]), the property manager and owner of a notoriously squalid doughnut shop and the shopping center that they are assigned to patrol.   Later that day, they meet Donna ([[K.D. Aubert]]) and Money Mike ([[Katt Williams]]), who run a fledgling shop called 'Pimps and Hoes.' The shopping center is also the home of a BBQ rib restaurant called 'Bros. BBQ', owned by the cousins' fathers, Willie ([[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]) and Elroy ([[Don "D.C." Curry]]).   A couple of baseheads try to rob Money Mike's store and Craig and Day-Day catch them both. Mike offers them a cash reward, but Craig denies it and instead invites him to his party. Willie and Elroy are having trouble with some of the children. When one of them kicks Elroy, he retaliates by taking out a belt and starts a series of beatings on the kids. Then, a gang of thugs, supposedly the grandsons of some carolers that were chased off by Day-Day for loitering in front of the corner store, begin to chase Craig and Day-Day, but, unable to catch them, they proceed to beat Moly for hiding them, resulting in the two quitting after witnessing what happened to Moly, throwing their uniform's in the dumpster and ultimately getting fired from their jobs. As revenge, Willie rats Moly out to the Department of Health.  Craig and Day-Day throw a [[rent party]] later that night to recoup their stolen money and stay in their apartment. While Money Mike is in the restroom, Damon attempts to sexually assault him, but fails when Money Mike grabs his testicles with pliers. Damon then proceeds to chase him when he tries to run away. Also Ms. Pearly comes on to Craig's father when he uses her bathroom, causing Craig's mother to attack Ms. Pearly when she catches the two. Craig and Day-Day see the robber and give chase, running into other obstacles and are ultimately unsuccessful. Eventually, the robber gets run over by Pinky's limousine.   The movie then ends when Craig and Day-Day retrieve their Christmas presents and tie and gag the robber up on a chimney. During the credits, it is revealed that Craig and Donna hooked up after Craig returned, Damon is still chasing Money Mike throughout the hood, and that Ms. Pearly tried to stop the party by calling the police, but they left after receiving marijuana as a bribe.  
Frankenthumb
 The scene opens in the funeral where a burial is taking place. The dead man's brother tells of his sibling's unfortunate life before confiding tearfully to the preacher that "He owed me money!" The session ends when a rat scares the mourners away. Dr. Frankenthumb(Dr. Frankenstein) and his hunchbacked assistant Humpy (a parody of the '[[Igor (fictional character)|Igor]]' character) dig up the grave and, prying open the coffin, the doctor gleefully proclaims "We'll use his bun cheeks!" Back at his secret lab, Dr. Frankenthumb combines the parts of several people (including, of course, the "Bun cheeks of that guy from the opening scene"). Although their first attempt results in the creature's body being seared to the bone by lightning, the second attempt is a success; the creature awakens and attacks Humpy. The Doctor happily declares, "We shall call him Pepper...because he really spiced up our lives!" Frankenthumb and Humpy attempt to make Pepper docile by presenting him with several animals (two birds, a puppy, a turtle, and a bunny among others), but ultimately he ends up smashing them in his hands. Tearfully, Dr. Frankenthumb has Humpy imprison the "Monster" in the dungeon. Eventually, Pepper's cries of anguish (and Humpy's persistence) drive the Doctor to conclude that the Monster must be destroyed. However, Humpy's taunting drives Pepper to break out of his bonds and escape. Soon, the villagers get suspicious of Pepper's doings and create an angry mob and chase after him. Frankenthumb tells the mob that he is the one who created the Creature, and that it is his responsibility to lead the mob to it so that it can be destroyed. They chase Pepper down to an old windmill and begin to burn it down. But Dr. Frankenthumb is upset by the mob "scaring him". When he realizes that he cannot stop the mob he returns to the castle to awaken another creature, "Franken-Bat-Thumb" (based on the character from the eponymous short film "[[Bat Thumb]]") in order to rescue Pepper. Franken-Bat-Thumb extinguishes the fire and the three (Dr. Frankenthumb, Pepper, and Franken-Bat-Thumb) decide to band together to create a new [[global empire]], warning the villagers that "Anyone who attempts to get in our way shall be promptly told not to". One of the villagers decide to join them and thus becoming the 4th Musketeer.

Gacaca, Living Together Again In Rwanda?
 The first film in this award-winning trilogy ventures into the rural heart of Rwanda. Follow the first steps in one of the worldâs boldest experiments in reconciliation: the Gacaca (Ga-CHA-cha) Tribunals. These are a new form of citizen-based justice aimed at unifying this country of 8 million people after the 1994 genocide which claimed over 800,000 lives in 100 days. While world attention is focused on the unfolding procedures, award-winning documentarian Anne Aghion bypasses the usual interviews with politicians and international aid workers, skips the statistics, and goes directly to the emotional core of the story, talking one-on-one with survivors and accused killers alike. In this powerful, compassionate and insightful film, with almost no narration, and using only original footage, she captures first-hand how ordinary people struggle to find a future after cataclysm.  
Gangs of New York
 In the [[slum]] neighborhood of [[Five Points, Manhattan]] in 1846, two [[gang]]s have engaged in a final battle (or "challenge") in Paradise Square over "who holds sway over the Five Points"; these two factions participating in this event are the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] "Natives" led by William "Bill the Butcher" Cutting, and the [[Irish Catholic]] group of immigrants, the "[[Dead Rabbits]]", led by "Priest" Vallon. At the end of this battle, Bill kills Vallon and declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed. Having witnessed this, Vallon's young son hides the knife that killed his father and is taken to an [[orphanage]] on [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]].  Sixteen years later, Vallon's son, using the alias of Amsterdam, returns to Five Points seeking revenge and retrieves the knife. An old acquaintance, Johnny Sirocco, familiarizes him with the local clans of gangs and thieves, all of whom pay tribute to Bill, who controls the neighborhood. Amsterdam is finally introduced to Bill, but keeps his past a secret, seeking to be recruited. He learns that many of his father's former loyalists are now in Bill's employ. Each year, Bill celebrates the anniversary of his victory over the Dead Rabbits; Amsterdam plans to murder him secretly during this celebration.  Amsterdam becomes attracted to [[pickpocketing|pickpocket]] and [[confidence trick|grifter]] Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is infatuated. Amsterdam gains Bill's confidence and Bill becomes his mentor, involving him in the dealings of corrupt [[Tammany Hall]] politician [[William M. Tweed]]. Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt, and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion.  On the evening of the anniversary, Johnny, in a fit of jealousy over Jenny, reveals Amsterdam's true identity and intentions to Bill. Bill baits Amsterdam with a [[knife throwing]] act involving Jenny. As Bill toasts Priest Vallon, Amsterdam throws his knife, but Bill deflects it and wounds Amsterdam with a counter throw. Bill proclaims that rather than dying, Amsterdam shall live in shame, and burns his cheek with a hot blade. Going into hiding, Jenny nurses Amsterdam back to health and implores him to escape with her to [[San Francisco]].  Amsterdam, however, returns to the Five Points seeking vengeance, and announces his return by hanging a dead rabbit in Paradise Square. Bill sends Mulraney to investigate, but Amsterdam kills him and hangs his body in the square. In retaliation, Bill has Johnny severely beaten and run through with a pike, leaving it to Amsterdam to end his suffering. The incident garners newspaper coverage, and Tweed presents Amsterdam with a plan to defeat Bill's influence: Tweed will back the candidacy of Monk McGinn for sheriff. Monk wins in a landslide, and a humiliated Bill murders him. McGinn's death prompts an angry Amsterdam to challenge Bill to a gang battle in Paradise Square for order, in which Bill accepts.  [[New York City draft riots|City draft riots]] break out just as the gangs are preparing to fight, and [[Union Army]] soldiers are deployed to control the rioters. As the rival gangs face off, cannon fire from naval ships is fired directly into Paradise Square, interrupting their battle shortly before it begins. Between the cannons, soldiers, and rioters, many of the gang members are killed. Bill and Amsterdam face off against one another until Bill is severely wounded by a piece of shrapnel. He is finally killed by Amsterdam, who, along with Jenny, leaves New York and starts a new life in San Francisco.  
The Gamers (film)
 The movie flips between following a group of [[gamer]]s in a dorm immersed in a role-playing game, and their characters (played by the same actors) as they journey through a world of fantasy and wonder to defeat a being known as "The Shadow" and rescue a princess. The latter is theoretically a heroic quest, but while the game master attempts to foster in a narrative, the players tend to be more interested in their characters' tolerance for ale, trying to apply the sneak attack damage multiplier to [[Ballista|siege weaponry]], et cetera.  The movie both makes fun of gamer stereotypes and plays the discrepancy between an optimal RPG plot and the events of an actual RPG session for maximum absurdity. Characters attempting something dangerous freeze as dice clatter in the distance. The party thief [[Pickpocketing|picks the pocket]] of a bystander, then steals that bystander's [[trousers|pants]]ânot because he wants the pants in any way, but solely to see if his skill statistics allow it.  When an unlucky dice roll causes the death of one character, the other players' characters mourn him for a moment, and then immediately start squabbling over the items he was carrying.  Characters spring to action, then keel over as their players forget and are reminded that the characters are asleep, players argue and make snack runs, and their game is frequently interrupted by a girl from the same dorm who demands they keep quiet so that she can study.  The Shadow is eventually defeated, after a long quest, and the characters find themselves in a strange tunnel.  On the other side of the door, they hear voicesâthe voices of their players, who are narrating the action in the hallway outside.  Bursting into the room (as dictated by the players), the characters slaughter the gamers, then begin picking over the room for treasure.  Discovering that their entire adventure has been documented by the 'strange sorcerers' they've just slain, they discover their character sheets (which inadvertently insults the group's warrior, because his Intelligence statistic is only 4).  In the midst of these revelations, the 'Princess' (the girl who needs to study and is constantly interrupted by the gamers' noise) bursts in and reads them the riot act, thinking their outfits to be mere costumes; after she leaves, the adventurers seem quite stunned that their beloved Princess has such a foul mouth and temper.  
Gemini (2002 Tamil film)
 Teja ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]) is a high-profile gangster in North Madras who often imitates the behavior characteristics of different animals for sarcastic effect. Accompanied by his gang, he arrives at a [[magistrate's court]] for a hearing. His animal antics are mocked at by "Chintai" Jeeva, another accused. Teja and his gang retaliate and kill Jeeva within the court premises. Jeeva was a member of a rival gang headed by Gemini ([[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]]), an aspiring goon from [[Chintadripet]] who wants to dethrone Teja and take his place. To avenge Jeeva's death, Gemini hunts down the murderer Pandian while Isaac (Isaac Varghese), one of Gemini's men, kills him. This incident leads to a feud between Gemini and Teja, and a fight for supremacy ensues. Pandian's mother Annamma ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]), a destitute woman, locates the whereabouts of her son's murderers. She approaches Gemini, becomes the gang's cook, and awaits a chance to poison them.  Gemini meets and falls in love with Manisha ([[Kiran Rathod]]), a free-spirited college girl. To pursue her, he joins an evening class at her college and she falls in love with him, unaware of his true identity. Two businessmen approach Gemini to evict traders from a market so that a shopping complex can be built in its place. As the market is in his control, Gemini refuses the offer, and the businessmen hire Teja to execute the job. Feigning an altercation with Gemini, his sidekick Kai ([[Thennavan (actor)|Thennavan]]) joins Teja's gang, acts as the inside man, and foils the plan. Teja becomes enraged at being outsmarted by Gemini.  Singaperumal ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]), an astute police officer, is promoted to the position of [[Director General of Police]] (DGP). Keen on eradicating crime, he arrests both Gemini and Teja, and the arrests are made "off the record" owing to their political influence. Aware of the rivalry between them, Singaperumal puts them in a private cell so they can beat each other to death. While Teja tries to exact revenge for the market issue, Gemini does not fight back but persuades Teja to trick Singaperumal by pleading guilty and requesting a chance to reform. Gemini's trick works, and they are released.  Since Gemini was arrested at the college, Manisha discovers his identity and resents him. To regain her attention, Gemini reforms his ways. Though his gang initially disapproves of it, they relent. As Gemini and his gang regret their actions, Annamma reveals her true identity and forgives them. Singaperumal helps Gemini get back into college and reunite with Manisha. Teja returns to his gang and continues his illegal activities. He pesters Gemini to help him in his business. Gemini informs Singaperumal of Teja's activities; Teja is caught smuggling narcotics, is prosecuted, and serves a term in prison.  A few months later, Singaperumal is transferred, and a corrupt officer ([[Vinu Chakravarthy]]) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja, and together, they urge Gemini to work for them and repay for the losses they incurred, but Gemini refuses. To force him to return to his old ways, Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against Gemini. With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. Gemini is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, Gemini beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots Gemini dead; he later realizes that he had actually shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to the Sewage Control Board.

Over the next couple of days, the two hikers wander through the wilderness without food or water. They try to split up for a while, retrace their steps and follow some animal tracks, all to no avail.

A young girl, Katie Harwood, sits alone until the ship's captain offers to dance with her on the exterior dance floor. Elsewhere, a hand presses a lever that unravels a thin wire cord from a spool. The spool snaps and the wire whips across the dance floor, bisecting the dancers.  Forty years later, at a bar, a boat salvage crew â Captain Sean Murphy, Maureen Epps, Greer, Dodge, Munder, and Santos â celebrate their recent success. Jack Ferriman, a Canadian weather service pilot, approaches them and says he spotted a vessel adrift in the [[Bering Sea]].

The captain explains that they recovered the gold from a sinking cruise ship, the ''Lorelei'', along with a sole survivor. Murphy is shown a picture of the survivor, whom he recognizes. He rushes to tell the others, but begins hallucinating and sees everyone as the ghost of the burned Santos, who provokes him into a murderous rage. The others think Murphy has gone mad and lock him in the drained fish tank, where Epps later finds him drowned.  Epps meets Katie's ghost, who reveals what happened on the ''Graza''. The sole survivor of the ''Lorelei'' convinced the ''Graza'''s crew to murder the passengers for the gold. Once the passengers were killed, the crew turned on one another; soon, only a single officer was left, but he was later killed by Francesca. Another man, the mastermind behind the massacre, then killed Francesca by mystical means and branded her palm with a hook-shaped symbol using only his hands. The man is revealed as Jack Ferriman, who is actually a demonic spirit. Epps deduces that Ferriman lured the salvage team to the ''Graza'' to repair it, and decides to sink it to thwart his plan. While Munder is crushed under the ship's gears while scuba diving in a flooded area, Epps tells Dodge to keep Jack on the ship's bridge while she secretly sets explosives. When Ferriman realizes that Dodge is on to his secret, he walks towards Dodge while insulting him for not being man enough to act upon his feelings for Epps. Dodge threatens to shoot Ferriman, who simply smiles and says that murderers go to hell. Dodge shoots and Ferriman is seemingly killed.  Epps is below decks setting explosives when she is confronted by Dodge. He tells her he has killed Ferriman and that they can salvage the gold to start a life together, but Epps is made suspicious by this unexpected romantic proposal and Dodge's apparent knowledge of the deaths of the rest of the crew despite not being told of them. Realizing that his ruse has failed, "Dodge" morphs into Jack Ferriman, who has killed the real Dodge. Ferriman describes himself as a salvager of souls, a job he earned by a lifetime of sin. He plans to use the ''Antonia Graza'' and the gold as a trap to continue collecting souls. Only the souls of sinners can be readily controlled, through the mark he brands them with, and as long as the ''Graza'' is kept afloat the soul of everyone who has died aboard the ship will be dragged down when Ferriman has filled his quota and returns to Hell, something which will please the "management". He offers to spare Epps's life in exchange for her not interfering but she detonates the explosives. Ferriman is blown to pieces in the explosion and Katie helps Epps escape the sinking ship. Katie wordlessly bids farewell to Epps before she and the other unmarked souls trapped on the ship ascend to Heaven.  Drifting on the open sea, Epps is found by a cruise ship and returned to land. As she is loaded into an ambulance, she sees the battered crates of gold being loaded onto the cruise ship by crewmen overseen by Ferriman, who glares at her and carries on; she screams as the ambulance doors close.

Ginostra
 As the film opens, we learn that Benson, a New Yorker, has been entrusted with protecting the 11-year-old boy. The style of the film is intentionally ambiguous, and details about only obtained through the dialogue between the main characters, in many cases, in a way that only makes sense once later scenes are viewed. The boy, as is revealed later, is with Benson because his father had appealed for protection from the authorities in return for his testimony against a local mobster, Manzella. The title of the film refers to the location of the main characters, who live on an island that is remote enough from the mainland that fresh water must be shipped in. Also on the island is a mysterious convent of nuns who make a living producing what appears to be wine and food seasonings, mainly using the local plants. The convent is located high in the mountains, and takes its heat from the active volcano on the island.  Benson finds that his efforts to get the child to talk to him about the murder of his father, who was to be under protection at the time that he was killed (the plot does not reveal when the killing took place) are frustrated by the boy's strong desire to exact his own revenge. From the actions of Manzella and others, it becomes apparent that the boy was either present when his father was killed, or knows details relevant to the murder. Much of the story revolves around a cat-and-mouse style chase between Manzella and the boy. All the while, Benson must deal with the local police, who have themselves been infiltrated by Manzella's organization (this, we learn, was how the boy's father was betrayed).  Romantic tension in the story is provided by Andie MacDowell's character, Jessie. She has come to stay on the island with Benson, and their young daughter. Because of the secretive nature of the case, however, there is very little that Benson can reveal to Jessie about their reason for being in Italy, and this begins to place a strain on their marriage. Jessie regards the boy as her own, and attempts to find things to occupy his time while her husband and the local police are  investigating Manzella. About midway through the story, we learn from the local detective, Giovanni Gigli, that the authorities are powerless to arrest Manzella, because he has the sympathy of those in the community of Naples, and it would be too dangerous to simply arrive in daylight with a warrant.

Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla
 In 1999, 45 years after [[Godzilla]]'s first attack in 1954, Lieutenant Akane Yashiro, a maser-cannon technician, is unable to kill a new member of Godzilla's species during her first fight. She is made a scapegoat for the military's losses during the battle and transferred to a desk job. During the battle, it was discovered that Godzilla is immune to maser fire, rendering all of the Japanese military useless against it should it return. Scientists, including single father Tokumitsu Yuhara, are gathered to build a bio-mechanical robot from the original Godzilla's skeleton. Four years later, the cyborg Mechagodzilla, named Kiryu, is finished and inducted into the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] along with its human pilots as the Kiryu Squadron. Akane becomes the main pilot for Kiryu. However, memories of Akane's actions during the original fight still linger, and one of her squadron mates, Second Lieutenant Susumu Hayama holds her responsible for the death of his brother (who was crushed to death when Godzilla stepped on his car while he was inside during their first fight).  Four years later, in 2003, Mechagodzilla is shown to the world, and the complete system that controls the unit is explained. Controlled remotely from a control craft that resembles a very large jet fighter with [[V/STOL]] capabilities, it can be remotely recharged from the ground using microwaves that are relayed through a power system on one of the command aircraft, and then beamed back down to the robot. For the end of the presentation, its greatest and most powerful weapon, the freezing Absolute Zero Cannon, is shown. At the same time, Godzilla shows up once again, and Kiryu is launched into battle. In the midst of the first battle, Kiryu's soul is awoken by Godzilla's roar and brings with it the memories of the original Godzilla's death. As if possessed by the original Godzilla, Kiryu proceeds to destroy the city around it after Godzilla retreats to the ocean floor. Horrified, the Kiryu Squadron can only watch in alarm as the rampaging cyborg destroys more city property than Godzilla did. After one hour, Kiryu runs out of energy and is brought back to headquarters for further work.  All the while, Akane attempts to settle matters involving Hayama, Tokumitsu, and his distressed daughter, Sara (who sees Kiryu as a being with a right to life and believes that it should befriend Godzilla rather than battle it). Later, Godzilla attacks again. After repairs are made, Kiryu is released from the air and hits Godzilla with immense speed. At this point, Godzilla and Mechagodzilla face off in a head-to-head battle where each combatant sizes up its opposite and exchange powerful blows that also devastate the cityscape around them. Kiryu gains the upper hand and beats down Godzilla. Kiryu proceeds to launch the Absolute Zero Cannon, but Godzilla fires its atomic breath. During the course of the impact, Kiryu is disabled, and the remote piloting system completely taken off-line. In an effort to continue the fight and press what advantage over Godzilla they still have, Akane orders the pilot to land his command craft so that she can make her way to Mechagodzilla and take control from its internal backup cockpit. Now under direct human control, Kiryu rises from the ground one more time and closes in on Godzilla for a final blow, hoping to use the Absolute Zero Cannon at point-blank range. The two titans collide, and Akane uses Kiryu's thrusters to propel it and Godzilla out to sea before the cannon fires, freezing a huge portion of the ocean around them. After the blast clears, Godzilla is shown to be alive but with a huge gash in its chest, steadily walking back into the ocean. Kiryu is heavily damaged, missing its right arm, and the Absolute Zero Cannon is devastated. With the Kiryu Squadron successful in defeating the monster, Godzilla retreats. In a post-credits scene, Akane agrees to have dinner with Tokumitsu and Sara and gives Kiryu one last salute for its aid in battling Godzilla.

One morning, Justine notices a new cashier and later introduces herself. Holden ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]]) appears quiet and reserved, qualities that the two of them share; therefore they quickly take a liking to one another. They begin taking their lunch breaks together and Justine gives Holden rides home. One time, he invites her in and she accepts. They swap stories about their lives including how Justine feels unappreciated by Phil and Holden tells her of his obsession with [[J. D. Salinger]]'s novel, ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', and how he took his self-assigned first name from its protagonist, [[Holden Caulfield]].  As the weeks go by, Justine and Holden start to bring out the best in each other. But when Holden makes a pass at her, she rejects him, leaving him dismayed. He becomes more and more besotted by her. Some time later, Holden does not show up to work but sends a letter to Justine, writing that if she does not meet him at 5pm that day behind the nearest [[Chuck E. Cheese]], she will never see him again. After much consideration, Justine decides to accept Holden's invitation, only to be intercepted by her manager, Jack ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), who insists that she take a very ill Gwen to the hospital. Justine then meets up with Holden. The two have sex for the first time in a motel room that Justine pays for with her credit card.  As the affair continues, Justine's marriage to Phil continues to deteriorate. One night, Justine spots Bubba's truck in the parking lot of the motel where she's been meeting Holden. She becomes convinced that Bubba knows, telling Holden that they need to cool down for a while.  When Justine goes to visit Gwen in the hospital, she is told that Gwen has died after contracting parasites from eating poisonous blackberries that she bought at a roadside fruit stand. When she returns home, Bubba starts hinting to Justine that he knows about her affair with Holden. Feeling guilty, Justine suggests that she and Phil should attend a church bible study that Corny, a security guard, had invited them to. Soon after they arrive, Justine spots the motel desk clerk she encountered with Holden, she grabs Phil and demand they leave immediately.  Justine speaks to Holden in private at work the following day, explaining that what they're doing is wrong and she can't see him anymore. Bubba tells Justine to meet him at his house. He blackmails her into having sex with him by threatening to tell Phil about her affair if she refuses, and she reluctantly gives into his demands.  Holden, who has been following her since the split, sees them through a window.  Holden does not show up for work the next day but is waiting in Justine's car when her shift ends. He calls Justine a whore and drunkenly demands an apology. He then says he could kill her husband to free her from her marriage. Justine becomes desperate to extricate herself from the relationship with Holden. She goes to talk to his parents and tells them that he is mentally ill and that he has imagined a romantic liaison between them. She goes on to suggest that Holden be hospitalized. That night after feeling unwell all day, Justine takes a pregnancy test. The results are positive. Phil is over the moon, but Justine feels uneasy, since she doesn't know whether the father is Holden or Phil.  The next day when Justine arrives at work, Cheryl tells her that someone stole $15,000 from the safe and that the police suspect Holden. Justine is called into Jack's office and interrogated about their relationship. As she leaves for lunch, Justine encounters Holden, who brags about having stolen the money and about his plans for them to escape. Holden tells her to meet her the following morning at a hotel. When Justine gets home, Phil, Bubba, and Bubba's new girlfriend are all waiting for her so they can celebrate. The phone rings and Phil answers. The doctor's office has called; they tell Phil his sperm is "no good".  He tells them his wife is pregnant and they don't know what they are talking about and angrily hangs up. Bubba assures Phil they made a mistake, that "they don't know everything". Phil then questions aloud if this means Justine isn't pregnant.  She also assures Phil that they just made a mistake.  The next morning Justine quickly packs a suitcase. While waiting at the light to turn toward either the hotel or the Retail Rodeo store, she assess her future if she stays versus if she runs away and becomes a fugitive with Holden. She decides to stay.  She arrives at Retail Rodeo and goes to the manager's office, telling him where Holden is hiding and how long he will be there. After arriving home, she watches a news report saying that the police have surrounded the hotel where Holden is staying and that Holden shot and killed himself. The next day, Bubba shows up at Retail Rodeo and tells Justine that Phil opened a statement from the credit card company, which listed the motel that Justine paid for with the card. Bubba then begs Justine not to tell Phil about their sexual encounter.  When Justine arrives home, Phil is looking at the credit card statement and tearfully asks Justine if she has been having an affair.  After she says, "yes",  Phil strikes her. Later, Phil expresses remorse at hitting his wife and asked her if the baby is his. Wanting to spare Phil any more pain and protect herself, she tells him that he is the father. Phil insists on knowing who she had an affair with.  When Justine says it doesn't matter, Phil concludes it's Corny, the security guard who invited them to Bible study.  When Justine arrives at work the next morning, Cheryl attempts to cover up her facial bruises with make-up just as Corny walks by.  His arm is in a cast and his face beat up.  Cheryl informs Justine two "beefy guys" with baseball bats and face masks beat him up.  As the movie concludes, Justine is still employed at Retail Rodeo.

  In [[San Francisco]], Sasha Petrosevitch (Steven Seagal) is a Russian car thief who's brought in by criminal Nick Frazier (Ja Rule) to work for crime boss Sonny Eckvall (Richard Bremmer), who apparently shot and killed Sasha's wife. After some time, FBI Special Agent Ellen "E. Z." Williams (Claudia Christian) and her team show up to nail Nick, but things go bad, and Sasha gets shot.  After eight months of recovery following his brief bout of being clinically dead from the shooting, Sasha is incarcerated along with Nick in the newly reopened Alcatraz prison. Run by the charismatic warden, Juan Ruiz "El Fuego" Escarzaga (Tony Plana), the place is known for its new state of the art death chamber where the condemned can choose from five different ways to die: lethal injection, gas chamber, hanging, firing squad, or electric chair.  Lester McKenna (Bruce Weitz), is the first death row prisoner brought to the new Alcatraz and also the first prisoner scheduled to be executed. An older man, he stole $200,000,000 worth of gold bricks in a heist that resulted in five deaths, and hid the loot at an unknown location. Federal Bureau of Prisons head Frank Hubbard ([[Stephen J.

But she's not the only one interested in Lester. A small but well equipped team of terrorists who call themselves the "49ers" have parachuted onto the Alcatraz island, and gained control of it.

When Sasha rescues Lester, the 49ers strap Jane to the electric chair and threaten to kill her, all while Ellen and her team prepare a rescue plan from the mainland.  With the help of Nick and some of the other inmates such as Twitch (Kurupt) and Little Joe (Michael "Bear" Taliferro), Sasha sets out to rescue Jane and bring Donny down, before Alcatraz becomes everyone's final resting place.  
Halloween: Resurrection
 On [[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|October 31, 1998]], [[Laurie Strode]] accidentally kills a paramedic with whom her brother [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] had swapped clothes. The guilt-ridden Laurie is now an inmate at the Grace Andersen Sanitarium, where the nurses believe her to be [[catatonic]]. Instead, she is preparing for Michael's return.  On October 31, 2001, Laurie, pretending to be heavily medicated, prepares herself for the inevitable confrontation with her brother. Michael breaches the facility and kills two security guards, decapitating one and slitting the throat of the other as he makes his way to Laurie. After a chase, Laurie lures Michael on to the institution's rooftop. Although he falls into her trap, Laurie's fears of again killing the wrong person get the better of her; when she tries to remove his mask, Michael stabs her and throws her off the roof, to her death. His life mission is finally complete after more than twenty years of tracking Laurie down, Michael returns home to his abandoned childhood house.  The following year, college students Bill Woodlake, Donna Chang, Jen Danzig, Jim Morgan, Rudy Grimes, and Sara Moyer win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show ''Dangertainment'', directed by Freddie Harris and his friend, Nora Winston, in which they have to spend a night in Michael's home in order to figure out what led him to kill. On Halloween, equipped with head-cameras as well as the cameras throughout the house, they search the house and separate into three groups. Sara's messaging friend Deckard watches the broadcast during a Halloween party. Meanwhile, Michael suddenly appears and stabs Bill in the head, and kills a cameraman.  Donna and Jim begin getting intimate in the basement and a wall filled with corpses falls on them. Jim realizes the corpses are fake and the show is a setup. Jim leaves, but Donna notices a tunnel behind the fallen wall. Myers chases her through the tunnels before impaling her on a spike on the wall. At the party, Deckard and other partygoers witness the murder. Deckard realizes that the murder was real, but the others believe it is an act. Freddie goes through the house dressed as Michael, but is secretly followed by the real Myers. Freddie, mistaking Michael for Charlie (the cameraman who had been killed earlier), tells him to go to the garage and help Nora out; he goes to the garage and promptly kills Nora.  When Rudy, Sara, and Jim find Freddie in the Myers costume, he reveals the scheme to them and begs them to cooperate, telling them that he's set up a nice payday for all of them. When he leaves, the trio decides to gather up the other three and leave.

They ask their father to read them a story to help them feel better about the storm. The father finds a dusty, old book and decides to read the story of ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''.  Hansel and Gretel ([[Jacob Smith (actor)|Jacob Smith]] and [[Taylor Momsen]]) are living with their father ([[Gerald McRaney]]) and stepmother ([[Delta Burke]]) in a very tiny shack. The children know their stepmother is evil, but the father does not. Since they are very poor, the father decides to sell Hansel and Gretel's biological mother's necklace, but the stepmother substitutes a pebble. The next day, the stepmother forces the children into taking a walk in the scary forest. Once they get far enough into the forest, the stepmother abandons them.  Afterward, Hansel and Gretel go looking for food and are tricked into going to a lazy troll's ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) house. They get caught, but are then saved by the Sandman ([[Howie Mandel]]), whom they befriend. They also let Wood Fairy ([[Alana Austin]]) free, whom they also befriend. Throughout the story the Sandman and the fairy are always bickering which causes problems at times.  One night when the Sandman goes out to get some food for the kids, and the fairy goes out for one reason or another, Hansel and Gretel wander off to a house made of candy and chocolate. The lady ([[Lynn Redgrave]]) that lives there invites them in and they eat some delicious food and then go to bed. They wake up the next morning and find the house is just an empty shack with an old lady in it. A raven ([[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]]) comes to the window to tell them that the old lady is actually a witch. The witch walks into the room, locks Hansel in a box, and makes Gretel cook and Hansel eat. She does this because she is going to eat Hansel and wants him nice and fat. Because of certain principles, Gretel breaks a mirror and the witch becomes ugly. The Sandman and Wood Fairy walk in and help Hansel and Gretel get the witch into her cauldron. Then they put her in the oven, killing her. The father finds them and they do not worry about the stepmother who had gone to the troll's house who then abandoned her after she made him cook and clean for her.  The scene returns to the bedroom of the two kids and their father who say goodnight. The Sandman the boogeyman and the troll drop by, say hello to the children, and take the Hansel and Gretel book.

Hart's War
 During the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, [[U.S. Army]] intelligence officer First Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) is captured by German forces. While interrogating Hart, the Germans [[coerce]] him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to [[Stalag VI-A]] prisoner of war camp at [[Hemer|Hemer, Germany]]. While en route, a [[P-51 Mustang]] attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing.  After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers.  Two [[Tuskegee Airmen|Black pilots]] are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart's barracks.  They are the only African Americans in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford (Hauser), a [[racism|racist]], is their primary antagonist. One of the pilots, Lt. Lamar Archer, is executed when accused of keeping a weapon that Bedford had planted in his bunk. When Bedford himself subsequently turns up dead, the surviving pilot, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) is accused of killing Bedford in retaliation. A law student before the war, Hart is appointed by McNamara to defend the accused pilot at his [[court-martial]], a trial to which the camp commandant, [[Oberst]] Werner Visser (IureÅ) agrees.  Much later, McNamara reveals to Hart that the "defense," like the trial itself, is a sham, an elaborate distraction to hide a planned attack on a nearby ammunition plant (which the U.S. Army mistakenly believes to be a shoe factory) by McNamara and his men, in aid of the war effort. It is revealed that Bedford planted the weapon in Archer's bunk, knowing the guards would kill Archer for it. In return, Bedford informed the guards of the location of a secret radio. It is also revealed Bedford planned to escape with money and clothes, likely in return for telling the Nazis about McNamara's plan. Upon realizing Bedford's plot, McNamara killed Bedford to prevent it. Hart is shocked that McNamara as a senior officer would sacrifice a fellow American (Scott) to protect the planned attack on the ammunition plant. McNamara reminds Hart that in war, sometimes one man must be sacrificed to save the lives of many. Hart acknowledges this, but retorts that it is McNamara's duty to ensure that ''he'' (McNamara), not Lincoln Scott, is the sacrifice. Disgusted, McNamara says that Hart does not know anything about duty, in reference to how Hart gave in to a "Level 1" interrogator after three days, whereas McNamara was tortured for a month.  McNamara's ploy nearly succeeds. The escaped soldiers destroy the nearby munitions plant. However, at the end of the court-martial, Hart falsely confesses to Bedford's murder in order to save Lt. Scott. McNamara overhears Hart's confession; McNamara has a change of heart and voluntarily returns to the camp to accept responsibility. Oberst Visser holds McNamara accountable and personally executes him on the spot, but spares the remaining prisoners. Three months later, the German army surrenders to the Allies. The prison camp is liberated and all of the surviving prisoners, including Hart, are sent home. Hart's final comments are that he learned about honor, duty, and sacrifice.  
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)
  [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] spends the summer with [[The Dursleys]] without receiving letters from his [[Hogwarts]] friends. In his room, Harry meets [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]], a [[house-elf]], who warns him of a peril that will take shape if he returns to Hogwarts, and reveals he intercepted his friends' letters, and destroys a cake. The Dursleys lock Harry up, but [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], jokesters [[Fred and George Weasley]] rescue him in their father's flying car.  While purchasing school supplies, Harry and the Weasley family encounter [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Hermione Granger]], and they attend a book-signing by celebrity wizard [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who announces that he will be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. During a small confrontation with [[Draco Malfoy]], Harry meets Malfoy's father, [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]], who discreetly slips a book in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s belongings. When Harry and Ron are blocked from entering [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]], they fly to Hogwarts in the flying car, crashing into the [[Whomping Willow]] upon arrival. Ron's wand is damaged, and the car ejects them before driving off. Both boys narrowly avoid expulsion when [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] gives them detention.  While serving detention with Lockhart, Harry hears strange voices and later finds caretaker [[Argus Filch]]'s cat, Mrs. Norris, [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]], along with a message written in blood announcing the "Chamber of Secrets has been opened". McGonagall explains that one of Hogwarts' founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber and placed a monster that only his Heir can control inside it, to purge the school of impure-blooded wizards and witches. Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy is the Heir, so Hermione suggests that they question him while disguised using [[polyjuice potion]]. They utilise a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost, [[Moaning Myrtle]], as their makeshift laboratory to brew the potion.  When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the Heir. On Christmas Day, Harry and Ron learn that Malfoy is not the Heir, but he mentions that a girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. Harry finds an enchanted diary, owned by a former student named Tom Marvolo Riddle, which shows him a flashback to fifty years before, where Riddle accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], [[Cornelius Fudge]], and Lucius Malfoy, come to take Hagrid to [[Azkaban]], but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow the spiders". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's giant pet spider [[Aragog]], who tells them that Hagrid was innocent and provides them with a small clue about the Chamber's resident monster. Aragog then sets his colony of [[Acromantula]] on the boys, but the now-wild flying car saves them.  A book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]], a giant serpent that instantly kills those that make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learn that Ginny was taken into the Chamber, and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, exposed as a fraud, planning to flee; knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they take him to her bathroom and find the Chamber's entrance. Once inside, Lockhart uses Ron's damaged wand against them, but it backfires, wiping his memory, and causes a cave-in.  Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Tom Riddle. Riddle reveals that he used the diary to manipulate Ginny and reopen the Chamber. When Riddle creates the anagram for his future new identity, "I am [[Lord Voldemort]]" from his full name, Harry realises that Riddle himself is Slytherin's heir and Voldemort was only a pseudonym. After Harry expresses support for Dumbledore, Dumbledore's [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]] flies in with the [[Sorting Hat]], and Riddle summons the Basilisk. Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, and the Sorting Hat eventually produces a sword with which Harry battles and slays the Basilisk, but he is injured by its fangs.  Harry defeats Riddle and revives Ginny by stabbing the diary with a basilisk fang. Fawkes's tears heal him, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Dumbledore praises them and orders for Hagrid's release. Dumbledore shows Harry the sword he wielded was [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's own sword]], and says he is different from Voldemort, because he chose Gryffindor House instead of Slytherin House. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The Basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Lockhart has published a new [[autobiography]], "Who Am I?".<ref></ref>

LoÃ¯c receives the pink rose and assumes that his wife sent it to him.

Rachel stands by her husband while he recovers from his injuries, and several years later the couple are shown at a house with their young children as LoÃ¯c hobbles around with a cane.  Five years after the attack, AngÃ©lique is released from the mental institution. Her therapist praises her progress and tells her, "If you keep taking your medication, you will be fine". However, when the cleaning man is clearing AngÃ©lique's room, he discovers her pills have been glued to the wall behind the wardrobe in a [[mosaic]] of LoÃ¯c, thus showing that AngÃ©lique has never taken her medication, and is still obsessed with LoÃ¯c.

While walking along the road, he is passed by Ron, who is taking Mandy to Blackpool for a dirty weekend. She brought her daughter along with her, seeing this weekend as more of an opportunity to get away with her kid. In Blackpool, Ron asks Colin to return the favour of the lift by taking the kid out of the way for a few hours. Ron chats up the hotel receptionist, so Colin takes Mandy and her daughter if for a stroll.  The three of them have fun at a fair. Come evening, Colin says he needs to go find his friends. As he is walking around the town, he sees his wife. Colin runs in the opposite direction and spends the night on a sea front bench. The next day he goes to the darts finals.  He finds Geoff having an argument with the opposing team, which deteriorates into a brawl. He asks Sandra if she would mind stepping out for a chat, and despite Geoff trying to stop her, she agrees. She tearfully confesses her regret and that she no longer wants to be involved with Geoff. She realizes that she has been very stupid, and is looking for forgiveness. Colin tells her that he loves her more than anyone else in the whole world, but that he does not want to go back to his old life. He has experienced some of the wider world, and wants to continue on the road to see what is around the next corner. He offers her the newsagent and wishes her goodbye.  Colin walks past a cafe and nods a hello to his hero, Eric Bristow, who nods in return. Colin gets a new moped, and gets back on the road. Mandy and her daughter wave at Colin from a bus.

Hell's Highway (2002 film)
  Out on a highway in [[Death Valley]], a man picks up a female hitchhiker named Lucindia, and gives her a drink. Lucindia has a coughing fit upon ingesting the liquid, stumbles out of the vehicle, and is stabbed to death by the motorist. The man (revealed to be a priest, whose offer to Lucindia was [[holy water]]) buries Lucindia's body, and erects a crucifix over the impromptu grave. As the preacher prays, Lucindia reappears, and bludgeons him with his shovel as he screams, "El Diablo!"  Nearby, four college students (Eric, Chris, Monique, and Sarah) from [[Western Pennsylvania]] are on a road trip to [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]]. Spotting Lucindia at a cluster of crosses, the quartet pick her up. When Chris mentions that a group of their friends are also on their way to Redondo, Lucindia brags that she tortured them to death before pulling out a gun and sexually assaulting Sarah. Lucindia then tries to shoot Sarah in the crotch, but is knocked out of the car by her and Eric.  The next day, Lucindia (who had just robbed, castrated, and murdered a motorist) catches up with the college students, who run her down, beheading and disemboweling her. On what's left of Lucindia's body, Eric finds Chris's brother's cell phone, and a battery pack that fits into a camcorder that Sarah had earlier unearthed in the desert. The group watches the last few minutes recorded by the camera, which shows Lucindia shooting all of their friends during a botched sÃ©ance. Lucindia then turns to the camera and tells the story of a settler couple that became trapped in the valley; to try and save his wife, the husband killed himself so that she could consume his flesh. Her husband's body was not enough to sustain her, and in her last dying hours the woman cursed God and prayed to the Devil for salvation, and received it in exchange for a steady stream of victims.  When the video ends, Lucindia appears, and butchers Chris with a chainsaw. The students drive off, with Lucindia catching up to them when they stop to dump Chris's body. Sarah, Eric, and Monique run, but are cornered by a pair of Lucindias, who murder Eric and Monique. Sarah kills one of the Lucindias, and is saved from the remaining one by two government operatives, who then capture Sarah.  Sarah is taken to a military installation, where it is explained that there were four equally delusional Lucindias, and that they were the result of cloning and accelerated growth experiments. The staff tell Sarah that she is going to become their new test subject, and as they try to give her an injection, a wounded Lucindia barges in. Sarah screams "I told you the Devil would come back!" as Lucindia opens fire with a shotgun, causing an explosion that presumably kills her and everyone else in the room.

Hero (2002 film)
 In ancient China during the [[Warring States period]], Nameless, a [[Qin (state)|Qin]] prefect, arrives at the Qin [[Xianyang|capital city]] to meet the king of Qin, who had survived an attempt on his life by the assassins Long Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. As a result, the king has implemented extreme security measures: no visitors allowed to approach the king within 100 paces. Nameless claims that he has slain the three assassins and he displays their weapons before the king, who allows the former to approach within ten paces and tell him his story.  Nameless recounts first killing Long Sky, before traveling to meet Flying Snow and Broken Sword, who had taken refuge at a calligraphy school in the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]]. He tells Sword that he is there to commission a calligraphy scroll with the character for "Sword" (å), secretly seeking to learn Sword's skill through his calligraphy.  Nameless also learns that Snow and Sword, who are lovers, had gradually grown distant. Once the scroll is complete, Nameless reveals his identity and challenges Snow to a duel the next day, to avenge her secret lover Long Sky. Sword, in anger at Snow's betrayal to him, makes love to his pupil Moon, and is seen by Snow. In revenge, Snow kills Sword, followed by Moon when she attempted to seek revenge for her master. The next day, Nameless kills the emotionally unstable Snow before the Qin army, and claims her sword. As the tale concludes, the king expresses disbelief and accuses Nameless of staging the duels with the assassins, as in the previous assassination attempt he had perceived Sword as an honourable man who would not stoop so low as to cheat on Snow. The king then suggests that what really happened was that the assassins volunteered their lives so that Nameless could gain the king's trust, which would allow Nameless to get close enough to the king to kill him. He then narrates his guess at what really happened.   In the king's hypothetical version of the story, Nameless had sought out Snow and Sword after staging the battle with Sky, telling them that he had acquired a special technique that would allow him to kill any target that is within ten paces. Nameless explains that he can use this technique to kill the king, but to get close enough he must present Snow's and Sword's weapons to the king. He further explains that he only needs to kill one of them in public to "prove" that he has killed both of them. Snow and Sword argue over who should be the one to die, which results in a short fight in which Snow is quicker and manages to injure Sword. Snow then proceeds to meet Nameless before the Qin army while Sword, still recovering from his wound, watches helplessly as Snow is defeated. Moon then gives Nameless her master's sword, telling him that the swords of Snow and Sword should remain together in death as they had in life.  Nameless admits that he does indeed possess the special technique the king alluded to. However, he states that the King had underestimated Sword, and tells the true story. Nameless says that the special technique, while deadly, can also be used to deal a seemingly-fatal blow that nonetheless misses all the victim's vital organs. He had used this technique on Sky, and now asked Snow and Sword to cooperate by faking a duel with him as well. He demonstrates the technique by showing that it is highly accurate as well as deadly. Snow agrees to the plan, but Sword refuses. Snow angrily accuses Sword of ruining the opportunity they had three years ago, when they had broken into the Qin palace yet Sword had refused to kill the king. She then attacks Sword, and manages to wound him with Nameless's help. The next day, Nameless "kills" Snow in front of the Qin army. Sword sends Nameless off to the Qin capital, writing the words [[Tianxia]] in the sand before leaving. Sword had not killed the king 3 years ago because he desired a unified, peaceful state, and only the king of Qin could achieve that vision.  The king, touched by the tale and by Sword's understanding of his dream to unify China, ceases to fear Nameless. He tosses his sword to Nameless and examines the scroll drawn by Sword. The king understands that it describes the ideal warrior, who, paradoxically, should have no desire to kill. When Nameless realizes the wisdom of these words, he abandons his mission and spares the king.  When Snow learns that Sword had convinced Nameless to forgo the assassination, she furiously attacks Sword and unintentionally kills him when he chooses not to defend himself so that she would understand his feelings for her. Overwhelmed with sorrow, Snow commits suicide. Urged by his court, the king reluctantly orders Nameless to be executed at the Qin palace for his assassination attempt. He understands that in order to unify the nation, he must enforce the law and use Nameless as an example. As the film ends, Nameless receives a hero's funeral and a closing text identifies the king as [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China.

  Arriving home from a basketball game, Arnold Shortman (Spencer Klein) and his best friend Gerald Johanssen ([[Jamil Walker Smith]]) learn that Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck ([[Paul Sorvino]]), the CEO of FutureTech Industries (FTI), has announced plans to redevelop the entire neighborhood as a luxurious high-rise [[shopping mall]]. That night, Helga Patiki ([[Francesca Marie Smith]]) finds that her father, Big Bob ([[Maurice LaMarche]]), is working with FTI to build a new super-sized branch of his beeper store in the proposed mall. She ultimately sides with her father, though is hesitant to do so because of her love for Arnold.  Arnold hosts a [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] against FTI. Unfortunately, their permit is stolen by Scheck's employees, Arnold's grandmother Gertie Shortman ([[Tress MacNeille]]) is arrested, and the demonstration is declared illegal. The failure encourages many of Arnold's neighbors to give up, and sell their homes to FTI. As the residents begin packing their belongings, Arnold's grandfather Phil Shortman ([[Dan Castellaneta]]) tells the story of the "[[Tomato]] Incident", a major [[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary war]] battle fought in the city. Arnold realizes that the neighborhood had to have been declared a [[historic district]] after the war, effectively ensuring its preservation; however, the legal document granting its landmark status was sold to Scheck, who denies obtaining the document.  As the deadline draws near, Arnold gets a mysterious phone call from "Deep Voice" (a [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|"Deep Throat"]]-esque character), who informs Arnold that Scheck is lying and the document is in his office safe. Arnold and Gerald steals the key to the safe from Scheck's assistant, Nick Vermicelli (Castellaneta). Nick later notices the missing key, and informs Scheck. Meanwhile, Phil and the boarders try to devise a backup plan in case Arnold fails. The plan is to wire the [[storm drain]] tunnels beneath their street with dynamite to intercept FTI's construction equipment. Big Bob later teams up with them after discovering Nick's contract states Scheck will control 51% of his company and swindle him as a result.   With help from agent Bridget ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), Arnold and Gerald infiltrate into FTI headquarters and access the safe, only to find that the document is missing. Scheck appears from behind them with the document in his hand. He reveals that his ancestor, a governor of the British forces, was humiliated by the "Tomato Incident", and, that, for years, Scheck has been planning to avenge his family by demolishing the neighborhood and replacing it with a hulking building carrying his name on it. He then burns the document to ensure that his plans will proceed, before summoning his guards to get rid of Arnold and Gerald. They escape, but believe they have failed, until "Deep Voice" advises Arnold to obtain the FTI's security-camera footage of Scheck burning the document.  After Arnold finds out that "Deep Voice" is Helga, he asks why she decided to help him instead of her father. Helga reluctantly professes her love for Arnold. Helga and Arnold escape the building, and meet Gerald on a city bus, convincing the driver Murray ([[Craig Bartlett]]) to race home when realizing that his girlfriend lives in the same neighborhood. Despite several near-collisions, the kids eventually make it back unharmed. Mayor Dixie arrives at the scene, along with the police and a news crew. Accessing the large ScheckVision [[jumbotron]] poised atop a nearby building, Arnold and Bridget show everyone the footage of Scheck burning the document. Dixie officially restores the neighborhood's status as a historic site.  Scheck arrives, demanding to know why demolition has not begun. He sees the footage of himself burning the document on the monitor. Gertie, having escaped prison, sabotaged his car, and Scheck is promptly arrested. Harold inadvertently sits down on the detonator that ignites Phil's explosives, causing the jumbotron monitor to be destroyed. Helga denies ever having loved Arnold, claiming that she said those things in "the heat of the moment". Arnold, unconvinced, pretends to accept it as she returns home.  
High Crimes
 [[Lawyer|Attorney]] Claire Kubik ([[Ashley Judd]]) and her woodworker husband Tom ([[James Caviezel]]) find their idyllic life in [[Marin County]], [[California]] shattered when, during a [[Christmas]] shopping excursion in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], he is captured by the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and charged with the murders of nine peasants in a remote village in [[El Salvador]] in 1988. Claire learns Tom's real name is Ronald Chapman, and she is shocked to discover he was a covert military operative serving in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and has been on the run for the past twelve years.  Tom admits he was present at the scene of the mass murders but staunchly denies any involvement in the killings. He insists he has been [[scapegoat]]ed in order to protect the real culprit, [[Major]] James Hernandez (Juan Carlos HernÃ¡ndez), who has become the aide of [[Brigadier General]] Bill Marks ([[Bruce Davison]]).  [[First Lieutenant]] Terence Embry ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]) is assigned to defend Tom, but his youth and lack of experience prompt Claire to decide to assist professionally in defending her husband. When she realizes she needs help from someone familiar with the workings of a [[military court]], she hires Charlie Grimes ([[Morgan Freeman]]), an embittered former military attorney who has a grudge against the military brass, to assist her. Three of the five key [[witness]]es, who previously testified Tom was guilty, have died under seemingly mysterious circumstances, raising Claire and Charlie's suspicions. As the trial proceeds, they uncover a massive [[cover-up]] perpetrated by one of the military's highest-ranking officials. Also creating problems are the sudden appearance of a resident ([[Emilio Rivera]]) of the village where the mass murder took place, who insists Tom was responsible; Embry's romantic involvement with Claire's irresponsible sister Jackie ([[Amanda Peet]]), which leads Claire to assume that he leaked details about secrets she has uncovered to the prosecution; and Charlie's [[Relapse|falling off the wagon]] after more than a year of sobriety.  The Salvadorian witness identifies an injured Hernandez as the culprit responsible for a bombing incident prior to the massacre. Claire recovers classified medical files from the FBI as evidence of the cover-up. Claire [[blackmail]]s Marks by threatening to reveal what she knows about the cover-up and asks him to make the case go away; the next day, the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]] has the case thrown out of court due to "security reasons".  Just as Claire is about to celebrate her victory in court, Charlie discovers the truth: Tom had murdered one of the witnesses in front of his family. The widow who witnessed the act described Tom's having tossed his gun from one hand to the other (a habit Tom displayed with keys and other objects throughout the film) and his shooting his gun first using one hand, then the other (revealing his [[ambidexterity]]). The match between these descriptions also indicated that Tom committed the massacre and also murdered two of the other key witnesses years prior to his arrest. After Tom overhears Claire talking to Charlie on the phone, a short scuffle between Claire and Tom ensues, during which Claire fears for her life. The Salvadoran witness shoots Tom through the window, and the film ends with Charlie and Claire partnering a new law firm.

The Hot Chick
   In the palace of the [[Ethiopia|Abyssinian]] King in 50 BC, Princess Nawa uses a pair of enchanted earrings to escape an [[arranged marriage]] by [[Body swap|swapping bodies]] with a slave girl. When each woman wears one of the earrings, their bodies magically trade places while their minds remain where they were.  In the present day, Jessica Spencer is a popular [[high school (United States)|high school]] girl in suburban [[California]] with her friends April, Keecia, and Lulu. April is Jessica's best friend, and all four girls are cheerleaders. At school one day, Jessica makes fun of a bigger girl named Hildenburg and a [[wicca]]n girl named Eden. After that, Jessica and her friends visit the local mall, where Jessica frames her rival Bianca for shoplifting, and finds the earrings in an [[Africa]]n-themed store. The earrings are not for sale, so Jessica steals them.  Shortly afterward, a small-time criminal named Clive Maxtone robs a nearby gas station. When Jessica and her friends stop there and mistake him for an employee, he services their car to avoid raising suspicion. Jessica accidentally drops one of the earrings on the ground, and Clive picks it up after the girls drive away. That evening, Jessica and Clive put on their earrings. When they wake up the next morning, each of them is trapped in the other's body. This is especially difficult for Jessica, who has a cheerleading competition and the school [[prom]] coming up soon. While at first difficult, Jessica convinces April, Keecia, and Lulu of her true identity.  The girls write a list of suspects of who could be responsible. They first seek Hildenburg, where Jessica apologizes for humiliating her in front of the entire school during the basketball game earlier, and the two make amends. They soon seek Eden, where Jessica also apologizes for her jealousy of Eden getting the only "A" on a report of the [[Salem witch trials]]. Eden reveals an ancient Latin witchcraft called "Santeria", which originated in Africa, and found its way into [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]]. Lulu ties this connection to Bianca, but Eden reveals that only a tattoo of a scorpion on her back could confirm this. While investigating at a dance club called 'Instant Tang', Bianca is proven innocent after Jessica rips her shirt to see if she has the tattoo, which she doesn't.  The girls then find a picture of the earrings on the [[internet]], and the girls post fliers all over town. They also get help from Keecia's awkward mother and Venetia and Sissie, twin sisters who are on Jessica's cheerleading squad. The girls tell this to Madame Mambuza, the owner of the African store at the mall. Madame Mambuza tells the girls the story of Princess Nawa, who, after switching bodies, was unaware that she had to bring the earrings back together. Nawa lived the rest of her life in the slave's body. Jessica could suffer the same fate if she does not unite the earrings before the end of the [[full moon]].  Meanwhile, Jessica is hired for two jobs while secretly living with April. At her home, where she works as a gardener named Taquito. Her parents tell her about their marital problems, and she helps them rekindle their sex life. At school, while cleaning the boys' locker room as a janitor, she spies on her boyfriend Billy, who truly loves her and April's boyfriend Jake, who secretly has another girlfriend named Monique. Faced with Jake's infidelity, April breaks up with him, and Jessica agrees to take her to the prom. At the cheerleading competition, Jessica signals romantically to Billy while disguised as the school mascot, but when the head of her suit falls off, he becomes confused and leaves with Bianca.  During this time, Clive has been using Jessica's body to make money from men, including Billy, who gives him his money and car, believing he is Jessica. On the evening of the prom, Hildenburg sees a video of Clive robbing a man on the television news and goes to the scene of the crime. After finding a business card for the club where Clive works as a [[pole dance]]r, she informs Jessica at the prom, and the girls go to the club. When they find Clive, Jessica steals back the earring and puts it on herself along with the other one. With the two earrings now on the same person, Jessica's and Clive's bodies return to their original owners.  After Jessica makes up with Billy, the film ends with the school's graduation ceremony, where Keecia and her mother reconcile. The previous night, Clive, running from the law and still dressed in [[lingerie]], jumps into the car of the same bartender Jessica encountered in the body of Clive. The bartender smiles and locks the car door. The movie ends with the car speeding away, and Clive turning around and screaming.  
How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog
 The film stars [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Peter McGowan, a [[chain smoking|chain-smoking]], [[impotence|impotent]], [[insomnia]]c British playwright who lives in Los Angeles. Once very successful, he is now in the tenth year of a decade-long string of production failures. His latest play is in the hands of effeminate director Brian Sellars ([[David Krumholtz]]), who is obsessed with [[Petula Clark]]; his wife Melanie ([[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright Penn]]) is determined to have a baby; he finds himself bonding with a new neighbor's lonely young daughter (Suzi Hofrichter) who has mild [[cerebral palsy]]; and during one of his middle-of-the-night strolls, he encounters his oddball [[doppelgÃ¤nger]] ([[Jared Harris]]) who claims to be Peter McGowan and develops a friendship of sorts with him.  
The Hours (film)
 With the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different years and alternates between them throughout the film. In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. In 1951, troubled [[Los Angeles]] housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. In 2001, [[New York City|New Yorker]] Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with [[AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award.  Richard tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death.  She tells him that she believes that he would have won the award regardless of his illness.  Richard often refers to Clarissa as "Mrs. Dalloway" â her namesake â because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does.  Each story in chronological order, not the order as presented in the movie:  1923 -- Virginia, who has experienced several [[nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business, [[Hogarth Press]], at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] and her children. Virginia passionately kisses her sister on the lips. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London, when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.  1951 -- Pregnant with her second child, Laura spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] with her young son, Richie. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty laughs it off as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs. Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.  2001 -- Clarissa appears equally worried about Richard's depression and the party she is planning for him. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, had been in a relationship with Richard during their college days. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Richard has taken a combination of [[Xanax]] and [[Ritalin]] and tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura (the same character from the middle story), arrives at Clarissa's apartment. It is clear that Laura's abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She has led an independent, happier life as a librarian in Canada. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family (Dan and their daughter are also both dead) and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: "It [her life] was death. I chose life." When Julia visits Laura in her bedroom, she treats her with kindness and sensitivity that Laura does not expect to receive.  The film ends with a voice-over in which Virginia thanks Leonard for loving her: "Always the years between us. Always the years. Always the love. Always the hours."  
House of Fools (film)
 The film tells the story of a [[psychiatric hospital]] in the Russian republic of [[Ingushetia]] on the border with war-torn republic of [[Chechnya]] in 1996. With the medical staff vanishing to apparently find help, the patients are left to their own endeavors.  Zhanna (Yuliya Vysotskaya), a young woman, lives in the belief that the pop star Bryan Adams is her fiancÃ©, that he is off on tour and will, at some point in the future, come to take her away with him. Zhanna is sort of the ad hoc keeper of peace, happiness and control of the others; she attempts to help curb some of the other patients exuberant impulses. Blissfully unaware of the terror of the war, the patients stick it out in the hospital. Their guests include a group of Chechen rebels, one of whom, Ahmed (Sultan Islamov), gives Zhanna the idea that he will marry her. At this point Zhanna falls in love with Ahmed.  She goes back to the "House" where, with the help of her fellow residents, she prepares for her marriage to Ahmed. From this point on Zhanna prepares for and expects to be swept away by Ahmed. Her hopes do not come to fruition and Ahmed and Zhanna part ways.  Zhanna returns to the "House" in order to resume her life there.  The story was partially inspired by the real-life tragedy of the psychiatric hospital in [[Shali, Chechen Republic|Shali]], Chechnya, which was abandoned by the personnel during the Russian bombing campaign and in which many patients subsequently died from attacks and neglect.<ref>[http://home.conceptsfa.nl/~mlassauw/bryan/articles/bryan_adams_rocks_way.htm Bryan Adams rocks way into Kremlin with film roleânâ roll] </ref>  The story also mirrors the plot of [[Philippe de Broca]]'s 1967 French cult classic film ''[[King of Hearts (1966 film)|King of Hearts]]'' (''Le Roi de coeur'', starring [[Alan Bates]]) about the inmates of an asylum abandoned by the staff during World War I who take over the neighboring town.  The two films even share similarities in their conclusion, with a soldier taking refuge from the insanity of war in the asylum when it returns to normal.<ref></ref> Although there are some similar aspects to King Of Hearts, the difference in the two films is that the inmates/patients in King of Hearts take on the various personalities of the town folk; mayor, baker, prostitute, etc.

Hukkle
 The story takes place in an ordinary village in [[Hungary]]. It begins with an old man who has hiccups, and takes place in front of his house near a can of milk.

The Hunchback of Notre Dame II
 The film is set in 1488, six years after the events of the original film and the death of [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]]. [[Captain Phoebus]] serves as [[Paris, France|Paris]]' Captain of the Guard under the new Minister of Justice. Phoebus and [[EsmÃ©ralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]] have married and become the parents of a six-year-old son named Zephyr. [[Quasimodo]] is now an accepted part of Parisian society; though he still lives in [[Notre Dame de Paris]] with his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne as the cathedral's bell-ringer.  A [[Circus|circus troupe]] led by Sarousch enters town as part of "Le Jour d'Amour", a day dedicated to the celebration of strong and pure [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] (in a fashion similar to [[Valentine's Day]]). Sarousch is secretly a master criminal who plans to steal Notre Dame's most beloved bell, La FidÃ¨le ("the faithful one"; a take on the real-life Notre Dame's biggest bell, [[Notre Dame de Paris#Bells|the Emmanuel]]), the inside of which is decorated with beige-gold and enormous jewels. He sends Madellaine, his aspiring assistant, to discover the whereabouts of La FidÃ¨le.  Madellaine encounters Quasimodo without seeing his face, and the two of them initially get along quite well. Once Madellaine actually sees his face, she is shocked at his deformed appearance and runs away from him. The gargoyles convince Quasimodo to go to the circus to see her again. At the circus, Sarousch captures the audience's attention by making an elephant disappear, while his associates steal from the audience. He pressures Madellaine to follow Quasimodo and obtain the information he needs for his plans. When Madellaine disagrees with this mission, Sarousch reminds her of her past and of the loyalty she owes him: when she was six years old, Madellaine was a thief who was caught trying to steal coins from Sarousch. He could have turned her over to the authorities and Frollo; instead, Sarousch decided to take the girl under his wing and to train her.  Madellaine reluctantly takes the mission to win Quasimodo's trust. After observing Quasimodo fondly playing with Zephyr and letting the boy sleep in his arms, Madellaine realises the hunchback's true nature and ceases to be frightened by his appearance. Quasimodo takes her sight-seeing around Paris. A rain forces them to end the date and return to Notre Dame. Quasimodo takes the opportunity to offer Madellaine a gift, a [[figurine]] in her own image which he created himself. A sincerely touched Madellaine kisses him on the forehead and leaves. Quasimodo soon realizes that he is in love with her.  Meanwhile, Phoebus is investigating reports about robberies in his city. He suspects that the circus is responsible for the crime spree and confides to his family and friends, but Esmeralda expresses her belief that Phoebus is motivated by his own prejudice. Elsewhere, Sarousch instructs Madellaine to keep Quasimodo preoccupied while the circus steals La FidÃ¨le. However, Madellaine has come to genuinely care for Quasimodo and protests, so Sarousch threatens to have Quasimodo killed if she refuses. Phoebus eventually questions Sarousch about the robberies, and finds a stolen jewel in his possession. To avoid being arrested, Sarousch claims that Madellaine is a lifelong thief and that he is covering for her crimes. Phoebus seems to believe him.  Later, while Quasimodo is out with Madellaine, Sarousch and two of his subordinates sneak into the cathedral. Sarousch causes La FidÃ¨le to vanish. The gargoyles try to stop the thieves, but end up trapped under another bell; Laverne still sounds the bell and alerts everyone that something is amiss at the Cathedral. Hearing the sound, Quasimodo and Madellaine rush back. When the [[Archdeacon]] informs everyone that La FidÃ¨le has been stolen, [[Clopin]] claims that if they do not find the bell, the festival will be ruined. Phoebus realises that Sarousch has played him for a fool. He sends the soldiers all over Paris to find Sarousch. Quasimodo realizes that his beloved Madellaine has deceived him (despite her pleas that she did not intend to) and angrily breaks off their relationship. He retreats deeper in the Cathedral, feeling heartbroken and betrayed.  Phoebus has his guards arrest Madellaine for her involvement in the theft. The gargoyles soon inform Quasimodo that Zephyr has left to pursue Sarousch. He passes the information to the boy's parents, who now have personal reasons to locate the master criminal. Madellaine, now a prisoner of Phoebus, informs them that Sarousch has taken the missing bell to the [[Catacombs of Paris]] and tries to explain the secrets behind her former master's tricks and illusions. Phoebus decides to search around the catacombs, and to bring Madellaine with him. In the Catacombs, the search party encounter Esmeralda's pet goat Djali, who leads them to Sarousch and Zephyr. Sarousch has taken the boy hostage and blackmails Phoebus into opening a gate for him. Madellaine uses her [[Tightrope walking|high-wire]] skills to rescue Zephyr. With no leverage against his pursuers, Sarousch and his group of criminals are arrested, and the missing bell is recovered.  The festival can finally take place. Hugo finally wins the heart of Djali, his longtime crush. A number of romantic couples, including Phoebus and Esmeralda, proclaim their love for each other while Quasimodo rings the restored La FidÃ¨le. The bell falls silent when a released Madellaine joins Quasimodo in the bell tower. The two of them admit their own love for each other and share their first romantic kiss. As the film ends, Zephyr takes over the ringing of La FidÃ¨le.

She summons her mother's ghost and develops a strange fascination with death as well as a passion for living. Family friend Jacob (GÃ©rard Depardieu) encourages Dina's father to hire Jimmy Rustle, a tutor of American English, who introduces her to the cello. When Jacob asks for Dina's hand in marriage, Dina refuses. Her outraged father slaps her, prompting Dina to attack him. Known that Rustle and Dina have grown close, her father retaliates by sending Rustles away, devastating Dina. Unable to come to terms with Rustle's departure, Dina nearly kills Rustle in a fit of insanity.  When Dina (Maria Bonnevie) is old enough, she marries Jacob and moves to Reinsnes, a port he runs with his mother, Karen, and his stepsons Niels and Anders. Niels doesn't like Dina's wild ways, nor the fact that she has taken over accounting duties at Reinsnes. As Dina's eccentric tendencies become even stronger, Jacob suffers gangrene poisoning after breaking his leg when he falls off the roof of his mistress' house while trying to fix a leak. As Jacob does not appear to be getting better and takes a turn for the worse, Dina takes him on sled to the top of a cliff and pushes him off to his death, hoping to end his suffering and send him to a better place. Jacob's death brings Tomas back into her life and the two have a passionate affair. Several months later, she gives birth to a baby boy that she names Benjamin, that she presumably had with Tomas. She then learns of Rustle's death when the latter bequeaths her his cello and his ''Writer's Reference''.  Some years later, as a child, Benjamin accidentally sets fire to the barn. Dina falls in love with a courageous, handsome Russian named Zhukovsky (Christopher Eccleston) who rushes into the burning barn to save her beloved horses. It turns out Zhukovsky had seen Dina several years ago in [[Bergen]] and was smitten by her, and has come to Reinsnes to court her. However, he leaves suddenly and Dina forces herself on Tomas.  Niels, deep into alcoholism, rapes a servant named Stina. When Dina finds out, she issues an ultimatum to Niels: Marry Stina or leave for America. Neils will not countenance marrying a servant, but cannot afford to leave for America. Zhukovsky then returns to Reinsnes to take a prisoner back to Bergen. When a drunken Niels staggers into the house, Dina announces that he too will soon be leaving, to America. Niels then decides to ask Stina to marry him, but she refuses. Overcome with rage, Niels hangs himself.  Dina's father then announces to Dina that Zhukovsky is an anarchist involved in a plot against the King, and is to hang. A distraught Dina rushes to Bergen to try and exonerate Zhukovsky. But when she visits him in prison and her visit's time is up, Dina attacks the guards, who then brutalize her, causing her to lose her baby with Zhukovsky. On the way back to Reinsnes, she is saved by Anders, who stops her bleeding. Her appeal is successful however, and Zhukovsky is released, though no one has seen him since. Several weeks later, Dina nearly drowns while teaching Benjamin how to sail but is miraculously saved by Zhukovsky who is on a nearby steamer. In her near death state, she dreams that she kills Zhukovsky when he announces that he is leaving her again. Dina then comes to, and asks if Zhukovsky is going to leave her again. Zhukovsky says he will always be leaving her, though he says he will always be coming back.

Kok Pin is pushed to excel at school by his mother ([[Xiang Yun]]), but he shows a talent for art, not academics &mdash; much to the consternation of his family.  Boon Hock and his mother struggle to make ends meet by running a small [[wonton noodle]] stall; to make up for the lack of a father figure, he places high value on loyalty and "manliness" in his friends.  The boys are often bullied for being in the "stupid" stream, which eventually leads to a fight during which one of the bullies is accidentally injured.  In the principal's office, Boon Hock and Kok Pin explain what happened, but Terry declines to testify on their behalf, following his mother's instructions to "mind his own business", which infuriates his friends and causes trouble between the boys.  Meanwhile, Terry's father, Mr. Khoo gets in a fight with a man who turns out to be Kok Pin's father, Mr. Liu ([[Jack Neo]]), over a parking space.  Mr. Khoo's company is a client for Mr. Liu's firm, an [[advertising agency]].

Contrary to Kok Pin's fears, his mother is satisfied because he has tried his best. When visiting Mrs. Liu at the hospital, the EM3 teacher announces that one of Kok Pin's drawings won second prize in an international competition, but the moment is overshadowed by the rush to save Mrs. Liu's life. Mr. Khoo passes the transplant test, but refuses to donate after discovering the intended recipient is his enemy's wife. He eventually relents, but it is revealed that due to a mix-up Terry, not Mr. Khoo, is the suitable donor. Despite protests from his parents, he insists on undergoing the operation, which is a success. A grateful Mr. Liu offers to help Mr. Khoo's business with his proposal. As a result, Mr. Khoo's business booms, and the two enemies become good friends.  The film ends with Terry being bullied again, as in the beginning of the movie &mdash; but this time, he stands up for himself and fights back.  
I Spy (film)
 At the Bureau of National Security headquarters, Special Agent Alex Scott is accosted by his rival, Carlos, before being briefed on his next mission. Scott is assigned to recover a stolen fighter, the "Switchblade," plane sold to arms dealer Arnold Gundars. Gundars is sponsoring Middleweight world boxing champion Kelly Robinson's next match and using the event to auction the plane. The agency has contacted Robinson and assigned him to be the civilian cover for Scott's mission. Scott and Robinson travel to Budapest, where Scott plans to penetrate Gundars' compound during a pre-fight party.  Arriving in Budapest, Robinson is kidnapped. During the interrogation Scott bursts in, frees Robinson, and fights the kidnappers before revealing this was a test which Kelly passed by not divulging Scott's identity. At Gundars's party, Robinson replaces Gundars's pen with a duplicate fitted with a tracking device before confronting his European challenger in the party's boxing ring. Scott, posing as a member of Robinson's entourage, uses this as a diversion to enter Gundars' private office and hack his computer. Robinson arrives unexpectedly and trips an alarm. The two are forced to escape and manage to evade their pursuers by hiding in a sewer.  After returning to base, Robinson coaches Scott into winning Agent Rachel Wright by feeding him lines from the song "Sexual Healing" by Marvin Gaye. Scott succeeds, but is interrupted by movement on the pen tracking device. He tracks Gundars to a bathhouse, which Scott believes is a dead end. Robinson has a hunch that the plane is hidden in the building, leading the two into a fight with Gundars's men. Gundars speeds off in his car, with Wright in pursuit. Wright's car explodes and Scott blames Robinson for her death. The two engage in a public confrontation that leads to Robinson's arrest. Scott convinces the BNS that the operation can continue and tracks Gundars down again.  Robinson reaches the arena just in time for his fight. Scott finds Gundars with terrorists, who are busy fitting the plane with a nuclear missile. Scott takes the men by surprise and forces them to surrender, before being disarmed by Agent Wright, who reveals she is a double agent. Wright tortures Scott for the Switchblade's activation codes. Scott activates the contact lens gadget, allowing Robinson to see the dilemma as he battles his opponent in the ring. Robinson gets knocked down for the first time in his career, but recovers, defeats his opponent, and departs for the bridge. Robinson sets off a firefight which kills many of the terrorists. After Carlos lands in a parachute, Robinson infers that Carlos is also corrupt. When Carlos provokes Kelly, he knocks him out, scattering the terrorists for them to take cover. Robinson takes out the remaining terrorists, while their leader, Zhu Tam, and Gundars are both killed by Wright. After the bomb on the plane is destroyed, Robinson tells Rachel to put the gun down. Wright makes up a lie that the BNS suspected that Carlos was corrupt and says that they pretended to team up with Carlos so they can catch him and uses this to convince the others that she is innocent. The confusion leads to a fight between Scott and Carlos, allowing Wright to escape with Gundars' briefcase. Scott and Robinson attempt to fly the Switchblade away, but it crashes into the river. While in the water, Robinson discovers the nuclear weapon. Scott realizes the mission is a success after all, and Robinson remarks that he will be recognized as a hero.  Later in Monte Carlo, Scott and Robinson track down Agent Wright and place her under arrest. Scott turns up a copy of USA Today and sees a picture of Carlos in a parade with President Bush. Robinson takes this news hard, and refuses to accompany Scott to BNS headquarters for a mission debrief. Scott tells Robinson the agency has perfected a jelly-like substance that will allow its wearer to float through the air. Robinson happily agrees to go, and Scott tells another agent to retrieve some jars of jelly and two parachutes.

Hanging over the family is the death of their five-year-old son Frankie, who died from a [[brain tumor]]. The devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Johnny questions God and has lost any ability to feel true emotions, which has affected his relationship with his family. Christy believes she has been granted three wishes by her dead brother, which she only uses at times of near-dire consequences for the family as they try to survive in New York.  After finding the apartment, Sarah gets a job in the local [[ice cream parlor]] to support the family while Johnny auditions for any role for which he is suited, with no success. Despite their poverty, the initial joy of being in the United States and the closeness of the family gives them the energy to make the most of what they have, and Christy chronicles the events of their life with a cherished [[camcorder]]. As money runs low and the city's temperatures soar, the family dip into savings to go to the movies to see ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and enjoy the air conditioning to find respite from the oppressive heat. Tensions between Johnny and Sarah begin to rise with the summer heat. Not helping their financial and emotional strain is the discovery that Sarah is pregnant.  Eventually Johnny finds work as a [[Taxicab|cab driver]] to augment their income and help pay for the girls' Catholic school tuition.  On [[Halloween]], the girls become friendly with Mateo when they knock at his door to [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]].

Later, Mateo falls down a flight of stairs and is knocked unconscious.

The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is [[Premature birth|born prematurely]] and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief [[nervous breakdown]] and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.  However, after calming her down, Johnny and Sarah agree to the blood transfusion but without giving the baby "bad blood," as using hospital blood banks was the source of Mateo's contraction of HIV. Shortly, it is discovered that Christy has a compatible blood type to donate with, and Mateo's death coincides with the first healthy movements of the infant following a [[blood transfusion]] from Christy. After the successful operation, the family is startled to learn that Mateo had settled and paid for their astronomical hospital bill before he had died, upon the discovery that Mateo was in possession of a large trust fund he never spent. They give the newborn baby girl the middle name of Mateo in gratitude and to honor his memory.  With the birth of the new baby and the death of Mateo, Johnny finally is able to overcome his lack of emotion and put his grieving for Frankie to rest. He also finally catches a break by getting a small role in ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' on Broadway.  The film ends after a baby shower at the apartment is held for the Sullivan family with many of the apartment tenants present to celebrate, and Christy and the rest of her family overlook the view of the city and look out for Mateo in the night's sky.

He is arrested by Major Hathaway of the Earth Security Administration (ESA), being identified as a [[Replicant#Replicants in popular culture|replicant]] created by the aliens. The ESA intercepted an alien transmission which cryptanalysts decoded as programming Olham's target to be the Chancellor, whom he was scheduled to meet. Such replicants are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories, and do not know they are replicants. Each has a powerful "u-bomb" in their chest, which can only be detected by dissection or a high-tech medical scan, since it only assembles itself when it gets in proximity to its target. Detection via the special scan works by comparing against a previous scan, if there was one.  Major Hathaway begins interrogating Olham. As Hathaway is about to drill out Olham's chest to find the bomb, Olham breaks loose and escapes, accidentally killing his friend Nelson in the process. With the help of underground stalker Cale, Olham avoids capture and sneaks into the hospital where his wife Maya is an administrator to get the high-tech scan redone and prove he's not a replicant. But the scan is interrupted by security forces before it can deliver the answer.  Olham and his wife are eventually captured by Hathaway's troops in a forest near an alien crash site, close to the spot where they spent a romantic weekend just a week or so before Olham's arrest. Inside the ship they discover the corpse of the real Maya, and Hathaway shoots the replicant before she can detonate. Hathaway thinks he has killed the true imposter, but as his men move debris away from the Centauri ship, the real Spencer Olham's body is revealed. At that moment, Olham realizes aloud that he really is a replicant, and the secondary trigger (his awareness of what he truly is) detonates his u-bomb, destroying himself, Hathaway, his troops, and everything else in a wide area, in a fiery nuclear explosion.   In the final scene, the news announces that Hathaway and the Olhams were killed in an enemy attack, as if the government were covering up the truth or didn't know what actually happened. Cale wonders if he ever really knew Olham's true identity.

 In this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play about mistaken identities, two gentlemen in 1890s [[London]] use the same [[pseudonym]], Ernest, for their secret courtship activities.  Chaos ensues when both men find themselves face-to-face and have to explain who they really are.  
In My Skin
  "In My Skin" tells the story of Esther ([[Marina de Van]]) who seems to have it all. She has a great job, an active social life and an adoring boyfriend.  One night, whilst attending a house party with colleagues, she hurts her leg in the backyard on some industrial supplies. Alone when it happens, she doesn't even realize she has been hurt until much later, briefly inspecting the damage in an upstairs bathroom. She leaves the party for more drinks with friends.  She visits a doctor (played by Van's real-life brother, Adrian de Van) afterwards, who patches her up and wonders why she didn't feel anything until much later. Esther wonders too, but seems unconcerned about any cosmetic damage. He asks her jokingly, "Are you sure it's your leg?"  The next day, Esther, in the bath, is fascinated by the folds of skin around her thigh. Her Boyfriend Vincent ([[Laurent Lucas]]) finds out about her injury after walking in on her taking off her dressings. He is concerned as to why she didn't feel anything until later too and even decides to test if she can feel anything by lightly touching her arm when she is not looking. She reacts to it normally, but they soon begin to fight before making up quickly.  At work, Esther is asked by a supervisor (Thibault de Montalembert) to correct a mistake she made. In the middle of typing she runs to a filing closet, finds a random piece of metal and proceeds to cut herself further. Esther then goes to her friend Sandrine ([[Lea Drucker]]) and asks her to come have a break but Sandrine declines. Esther reveals candidly that she has just cut herself before laughing it off. Sandrine is concerned and asks Esther to stay over at her place for the night.  At Sandrine's house Esther has a shower and Sandrine, coming in to deliver Esther's clean clothes, sees the extra cuts Esther made to her leg. Sandrine is shocked. Esther, is again indifferent to her loved-ones concerns. Later they talk about work, Sandrine is fed-up with work and wants to move up in the company they both belong to.  The next day, Sandrine and Esther attend a work function at a pool. Esther tells Sandrine she has just been promoted. Sandrine tries to act happy for Esther, but is obviously jealous. Esther later tells her boyfriend about Sandrine's jealousy but he just gets angry about the extra injuries to her leg. She asks him to stop questioning her about it. He reluctantly complies and they talk about moving in together.  Esther attends a dinner with her supervisor and some prestigious clients. She stays very quiet throughout the meal and soon loses control of her left arm. The arm moves around, messing up her plate of food and then, when she seems to have regained control, it detaches completely from her body. She begins to stab at it with her steak-knife. The others notice how silent and uncomfortable she is and she excuses herself from the table, with the knife.  She checks herself into a hotel across the road and proceeds to cut and chew at her hands and thighs, leaving big bite marks. She crashes her car in the woods to explain her injuries. Vincent meets her in the ambulance, inspecting her cuts and seeming suspicious.  Later, at her home, Vincent talks to her lovingly, telling her she will heal and talking about places they can move into together. Her supervisor at work, however, is not so forgiving and berates her for her behavior at the dinner.  Esther heads off to work the next day but becomes disorientated whilst walking through a busy shopping-strip. She stops to buy some supplies, including a camera and a new knife. She goes to another hotel room and begins to cut away at her flesh again. Including, in a very defiant act of self-mutilation, her face.  The next morning she goes to a pharmacist to ask how she might preserve a piece of her skin that she claims was cut out during surgery. The pharmacist, while seeming fairly perplexed, tells her to try to tan the skin.  Back at the hotel room, she calls her work, apologizing for her unexplained absence. She also calls her boyfriend and leaves a message telling him she won't be home that night.  In the morning she wakes up, gets dressed and inspects her piece of skin. It has gone hard and shriveled. She places it sadly and lovingly in her bra. She quickly leaves the room. But then a subsequent shot shows her, still lying on the bed, staring vacantly into the camera. The shot fades to black.

Indra (2002 film)
 ''Indra'' opens in a village in [[Andhra Pradesh]] showing the rivalry between two families. A police officer ([[Narra Venkateswara Rao]]) wishing to end this hostility comes up with the proposal of marriage between the two families which ultimately is used by Veera Siva Reddy as a trap to finish off his rival brothers, Bharatasimha Reddy and Vijayasimha Reddy. After the funeral, no one is willing to stake claim for the leadership of the clan when the young Indrasena Reddy, Bharatasimha Reddy's son, comes in and tells his grandmother that he will.  The story then moves to 2002 in Varanasi. Shankar Narayana is a taxi driver who has his own boat, makes an honest living, and is held in high regard by the members of his adopted family. During a singing competition held in his niece's college, her friend Pallavi ([[Sonali Bendre]]) sees him and falls in love. Pretending to be an orphan, she starts staying with Shankar Narayana and his family. Pallavi's father Chenna Kesava Reddy ([[Prakash Raj]]) is the governor of AP. Upon finding his daughter missing, he carries out a search and discovers that she is staying with a taxi driver and his family. He sends out an attack on his family. Enraged he goes to his house to discover that she is staying with Shankar Narayana. He folds his hands and greets him and it is hinted that he knows something about Shankar Narayana's past. The story carries on to Shankar Narayana's niece's wedding. Giri (Sivaji), who stays with Shankar Narayana and his family as a student says that he loved Shankar Narayana's niece. After the marriage, in the area only, Snehalata Reddy ([[Aarthi Agarwal]]) comes with her brother Veera Shankar Redddy ([[Mukesh Rishi]]), Siva Reddy's eldest son. Snehalata tells Giri to get up, and reveals that Giri is actually Veera Manohar Reddy, Veera Shankar Reddy's son and Snehalata's nephew. She also reveals that Shankar Narayana is really Indrasena Reddy. After the marriage is over, Valmiki ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), Indrasena's loyal friend, tells the past of Shankar Narayana.  Indrasena Reddy/Shankar Narayana was held in regard in his village. He used to work for the benefit of the people. Siva Reddy, who had murdered Indrasena's family, is warned by him not to return to the village. Siva Reddy returns and, in the ensuing battle, Indrasena kills him. After this, his sons swear revenge on Indrasena and his family. One day Indrasena saves a boy from being run over by a truck â he turns out to be Veera Shankar Reddy's son. Veera Shankar Reddy is furious that his son was saved by his enemy, and he kills his own son. Indrasena, upon hearing this, storms Veera Shankar Redddy's house and confronts him. He buries the boy in the courtyard and plants a sapling over it and tells the boy's mother to pour water to the plant everyday, also warning the brothers that if anything were to happen to the plant, he would kill all of them. Snehalatha (Siva Reddy's daughter) sees this, falls for Indrasena, and tells him that she will marry him.  The town has been suffering from drought. When one of the villagers tell Indrasena this, he goes to Chenna Kesava Reddy, previously a collector, and asks to build a reservoir because the poor don't have enough water supply. The government is unable to help because the place where the reservoir can be constructed is owned by Veera Shankar Reddy and his family who are not giving it up. Indrasena calls a meeting and asks them to hand over the land in exchange for whatever they want. The brothers ask for all of his property and a promise that he will leave the village while Snehalata asks Indrasena to marry her. Indrasena agrees and the reservoir is built. On the day of the wedding, unknown to Snehalata, her elder brother murders Indrasena's sisters and their husbands. In a state of rage, Indrasena goes on a rampage, killing three of the brothers. Snehalata swears revenge and sends her nephew, Veera Manohar Reddy, to seduce Indrasena's niece.  Indrasena then returns to his village of Rayalaseema. Later Snehalata realizes the truth of her brother killing Indrasena's family by Veera Shankar Reddy's brother-in-law ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]) as she tells it to her brother, and asks Veera Manohar Reddy to go ahead and marry Indrasena's niece. Veera Shankar Reddy starts a hase for them as they go in the car and finally Indrasena battles all of them but does not kill Veera Shankar Reddy and suggests that they end the rivalry here only. In the end, Snehalata and Pallavi try to convince Indrasena Reddy to marry them but neither are successful as he still wants to work for the people.  
Insomnia (2002 film)
 In the small fishing town of [[Nightmute, Alaska]], 17-year-old Kay Connell is found murdered. LAPD detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to assist the local police with their investigation, at the request of police chief Nyback, an old colleague of Dormer's. Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a young local detective who is also a fan of Dormer's investigative work, picks them up when they arrive. Back in LA, [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] is investigating Dormer. Flying to Alaska, Eckhart reveals that he is going to provide testimony against Dormer in exchange for immunity, to which Dormer responds that many criminals whom he helped to convict using [[False evidence|questionable evidence]] could go free if their cases are reopened.  Dormer attracts the murderer to the scene of the crime, but the suspect flees into the fog, shooting one of the police officers through the leg. Dormer spots a figure in the fog and fires with his backup weapon. Rushing to the fallen figure, Dormer picks up a .38 pistol the suspect has dropped. He then discovers that he has shot Eckhart. Because of Eckhart's pending testimony, Dormer thinks that Internal Affairs will never believe the shooting was an accident, so he claims that Eckhart was shot by the suspect. He doesn't mention he has the .38 pistol. Burr is put in charge of the shooting investigation, and her team finds the .38 caliber bullet that hit the officer. That night, Dormer walks to an alley and fires the .38 pistol into an animal carcass, then retrieves and cleans the bullet. At the morgue, the staffer hands him the bagged bullet retrieved from Eckhart's body but she is unfamiliar with its type. Dormer leaves and switches the .38 bullet for the 9mm slug from Eckhart's body.  Over the next few days, Dormer is plagued by insomnia, brought on by his guilt over killing Eckhart and exacerbated by the [[Midnight sun|perpetual daylight]]. Dormer starts receiving anonymous phone calls from the killer, who claims to have witnessed Dormer kill his partner. When the police learn that Kay was a fan of local crime writer Walter Finch, Dormer breaks into Finch's apartment in the nearby village of [[Umkumiut]]. Finch arrives home, realizes the police are present, and evades Dormer after a chase. Dormer returns to Finch's apartment and plants the .38 to frame Finch.  Finch contacts Dormer and arranges a meeting on a ferry. Finch wants help in shifting suspicion to Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy Stetz and will stay silent about the Eckhart shooting in return. Dormer gives advice on handling police questioning. After Finch leaves Dormer on the ferry, he shows the detective a tape recorder he used to record the conversation.  Finch calls Dormer and tells him that Kay's death was "an accident"âhe beat her to death in a fit of rage after she rejected his advances. The next day, Finch gives false testimony at the police station. When Finch claims Randy has a gun, Dormer realizes Finch has discovered his plant, and has hidden it at Randy's home. Randy is arrested when the gun is found at his house. Finch asks Burr to come to his lake house the next day, to collect letters indicating that Randy abused Kay.  Burr returns to the scene of Eckhart's death and finds a 9mm shell casing, which conflicts with the bullet type from Eckhart's body. She reads old case files from investigations Dormer was involved in and learns he has carried a 9mm, leading her to suspect that he shot Eckhart. Meanwhile, Dormer confides in the hotel owner, Rachel Clement, about the Internal Affairs investigation: he fabricated evidence to help convict a pedophile he was certain was guilty of murdering a child.  Dormer learns that Burr has gone to Finch's. He finds Kay's letters in Finch's apartment and realizes that Finch intends to kill Burr. He learns of Finch's lake house and rushes there. At the house, Finch knocks Burr unconscious just as Dormer arrives. Dormer is too disoriented from lack of sleep to fight off Finch. Burr revives and saves Dormer, while Finch escapes. Burr reveals she knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he admits that he is no longer certain if it was an accident. From his shed, Finch shoots at them with a shotgun, and Burr returns fire while Dormer sneaks around to Finch's location. After a scuffle in which the men inadvertently exchange weapons, Finch shoots Dormer with the 9mm pistol, and Dormer shoots and kills Finch with the shotgun. Burr rushes to the fatally wounded Dormer and comforts him by affirming that Eckhart's shooting was accidental, then moves to throw away the 9mm shell casing to preserve Dormer's secret. Dormer stops Burr, however, telling her not to lose her way and asks her to let him sleep.

IrrÃ©versible
 ''IrrÃ©versible'' contains thirteen scenes presented in reverse chronological order. They are arranged here in chronological order. # An Italian woman living in France named Alex ([[Monica Bellucci]]) is reading ''[[An Experiment with Time]]'' by [[J. W. Dunne]] in a park, surrounded by playing children. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th Symphony]] is heard in the background. The camera spins around faster and faster until it blacks out into a [[Strobe light|strobe]] effect, accompanied by a pulsing, roaring sound. A rapidly spinning image of a lawn sprinkler resembling the cosmos can be dimly perceived. A title card reads: "Le Temps Detruit Tout" ("Time destroys everything")a phrase uttered in the film's first scene. The film ends. # Alex sits on the bed clothed, her hand on her belly. A poster for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', with the tagline "The Ultimate Trip", is above the headboard. # Alex lies in bed with Marcus ([[Vincent Cassel]]) after having sex. Alex reveals she might be pregnant, and Marcus is pleased with the possibility. They prepare to go to a party, and Marcus leaves to buy wine. Alex takes a shower, then uses a home pregnancy test that confirms she is pregnant. She is elated. # At a nearby [[Paris MÃ©tro]] station and aboard a subway train, Alex, Marcus and Pierre ([[Albert Dupontel]]) are on their way to a party. They discuss sex, and Pierre refers to the fact that he and Alex were once dating, but are no longer in a relationship. He implies that Marcus stole Alex from him. # Alex, Marcus, and Pierre have arrived at the party. Alex is annoyed by Marcus's unrestrained use of drugs and alcohol and his flirtatious behavior with other women, and consequently decides to leave the party alone.  # On her way home, Alex sees a pimp called "Le Tenia" ("The Tapeworm") ([[Jo Prestia]]) beating a [[transsexual]] prostitute named Concha (Jaramillo) in a pedestrian underpass. Once the man sees Alex, he releases Concha and turns his attention to Alex, who attempts to flee, but Le Tenia catches her and threatens her with a knife. Le Tenia pins Alex to the ground and anally rapes her for several minutes of screentime, after which he brutally beats her into unconsciousness. # Marcus and Pierre leave the party and encounter commotion on the street. Marcus wails as he discovers Alex's bloodied body being wheeled on a stretcher into an ambulance by paramedics. # Alex is hospitalized and revealed to be comatose. Marcus and Pierre are questioned by the police. They then talk to a street thug named Mourad (Mourad Khima) and his friend Layde (Hellal). The two gangsters promise, if they get paid, to help them find the rapist, who Mourad claims is Le Tenia. Marcus and Pierre go looking for the man who raped Alex. Marcus is still high on drugs and very agitated.  # The men track down Concha, Le Tenia's last victim. At first, she refuses to talk to them. After Marcus threatens to slash her with a piece of broken glass, she identifies Le Tenia as the rapist and says he can be found at a gay [[BDSM]] nightclub called The Rectum. They are soon chased by angry sex workers seeking to defend Concha. Mourad and Layde run in a separate direction. # Marcus and Pierre hail a taxi. Following a row, Marcus assaults the taxi driver and steals the car. # Marcus and Pierre go to The Rectum, but do not know what Le Tenia looks like. Marcus finds Le Tenia standing with another man. Thinking the other man is Le Tenia, he assaults him, but the man wrestles Marcus to the ground, breaks Marcus's arm, and attempts to rape Marcus on the club floor. Pierre defends Marcus by using a fire extinguisher to crush the man's skull, thus killing him. # Police arrest Pierre and put him in handcuffs. An ambulance arrives, and Marcus is put on a stretcher and taken from the club. Outside, Mourad and Layde shout [[homophobia|homophobic]] insults at Pierre and Marcus. The murdered man is revealed not to be Le Tenia after all. Rather, the man standing next to him in the club was the real Le Tenia. # Across the street in a small apartment, two men are talking about sex. One of them is "the Butcher", the protagonist of NoÃ©'s previous film, ''[[I Stand Alone (film)|I Stand Alone]]''. In a drunken monologue, the Butcher reveals that he was arrested for having sex with his own daughter. The subject of their discussion shifts to the commotion in the streets outside. Without looking out the window, they derisively attribute the commotion to the patrons of The Rectum. Outside, Mourad is seen talking to a police officer.  
Infernal Affairs
  Chan Wing-yan, a police officer, goes undercover into a [[Triad (underground society)|triad]]; only his direct superior, Superintendent Wong, is aware of his mission and true identity. Around the same time, Lau Kin-ming, a triad member, infiltrates the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] on the orders of a powerful gang boss, Hon Sam. Each [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] has been planted by the rival organisation to gain an advantage in [[Criminal intelligence|intelligence]] over the other side. Over the course of ten years, Chan experiences great stress from his undercover work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department.  Using [[Morse code]] the Chan is able to relay data back to the police. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to order his minions to dispose of the evidence. After the incident, both Wong and Hon are tasked with finding the moles in their respective organization.   Wong intends to pull Chan out of undercover work for fear of his safety. However, he is caught by Hon's men and is killed when he is thrown off the building, having refused to reveal Chan despite the beating from the gangsters.  Through this incident, Lau retrieves Wong's cell phone and contacts Chan; both of them agree to foil a drug deal by Hon. The plan succeeds and many of Hon's men are arrested, while Lau betrays Hon and murders him. Everything seems to have returned to normal. However, back at the police headquarters, Chan discovers that Lau was the mole and leaves immediately.   Chan and Lau meet on the same rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau and holds a pistol to his head as a rebuke to Lau's plea for forgiveness and request to remain as a cop. Inspector B arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan holds Lau as a hostage at gunpoint and backs into the lift, but upon moving his head from behind Lau he is suddenly shot in the head by B. B then reveals to Lau that he is also a mole planted by Hon. As they take the lift down to the lobby, Lau kills B out of his desire to eradicate traces of his past, become a "good guy" cop, and end the mole hunt.  Stepping out of the lift, Lau shows his identity card to the police to identify himself as one of them. Months after Chan's death, Lee discovers records revealing Chan's true identity as an undercover police officer; B becomes a scapegoat for Lau as the real mole in the police force and the case is closed. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral. A flashback reaffirms the point that Lau wished he had taken a different route in life.  
Interstate 60 (film)
  The film opens with two college students in a bar, talking about a [[thesis statement]] for an upcoming paper. One of them makes an argument that America is unique in that it has no real [[mythological]] character for granting wishes, such as a [[genie]] or [[leprechaun]]. The two men are soon joined in conversation by an old man at the bar claiming that America does, named O.W. Grant; the son of a [[leprechaun]] and a Cheyenne Indian.  O.W. Grant, who is yet found near Interstate 60, wears a red bow tie, carries a pipe with mysterious powers in the shape of a monkey-head and grants people their wish, often with the macabre twist that the wish manifests exactly as it was worded.  In the opening credits, Grant ([[Gary Oldman]]), rides down a city street where a man ([[Michael J. Fox]]) opens his car door, causing Grant to fall from his bike and break his pipe. Then a truck runs over and smashes Grant's bicycle along with man's cellphone thus breaking his business conversation. Last thing makes the man infuriated and he says that he would like never to meet Grant. Grant, seemingly amused, asks the man if he wished the event never happened. When the man says yes, green smoke billows from Grant's pipe and the scene begins again. This time, Grant safely avoids the car door. As he watches, the man gets out of his car and is crushed by the oncoming truck. Grant retorts, "Some people just don't know what to wish for."   The story then switches over to Neal Oliver who works at a [[warehouse]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], at night on the stocking crew that gets food ready to be delivered to local grocery stores. Although he has a rich family, and his dad works as a [[lawyer]], Neal works the warehouse job to not have to rely on his family for spending money. While he aspires to become an [[artist]], he does not have enough faith in his work, and his girlfriend is a [[psychology]] major who keeps analyzing him without offering any real support. He also has recurring dreams about a blonde-haired girl ([[Amy Smart|Smart]]), whom he keeps drawing and painting.  On his twenty-second birthday, his family is gathered in a restaurant to celebrate. Among the gifts and smiles, O.W. Grant, dressed as a [[waiter]], serves them their cake. Neal blows out the candles and tells everyone that he wished for an answer to his life, to which his father presumptuously hands him an acceptance letter to a prestigious law school. Watching from a corner, Grant is intrigued by Neal's wish, considering it one of the few he heard that is not entirely self-serving. As the family goes outside to look at the car (a new red [[BMW]] convertible) that Neal's dad bought him (which suits his dad's taste more than it does Neal's), a bucket falls onto Neal's head, knocking him out. Later, he wakes up in the hospital, where a doctor named Ray ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) comes in and does a quick sight test with Neal using [[playing card]]s. He holds them up quickly and Neal has to name the suit on the cards.  At the end of the test, Neal confidently asks if he got it right, at which Ray replies that he did not, since the cards actually had red spades and black hearts. Ray then gives Neal a small lecture about how things aren't always what they seem. He leaves, and another doctor comes in confirming that they don't have a doctor named Ray on their staff.   Shortly after getting out of the hospital, more strange happenings occur around Neal. At a Chinese restaurant, his [[fortune cookie]] 'fortune' reads: 'Oct 15th. Are you sure?' The date is the same day of the law school interview that his Dad had set up. However, when one of Neal's friends looks at the fortune, the letters have disappeared.  While working at his warehouse job, he notices a [[billboard]] with the same girl on it that he has been painting in his art pieces. Neal is curious to find out who she is, and calls the billboard company that placed the advertisement, only to have them say that the display is blank. Bewildered, Neal drives back to the location to find that the billboard has now changed to a new image with the girl and a telephone number. Neal gives it a call, and a recorded message tells him that he has an appointment for the next day at a specific time. The next day, Neal goes to his appointment on the 13th floor of the specific building, only to find that the building doesn't have one. Taking a cue from an ad in the elevator (which also has the girl on it), he presses the '10' and '3' buttons on the elevator, and ends up on floor 13.  Once there, he again meets Ray who gives him a package to deliver, but does not tell him what is inside; addressed to a Robin Fields in a town called Danver in Colorado (not "[[Denver]]"). Ray then explains the rules of the delivery: if Neal leaves the 13th floor with the package, he must deliver it. As well, he is not allowed to open the parcel or find out what is inside it. Neal is then given a contract, which he signs with a pen, and seals with a drop of blood per Ray's request. Once he has done so, Ray cautions him that there's a killer on the loose, and to be careful. However, when Neal presses for more information, Ray will not continue further. As Neal leaves with his assignment, Ray tells him that he'll find Danver by taking Interstate 60.  Neal checks a number of roadmaps, but there does not appear to be an Interstate 60. Taking a guess, he sets out West, only to encounter O.W. Grant along the roadside. Grant happily greets Neal, and hands him a bag containing a 'birthday present.' The present turns out to be a [[Magic 8-Ball]], which can answer any yes-or-no question that Neal asks it. Shortly after their meeting, Grant gives Neal some directions, and they are soon on the unlisted Interstate 60.     Traveling along the mysterious highway, Neal and Grant discuss such things as the humor found in causing people to recognize the gullible side of themselves, Grant's unfortunate accident that cost him his penis, and the certainty of knowing what to wish for. Grant departs soon after, leaving Neal to run into such characters as:  * A [[promiscuous woman]] (played by [[Amy Jo Johnson]]) looking for perfect sex.  She leaves the car after Neal tells her that her "perfect sex" will be what she never got from him, because its potential will outweigh any real-life encounter. * The same man who told the two men in the beginning about O.W. Grant. Neal and O.W. encounter him as he walks into a diner and makes a bet that he can eat a gigantic amount of food in an hour without throwing up or relieving himself. He wins the bet, but reveals that he got this ability as a wish, and that it has drained any enjoyment of food he used to have. * A dying and persistently honest ex-advertiser named Bob Cody ([[Chris Cooper]]) with lung cancer...and [[dynamite]]. He hires Neal to drive him, and approves when he follows his requests (silence and honesty). He later helps Neal in the town of Morlaw. * A lonely mother looking for her slacker son, who turns out to be living in a city where the population is addicted to a government-controlled drug, [[Euphoria]]; [[Kurt Russell]] is the local police chief with a penchant for dry humor. * A Museum of Art Fraud run by Mrs. James ([[Ann-Margret]]) that actually contains real masterpieces posing as fakes that are undetected by the visiting [[poseur]]s. * The town of Morlaw, where every citizen is a lawyer who spend their days suing each other, and imprisoning and exploiting unwary travelers on trumped-up charges.  It's here that Neal is finally united with the imprisoned  Lynn ([[Amy Smart]]), whom he has been painting and drawing. When he gets her released from prison, she turns out to be far from the perfection he expected, swearing in an uncouth and rude manner â but it turns out to be a ruse to make sure that Neal does not just want to get into her pants.  Once they are free, Lynn explains that she had previously met O.W. Grant, and had wished to find the right guy; Neal's experiences were actually tests to qualify her princeâthough she hadn't counted on her wish leaving her in jail for one year. After exchanging conversation, they realize that they have much in common and spend the night together at the "Fork in the Road" motel. Neal also makes a painting of the motel in the waking hours of the morning. Neal then leaves to ensure that he delivers the package in Danver, due to the contract he signed. However, Lynn stays behind, as a letter from O.W. Grant cautions her not to go.  However, when driving on the way to Danver, Neal's car matches that of a reported murderer on the loose. He abandons the vehicle, and the police get into a confrontation with the real killer in an identical car, which ends in a fiery car wreck. Neal asks one of the policemen who he was, and replies that he was a St. Louis law school student who went insane and murdered his own father.  After [[hitchhiking]] a ride to Danver, Neal finally makes it to the Rainbow Club. Entering a seemingly-abandoned bar, he is reunited with the mysterious Ray, and is stunned when "Robin Fields" turns out to the whimsical O.W. Grant himself, whose insistence at holding people to their tasks prevented him from reclaiming his package earlier in the film. Upon taking delivery of the package (which holds a replacement monkey-head pipe for O.W.'s broken one), Grant uses his magic powers to "warp" Neal back in time, where he wakes up in the hospital before he first encountered Ray.  Leaving the hospital, Neal finally confronts his father and asserts his right to live his life without his father's interference, and then proceeds with his sister to an art gallery at her insistence, confused as to why he'd need to be there with none of his work submitted. Once there, he realizes that his painting of the "Fork in the Road" was submitted to the art gallery. A few moments later, Grant appears, reminding Neal of the value of honesty and humor. A girl who resembles Lynn (also Amy Smart) talks to him, interested in commissioning him to do a series of paintings on roadside motels and diners. As they chat, Grant is seen talking softly to Neal's sister. "You have a birthday coming up, right?" he says, smiling mischievously. "Don't forget to make a wish..."

Interview with the Assassin
 An unemployed cameraman, Ron Kobeleski (Haggerty), is asked by his reclusive neighbor, a retired [[United States Marine Corp|Marine]] named Walter Ohlinger (Barry) who has been diagnosed with terminal [[cancer]], to document a startling confession: that he, not [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], killed [[Presidents of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] on November 22, 1963.  A stunned Kobeleski learns that the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] that says there was a second gunman on the [[Dealey Plaza#Grassy knoll|grassy knoll]] is true &mdash; because he was that second gunman.  To prove it, he shows Kobeleski a spent [[Casing (ammunition)|casing]] from the [[rifle]] he used.  A skeptical Kobeleski demands proof, and follows Ohlinger as he attempts to prove his claims.  He speaks to people who would seem to support Ohlinger's claims, but others, most notably his ex-wife, point to Ohlinger being a fraud and a lunatic.  The film ends with Walter Ohlinger's failed attempt to assassinate the present-day president. Kobeleski later shoots Ohlinger in self-defense at his own home. Ron Kobeleski is arrested and charged as an accomplice in the assassination attempt, and sent to prison for 3 years. In a short interview with a reporter, he states that "telling his side of the story won't help him at all." The closing credits state that Kobeleski was killed in prison.  For the most part, ''Interview with the Assassin'' is filmed from the perspective of Ron Kobeleski, as if he had shot it with his own camera.  On a few occasions, the viewer actually sees Dylan Haggerty, the actor portraying him.

John Q.
 A motorist is driving dangerously down a winding road, recklessly passing cars until she comes upon a slow moving Mack truck. As she attempts to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her.  Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and that he will die without a heart transplant. The procedure is very expensive: $250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of $75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ recipient list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his [[health insurance]] has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise $75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital eventually tires of waiting and plans to release Michael, and an outraged, distraught Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his son die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible or the hostages die. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off.  Meanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other. They begin to understand John's situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for. One of them, Miriam, is pregnant, and her husband Steve is hoping that their first child is healthy. A young hostage, Julie, has a broken arm, and she and her boyfriend Mitch claim that a car crash caused it. Due to holes in their story, John and another hostage, Lester, conclude the two are lying and that Mitch beat up Julie. After a while, John agrees to release some hostages to have his son's name added to the list an hour afterward. He releases Steve, Miriam, and a hostage named Rosa with her baby.  The Chicago Chief of Police, Gus Monroe, gives a [[SWAT]] unit permission to insert a sniper into the building via an air shaft. John is shot but ends up receiving only a minor wound, which is treated right away. After taking the shot, the sniper's leg falls through the ceiling tiles. Outraged, John pulls him out of the air shaft and beats him up. Using the bound SWAT policeman as a human shield, he steps outside to the sight of dozens of policemen pointing weapons at him and a large, supportive crowd. John demands that his son be brought to the emergency room. The police agree to his demand in exchange for the SWAT sniper.  Once his son arrives, John reveals to the hostages his intention to commit suicide so his heart can be used to save his son. He persuades Dr. Turner to perform the operation, and two of his hostages bear witness to a will stating his last request. John says his last goodbyes to Michael and enters the operating room. He loads 1 bullet into the gun; his gun was never loaded and he never intended to kill any of the hostages. John pulls the trigger, but the safety is on. As he prepares to end his life a second time, his wife learns about an organ donor (the woman killed in the beginning of the film) who has been flown to the hospital for organ recovery. She runs to the emergency room and stops John from shooting himself, and John allows the hostages to go free. Michael is given the life-saving operation and, after watching the procedure with Denise, John is taken into police custody. Afterwards the entire ordeal becomes subject to a national debate about the quality and accessibility of insurance and healthcare. Three months later at his trial, all of the witnesses speak on his behalf. He is later acquitted of charges of [[attempted murder]] and armed criminal action but is found guilty of false imprisonment. It is never revealed what his sentence for the crime will be, but his lawyer is overheard and saying that no judge will give him "more than three to five (years)" and that she will try to get it reduced to two.  
Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie
   [[List of VeggieTales characters#Bob the Tomato|Bob the Tomato]] and [[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad and Mom Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]] are driving Veggie children to see the popular singer "Twippo" in concert. During the drive, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Laura Carrot|Laura]] taunts the other children because she won a backstage pass, which particularly annoys [[List of VeggieTales characters#Junior Asparagus|Junior]]. Meanwhile, Bob is frustrated with Dad for singing songs and playing his guitar instead of helping him with the map. After being struck on the head by Dad's guitar, Bob loses control of the van, leading Laura to lose her pass. To make matters worse, soon afterwards a porcupine shoots out two of the van's tires, and the van veers off the road and careens down a hill, stopping short of a river.  In a nearby restaurant, Bob blames Dad Asparagus for the crash and Junior tells Laura losing her pass was her own fault. As Bob calls up a [[tow truck]], Junior is met by [[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie|The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]], who tell Junior he was being rather tough on his friend and encourage him to show some compassion. To emphasize, they tell all the Veggies a story about a man of God named [[Jonah]].  Jonah is a Prophet of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] who goes from town to town delivering God's messages. But when God asks him to deliver a message to [[Nineveh]], a town known for its corrupt citizens, he resents Him and runs away to [[Tarshish]] with The Pirates. After leaving port, a guilt-stricken Jonah goes below deck to rest where he meets a salesman caterpillar named [[List of VeggieTales characters#Khalil|Khalil]], who agrees to go with Jonah to sell his merchandise.  After experiencing a [[nightmare]], Jonah awakens to find the ship beset by a great storm. Captain Pa Grape concludes the storm has been sent because God is angry at someone on the ship. The group decides to play [[Go Fish]] to [[Cleromancy|divine]] who is at fault. Jonah loses the game and is forced to [[walk the plank]]. As soon as Jonah is off the ship, the skies clear. The Pirates attempt to reel Jonah back in, but before they can do so, Jonah is swallowed by a giant whale. The pirates attempt to attack the whale using a cannon with cannonballs and a bowling ball as ammo, but the whale merely swallows the ball (which Khalil is hiding in), disgorges Jonah's lifebelt, and swims away.  Inside the whale, Khalil finds a grieving Jonah and the pair are soon visited by a host of God's angels, who explain that if Jonah repents, God will grant him a second chance. Upon repenting, Jonah and Khalil are spit up onto the shore, where they ride Jonah's camel Reginald to Nineveh.  As Jonah reaches the entrance, The Pirates appear and help sneak him into the city under the guise of having won the Mr. Twisty's Twisted [[Cheese puffs|Cheese Curls]] sweepstakes. The group is soon arrested after [[List of VeggieTales characters#Larry the Cucumber|Larry]] tries to steal the King's Cheese Curls and are [[Capital Punishment|sentenced to death]]. As a last request, they are granted an audience with King Twistomer. Jonah then delivers the message given to him by God that the Ninevites should immediately repent of their ways forever or Nineveh will be destroyed; King Twistomer and the Ninevites quickly agree.  Still expecting God to destroy Nineveh for their past [[sin]]s, Jonah watches and waits from a distance in the hot sun. God provides a plant to shade Jonah, only for Khalil to eat a single leaf off the plant, which kills it. Jonah laments the dead plant, and Khalil is disappointed Jonah shows compassion for a plant, but not the Ninevites. Khalil then tries to explain God is compassionate and merciful and that he wants to give everyone, both Israelites and non-Israelites, a second chance. Jonah refuses to accept this and states it would be better if he was dead. The story ends with Khalil and Reginald leaving Jonah to his sulking.  Back in the present day, the Veggies are disappointed in the anti-climactic ending, but come to understand the point of the story: God wants everybody to show compassion and mercy, even to those that do not seem to deserve it. Twippo then appears in the restaurant unexpectedly and offers to give everybody a lift to the concert, while Bob forgives Dad Asparagus and Junior gives his Twippo ticket to Laura. The film ends with a song and the surprise arrival of the tow truck driver, who is none other than Khalil.

Larry then says to Bob that it's time to roll the next song.  ===Countertop Segment #4 (Larry the Chicken)=== After the ''Lyle'' Medley, Larry continues to try to get Archibald out of his dressing room, but Archibald refuses. So Larry imitates a chicken to Bob and Archie's annoyances, causing Bob to turn off the lights. Bob claims they blew a fuse on the movie set. Larry then expresses his fear of the dark. Bob then tells him if he knew what it was like to be in a belly of the whale, he will be compassionate towards Archie and reminds him that Jonah was in the whale for three days.  ===Countertop Segment #5 (The VeggieTales Memorabilia Auction)=== Larry decides to show Bob his priceless memorabilia from ''VeggieTales'' episodes, including a piece of chewing gum (from ''Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen''), the first LarryBoy helmet (from ''Larry-Boy! And the Fib from Outer Space!''), and a partially eaten jelly doughnut (from ''Dave and the Giant Pickle''). Bob accidentally bumps into the LarryBoy helmet, causing one of its plungers to hit the doughnut, knocking it to the ground for the LarryBoy helmet to smash it. Larry then states that it's $77,000,000, since it's rare; Bob objects and tells Larry to show mercy. When asked how much, Bob says that mercy is free and that we should show mercy to others since God shows mercy to us. At this, Larry follows Bob's advice. Bob then asks Larry to help him get Archibald out of his dressing room. Larry agrees, but asks Bob to help him get the jelly off the floor.  ===Countertop Segment #6 (Hero Help)=== Larry offers to help Archibald by giving him courage. Bob suggests that he slips some under the door, but Larry has a better idea: to inspire him with courageous heroes from the silver screen. First, he tries to be like [[Indiana Jones]] calling himself Indiana Larry, but that doesn't work. Then he tries to be like [[James Bond]] penning himself Larry Bond, but it doesn't work either. Finally he comes out as LarryBoy, but that doesn't work either. Bob comes out and comforts him, saying that real courage doesn't come from watching movie heroes, but from believing God.  ===Countertop Segment #7 (Outroduction)=== Larry comes out in a scuba outfit and states that since Archibald won't come out of his dressing room, they're going to take matters into their own hands. When questioned, Larry states that they'll pick someone else to play Jonah: Larry. Bob gets worried, but Larry tells him that he is got his speech for the Academy Awards ready. Bob cuts him off and tells him that he forgot something Jonah discovered; that it's important to praise God. Larry tries to defend himself, but discovers that Archibald is out of his dressing room. Bob then asks him he's gonna be Jonah after all and Archibald agrees because he doesn't want Larry to do it. Although Bob is glad that Archibald is back, Larry wonders if the Pirates will now only be supporting actors.  
Johnny Flynton
 Based on a true story and starring [[Dash Mihok]] in the title role, the film follows an undefeated boxer, Johnny Flynton, in a small Alabama town on the day of a local exhibition fight that sparks a series of tragic events.  
Jologs
 The first character shown is Ruben ([[John Prats]]). A college student, his job at Barako CafÃ© owned by Trigger ([[Onemig Bondoc]]) is not nearly enough to pay his tuition. Having lost his scholarship on a technicality, Ruben resorts to burglary at his father's house in order to cover his educational expenses. What ensues is a comedic overly choreographed fight-scene complete with wire work and overdone martial arts action.  Shona (Michelle Bayle) leaves her daughter and her boyfriend Mando (played by [[Diether Ocampo]]) in order to return to work in Japan as an exotic dancer. Her predicament exemplifies the situation of every Filipino person who has come to the realization that life in the Philippines often does not allow the working person to earn money enough to save for a better living.  Cher ([[Baron Geisler]]) is a [[drag queen]] who, because of her sexuality, becomes the victim of violent [[homophobic]] aggression. His performance, while exaggeratedly comic, touches on the ugliness of homophobia and [[sexual discrimination]]. And yet the issue is never resolved, because Cherâs attackers are not punished for their hate crime. Neither is Shona condemned for abandoning her child in this instance of labor export from the Philippines, and the effects that it has on the people who must be left. Rubenâs moral and practical [[dilemma]] remains unresolved as well.  The lives of three couples: Iza ([[Assunta de Rossi]]) and IÃ±igo ([[Dominic Ochoa]]), Kulas ([[Vhong Navarro]]) and Joan ([[Julia Clarete]]), and Dino ([[Patrick Garcia]]) and Faith ([[Jodi Sta. Maria]]) deal with objectification, unrequited love, and first sexual experiences, respectively.  
Joe and Max
 In 1936 African American boxer [[Joe Louis]] ([[Leonard Roberts]]), trained by [[Jack Blackburn]] ([[Richard Roundtree]]), is undefeated and apparently invincible. Then Jewish-American boxing manager Joe Jacobs ([[David Paymer]]) obtains a film of his fight against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Jacobs delivers the film to his client, German heavyweight champion [[Max Schmeling]] ([[Til Schweiger]]). A pioneer of video analysis, Schmeling discovers how Louis always neglects his guard when he has just delivered a certain blow. Schmeling decides to seek a fight with Louis. The next year they fight in the United States. The German, who is nine years Louis's senior, surprises everybody by winning.  The German boxer returns home. The reigning [[Nazi]]s strive to exploit his coup for their [[propaganda]], but he refuses to sign a [[treatise]] supporting the Nazi line because for him it is unthinkable to comply with the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]]. Only his currently huge popularity saves him from their wrath. Moreover, Schmeling is allowed to keep his manager despite all the discrimination Jews are facing in Germany at this time. Nevertheless, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] ([[Rolf Kanies]]) himself forces Schmeling to sign the Nazi treatise at last.  Schmeling feels that he owes Louis a rematch. This time the US-American audience is completely against Schmeling because the Nazis have succeeded in using him in their propaganda. Right at the beginning of this fight Schmeling is hit in the [[lumbar|lumbar region]] and suffers a spinal injury. Unable to keep on fighting he must forfeit. Joe Louis visits him after the fight when Schmeling is being treated in a hospital.  Joe Jacobs remains in USA when Schmeling returns home again. Schmeling's wife, [[Anny Ondra]] ([[Peta Wilson]]), waits for him at the airport; but this time there is nobody else to receive him. Joe's fate is exactly the opposite. He is revered by the public, but his wife Marva ([[Siena Goines]]) leaves him because she can't deal with the effect this has on him. Meanwhile in [[Nazi Germany]] the [[Reichskristallnacht]] takes place. Max Schmeling and Anny Ondra hide his Jewish tailor in their house. In the end only Anny Ondra's aptitude as an actress saves their lives. Even so, Max Schmeling never agrees to become a member of the ruling Nazi party. Eventually he has to serve as a [[paratrooper]] while Joe Louis does exhibition fights for the [[United States Army]].  After the war both boxers face personal difficulties. Schmeling's house in Germany is destroyed. Joe Louis has problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Both are clearly past their prime, but still they have to return to the boxing ring. Max Schmeling is eventually lucky because an American boxing official remembers him when [[Coca-Cola]] is looking for an appropriate representative in Germany. With Anny Ondra's approval, he accepts the offered position. When Schmeling visits USA on a business trip, he visits the divorced and impoverished Joe Louis. They remain friends for the rest of their lives.

Justice (2002 film)
 ''Justice'' is set in a Japanese high school, where Mr. Robert's class is doing a running translation of the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. The action in the classroom is centered on: *Mr. Robert's lifeless, monotonous recitation of the document. *Itadaki's hurried efforts to write it all down in grammatically correct Japanese prose. *An unnamed student's creation of pornographic [[flipbook]] animation in the corner of one of his textbooks. *The initially drowsy Tojo.  Tojo, who is not paying attention, wakes up when he realizes a girls' gym class is running the hurdles outside. He clears the books and blank notes off his desk and begins to watch. Using the five-stroke Chinese character "æ­£", Tojo keeps a running tally of when the girls readjust their ''buruma'' (literally "[[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]]," roughly the same as the spankies [[cheerleaders]] and female [[volleyball]] players wear). Each readjustment is recorded with a color (red, blue, or green) and emphasized for the audience by the sound of snapping spandex.  The stunning Hoshi notices Tojo staring at her and she self-consciously puts her all into her time. When she trips over a hurdle and hits the asphalt, Tojo can't hide his alarm. Immediately, Mr. Robert turns on him and lectures about focusing on Potsdam rather than ''buruma''.  He uses racist language &mdash; "What do you Japs mean by this character?" &mdash; when he asks Tojo about the "æ­£æ­£æ­£" written on the desk; Tojo's reply is "justice" ("justice" being æ­£ç¾© in Japanese). After Mr. Robert looks out the window, who is astonished by the girls' beauty at the first sight, he throws Tojo out of class and tells him in English and Japanese to "get out in the hall".  The girls' gym class comes back into the building and Hoshi flirtatiously confronts Tojo, who sprouts a nosebleed when he sees her adjust her bloomers.  He denies all wrongdoing but grins at the camera and displays a "V" for "victory" once Hoshi's back is turned.  
Ju-on: The Grudge
   Several years prior to the main plot, [[Takeo Saeki]] murders his wife [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]] after discovering she is in love with another man, also killing the family cat Mar and possibly his son [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]]. The murders create a curse that revives the family as [[onryÅ]], with Kayakoâs ghost murdering Takeo. Whoever enters the house in [[Nerima]], [[Tokyo]], is eventually consumed by the curse, which spreads to the place they die in and in turn consumes anyone who goes there.  The latest owners of the house are the Tokunaga family, consisting of [[salaryman]] Katsuya, his wife Kazumi, and his ill mother Sachie. Kazumi is quickly consumed by the curse, and Katsuya is emotionally affected by Takeoâs personality before dying too. Katsuyaâs sister Hitomi dies shortly after Kayakoâs spirit follows her to her office and then her apartment. [[Social worker]] Rika is sent by her boss Hirohashi to care for Sachie. She discovers Toshio, and witnesses Sachie being killed by Kayakoâs ghost, causing her to faint.  Hirohashi finds Rika and contacts the police. Detectives Nakagawa and Igarashi discover Katsuya and Kazumiâs bodies in the attic, and later learn of Hitomiâs disappearance and the death of a security guard at her workplace. Hirohashiâs body is discovered, and Rika is haunted by the ghosts. Upon researching the history of the house and the Saeki murders, Nakagawa and Igarashi contact a retired detective named Toyama, who is afraid of revisiting the case. Toyama goes to burn the house down but hears a group of teenage girls upstairs. One flees while the others are consumed. Kayako appears, chasing Toyama away but killing Nakagawa and Igarashi.  Some time after visiting the house, Rika has moved on with her life. Her friend Mariko, an elementary school teacher, pays a visit to Toshio, who is registered as her student but has never shown up for class. Rika races to save her but is too late. Kayakoâs ghost comes after her, and Rika witnesses Kayako briefly take on her appearance. She realizes that she is doomed to play out the curse and the same fate as Kayako. With Toshio watching from the banisters, Takeoâs ghost descends the stages and kills her.  In the deserted [[Tokyo]] streets, many [[missing person]]s posters lie on the ground. Rikaâs corpse lies in the houseâs attic, only to reawaken with a [[death rattle]]. Elsewhere, Toyama dies at some point and leaves his daughter Izumi behind. As a teenager, Izumi went to the house with her friends but fled while her friends were killed by Kayako; this was the event Toyama witnessed in the past.  Izumi is wrought with guilt for abandoning her friends and becomes increasingly paranoid and unstable. Two of her other friends visit her and discover Izumi and her dead friends have their eyes blackened out in photos. Izumi encounters a vision of her dead father, then discovers the ghosts of her friends watching her. She is cornered by her dead friends, only for Kayako to appear and drag her into damnation.  
Juwanna Mann
  Jamal Jeffries ([[Miguel A. NÃºÃ±ez, Jr.]]) is a UBA (fictional version of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]) basketball star whose undisciplined on-and-off-court antics have earned him a bad reputation in the basketball community. Jamal is dropped from his team, the [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Beat]] and suspended indefinitely after he strips naked in protest of being taken out of a game. His agent, Lorne Daniels ([[Kevin Pollak]]), is unsuccessful at finding him a new team, and cuts Jamal as a client. As a result, Jamal's life goes downhill: his endorsements drop him, he ends up bankrupt due to lavish spending, his belongings are repossessed, his mansion is foreclosed on, and his girlfriend Tina ([[Lil' Kim]]), who only put up with his antics for his money and fame, walks out on him.  Jamal, now out of work and homeless, goes to live with his no-nonsense Aunt Ruby ([[Jenifer Lewis]]), the only person that doesn't put up with Jamal's outrageous antics. Lacking any other sort of skills, he decides to [[cross-dressing|dress up as a woman]] named "Juwanna Mann" to play for the [[Charlotte Sting|Charlotte Banshees]] of the WUBA (fictional version of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]). Aunt Ruby reluctantly agrees to help him with his charade as does Lorne who has no choice after Jamal reveals himself to be Juwanna.  In a scene involving the team [[Physical Examination|physical]], Jamal has to disguise himself as the team [[mascot]] in order to avoid being found out by the team [[physician]].  Jamal quickly becomes a star on the court, and his overall attitude changes drastically as well. He learns to play with a team rather than just himself. While becoming successful with the Banshees, Jamal also finds himself in a problematic relationship with his teammate Michelle ([[Vivica A. Fox]]), whom he has romantic feelings for but cannot act on because Michelle knows him only as her confidante, Juwanna. His situation is further complicated as Michelle is involved in a romantic relationship with [[Rapper]] Romeo ([[Ginuwine]]) (who ends up cheating on her) while Jamal (as Juwanna) is busy warding off the amorous advances of Romeo's sidekick Puff Smokey Smoke ([[Tommy Davidson]]).  Eventually, Jamal is given a chance to return to the men's league, but the hearing takes place at the same time as the Banshee's first playoff game. After much debate, Jamal decides to do the selfless thing and stick with the Banshees and help them win. Jamal's cover is blown at the end of the game when Jamal decides to dunk the winning basket and [[backboard shattering|shatters the backboard]]. In all the excitement, Jamal loses his wig, revealing that he is in fact Jamal Jeffries. Jamal is fired from the team, and the Banshees, devastated at the betrayal, begin to suffer on the court as a result.  Jamal, seeing this, decides to try to make things right again, and enters the Banshees' locker room during another game's halftime to apologize for the lies and tell them that playing with them had changed his views and attitude about basketball, women, and life in general. His ex-teammates (especially Michelle) are initially still furious at him, but end up accepting Jamal's genuine apology, which also inspires the team to win the playoffs and eventually the championship. Afterwards, Jamal is called in for a hearing with the UBA's commission board. Despite the genuine apology and assurance by himself and Lorne that he has changed for the better, the board is still unimpressed due to the Juwanna scandal, and it first appears that Jamal's playing career is truly done for. However, his former WUBA teammates show up and successfully vouch for him to be brought back into the league, and Michelle gives him a championship ring and a kiss.  Jamal Jeffries is reinstated into the UBA and returns to action with his old team, a better player and person.

Joshua takes up residence in a barn that he rents from Joan Casey to use as his home and woodcarving shop. To the surprise of a local priest, the roof does not leak after Joshua moves in, despite the many holes in it.  The more time Joshua spends in town, the more attention he draws to himself simply by doing what he does. He begins by rebuilding the [[Baptist]] Church which was destroyed during a storm the year before. He gets the attention of many locals by carrying a huge log of [ash] through town and out to his barn, some estimates range that it weighs at least 300 pounds.  Later, Father Tordone ([[F. Murray Abraham]]) of the local [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church hires him to carve a statue of the [[Apostle Peter]], to which Joshua responds that it should be made of ash and that he "knows Peter".  Joshua spends his next few weeks helping out anyone he meets, who in return help him rebuild the Baptist Church. He intervenes in a Tent Revival, where a con artist is tricking people into believing that he is healing people through the power of God. Joshua tells him, "You don't have to do it this way", and proceeds to restore sight to a blind woman sitting in the audience.  Father Tordone becomes very suspicious of Joshua's behavior and motives, and tries to convince the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to step in and stop him before he gains more followers and creates his own cult. It isn't until Joshua resurrects a man (Theo) from the dead that the Catholic Church takes interest in him and invites him to [[Rome]].

K-19: The Widowmaker
  In 1961, the [[Soviet Union]] launches its first ballistic missile [[nuclear submarine]], the [[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']], commanded by Captain Alexei Vostrikov ([[Harrison Ford]]), aided by [[executive officer]] Mikhail Polenin ([[Liam Neeson]]). Polenin was the crew's original captain, and they have served together for some time; Vostrikov's appointment is alleged to have been aided by his wife's political connections, as well as Polenin's tendency to put the crew's morale and safety before the pride of the Soviet Union. During his first inspection, Vostrikov discovers the reactor officer to be drunk and asleep on duty and sacks him, ordering Polenin to request a replacement.  The replacement reactor officer, Vadim Radtchenko ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), is fresh from the naval academy's nuclear program. Before the launch, the medical officer is killed when struck by an oncoming truck, and is replaced by command's foremost medical officer, who hails from the army and has never been out to sea. During the official launch of the ''K-19'', the bottle of champagne fails to break when it strikes the bow, considered to be a sign of ill fortune (according to some naval traditions, a young woman is supposed to break a bottle of alcoholic/celebratory beverage against a ship's hull at its christening/maiden launch; if the bottle did not break, it was taken to be an ill omen).  With Captain Vostrikov's constant drilling, the crew's performance improves. The first mission of the ''K-19'' is to surface in the Arctic to fire an unarmed [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] as a test, then to patrol a zone in the Atlantic within striking range of [[New York City]] and [[Washington D.C.]] as a Soviet deterrent to American ambitions. To test the submarine's limits, Vostrikov orders the ''K-19'' to submerge past its maximum operational depth of 250 meters to a depth closer to its "crush depth" (300 meters), then surface rapidly at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice, estimated at no more than one meter thick. Polenin regards this maneuver as dangerous and storms off the bridge. Scraping along the underside of the ice, the ''K-19'' breaks through with little difficulty. The test missile is launched successfully.  En route to the patrolling area, a pipe for the [[Nuclear reactor technology#Cooling|reactor cooling system]] springs a leak and then bursts completely. Control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but without coolant the reactor temperature continues to rise rapidly. During an officers' review of emergency protocols, it is revealed that back-up coolant systems were not installed; without these, the protocols are useless (they are based on the assumption that back-up systems are in place). The ''K-19'' surfaces to contact fleet command about the accident and await orders. The cable for the long-range transmitter antenna on the [[conning tower]], however, is damaged, possibly due to the earlier surfacing maneuver in the Arctic.  An engineering team conceives a plan to rig a makeshift coolant system; because Polenin has discovered that the submarine was supplied with chemical, not nuclear, suits, teams are instructed to work in 10-minute shifts to limit radiation exposure. The first group emerges vomiting and heavily blistered; the second and third teams succeed in cooling the reactor, but all are severely ill with radiation poisoning. As radiation levels slowly rise inside the ship, the submarine surfaces and most of the crewmen are ordered topside. Radtchenko, the reactor officer, is initially assigned to go as part of the third team to finish the operation, but his fear upon witnessing the first team's radiation injuries overtakes him, and the [[Glavny starshina|crew chief]] joins the third team in his place.  A United States Navy helicopter from a nearby [[destroyer]] approaches the ''K-19''; the destroyer and asks if the ''K-19'' requires assistance. Vostrikov tells the destroyer "no" and refuses to allow the Americans anywhere near ''K-19''. Back in the [[Soviet Union]], the government worries about the condition of the ''K-19'' because it has ceased contact with fleet command (due to its disabled long-range communicator) but has been spotted by Soviet spy aircraft in the vicinity of the American destroyer.  With the hope that fleet command will send some diesel submarines to tow the ''K-19'' back to port, Vostrikov ceases the mission and orders a heading that would return to port, but at a pace that could kill the entire crew with radiation sickness if rescue is not forthcoming. Shortly thereafter, the repair crews' pipework springs leaks and the reactor temperature begins to rise once again. This incites unrest among some of the crew, and in an accident, fuel that had been previously removed from a torpedo ignites, causing a fire in that compartment. Initially ordering the emergency fire suppression system to be activated (which would deprive the fire of oxygen, but suffocate anyone inside that area), Vostrikov is talked down by Polenin, who personally goes to assist the fire crew in putting out the fire. This leaves Vostrikov facing some hostile crew and officers who no longer have Polenin present to moderate them, and two officers enact a pre-planned mutiny to remove Vostrikov from command. Radtchenko, who earlier panicked and backed out from joining the repair crews, this time enters the reactor area alone and commences a second repair attempt.  Polenin returns to the command deck after helping put out the torpedo room fire; upon seeing Vostrikov handcuffed to a ladder, he deceives the mutineers into handing over their weapons, places them under arrest, and then frees Vostrikov. Believing the repairs to have failed and unaware that Radtchenko had gone in alone to patch up the new leaks, Vostrikov, at the behest of Polenin, tells the crew what has happened, and his rationale for a subsequent dive to attempt another repair; he is afraid that if the reactor were to overheat, it could set off the actual nuclear warheads carried by the ''K-19'' and the accident would destroy not just the ''K-19'' but also the nearby American ship, provoking an American retaliatory attack and possibly inciting nuclear war. Vostrikov then waits for the crew to respond to his recommendation; the crew subsequently responds in the affirmative, and the ''K-19'' dives. Vostrikov then goes back to the reactor section after hailing Radtchenko and receiving no reply. Radtchenko's repairs were successful, but he received a heavier dose of radiation than earlier teams, having stayed in 18 minutes to complete his repair. Unable to see and too weak to properly extricate himself from the reactor chamber, Radtchenko is dragged out personally by Captain Vostrikov. The repairs prevent a reactor meltdown, but radiation is leaking throughout the submarine due to irradiated steam leakage from the reactor's damage.  A Soviet diesel submarine finally reaches the ''K-19''; it relays orders from fleet command to confine the crew on the submarine until a freighter can pick them up. Knowing it would be too dangerous to stay, Vostrikov orders the crew to be evacuated to the diesel submarine, despite knowing he will most likely lose his command and be sent to a [[gulag]] for countermanding a direct order. The crew is evacuated and returns to the Soviet Union, without having to receive assistance from the nearby Americans. After the incident, Captain Vostrikov is tried for endangering the mission and disobeying a direct order, but Polenin and the other officers and crew of the ''K-19'' come to his defense.  
Kaante
 In [[Los Angeles]], six criminals, all of [[Indian Americans|Indian origin]], are detained by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|Police]], and interrogated about stealing a truck full of laptops and its whereabouts. Their deep antipathy towards the police for arresting them without any evidence, just because the witnesses had seen an Indian at the crime scene, grows into a daring plot. Sparked off by "Ajju" ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) and seconded by "Major" ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), they all hatch a plan to rob the bank in which lie the fundings for the Los Angeles Police Department. In return, Ajju reveals that he stole the truck and splits the steal with everyone else.

Kadhal Azhivathillai
  Chimbu(simbhu) is elected college chairman after he beats Charmi(charmi), the daughter of Ravishankar(Radharavi), a minister. Predictably, the two soon fall for each other though they never directly reveal it. But when Ravishankar comes to know of the love affair, he is staunchly against it, and is willing to go any distance to make sure that it never succeeds. At home, Simbu's father(Prakashraj) mentally tortures his wife(Seetha) since he suspects her of having an affair with her ex-lover. Outside home, Simbhu is helped by Vakkeel Dada (T.Rajendar), a lawyer who makes sure justice is served, whatever the means.  The movie deals with the oldest of stories â the poor boy-rich girl love story â and makes no attempts to treat it in a different way or in an interesting manner. It follows the typical sequence of events in such stories. We have the initial enmity between Simbhu and Charmi, the gradual thawing of the icy relationship between the two, the idiot suitor who Charmi's parents want her to marry, her family's horror on finding out about her romance, their attempts to kill it and of course, the lovers' strong refusal to give up their love against all the opposition. There is no deviation from this at any point and as a result, we can predict with great accuracy, what would happen next in the story. In the end Charmi is married to simbhu.

Their new life is difficult, but a visit with their estranged grandparents (Fernanda Mistral and [[HÃ©ctor Alterio]]) reveals that they are still a close-knit family.

Kedma (film)
 The film is a historical tragedy set during the opening stages of Israel's 1948 War of Independence. The film follows the fate of a group of refugees from the [[Holocaust]] who are illegally brought to Israel by the [[Palmach]]. When they arrive, they are chased by British soldiers. Once they escape, they are immediately drafted into the war, and take part in a grueling battle against Arab irregulars. The film centers on two long monologues, one by an Arab peasant who pledges to oppose the Jews forever; and one by an emotionally demolished refugee who laments the seemingly endless suffering of his people. Gitai intended the film to be a more realistic answer to the romanticized depiction of the war in Otto Preminger's ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]''. The final shot of ''Kedma'' is identical to the final shot of Preminger's film.  
Kannathil Muthamittal
 The film begins in a small village in [[Sri Lanka]] called [[Mankulam (Sri Lanka)|Mankulam]], where M. D. Shyama ([[Nandita Das]]) is married to Dileepan ([[J. D. Chakravarthy]]), who along with few other Sri Lankan Tamils in the village, is part of the [[Tamil Tigers]] rebel association. While having a quiet moment, the couple hears sounds of Sri Lankan army troops approaching. He asks Shyama to leave while he remains in the forest. Shyama realizes that she is pregnant and waits in vain for Dileepanâs return. Her villagers begin fleeing to India to seek refugee due to the war. Shyama is initially stubborn to leave her husband behind, but her relatives convince her to seek refuge for her unborn child's sake. The villagers board a boat to the shores of [[Rameswaram]]. On the journey, one of the rebels says that he has seen her husband, Dileepan, with bullet wounds in the forest. Shyama wants the boat to turn around but it is too late. In Rameswaram,  while a local collector takes down the names of the refugees, Shyama gives birth to a baby girl. However, the urge to find her possibly wounded husband and be with her people back home overwhelms Shyama and she leaves behind the newborn girl, hoping that the girl will lead a better life.  Nine years later in [[Chennai]], a young girl, Amudha ([[P. S. Keerthana]]) narrates her family life. She introduces her father, writer Thiruchelvan ([[R. Madhavan]]), who uses the pen name 'Indira' for his books. Indira ([[Simran Bagga]]) is Amudha's mother, while she has a younger brother named Vinayan and another younger brother called Akhilan. Amudha's ninth birthday approaches and both of her parents take her to the temple. Indira later reminds Thiruchelvan of their promise to reveal 'the truth' to Amudha on her ninth birthday. After their prayers, Thiruchelvan brings Amudha to [[Marina Beach]] and reveals the truth that she was adopted from a refugee camp in Rameswaram and is not their biological daughter. Amudha is heavily disturbed after hearing the news and begins distancing herself from the family. Indira's father criticizes them for revealing the truth to her, but Thiruchelvan and Indira are certain they have taken the right decision. Amudha asks her adopted parents about her adoption.  The film then flashes to nine years ago in Rameswaram, where Thiruchelvan, then a budding writer, constantly travels to the refugee camp and writes stories inspired by the people there. At one such instance, Thiruchelvan sees a newborn baby girl and writes a short story about her. Indira is his neighbour, and has always expressed an interest in him. Thiruchelvan, after a while, finds the urge to adopt the girl, but realizes that he will not be allowed to do so until he is married. He then proposes to Indira in order to be able to adopt the baby. Indira suggests the name 'Amudha' after seeing the baby once, and then adopt the baby after they marry each other. Vinayan was born few years after their marriage, followed by Akhilan, and thus, the family happened.  Even after hearing this, Amudha is dissatisfied. She requests to meet her mother despite Indira's insistence that they can't possibly find her even if they wanted to. Thiruchelvan gives in and promises to take Amudha to [[Sri Lanka]] to find her mother. Leaving the two boys under the care of Indira's father, the trio travel to Sri Lanka and are greeted by Dr. Herold Vikramasinghe ([[Prakash Raj]]), who also helps them to find Amudha's mother. Amudha and Indira's relationship strains as Amudha becomes increasingly rude at her mother while urging to find her real mother. While taking a walk in the jungle, Thiruchelvan and Vikramasinghe are captured by a group of LTTE rebels. Thiruchelvan immediately recites [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[poetry]] and is identified as Indira by the group's leader ([[Pasupathy]]). Thiruchelvan explains his motives of coming to the country, mentioning the only evidence that he has regarding Amudha's mother is that her name is Shyama. The group leader arranges a meet and says he will bring Shyama to the spot. It is later revealed that Shyama is the group leader's sister who is also a part of the LTTE rebels living in seclusion.  The next day, Vikramasinghe, Amudha, Indira, and Thiruchelvan wait at the spot, but a sudden series of bombings break out at the place as the Sri Lankan army tries to infiltrate the hideout of the rebels. Indira gets shot in her arm in the process. The family finally leaves the place, and Amudha, apologizes to Indira and asks all of them to return to India. The next day, the family leaves for the airport but unexpectedly, Indira requests that they drive through the meeting spot one more time. As they wait, Shyama arrives. Amudha gives Shyama a photo album and asks Shyama a series of questions, some which Shyama is unable to answer. As the emotional meeting comes to an end, Amudha begs Shyama to come back with her to Madras but Shyama tearfully refuses saying that she has work to do in Sri Lanka and that someday there will be peace in the country and when that day comes Amudha should come back to her then.  The film ends with Thiruchelvan, Amudha, and Indira hugging each other as Shyama leaves, and a teary-eyed Amudha kisses her parents, re-affirming her love for them.

He arrives at a skate park, where he casually sits in the middle of it, sets up a [[camcorder]], smiles, and shoots himself in the temple with a handgun. His death is used to bookend the film, which follows the lives of four teens who knew him in the weeks running up to his suicide.  Shawn (James Bullard) is the most stable of the four main characters. He's polite and caring. Throughout the story, he has an ongoing sexual relationship with his girlfriend's mother, Rhonda . He casually socializes with her family, who are all completely unaware of the affair, including her husband and his girlfriend Hannah.   Claude fends off physical and emotional abuse from his alcoholic father while trying to take care of his neglectful pregnant mother, who never does anything to defend him. Claude's father detests him for being insufficiently manly. However, after coming home drunk one night, he attempts to perform oral sex on Claude, prompting the boy to run away from home.  Peaches is a girl living alone with her obsessive and overly-religious father , who fixates on her as the embodiment of her deceased mother.

He finds that the act arouses him sexually. He records himself on his tape recorder so the police will know how and why he killed his grandparents. After finishing recording, he puts his grandfather's dentures in his mouth, lies naked in his bed, and falls asleep.  The film cuts frequently between subplots, with no overlap of characters or events until the end. As Tate is arrested for his grandparents' murder, Shawn, Claude, and Peaches meet and have sex as a [[threesome]], while [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] plays. The ending finally reveals the motive behind Ken Park's suicide: he has impregnated his girlfriend who responds to his question asking if she wanted to keep it by asking if he wishes he'd been aborted himself. Realizing that he'd rather never have been born, he sets out to the skate park to kill himself.

After a chance encounter with a mysterious stranger (Joseph Fiennes), she seeks him out, taking a taxi with him to his house and having passionate sex. She returns home to her boyfriend and unsuccessfully attempts to bring out the same feelings between them that she had with the strange man.  The following day she seeks the stranger out again, discovering his name is Adam - a mountain climber who is considered a hero after saving six people in a tragic event that killed several others, including the woman he loved. Alice leaves her boyfriend and begins a relationship with Adam, although her friend shows reservations about Alice being in such a sudden relationship. When Alice is mugged on the street, Adam beats the thief terribly, and then asks Alice to marry him, a proposal she happily accepts. For their honeymoon, he takes her to a secluded cabin.   The newlyweds settle into their new life, but Alice is troubled by a series of mysterious letters and phone calls, and begins to wonder about her husband's mysterious past. A reporter who did a story on Adam sends her a copy of a letter from a woman claiming Adam raped her. Alice interviews her, posing as a journalist. Disturbed by the fact that she barely knows her new husband, she begins to go through their apartment, becoming even more alarmed when she searches a locked wardrobe and finds a box of old letters from an ex-lover, Adele, who insists she and Adam end their affair. Adam begins to question Alice more about her activities, including where she got a necklace that she received from his sister, Deborah ([[Natascha McElhone]]).  Soon after, Alice receives yet another warning. Following the trail, she discovers that Adele has been missing for eight months. She also finds a picture of Adele at the same cabin where she and Adam honeymooned. She realizes she doesn't feel safe with him and runs to the police. She tells her story, insisting they reopen Adele's missing persons case, but they can't do anything without any evidence, telling her they can only keep him for a few hours. Alice seeks help from Deborah, telling her she believes Adam killed Adele for leaving him and buried her at the cabin. On the way to the cabin, Deborah admits that she was the one who sent the messages to Alice, because she wanted to save her from Adam's violent rages. When Adam returns home from the police station, he finds that Alice was there and left the two pictures, and realizes she must have gone to the cabin.   At the cabin, Alice discovers a body buried in the dirt, wearing the same necklace that Deborah gave her. Deborah tells her that Adele didn't have to die, if she'd only gone back to her husband. It is apparent that Deborah has incestuous feelings for Adam, resulting in her subsequent possessiveness and need to rid his life of any other woman. She tries to kill Alice, but Adam appears in time and saves her. Furious, Deborah tries to kill him, stopped short by Alice, who shoots her with a flare pistol.   Adam tells Alice that he and his sister used to come to the cabin together, but that he thought that if Alice just trusted him, then everything would be alright. Adam is led away by police that morning.   Two years later, Alice and Adam see one another again on either side of an escalator - she's going down and he's riding up. They both watch each other as they pass without saying anything. Adam stops at the top and turns to stare back at Alice before walking away. The film ends with Alice's voiceover recalling the events in posterity and wondering what might have happened had fate not led her to Adam one morning. She wonders if the passion between them could ever have lasted, and if a "flatlander" like her could ever have stayed at such a high altitude . At least  that's  what  she tells  herself  anyway.

Krassman decides to dissect Goggles, but Blotch takes his place to return the favor for rescuing them from Vicki. Krassman discides to dissect Croaker instead, when Wilson brings him into the class. Mary refuses to show the class how the dissection is done, so she leaves the classroom. In a daring rescue, Kermit manages to free Croaker from the dissection table and fend off Dr. Krassman using some swashbuckling techniques he picked up earlier at a movie theater, but Krassman is able to defeat Kermit, Croaker, and Blotch. Goggles finds the knife that Kermit dropped, but after he picks it up, Krassman spots him. Despite the warnings that Kermit should never talk to humans, Kermit stops Krassman from killing Goggles by talking and asks him to please release the frogs. This decision by Kermit reveals that Krassman, as a child, when he was going to dissect his first frog, the frog spoke to him, but he refused to say it out loud to everyone else in Krassman's classroom, which caused him to be humiliated. With the truth revealed that frogs can talk, Krassman frees all the frogs and dismisses the class and enables Kermit and his friends to return home.<ref></ref> When they hitch a ride back on Wilson's truck, Wilson adopts Pilgrim and the four friends head home.

A week later, Nic, his partner-in-crime Ray-Ray ([[Choice Skinner]]) and three other delinquents: Eddie ([[Jermaine Cheeseborough]]), Ce-Ce ([[Nicole Pulliam]]) and the shy Charlotte Davis ([[Olimpia Fernandez]]) are taken by two detention officers, Denise Martinez and Harris Redding ([[Debbie Rochon]] and [[Logan Alexander]]) to [[Loxahatchee Canon]], where there is a detention center for the delinquents to stay in order for them to pay for their crimes. On the way down, their engine blows in the middle of nowhere, with no cell phone reception, no gas stations nearby and no hope.  The men then head out to get a signal on Redding's cellphone, where they find a house nearby. Ray-Ray breaks into the house to find a working phone when suddenly, a gunshot is heard and Ray-Ray falls down on the ground with a shotgun bullet in his chest. The men are then greeted by a redneck local named Lilly ([[Tammi Sutton]]), who threatens to shoot them next if they don't leave. When the group refuses, she points the gun at Eddie and just before she pulls the trigger, Redding shoots her in the head with his gun, who proclaims: "Don't fuck with my kids". Redding tells them to get Ray-Ray back to the van while he searches for a phone. On the way back, they hear another gunshot, warning them that there are more rednecks out there. Believing that Redding is dead, the men quickly head back.  They get back to the van and find out that they don't have a medical kit with them. Warning them about the rednecks, the group head out to find a phone booth. About an hour later, they find another house belonging to a voodoo priestess named Kadja Boszo ([[Rhonda Claerbaut]]), who tells them that she can try to help Ray-Ray with her magic, but proclaims that if Ray-Ray chooses to stay alive, he'll be alive. If he doesn't, he would be dead. Meanwhile, Ce-Ce tells the group a story that her grandmother told her about, an evil spirit named Killjoy, therefore proving that the events of the previous film occurred. Nic, intrigued and believing that Killjoy can help Ray-Ray, bribes Ce-Ce with cocaine if she can bring Killjoy to life.  After seemingly to have failed, Nic yells at Ce-Ce and she goes to cry about it in an outhouse. Suddenly a pair of teeth chatters its way through the outhouse and off-screen, starts killing her. The teeth chatters its way out and a gloved hand picks it up and puts the teeth back in his mouth, revealing him to be...Killjoy! ([[Trent Haaga]]). Killjoy heads back to the house where he bumps into Eddie, who is pumping water out of a water pump. Killjoy, by using his telekinetic powers, lifts Eddie up off the ground and impales him onto the pump. Back inside the house, Nic arrives and gets told that Ray-Ray choose not to stay and now he's dead, and Ce-Ce and Eddie are missing. Nic heads out to go find them and takes Ms. Martinez's gun for protection.  Outside, he runs into Killjoy. Realizing he killed Eddie and Ce-Ce, he shoots him a few times but nothing happens. Killjoy, with his powers, magically makes Nic kill himself with his pocket knife. Ms. Martinez, Charlotte and Kadja, now the only people left alive, now discuss how to kill Killjoy. Kadja tells them that there is a spell to put him away for good, but before that can be accomplished, Killjoy uses his powers to slash Kadja's throat as she makes her way outside to confront him. Killjoy enters the house, knocks out Ms. Martinez and just as he's about to kill Charlotte, Redding comes back, and just as he and Killjoy are about to fight, Charlotte splashed [[Holy Water]] on Killjoy's face, melting his head and killing him. The next day, Charlotte, Ms. Martinez and Redding are taken out of the wilderness by a ranger ([[Devin Hamilton]]).

Raja continues speaking like his father to confirm the symptoms related to the disease. But he does not reveal this and tries to behave normally. Raja understands that his father has requested Cheenu to lie to Raja, so that Raja, in the process of making his father happy, will eventually be happy himself.

Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
 A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged [[sifu]], and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has romantic feelings for him.  While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people kick him in the groin, but is knocked out after being hit. When he wakes up, a mysterious woman named Whoa warns him not to rush to fight Betty. After flirtily fighting The Chosen One, Whoa flies off into the sky.  Ignoring the advice, The Chosen One sets off to find Betty. He comes across one of Betty's evil companions: Moo Nieu (pronounced [[Mooning|"moon you"]]), a [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cow]] gifted in karate, with a large udder that can squirt milk as a weapon. They fight in a scene parodying ''[[The Matrix]]'', and The Chosen One eventually incapacitates Moo Nieu by milking her until her udder is empty. He sees Betty at a waterfall and confronts him. Master Doe, Ling's Father, shows up and tries to stop the unprepared Chosen One, and is wounded by Betty. The Chosen One takes Master Doe to Master Tang; it turns out they are old friends. However, as Tang massages Doe's wound, it doesn't close and Doe dies that night. Out of depression, Ling confesses her feelings for The Chosen One.  Confused, The Chosen One journeys out to a field and consults the heavens for confidence. Suddenly Mu-Shu Fasa, a large sentient [[lion]], appears in the sky and dispenses advice in a scene parodying a portion of ''[[The Lion King]]''. He returns to town and finds that Betty's hostility has expanded to the entire town, and they are killing anyone who may be his allies. He finds Wimp Lo, Ling, Master Tang and even his Dog heavily maimed. However, except for Lo, they all survive. After taking Ling and his dog to safety, The Chosen One begins training himself. Believing Betty's weak points are the pyramid spikes embedded in his chest, The Chosen One makes wooden dummies, embeds similar spikes onto their chests and attempts to pluck them out with his bare hands. His hands are battered and he is exhausted, but after Ling treats his wounds and gives an inspiring speech, he finds himself rejuvenated and successfully pulls off the attack.  Meanwhile, Betty is called by the mysterious Evil Council and learns that The Chosen One is alive. The Chosen One confronts Betty at the temple. They fight evenly, until the Evil Council shows up revealing themselves to be [[France|French]] aliens, and gives Betty supernatural powers. Betty viciously beats up The Chosen One, who, in a semi-unconscious state, sees visions of Whoa and Mu-Shu Fasa giving him advice. Mu-Shu instructs him to open his mouth. As soon as he does, Tonguey flies out and attacks and destroys the mother ship, causing the entire Evil Council armada to panic and retreat, leaving Betty vulnerable. The Chosen One eventually rips the pyramid spikes out of Betty's chest, killing him. As The Chosen One returns home with Ling, his tribulations are far from over, as presented in a trailer for a sequel, ''Kung Pow 2: Tongue of Fury'', that immediately follows the final scene.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Master Tang, who has been left behind, asks someone to help him from a hungry [[golden eagle]] pecking his leg.

Sam is a recently graduated [[psychiatrist]], starting his [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], while Alex, who comes from a very wealthy background, and is also an MD,  is finishing her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] [[dissertation]] on [[genomics]]. The relatively straight-laced, upwardly mobile couple plan to stay at the vacant home of Sam's mother, Jane ([[Frances McDormand]]), a free-spirited record producer in the [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]] section of the City of [[Los Angeles]].  In a change of plans, however, Jane is still around, recording an album with her [[United Kingdom|British]] boyfriend, Ian McKnight ([[Alessandro Nivola]]), and his band. The film focuses in some depth on the challenge of trying to create successful pop music, showing work on two tracks (both actually written, and previously released, by the band [[Sparklehorse]]). Ian's bandmates are played by two noted indie rockers, bassist [[Lou Barlow]] and guitarist [[Imaad Wasif]].  Jane and Ian are in the midst of a fiery [[romantic love|romance]], and both the producer and the band seem more interested in partying than finishing the record. Jane's presence is a source of consternation for Sam, as he and his mother have a somewhat strained relationship, due to their very different mindsets.  Alex, however, is intrigued by the new lifestyle options presented by her soon-to-be mother-in-law. Normally hardworking, Alex begins spending more time with the band and less time working on her dissertation. Her growing fascination with Jane and Ian leads to a scene where the three of them kiss one another while naked in the swimming pool.  Meanwhile, Sam finds himself attracted to [[Israel]]i fellow resident Sara ([[Natascha McElhone]]), who is unapologetically interested in him as well. They share one first kiss while returning from an informal interns' meeting, around the same time Alex has her first tryst with Jane and Ian in the pool. Some time later, while Alex attends Jane and Ian's party held in a crowded hotel suite to celebrate the band's new album release, Sam and Sara meet in a parking lot and, in a conversation filled with sexual tension, they declare their attraction for one another.  The situation strains Sam and Alex's relationship almost to the point of breaking by the end of the film. After the party has finished and the three of them are left alone in the suite, Ian tries to "finish" (in his words) his encounter with Alex and Jane, but the latter decides against it and the [[threesome]] does not take place. Upon returning home after his conversation with Sara, Sam decides to go to the hotel and discovers Jane, Ian, and Alex scantily-clad in the bedroom. In a fit of rage he repeatedly punches Ian, hits his mother with his elbow as she tries to split up the fight, and leaves the hotel, but Alex chases him down the street and professes her love for him.  The next morning, the situation seems back to normal again. But Sara phones Sam and tells him she can't control her heart, as opposed to what he told her the day before. Sam watches his surroundings, postpones any further conversation, and takes a moment of reflection. Credits run.  
The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water
 After a period of harsh rain, the Great Valley is partially flooded, and covered in debris. Littlefoot tries to play with his friends, but they are preoccupied: Cera and her father are removing a large log from their nesting area, Ducky and Spike are relocating their nest with their family, and Petrie has gotten a cold. A bored Littlefoot wishes for a brother, but eventually explores on his own, and discovers a large area flooded by the rains. The adults advise their children to stay away, fearing dangerous creatures from the outside may have been washed into the Valley. However, Littlefoot returns, and meets Mo, a playful young ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]'' that had been caught in the floodwater.  Littlefoot quickly strikes a friendship with Mo, and describes him as his ''mud brother''. His other friends also eventually befriend him. Mo explains that he is from the ''[[ocean|Big Water]]'', and he swam into the Valley during the flooding. He confirms that he is alone, but soon after, a ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' attacks the group. Littlefoot requests help from the adults to help Mo return home, but they refuse, not wanting to risk leaving the Valley to aid an outsider. A subsequent [[earthquake|earthshake]] separates the children and Mo from the rest of the Valley, but it also imprisons the Sharptooth in an underwater cavern. Unable to return, they decide to take Mo home on their own.  The children follow a river that they believe leads to the ocean. A ''[[Diplodocus]]'' mother allows them to take refuge at her nest for the night, and the friends are present to witness the hatching of her offspring. The next day, Littlefoot and the others realize that they are near the ocean, as they have begun to taste salt in the water. However, the Sharptooth, who has escaped from the cave, attacks them that night. The land, which surrounds the river, is steep, and slick with mud, and the children are unable to escape. Mo distracts the Sharptooth, and lures it further down the river. Reappearing the next day, Mo explains that the Sharptooth had smelled the ocean in the distance, and abandoned the chase, choosing to return to the sea.  The children reach the ocean, but Mo is saddened to learn that his friends must depart. He wishes to remain with them, but the others explain that he cannot, and Littlefoot reminds Mo that the two will always be brothers. Mo reunites with his family and asks them for directions to the ''[[Volcano|smoky mountains]]'', as the children know how to find the Valley from that location. Before leaving, Mo offers to show Littlefoot his home. Littlefoot accepts the offer, and is amazed by the underwater world's beauty. Littlefoot and his friends say goodbye to Mo and return home, where they are greeted by the adults.  
The Legend of Bhagat Singh
 [[Bhagat Singh]] was born in [[British Raj|British India]] in 1907. From childhood, he witnesses numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by the British, who came to trade under the guise of the [[East India Company]] and ended up controlling most of the nation. Bhagat takes a solemn vow to free India from British rule after witnessing the aftermath of the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]]. Soon after the massacre, he learns of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[satyagraha]] policies, and is especially impressed by his call to launch the [[non-cooperation movement]], which saw thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up school, college studies, and government jobs. In 1922, Gandhi calls off the movement after the [[Chauri Chaura incident]]. Undaunted, Bhagat decides to be a revolutionary, and, as an adult, joins the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association|Hindustan Republic Association]] in its struggle for India's independence, ending up in prison for it. Bhagat's father, Kishen, bails him out so that he can get him to run a [[Dairy farming|dairy farm]] and marry a girl named Mannewali. Bhagat runs away from home leaving a note saying that his love for the country comes first.  When [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] was beaten to death by the police while protesting against the [[Simon Commission]], Bhagat, along with [[Shivaram Rajguru]], [[Sukhdev Thapar]] and [[Chandra Shekhar Azad]], carry out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders. Later in 1929, when the British proposed the [[Bhagat Singh#1929 Assembly incident|Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills]], Bhagat, along with [[Batukeshwar Dutt]], initiates the bombing at [[Parliament House (India)|Parliament House]]. He and Dutt throw the bombs on empty benches thereby not killing anyone. They are subsequently arrested and [[In open court|tried publicly]]. This is when Bhagat launches his [[Bhagat Singh#Assembly case trial|much publicised ideas of revolution]], becoming as popular as Gandhi among the masses, especially the younger generation, labourers and farmers.  In [[Central Jail Lahore]], Bhagat and other fellow prisoners, including Thapar and Rajguru, undertake a 63-day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian political prisoners. Meanwhile, Azad, whom the British had repeatedly failed to capture, is ambushed at the [[Alfred Park]] in [[Allahabad]] on 27 February 1931. The police surround the entire park leading to a shootout; refusing to be captured by the British, Azad commits suicide with the last remaining bullet in his [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless|Colt pistol]].  The British re-open the Saunders' murder case, which leads to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Thapar and Rajguru. The Indians hope that Gandhi would use his [[GandhiâIrwin Pact|pact with Irwin]] as a bargaining chip to save Bhagat, Thapar and Rajguru's lives. Irwin refuses Gandhi's request for their release. Gandhi reluctantly agrees to sign a pact which includes the clause: "Release of political prisoners except for the ones involved in violence". Bhagat, Thapar and Rajguru are hanged in secrecy at 7:33&nbsp;pm on 23 March 1931.  
Left Behind II: Tribulation Force
 It's a week after the rapture and the millions of people who vanished into thin air are still missing. Chaos rules the world as panic and grief-stricken survivors continue to search for their lost loved-ones. Suicide rates are skyrocketing, businesses and homes are being looted, and martial law is in effect. A desperate world looks to the leadership and guidance of UN Secretary General Nicolae Carpathia, the only person offering any answers, hope, and plans to restore peace and order.  While Carpathia has the world's adoration and trust, he is seemingly unaware of a small group of rebels spreading the truth that he is in fact the Antichrist. Buck Williams ([[Kirk Cameron]]) is a highly respected television journalist who has seen firsthand Carpathia's manipulative and deadly powers. His position allows him special access to a global audience through the media and to Carpathia himself. Airline pilot Rayford Steele ([[Brad Johnson (actor, born 1959)|Brad Johnson]]) and his 20-year-old daughter, Chloe ([[Janaya Stephens]]), make up the rest of this group. Ray is still struggling to come to grips with the loss of his wife and son, but his recent salvation and friendship with Pastor Barnes have brought him back to the church and closer to his feisty daughter. Ivy Gold, Buck's assistant from the first film, comes into the GNN headquarters, and they go to Buck's apartment so they can work on the story of the vanishings.  As the Tribulation Force struggles to open the eyes of the world to the truth, Global events get even stranger when word leaks out that three men have mysteriously burned to death at one of the holiest sites in Israel: the [[Western Wall]]. At the same time, Rabbi Ben Judah, one of the leading religious scholars of his time, plans to make a world-altering announcement based on years of research. Pastor Barnes believes both events are linked to Carpathia, signaling the oncoming terror of The Tribulation. He acts quickly by getting Ray and Buck to embark on a dangerous mission to infiltrate Carpathia's organization. They must get to Ben Judah before he makes his announcement. Buck is going to the Wailing Wall to get the witness on tape, but Steve Plank tries to talk him out of it. Bruce wants Rayford to join Carpathia's staff as the pilot of the new plane that the US government gave to Nicolae. Rayford initially turns down the mission.  Rayford, while grieving about his family, receives a call from Chris (his former co-pilot). He goes to Chris' apartment, and saves Chris' life and soul, because Chris wanted to commit suicide. Rayford then accepts Bruce's mission, to spy on Nicolae. Chloe is concerned for Buck and Rayford, but Buck starts to care for Chloe.    Rayford then heads to Hattie to try and fly the plane. Initially, Hattie is suspicious of Rayford (due to their last confrontation), but Rayford convinces her that he is the right man for the job.  Meanwhile, Chloe goes to Bruce and asks about relationships during this time of chaos. She then goes to Buck's apartment where she sees Ivy Gold, Buck's assistant.  Ivy blows Chloe off, thinking that she is just some star-struck fan of Buck's. Buck tries to call the Steele's house, but Chloe doesn't want to chat with him. When Rayford finally picks up the phone, he uses a bit of deception to have Buck meet with Chloe. When Buck leaves his apartment, he is taken to the roof of his building where he has a meeting with Nicolae. Buck is granted access to the Wailing Wall, and he goes to meet with Chloe.  Chloe first blows him off, but some deception from Rayford gets them to talk.  Buck and Chloe make up and start a relationship. Rayford and Buck then leave for Israel. Meanwhile, Ivy starts to visit Chloe at the church, initially to apologize for her behavior, and then later because she starts to become friends with Chloe and Bruce. Nicolae then ups the security at the Wailing Wall; and, with the help of Steve Plank, they create a "One World" religion. At the airport before leaving for Israel, Buck and Chloe share some time together. Rayford tells Chloe that he will watch over Buck.  On the airplane, Rayford attempts to find some solid evidence about Nicolae. He finds some information on a computer pertaining to Rabbi Ben-Judah. While obtaining the evidence, Nicolae comes in and congratulates Rayford on being the pilot. As Rayford hands Nicolae their ETA, he sees a vision that disturbs him.  When on the ground in Israel, Rayford shows the email he downloaded from Nicolae's computer to Buck. They realize that the conversation about Ben-Judah was about the speech he was going to give.  Steve and Nicolae changed the speech because Ben-Judah was going to announce Jesus as the Son of God. Instead, because of the new changes, Ben-Judah is going to announce Nicolae as the Messiah. Buck goes to meet Rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah. He asks the Rabbi to come and discredit the witnesses, and prove that Jesus is the messiah. He agrees. Nicolae puts added security on the wall, and Rayford and Buck pray to God to help the get message out.  They go to the Wailing Wall to meet the two witnesses. Rayford distracts the guards (through God's intervention in the form of an angelic singer) and Buck and Ben-Judah slip through to confront the two men. Ben-Judah chats with the two men and learns about Jesus. They are attacked by UN guards and the two witnesses breathe fire at their attackers and they die. During the broadcast, Nicolae cuts the feed right in the middle of the Ben-Judah/Two Witnesses confrontation. Buck then learns that the broadcast got cut and Ben-Judah ran off. Ivy comes to the church to give Chloe some food, and witnesses Chloe ministering to a severely burned fireman who then passes away. Ivy hugs Chloe, and states that the fireman was at peace. Chloe remarks that he found God.  Nicolae comes to the Temple Mount and speaks to the masses. Rabbi Ben-Judah then comes to the Temple Mount and starts giving his speech. Nicolae, along with his advisors, watch the broadcast. Rayford, in the cockpit, asks the copilot to take over. He then goes out and pulls the fuse to stop Nicolae from ruining the broadcast. Rabbi Ben-Judah then gives his speech about Jesus being the Messiah, and how he needs to be forgiven. Nicolae then orders the broadcast to be cut. In Chicago; Ivy, Chloe, and Bruce are watching, with Ivy crying. When the broadcast is cut, Ivy is stunned, but Chloe leads her to Jesus, with Bruce praying with them.    In Israel, Ben-Judah's announcement leaves the crowd mixed. Buck asks Ben-Judah if he will be ok, Ben-Judah states that Buck helped millions learn the truth. Back in the cockpit of the airplane, Rayford hangs up pictures of his wife and son. He is finally at peace about their disappearing.  Carpathia, filled with rage, tells God that it is his time to rule the Earth.  Back in Chicago at the New Hope church, Bruce is leading worship. Ivy, Chris, Rayford, and Chloe are singing a hymn (How Great Thou Art) when Buck enters. Buck hugs everyone as they continue to sing.  
Leaving Metropolis
 David (Troy Ruptash) is a well-known artist who is blocked. He decides to take a job as a waiter to try to find inspiration. His friend and roommate Shannon (Thom Allison), a pre-op male-to-female [[transsexual]], stumbles across the Main St. Diner, owned by Matt (Vince Corazza) and Violet (Cherilee Taylor), who are looking for a waiter. David gets hired and quickly becomes close with the couple although they don't know of his standing in the art community and are surprised to learn that he's gay. David's friend Kryla (Lynda Boyd), a columnist for the [[Winnipeg Tribune]], tracks David down at the diner against his wishes. An annoyed David demands that she write up the diner in her column, which she does. The diner's business picks up considerably.  Shannon, whose [[sex reassignment surgery]] has been repeatedly delayed because of her [[HIV]]-positive status, begins to become ill. David has a painting installed and Kryla gets his photo in the paper. Matt and Violet see the photo and realize that he's famous.  David and Matt start hanging out. Matt, who had tried his hand at drawing [[comic book]]s, pesters David to show him his paintings but David resists. Matt confesses that he had once fallen in love with another man in college although he hadn't acted on it. David, finding himself drawn to Matt, paints him nude (although Matt doesn't pose). He tells Matt that there's a painting he needs to see. Matt comes to David's place and sees the painting. He becomes aroused and the two begin an affair.  David paints two more portraits of Matt, who still doesn't actually pose. Kryla and Shannon hail them as his best work and entreat him to exhibit them but Matt, nervous about how Violet would react, makes him promise not to. Each also tells the other that he loves him. They keep the relationship secret, though, especially in the face of the vehement disapproval Kryla expresses to David at the idea of his sleeping with a married man.  Kryla soon discovers the affair when she walks in on David and Matt having sex. A panicked Matt tells David that he lied about loving him and flees. In the aftermath of the affair, Shannon convinces David to break his promise and exhibit the paintings. He does so under the title "Straightman." When Matt learns of the show he confronts David, first threatening to destroy the paintings and then offering himself again sexually. David contemptuously dismisses him. Matt tells Violet about the paintings and about the affair and admits that he is in love with David. She demands a divorce.  Shannon, who has grown progressively more ill, decides to take her life. As she dies, David runs into Kryla at a bar and they have a bitter fight.  Violet attends the opening but merely tells David that the paintings are very good. As she's leaving Matt arrives and she refuses to give him another chance. After the opening Matt again approaches David who also rebuffs him.  At film's end, Violet sells the Main St. Diner and Matt has left town. David has also decided to leave. He and Kryla reconcile.  
Liberty Stands Still
 Liberty Wallace ([[Linda Fiorentino]]) is the Vice President of Marketing of one of the largest gun manufacturers in the [[United States]], McCloud Industries. She's the daughter of the company's founder, and married to the company's ruthless CEO, Victor Wallace ([[Oliver Platt]]). While Victor is busy [[weapons trafficking|trafficking]] in international armaments, Liberty takes business breaks to conduct an affair with actor Russell Williams ([[Martin Cummins]]).  The balance of their marriage of convenience shifts when a sniper named Joe ([[Wesley Snipes]]) aims his rifle at Liberty as she walks through a busy [[Los Angeles]] park on her way to meet Russell. Joe calls Liberty on her cell phone and orders her to shackle herself to a nearby hot dog vendor's cart. Liberty has no intention of acquiescing to Joe's wishes, until Joe begins shooting.  Quickly convinced, she locks herself to the stand, only to learn that it is loaded with explosives. If she calls for help, hangs up the phone, mutes the phone, or fails to co-operate, the bomb will go off. Joe has also attached a bomb to Russell, who is now in his dressing room at the theater.  Liberty realizes she can not buy her way out of the situation, and she is forced to consider Joe's demand for an anti-gun forum. It is revealed that Joe's daughter was fatally shot at school by a classmate, who used a gun manufactured by McCloud Industries. Joe has decided to show Liberty what it is like to be on the other end of the weapon, and the horrors of what she has had a blind hand in for years.  Victor has apparently bartered illegal deals without Liberty's knowledge, ones that have resulted in easier access to weapons for street dealers, including the ones who sold the weapon that killed Joe's daughter. Joe wants Liberty to use her political connections and this incident to spark a public debate on the Second Amendment. Despite his past, Joe no longer supports the unequivocal right to bear arms.  Joe tells Liberty that she is going to die, but that she can die a hero if she exposes her company's shady business dealings and political connections before she's killed. As Joe monitors and records her every move, Liberty reveals secrets about her own past, and her business dealings.  When Victor, who is also having an affair, finds out that Liberty has been taken hostage, he is torn between protecting himself and allowing Liberty to be killed, or going to help her. Eventually, he arrives on the scene. At first, it seems that Joe, who is actually a former CIA agent named Alex, is using Liberty as bait to attract media attention, but then Joe guns down news reporter Bill Tollman ([[Jonathan Scarfe]]), who is also the son of a hawkish U.S. Senator.  Joe calls Victor on his cell phone, and Victor recognizes the caller's voice. Joe shoots and kills Victor in front of Liberty, and he then informs her that a key to the shackles is hidden in a box, underneath the [[hot dog cart]]. Liberty retrieves the key and releases herself, and then she runs to Russell's dressing room. Together, they helplessly watch the timer on his bomb count down to zero. When the bomb does not explode, they realize that it was a fake.  Meanwhile, a police SWAT team has figured out which building Joe is hiding in. Before they can get to Joe, he shoots himself in the head, and dies, but he has already forwarded Liberty's recorded confessions to several newspapers.  
Let's Talk (2002 film)
  Radhika (Maia Katrak) has been married for over ten years to Nikhil (Boman Irani) and is having an affair for the past six months with an interior designer, Krish. Radhika is now pregnant with Krishâs child and pours out her plight to a friend, Rita (Anahita Oberoi). She mentions a particular incident where she suffered a miscarriage of their second child that had started the rift. Radhika says that she did not want to have this baby, while Nikhil did, and adds that both of them have not quite gotten over the miscarriage. Radhika wants to come clean with Nikhil, while Rita advises her to sort things out in her mind first as to what she wants before she tells Nikhil. Radhika then plays out various scenes in her mind where she has told Nikhil of her affair and visualizes different ways in which Nikhil could react.  The first scenario has Nikhil lying on the couch while Radhika has confessed all and is helplessly asking him for advice as to what she should do now since she doesnât have a clue. Nikhil is silent for the most part but lashes out at her when she mentions their daughter, Sakshi. Nikhil walks to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee and relates to Radhika for the first time, what he had to go through when she suffered the miscarriage. Nikhil then breaks down, saying that he came home on a day quite as ordinary as other days to find his wife was pregnant and the baby was not his. He seems fixated on the last part, and keeps re-iterating it. Radhika tries to reach out to him but he brushes her away. He slowly walks out of the kitchen, into the hall and then the balcony, as Radhika follows and realizes he has taken a jump from their high rise apartment.  The next scenario has Radhika and Nikhil on their dining table, Nikhil is singing at the top of his voice, much to Radhikaâs consternation, while he repeatedly refuses to believe Radhikaâs confession, attributing it to the fact that Radhika is just a typical bored urban Indian wife and is making the whole story up for laughs. Nikhil pokes fun at the situation saying "Krish and Radha" are so perfect for each other, all the while nonchalantly pounding away on his laptop.  Radhika retains her focus on the dining table again, where a supper time scenario is played out this time. As they sit down to eat, Nikhil starts off asking Radhika the cryptic question "Where do you go?", and persisting with his interrogation of a sullen Radhika until exasperated, she asks him what exactly he means by that. Nikhil elaborates asking her where they go to screw. As Radhika replies they go to the new flat, Nikhil continues making crude remarks until Radhika asks him why he is doing it. Nikhil responds by banging a quarter plate on the table to make Radhika jump up and points out that that isnât the way he is reacting, by screaming, pulling his hair out, or by throwing things around, and ventures Radhika to guess why he isnât acting that way. When Radhika does ask him why, he says that he is able to maintain his cool due to the Indian Penal Code section 497 where Radhika is his private property and anyone trespassing could go to jail. Radhika disbelievingly says he wouldnât do that, but Nikhil holds his stand.  Nikhil proposes to talk to Radhika just as a friend in the next scenario played out in Radhikaâs mind, where he asks her if she has thought about the future and what she wants to do. He suggests calling Krish over since he wants to ask him a few questions. Radhika thinks this is futile and asks him what he would ask Krish. Nikhil starts off by asking an imaginary Krish seated in their apartment if he loved Radhika, to which Krish responds in the affirmative. Nikhil then asks Radhika if she and Krish have thought about their future, and is quite incredulous when she says that they havenât discussed anything like that in the six months that the affair has been going on. Nikhil then poses another question to Krish asking him if he would marry Radhika. On Krishâs slight hesitation to answer this question, Nikhil totally dismisses him telling Radhika that that isnât the way he is supposed to respond, but is to say, "Of course, but I need some time". Nikhil then points out to Radhika that Krish has walked out of the door and explains to her that he is just looking out for her since he is concerned.  Nikhil takes on a jealous, egoistic stand in the next imagery depicted, hitting Radhika with the fact that she might have had an affair for 6 months, while he has been having one with her sister Anita for the past five years. Radhika disregards his claims saying that he is acting juvenile, and making this up just for revenge. A discussion of how good Nikhil is in bed ensues, where Radhika compares him to Krish, saying that he has reduced her to a pair of breasts and one other part in bed, without a face, without arms, without a neck. She relates how Krish has opened up a whole new world to her by concentrating and spending hours on her neck, which she never knew was so sensitive. Nikhil asks her to swear on Sakshi that Krish is better than him in bed, and when she refuses to do so, hangs on to some words of hers uttered in another context, and uses them to massage his ego, interpreting the same to his own self that he is better in bed.  The next visualization has Nikhil drunk and sorting out CDs in the bedroom, as he calls out to Radhika to join him. Nikhil then starts off asking Radhika if she knows what "Supari" is. When she responds saying it is money given to get rid of someone, Nikhil starts playing out a mock situation where he gives supari to get Krish maimed. He enacts a complete scene where the goons castrate Krish and place his genitals in a glass jar, in this case, the glass of champagne Nikhil is drinking acts as the prop and Nikhil directly takes a sip out of it after he has finished his little act. Radhika is visibly disgusted and walks out of the bedroom.  A cut back to reality shows Radhika still confused and blaming her friend Rita for not helping her out. Rita then propounds her thesis with a plate of biscuits and a knife. Thereâs Radhika and the unborn baby, Sakshi, Nikhil and Krish, all represented by the biscuits. Rita moves the biscuits around the plate showing her the various permutations and combinations, and finally narrows it down to a straight choice between Krish and Nikhil, alternating the knife in quick motions on the two biscuits that represent them. Finally, Rita asks Radhika to eat up, and the two women now spontaneously break out into laughter at the situation Radhika is so tightly meshed up in.  Radhikaâs mind gets a bit intense with her imagining a scene next of returning home amidst sightings of Krishna in the city, and packing a few things of their daughter Sakshi into a brown box, while Nikhil has just returned from office. Radhika begins to silently weep and when Nikhil inquires as to why, she talks about seeing a girl on the roadside, about fourteen years old, and just 5 or 6 years older than Sakshi, breastfeeding a baby. While Nikhil is puzzling over why this would affect Radhika so much she blurts out that she is pregnant. Nikhilâs confusion turns to elation and further puzzlement when Radhika does not share his happiness. Radhika tells him about how she did not want to go through what happened five years ago when she had the miscarriage at which Nikhil really loses it, and calls her stupid since she doesnât know what is good for her or will make her happy. The very next instant Radhika is lying on the floor, bruised badly, in her own vomit, her pants pulled down over her knees, while around broken glass strewn around show the evidence of a rape and struggle. Nikhil emerges from the balcony hearing the phone ring, and bathes the cuts on his face with astringent as he talks to his daughter, currently at Nana-Naniâs. Radhika now slowly emerges to wash and clean up, and dress her wounds.  The last and most poignant of the scenarios revolves back to the dining table where both Radhika and Nikhil are sitting calm, the shared knowledge between them heavy. Radhika asks Nikhil if he has told anyone about their situation and while Nikhil says he hasnât, Radhika says she has told Rita. Nikhil says that he didnât tell anyone on the slim chance that she might change her mind, and chuckles while saying so. Radhika is quick to point out it is good he laughed at that point, since the fact is truly funny. Radhika further clears it up to Nikhil that he shouldnât hang on to the fact, that she has made up her mind, her heart, and in fact many parts of her and they will not be easily changed. Nikhil, taking both her hands in his, asks her if that means he should start getting used to the fact that she isnât going to be around. Nikhil is a little surprised since he did not realize there was something so fundamentally wrong with both of them. Radhika then starts opening up, telling Nikhil all the things that were missing from their marriage. She says she thinks they do not treat each other well, that she isnât happy anymore, that she frowns in her sleep, as Nikhil himself pointed out to her one-day, and that she starting to look like her mother at 33 itself. Nikhil asks if this is because he doesnât say nice things anymore about the way she looks, and she admits  that he wouldnât even notice anything different about her any more, for instance if she got a new haircut, that she is a woman, and that Krish never lets her forget that. Nikhil tries to rationally justify the difference between how he responded to that when they were dating and now. His stand is that now, instead of praising a new haircut, he would point out that her hair was in her eyes, since this was more logical due to actual concern. Radhika also recalls the times when she was taking a shower and Nikhil would sing to her, and for which he didnât have the time anymore now, and how she missed his voice, still misses his voice. Nikhil tries to sing and laughs it off as impossible since the situation isnât right. A bit of conversation more, and Nikhil suddenly breaks into the song, [[Over the Rainbow]] from the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]. He asks if he can make her laugh, and starts laughing himself. Radhika catches up on the infectious laugh and they both seem to bond in strange strength and maturity.

On Kauai, a young woman named Nani has been struggling with caring for her rambunctious, disobedient, and lonely younger sister, Lilo, following the death of their parents. A social worker named Cobra Bubbles expresses increasing concern that Nani is unable to take adequate care of Lilo. To reduce Lilo's grief of not having any friends, Nani decides to let Lilo adopt a dog. At the shelter, Lilo immediately takes a keen interest in Experiment 626, who is impersonating a dog. In spite of Nani's doubts, Lilo names 626 "[[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]]" and shows him around the island.  That evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, Jumba and Pleakley try but fail to capture Stitch. The resulting chaos is blamed on Stitch, causing Nani to be fired. The next day, Cobra warns Nani that if she does not find another job, Cobra will have to place Lilo with a foster family. However, Stitch's antics, including evading Jumba and Pleakley, ruin Nani's chances of finding work.  Nani's boyfriend, David, invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to take a break and enjoy a day of surfing. While Nani, Lilo and Stitch ride a huge wave, Jumba makes one final effort to capture Stitch from underwater, causing Nani to [[Glossary of surfing#Accidental|wipe out]], and Stitch unintentionally pulls Lilo down with him. Although everyone survives, Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that although she means well, Lilo will have to be taken away. Seeing how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off.   The next morning, the Councilwoman relieves Jumba and Pleakley of their assignment and gives it to the galaxy's militant captain, Gantu, instead, freeing Jumba to pursue Stitch using less covert methods. Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which Nani rushes to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba, who chases him back to Lilo and Nani's house. A fight ensues which destroys the house. Cobra arrives to collect Lilo and take her away. As Nani and Cobra argue, Lilo runs away and encounters Stitch, who reveals his alien identity moments before Captain Gantu captures both of them. Stitch manages to escape before Gantu's ship takes off and is confronted by Nani. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba insists they only came for Stitch. When Nani breaks down, Stitch reminds Nani about [[ohana]], a term for "family" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani give chase in Jumba's spaceship and rescue Lilo.  The Grand Councilwoman appears and prepares to take Stitch into custody and retire Gantu for kidnapping Lilo, but Lilo insists that, as Stitch is her pet under local law, he cannot be taken away. Impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy, the Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live in exile on Earth and be entrusted into the care of Lilo and Nani, and asks Cobra, who is revealed to be a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent whom she met in 1973, to watch over them. Together, they rebuild the house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Lilo and Stitch's family. The film ends with various footage and pictures of Stitch and his new family's life together.  
Like Mike
 Calvin Cambridge and his two best friends, Murph and Reg Stevens, live in an orphanage. Murph is the youngest of the trio, and has a brotherly bond with Calvin. At night they all have to sell chocolate for the awkward orphanage director, Stan Bittleman, after each home game of the (fictional) [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team, the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles Knights]].    Calvin meets the team's coach, who is impressed by Calvin's knowledge of basketball and honesty about the chocolates and offers Calvin tickets for the next game. Inside a thrift store donation box, Calvin finds a pair of old [[Nike Blazers]] that were used by [[Michael Jordan]]. Calvin's sneakers are taken by a jealous bully named Ox who throws them onto an overhead power line. When Calvin tries to retrieve them that night in a rainstorm he is shocked by a lightning bolt.  Calvin and his friends attend the basketball game between the Knights and the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. After the second quarter ends, the team's star player, Tracy Reynolds, prepares for a halftime contest. Calvin's ticket number is called and he goes one on one with Tracy. Calvin ends the contest with a dunk after bouncing the ball off the backboard. Murph, Reg, and the surprised crowd give Calvin a standing ovation. Calvin is signed to a one-day contract by the Knights. Calvin prepares for his first game with the Knights, but realizes that he is not there to play. When the Knights play the [[San Antonio Spurs]] they start losing badly and Coach Wagner decides to let Calvin play in the fourth quarter. Calvin leads a comeback against the Spurs and they win, which leads to Calvin getting a season contract. Reynolds becomes his mentor since Calvin is a minor. Calvin brings teamwork to the Knights and makes them one of the best teams in the league. Tracy starts to respect Calvin after Calvin gets himself into trouble when making sure that Tracy didn't miss curfew.  Bittleman signs a contract with the team that all of Calvin's money will go to him until Calvin is eighteen or adopted. When the second option is about to become true, Bittleman grows desperate and steals Calvin's shoes and bets [[US$]]100,000 against the Knights.  After convincing Ox and his cohorts that Bittleman is selfish, Ox takes the shoes out of Bittleman's safe. The kids head to the arena with Calvin's sneakers. Bittleman escapes and sends goons after Calvin in a failed attempt to steal the shoes back. Calvin makes it to the arena with the shoes after the 3rd quarter ends with [[Vince Carter]] and the [[Toronto Raptors]] routing the Knights 80â59.  In the 4th quarter of the last regular season, Calvin is put into the game by the coach and the Knights start to make a comeback. After a pile-on towards the end of the game, Calvin's shoes are ruined with the Knights down by one point. Without the shoes and wanting to be a normal child, Calvin sadly tells the team this will be his last game. In the final play, Calvin manages to pump fake to get Vince Carter to jump and pass the ball to Tracy. Tracy makes the game-winning shot to clinch the Knights their first playoff appearance. After the game, Calvin bids poignant goodbyes to Tracy and Coach Wagner.  After going back to his orphanage, Calvin is surprised by Tracy's return and intentions to adopt him. Calvin agrees under the condition that he also adopts Murph (whom Tracy previously met and bonded with), not wanting  to leave him behind. Reg is later adopted by a different family, though they all still keep in touch. Bittleman is missing because he doesn't have enough money to pay the bet and the orphanage is now sponsored by the Knights.  
Lilya 4-ever
 The film begins with a figure running towards a motorway bridge. When the figure turns around, the film introduces the audience to Lilya Michailova, an adolescent girl who has recently been brutally beaten. The film then reveals her past.  Lilya lives with her mother in a run-down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union (principal filming took place in [[Paldiski]], [[Estonia]]). Lilya's mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother's new boyfriend, but instead, she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt while she and the boyfriend move to the U.S. The aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat Lilya and her mother had lived in while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment.  A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilya. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostitution, but Lilya declines. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and says the money belongs to Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school, culminating in her being raped by a group of boys she knows. Lilya ultimately has to actually become a prostitute to support herself.  Meanwhile, she forms another close, protective friendship with a younger boy named Volodya, who is physically abused by his alcoholic single father. She buys Volodya a basketball, but Volodya's father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She then meets a young man, Andrei, who becomes her boyfriend and convinces her to move to [[Sweden]], where he says they'll live together. After arriving in Sweden, she is instead met by a pimp who takes her to a nearly empty apartment, where he imprisons and rapes her. Lilya is then forced to perform sexual acts for a large number of clients.  Despondent over the departure of the only person who cared about him, Volodya commits [[suicide]]. In the form of an angel, Volodya comes to Lilya to watch over her. On Christmas Day, he transports Lilya to the roof of the apartment building where they lived and, deeply regretting having killed himself, gives her the world as a present, but a disillusioned Lilya rejects it. After an escape attempt, Lilya is brutally beaten by her pimp, but she escapes again successfully. With the story arriving full circle to the scene at the beginning of the film, Lilya jumps from the bridge and commits suicide herself.  The film's conclusion presents two different endings. One version shows Lilja being sent back in time after killing herself to when she made the decision to go to Sweden with Andrei. However, this time she rejects Andrei's offer to go to Sweden, and she and Volodya are shown to presumably live happier lives. In the final scene, Lilya and Volodya are both angels happily playing basketball on the roof of a tenement building.  
Life or Something Like It
 Lanie Kerrigan ([[Angelina Jolie]]), a successful reporter for a Seattle television station, interviews a self-proclaimed [[prophet]], Jack ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), to find out if he really can predict football scores. Instead, Prophet Jack not only predicts the football score, and that it will [[hail]] the next day, but also that Lanie will die in seven days, on the following Thursday. When his first two prophecies come true, Lanie panics and again meets with Jack to ask for another prophecy to test him again. Jack tells her that there will be a relatively significant [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]] at 9:06 am, which also happens. Now Lanie is convinced that she is going to die and is forced to reevaluate her life.  Lanie tries to find consolation in her famous [[baseball player]] boyfriend Cal Cooper ([[Christian Kane]]), and in her family, but there is little there. Her lifelong ambition, that of appearing on network television, begins to look like a distant dream. In her desperation, she commits professional blunders, but ends up finding support in an unlikely source: her archenemy, the cameraman Pete Scanlon ([[Edward Burns]]), with whom she once had [[casual sex]]. He introduces her to a new approach to life; to live every moment of her life and to do whatever she always wanted to do. Lanie moves in with Pete for a day, and he introduces her to his son Tommy ([[Jesse James Rutherford]]), who lives with his mother, and they spend a whole day together with Tommy. That night they sleep together for the second time. The next day Lanie receives an opportunity for a job she always dreamed of in [[New York City|New York]]. She asks Pete to come with her, but he declines telling her that her appetite for success and fame will never end. Sadly, Lanie leaves for New York.  Pete meets Jack and tells him how wrong he is, as Lanie got the job which Jack foretold she would not get. But Jack explains that he was right as Lanie will never be able to get the job as she'll die before it begins. He also gives a prophecy of the death of a famous former baseball player in a plane crash. When Pete receives the news of the death of the baseball player, as foretold by Jack, he tries to call Lanie to warn her but can't reach her so he flies to New York.  Lanie - unconcerned with Jack's prophecy - interviews her idol, famous media personality Deborah Connors ([[Stockard Channing]]). Lanie realizes how petty the opening questions are and shares a heartfelt moment with Deborah live on air. The interview receives huge [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. The network immediately offers her a position, but Lanie declines, realizing that she wants a life with Pete in Seattle.  As she leaves the studio, a police officer gets into a conflict with a man, who shoots a bullet into the air. Pete tries to warn Lanie from across the street, but she is shot in the crossfire. Lanie dies in the operating theatre but is revived. When she wakes up, Pete tells her that he has loved her since the first time he saw her, and Lanie says she loves him too. Later, Pete, Lanie and Tommy watch Cal's baseball game, while Lanie (in a voiceover) says that one part of her has died â the part which didn't know how to live a life.

Long Time Dead
 The film begins showing people using a ouija board in [[Morocco]]. Throughout the scene, something is seen from first person perspective coming at high speed towards the people.  The main film begins with four housemates Rob ([[Joe Absolom]]), Liam ([[Alec Newman]]), Stella ([[Lara Belmont]]) and Webster ([[Lukas Haas]]) deciding to go out and party. Also going to the party is Lucy ([[Marsha Thomason]]) (a friend of Stella), Spencer ([[James Hillier (actor)|James Hillier]]), Joe ([[Mel Raido]]) (a new housemate of the first three) and Annie ([[Melanie Gutteridge]]) (Liam's girlfriend). As the night progresses, they all try to find the biggest buzz they can, until Spencer suggests a ouija board, saying it is the weirdest buzz he's ever had. The partygoers agree and participate, all placing their right index fingers on an upside-down glass with the alphabet and the words 'Yes' and 'No' written in a circle around the glass. Lucy tells them that under no circumstances should they remove their fingers from the glass early â otherwise the spirit they summon will not be able to return.  At first, the glass moves slowly, spelling out 'DJINN', but when Liam asks if it can predict the future, the glass sharply goes to 'Yes'. It then proceeds to spell out 'ALL DIE' and then Annie's name. Before the ritual can continue, however, Liam experiences visions similar to the prologue that causes him to run away. Annie goes to see him to check if he's alright, but Liam refuses to talk. Annie realises she has left her inhaler in the room that they used the ouija board in, and goes back to get it. When she gets there, she becomes frightened by noises. Eventually she sees something that the camera does not see, and it gives chase (as shown through the first person view that was used in the prologue). Finding Liam nowhere and with her exits barred, she attempts to climb over a glass roof to safety, but the thing giving chase grabs her legs and she falls through the glass roof into the party below, dying instantly. As the camera pans out, severe burn marks are seen on her legs.  The group are distraught by her death, but while Spencer goes to find some hash to calm himself down, Lucy goes back to her boat and does some research. She comes across a description of a djinn, explaining that it's made of fire. She learns that it can be banished by using lawful magic. She is suddenly disturbed by banging all around her, but it turns out to be a boatman who is telling her that the electrics are down.  Lucy and Spencer go to the house where everyone else lives and discuss the events of the night. Lucy suggests to the housemates that they may have summoned a djinn, saying the burns on Annie are signs of this being true. The housemates are still skeptical, so they watch the tape they recorded of the 'summoning' to check if anyone was pushing it. Soon after Liam freaks out in the video, however, the electricity in the house goes out. Webster and Spencer break into Becker ([[Tom Bell (actor)|Tom Bell]]), the landlord's, flat  and find a hidden shrine of sorts to the Djinn with grisly photos and newspaper cuttings. It is also revealed that Liam's father, Paul Brennan, had been in the same predicament once (as shown in the prologue) and killed his mother as a result. He pleaded insanity and was put in a mental hospital. Joe attempts to get information out of Liam about it the next day at college, but he gets angry and leaves. Stella also leaves soon after, and goes to the toilet. She starts to freak out about a burning smell when an unnamed female black student ([[Tameka Empson]]) tells her it's just a joint. Calming down, Stella goes to leave, but is pulled into another stall, where she is brutally murdered (the viewer can only see her feet lifting off the ground as they slowly become covered in her own blood). Her body is discovered by the female student. Liam goes to see his father to get answers but it quickly descends into a row. When Liam mentions Becker his father shouts that he is there to protect Liam. Liam leaves without hearing this.  Meanwhile, Joe and Webster sneak back into the house (now under police guard) to get the camera which recorded the ritual and Webster insists on watching it there. Joe goes to the kitchen to get a light for his cigarette. Meanwhile, Webster is thrown into a panic by something on the film. He goes to look for Joe. In the hallway he turns the lights on and realises he is standing in a pool of blood. He runs for the front door which is locked, so he rushes back upstairs to get the keys. He has to hide under the bed as he is being chased by the djinn. While the djinn does not see him, it dumps Joe's dead body in the room - his throat has been slit. Webster silently exits the room with keys in hand but steps on a broken light bulb, alerting the djinn. He races back down to open the door, but the djinn catches up and kills him before he can succeed.  Rob and Spencer return to Lucy's boat and tell her of Stella's death. Lucy demands that they perform the banishing ritual, so they return to the warehouse where the party was held. Liam attempts to catch up with them, but upon arriving at their boat, they have already left. Lucy, Spencer and Rob begin the ritual, but as they are performing it, a sudden burst of flame from the ouija board frightens them all off. Spencer runs off and tries to look around, but when he drops a large metal pole he alerts the djinn, who has already arrived, to his location. He hides in a cupboard. We then learn that the djinn has possessed Rob. The djinn walks off, making Spencer think he is safe, until he bursts into the cupboard from behind and kills Spencer after knowing he was there by smelling the blood on his cut hand on a shard of glass he's holding tightly in fear.  Liam enters the building, as does Mr. Becker, who is holding a petrol can. As Liam walks into the ritual room, Rob runs out, shouting "Liam, it's Becker, he's here!" but is interrupted by Becker who hits him with a bat and proceeds to douse him with petrol. Liam, thinking Becker is the djinn, runs in to save Rob, accidentally pushing Becker down some stairs. When he goes back to look Becker has disappeared. Later Becker reappears and Liam is about to kill him in revenge for Annie until Rob rushes in and stops him. Seconds later, Rob kills Becker in a panic when Becker attempts to choke him. They start to leave, Rob attempting to convince Liam there really was no djinn but Liam remembers Lucy and they go looking for her. Liam finds her hanged in the lift shaft. Rob reveals to Liam that he is the djinn, telling Liam that it's his turn as his father sent him somewhere terrible, so now Liam will know the pain that he has. Liam attempts to stab him, but Rob blocks it with his hand, which bleeds but also starts a small flame. As Rob taunts Liam, Liam realises through another flashback that fire will kill the djinn. He grabs the nearby lantern and wards off Rob with it, but as Rob attempts to fake being unpossessed (by crying and admitting fear) Liam tosses the lantern at him, setting him ablaze. Liam kicks him down the lift shaft, but a few seconds later he grabs onto Liam's shin (now heavily burned and scarred). Liam finishes him by shutting the lift door on him, causing him to fall all the way down. After a while Liam opens the door to check he is dead, but a burst of flame pushes him back, signalling his body has been destroyed.  Liam goes back to the mental hospital to see his father face to face, and they reconcile only for Liam to reveal he too is now possessed. He kills his father. The djinn, now free, sets off. As the camera rolls back from the cell, it is revealed that Liam had killed a prison officer to get in, and Liam suddenly appears in front of the camera, and reveals his eyes are now permanently like the djinn's.  
LisÃ­strata
 It is the year 411 BC and the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Sparta]] (among others) and [[Athens]] has been raging for some 20 years.  The women who want to see the conflict finally ended use a trick to make their husbands comply: led by the Feminist LisÃ­strata ([[Maribel VerdÃº]]), they barricade themselves on the [[Acropolis]], where the Athenian treasure is kept, and refuse to have sex with their husbands until peace is restored.  The men soon sport gigantic [[erection]]s, which as in Aristophanes' play are depicted by huge prosthetics that protrude from under the actors' clothes.  This unfortunate state of "[[blue balls]]" hinders them in their capacity to fight.  Luckily, the Spartans have the same problem.  To the rescue comes Hepatitos ([[Juan Luis Galiardo]]), the local homosexual and [[transvestism|transvestite]], who disguises himself as a medical doctor and advises the generals to order [[circumstantial homosexuality]] as a way to relieve the pressure in their men.  At first, the soldiers refuse, but quickly warm up to the idea &mdash; and soon everyone lives rather happily in male&ndash;male relationships.  The women are not amused by this, as their plan has been foiled.  However, as the soldiers begin to fall in love with enemy soldiers instead of fighting them, peace is finally established.  The women end their strike (not to the delight of all men) and it is hinted that in the future, homosexual and [[heterosexual]] relationships will be regarded as relatively exchangeable.  While the film is primarily a bawdy comedy (even more so than the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] play), it also contains interesting tidbits of historic truth, such as a relatively accurate life-size replica of the [[Pallas Athene]] statue by [[Phidias]] in the [[Parthenon]].  The scene in which one soldier is about to kill an enemy fighter, but is moved by his beauty so much that he spares him and arranges a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with him after the battle, can be seen as being based on the legend of [[Achilles]] and [[Troilus]], son of [[Priam]].  
Long Life, Happiness & Prosperity
  A 12-year old girl Mindy Ho ([[Valerie Tian]]) attempts to help her single mother win the lottery and better their living conditions through the usage of [[Taoism|Taoist]] charms she found in a book from Lee Tai Taiâs Fortune Telling and Appliance Repair shop.

He wishes to one day get rid of his fatherâs disdain for him by working in his own butcher shop with his son.  When Mindy attempts to win a lottery for her mother using the taoist charms, Bing Lai accidentally cuts in front and resulting in him winning the lottery. With the money, Bing Lai buys his own butcher shop in an effort to reconnect with his father. During this time, Alvin attempts to kiss Kin in an effort to woo her over. The effort fails drastically, much to Mindy's chagrin. Mindy then resorts to using a love potion to create chemistry between Kin and Alvin. However, Alvin ends up drinking the tea with the owner of Bingâs Butcher, Nelson Zong. Nelson falls in love with Kin while Alvin falls in love with Nelson. Nelson goes as far as serenading Kin while Alvin becomes enraptured by Nelsonâs singing.  When Bing attempts to make his son a partner in the butcher shop business, he discovers that his son never wanted to become a butcher but rather, intends to become a Zen monk. As a result, Bing Lai disowns his own son. At the same time, Shuck stops believing in the Yellow God, even resorting to destroying the shrine he created for his god. Mindyâs frustration over her charms not working worsens her relationship with her mother.  In the climax of the movie, Mindy goes to a local park to try another spell in order to make everything better, only to find herself in the middle of a violent storm. In disdain for his son, Bingâs father does not show up at the airport. A letter from his father declares that Bing was "dead to him" from the day he was born. Alvin and Kin bump into each other and discover that they actually like each other. They then search for Mindy in the storm and find her unconscious and trapped under a fallen tree branch. Meanwhile, Shuck contemplates suicide since has he has lost faith in his god and his own worth. At the last second, Shuck finds the turtle that a young boy previously lost, receiving this as a sign from God that he should live. Bing Lai accepts his sonâs decision to be a Zen monk. Mindy turns out to be unhurt, and she is seen dancing happily with Kin and Alvin.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
   Awakening from a dream of [[Gandalf the Grey]] battling the [[Balrog]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and his friend [[Samwise Gamgee]] find themselves lost in the Emyn Muil near [[Mordor]] and soon become aware of being stalked by [[Gollum]], former owner of the [[One Ring]], capturing him with a sympathetic Frodo deciding to use Gollum as a guide to Mordor, despite Samâs objections. Meanwhile, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] pursue the [[Uruk-hai]] to save their companions [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by [[Rohirrim]], the exiled army of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] with the two [[Hobbit]]s escaping into [[Fangorn|Fangorn Forest]] where they meet the [[Ent]] [[Treebeard]]. Aragornâs group later meets the Rohirrim and their leader [[Ãomer]], who reveals that their king [[ThÃ©oden]] is being manipulated by [[Saruman]]âs servant [[Grima Wormtongue]] into turning a blind eye to Saruman's forces running rampant in Rohan. While tracking down the Hobbits in Fangorn, Aragornâs group encounters a resurrected [[Gandalf]], who came back after killing the Balrog and his death in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] to help save Middle-earth.  Aragorn's group travels to Rohanâs capital city [[Edoras]], where Gandalf releases ThÃ©oden from Sarumanâs influence and Wormtongue is banished. After learning about Saruman's plans to wipe out Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, ThÃ©oden decides to move his citizens to [[Helm's Deep]], an ancient fortress that has provided refuge to Rohan's people in times past, while Gandalf departs to acquire the aid of the Rohirrim. Aragorn builds a friendship with ThÃ©odenâs niece, [[Ãowyn]], who quickly becomes infatuated with him. During a [[Warg]] attack, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river, but is found by his horse Brego and taken to Helmâs Deep. The Uruk-hai army arrives at Helmâs Deep, finding a makeshift army of civilians and Elves from LothlÃ³rien waiting for them as a night-long battle follows before the Uruk-hai breach the fortress.  At Fangorn, having met Gandalf prior with Treebeard intent to keep them safe, Merry and Pippin convince him to take the Hobbits to Isengard following an Ent council where Treebeard's kin agree to not participate in the war. Upon seeing the destruction wrought by Saruman, Treebeard summons the Ents to storm Isengard, drowning the Orcs in the resulting flood and stranding Saruman in Orthanc. At Helm's Deep, Aragorn convinces a despairing Theoden to ride out and meet the Uruks. Gandalf and the Rohirrim arrive at sunrise, turning the tide of the battle and decimating the Uruk-hai while those remaining flee and are slaughtered. Despite this win, Gandalf warns that Sauron's retaliation will be terrible and swift.  Meanwhile, becoming loyal to Frodo after taking him and Sam through the [[Dead Marshes]], Gollum convinces the Hobbits of another entrance besides the Black Gate. Frodo and Sam are later captured by the [[Rangers of Ithilien]] under by [[Faramir]], brother of the late [[Boromir]]. After torturing Gollum while inadvertently instilling in him the notion that he has been betrayed when Frodo saves him from being killed, Faramir learns of the One Ring and takes his captives with him to [[Gondor]] to win his father's respect. While in the Gondorian city of [[Osgiliath]], Sam reveals that Boromir was driven mad by the Ring. Attacking NazgÃ»l nearly capture Frodo, who momentarily attacks Sam as he attempts to hide him, forcing Sam to remind him that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth, rekindling Frodo's hope. This resonates with Faramir, who releases them. Gollum decides to reclaim the Ring and revenge himself on Frodo by leading the Hobbits to â[[Shelob|Her]]â upon arriving at Cirith Ungol.  
Love Liza
  Wilson Joel's ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) wife Liza ([[Annie Morgan]]) has, for an unexplained reason, committed suicide.  Wilson one night discovers a sealed letter from his wife, which he believes to be her suicide note.  In his grief-stricken state and with the added stress of finding the letter, which he cannot bring himself to open and read, he forms an addiction to inhaling [[gasoline]] fumes ("[[huffing]]").  His mother-in-law Mary Ann ([[Kathy Bates]]) tries her best to help Wilson and deal with her own loss at the same time. She becomes increasingly anxious to know the contents of the letter.  In order to hide his addiction from a work colleague named Maura (Sarah Koskoff), he informs her that the petrol smell in his house is from his hobby of flying remote controlled planes. To try to engage an ever-distant Wilson, Maura asks her brother-in-law, Denny (Jack Kehler), a [[radio control]] (RC) hobbyist, to visit Wilson.

While Marisa and fellow maid Stephanie are cleaning the room of socialite Caroline Lane, Stephanie convinces Marisa to try on a  designer [[Dolce & Gabbana]] coat. Lane had previously asked for it to be returned to the store and Stephanie argues that it âtechnicallyâ doesnât belong to anyone at the moment. Elsewhere in the hotel, Ty befriends hotel guest and senatorial candidate Christopher "Chris" Marshall, whom Ty learns has an interest in [[Richard Nixon]], the subject of his school presentation.

The Magdalene Sisters
 Set in Ireland, beginning in 1964, so-called "fallen" women were considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. The film follows the stories of four young women - Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) - who are all forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum. The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions put on at the laundries.  Each woman suffers unspeakable cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior, Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.  The film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to [[Mary Magdalene]], who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a "contest" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic [[washing machine]]s start to appear, a modern [[household appliance]] whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene Asylums unsustainable.  Three of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridget's study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to [[Liverpool]] and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of [[anorexia]] at age 24. Her real name was also revealed to be Harriet.  The epilogue to the film gives a brief description of the lives of four of the inmates after the girls leave the asylum by the late 1960s. It is noted that the last Magdalene asylum closed in 1996.

MalÃ©fique
 Carrere, a middle-class family man convicted of financial fraud, arrives in prison where he finds himself sharing a cell with three others- Lassalle, an old librarian who murdered his wife; Paquerette, a childlike lunatic who ate his infant sister and Marcus, a beefy young transgender woman (whose crime is not mentioned) who yearns for a sex-change.  The cellmates discover, hidden behind a loose brick of the cell-wall, an old hand-written journal which belonged to a prisoner named Danvers in the 1920s who mysteriously disappeared from his cell. The book is filled with incantations and symbols of black magic. Although sceptical, Carrere reads aloud one of the incantations and the prisoners are shocked when a bright, burning symbol briefly materialises on the floor. Carrere, and then Lassalle both study the book and they begin to have disturbing visions. Paquerette wakes up one morning to find that during the night, his fingers have vanished.  The cellmates argue over what to do with the book. Paquerette grabs the book and starts to eat its pages only to be over-powered by an unseen force which twists his entire body until his spine and neck snap. The other three prisoners are blamed by the guards for Paqueretteâs death, condemning them to stay in prison for life. Lasselle believes that the book was defending itself. A new prisoner named Picus arrives, a friendly, eccentric man who always carries a video camera. Later, the others wake up one morning to find that Picus has disappeared, leaving his camera and the journal on the floor. They watch the last piece of footage on the camera in which Picus reads an incantation from the book whereupon a brightly lit doorway appears on the wall through which he walks. They ask the guards about Picus but the latter reply that they do not know who the cellmates are talking about, revealing that Picus was a hallucination concocted by the book, designed to reveal the bookâs true powers.  Carrere has been abandoned by his wife and he will never see his beloved son again, the only relic of whom he possesses is an action-figure doll that belonged to his offspring. Carrere now sees the book as his only chance to escape. The three prisoners read aloud the same incantation that Picus read and the brightly illuminated door-way again appears in the cell wall, through which they walk. They find themselves in a dirty, much older prison cell and the book does not offer a means of escape. They realise that they have entered Danversâ cell as it was in the 1920s. Carrere and Marcus become angry but Lassalle remains calm and without warning kills Marcus with a sharpened rock. Carrere is furious but Lassalle explains that he finally understands the nature of the bookâs powers- it was not intended to let them physically escape but to enable them all to realise their deepest desires albeit at a terrible price. A flashback sequence reveals the true fate of the cell's original inhabitant Danvers. Obsessed with youth, Danvers uttered his final spell and the book transformed him into a young man but the reverse ageing did not stop until he was reduced to an unborn infant, dissolving into nothingness. Lassalle says that Marcus' desire to become a woman was not strong enough and he could only be set free through death. Lassalle, who has always been obsessed with, and terrified of, the powers of the written word, grips the book and merges with it, its powers crushing the life out of him. Now the only survivor, Carrere states aloud his dearest wish- to see his son again- and his mouth opens in a silent scream as his eyes vanish.  The final scenes occur outside the cell. Carrereâs estranged wife and son arrive to collect his belongings, a prison official explaining that Carrere and his cellmates have mysteriously vanished. As they drive home, Carrereâs young son plays with the action figure that his father had kept in his cell. The dollâs head is seen in close-up and is revealed to have Carrereâs living eyes, now able to see his son.

The film begins on the morning of Manny's graduation when various principal characters reluctantly roll out of bed, communicating with each other in overlapping arguments and cell phone conversations. Muscle-bound hunk Junior Moreno immediately channels his ever-hot-tempered energy toward long-suffering wife Miriam (Julissa Lopez) as well as the Mexican foreman (Panchito Gomez) who recruits day workers for Junior's not quite legal home-plastering biz. Reasons for Miriam's wary demeanor soon become obvious: Being a husband and father hasn't cramped Junior's lady-killer instincts one whit, with wealthy female business clients definitely on his to-do list.  The day is focused on a big event: Younger sibling Manny is graduating from high school, a huge party is planned, and he is headed for Syracuse University on a full scholarship. He is the apple of everyone's eye, including his grandpa (Hector Gonzalez). Conspicuously absent from the preparations, however, is his and Junior's father Oscar (Manuel Cabral), who runs a bodega in the neighborhood but is ostracized from all contact. Only well into the storyâafter he's been forcibly ejected from the boisterous celebrationâdo we learn why: Oscar's criminal activities landed Junior in prison, after which the father abandoned him and the rest of the family.  This black sheep's uninvited appearance casts a pall over the hitherto raucous party. As it breaks up, Manny insists on escorting home his date, gorgeous single-mom classmate Marisol (Jessica Morales). On the subway, two punch-drunk thugs interrupt their sweet courtship. When things get scary, Marisol uses her mace can, instigating a harrowing chase from which the young couple barely escapes. Shaken, Manny refuses an offer to sleep over. Marisol, afraid the thugs are still waiting outside, presses a handgun on him "for protection."  The next morning dawns with a new series of cell phone calls: Manny is in jail for shooting an attacker who's now in a coma; the second assailant is still at large. Junior knows from experience that little bro doesn't have what it takes to survive long in prison, especially since he's swiftly transferred to the hard-core Rikers Island.  When Junior's desperate attempts to raise bail money and secure a decent lawyer, prove fruitless, he chokes down his bitterness and approaches Oscar for help. Their tense, then terrifying confrontation reaches an awful impasse that leaves the family's future darker than before.

Once inside, he is immediately beaten by the prison guards for misbehaving, and is subsequently approached by the prison governor. The governor offers Meehan a job as coach of the prison wardens' football team; not wanting to make enemies with the other prisoners, Meehan declines, and instead offers to train a team consisting of other inmates, who will take on the wardens in a practice match. Meehan then recruits the resident contraband dealer, Massive, as his right-hand man, and receives advice from an elderly convict, Doc, who teaches Meehan prison lore and warns Meehan to avoid making mistakes by revealing he was in prison for killing an enemy as well as the enemy's wife and child with a grenade.

The waitress, Laura Vasquez, tells him that the murderers are Serleena, a [[shapeshifting]], plant-like Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad. Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MiB rules, does not [[Neuralyzer|neuralyze]] her to erase her memories.  J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent K, who was neuralyzed upon retirement and remembers nothing of his MiB service. In [[Truro, Massachusetts]], where K is now the town's [[postmaster]], J convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MiB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but remembers that years before, he neuralyzed himself specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returned. As a precaution, he left himself a series of clues.  At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with worm aliens. The key opens a locker in [[Grand Central Station]] where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card. At the video store, as J and K watch a fictionalized story of the Light of Zartha, K remembers the Zarthan Queen Laurana long ago entrusted Men in Black with safeguarding the Light from her nemesis, Serleena, who followed Laurana to [[Earth]] and killed her. After hiding the Light, K neuralyzed himself to ensure that he would never reveal its hiding place. K still cannot remember where he hid it, nor what the Light actually looks like; he only remembers that it must return to Zartha soon, or both Earth and Zartha will be destroyed.  At the worms' apartment, they find that Laura has been kidnapped by Serleena, who believes that Laura's bracelet is the Light. J, K, and the worms counterattack MiB headquarters, freeing Laura and the other agents. Serleena attempts to retaliate by chasing them with a spaceship through New York but is eaten by Jeff, a gigantic worm alien living in the [[New York City Subway]].  Laura's bracelet leads J and K to the roof of a skyscraper where a ship stands ready to transport the Light back to Zartha. The two realize Laura is the daughter of Laurana, and is herself the Light. K convinces J and Laura that she must go to Zartha, to save both her planet and Earth from destruction. Serleena, who has assimilated Jeff and taken his form, attempts to snatch the ship carrying Laura as it lifts off, but J and K blast her out of the sky. Since all of New York City has just witnessed this battle in the skies over the metropolis, K activates a giant neuralyzer in the torch of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  Back at headquarters, K and Men in Black Chief Zed, hoping to cheer up a heartbroken J, have relocated the tiny locker-dwelling aliens who worship him to his Men in Black locker. When J suggests showing the miniature creatures that their universe is bigger than a locker, K shows J that the human universe is itself a locker within an immense alien train station.

Mekhong Full Moon Party
  Khan, a [[Nong Khai]] native now attending university in [[Bangkok]] comes home for the annual [[Naga fireballs]] festival, just as a debate is raging over the cause of the fireballs. A local physician, Dr. Nortai, believes there is a scientific explanation for the phenomenon. A university professor, Dr. Suraphol, thinks the fireballs are manmade and are a hoax.  Khan knows the truth: Having grown up as a [[temple boy|dek wat]] at a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple across the river in [[Laos]], he helped the temple's abbot and the monks there to create fireballs and plant them on the bed on the [[Mekong]]. It is how he grew up to become such a strong swimmer and obtain an athletic scholarship.  The temple's abbot, Luang Poh Loh, seeks Khan out and begs him to once again help with the planting of the fireballs. But Khan, weary of perpetuating a myth and of the crowds that accompany it, refuses.  This sets up a conflict between science and religion that threatens to change the annual celebration.  For his part, Luang Poh Loh is philosophical, advising "Do what you believe, believe in what you do."  
Megalodon (2004 film)
 In the [[North Atlantic]] off the coast of [[Greenland]], a highly advanced deep sea [[Oil platform|oil rig]] has been recently constructed by the company Nexecon Petroleum, and named "Colossus" for its immense size. This "new" type of oil rig can dig deeper and extract more [[oil]] than any other in the world. The fact that this huge rig has been built on fault lines alarms [[geologists]], who are concerned that the delicate ocean floor fault lines in that region might be disturbed through deep drilling, with catastrophic consequences. A [[reporter]], Christen Giddings, has been invited by the [[CEO]] of Nexecon, Peter Brazier, to the oil rig in an attempt to address the concerns of the geologists. Christen is accompanied by a trusted [[cameraman]] Jake Thompson, who will record their findings. The oil rig's crew seem to be convinced that nothing bad will happen, and are skeptical of the geologists. Brazier hopes that a documented report on "Colossus" will reveal that his rig has all the necessary safety arrangements and that the region is stable enough for a drilling operation. As the drilling commences, a rich oil deposit is discovered. However, further drilling is not stopped and an "ocean floor fault line" gets ruptured, which opens a portal to a "mirror" ocean, hidden under the normal ocean for millions of years and containing [[prehistoric]] life. An [[explosion]] occurs and the drilling system collapses. A team of [[engineer]]s descend through a glass [[elevator]] to assess the situation. A giant animal is spotted approaching, which turns out to be the most powerful and fearsome oceanic predator that ever lived, ''[[Megalodon|Carcharodon megalodon]]'', a giant, 60+ foot prehistoric shark. A struggle for survival ensues as the crew and geologists attempt to escape from "Colossus", during which several people fall victim to the beast. In a desperate move to stop the monster shark, one of the crew members, Ross, lures it to an open space with his small [[submarine]] and overloads the fuel tanks of the machine, resulting in a gigantic explosion that kills both him and the beast. The ordeal is not over yet as another Megalodon ventures into open waters, passing below a boat with Christen Giddings on board. However she is unaware of its presence.  
Meesa Madhavan
 Madhavan ([[Dileep]]) is a clever thief who robs for a living and is well known in the village. He is following the principles of his mentor Mullani Pappan ([[Mala Aravindan]])who trained him to be a thief when Madhavan was a young boy. Meesa Madhavan got his name by the popular saying that if Madhavan rolls his Moustache (Meesa in Malayalam) looking at someone, he will rob his house that night. His enemy is the local money lender Bhageerathan Pillai ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]) who refuses to give back his father's property despite Madhavan paying back the loan with interest years ago.  Madhavan falls in love with Bhageerathan Pillai's daughter Rukmini ([[Kavya Madhavan]]). Despite being childhood friends, in the beginning of the movie Rukmini hates Madhavan as he is a well known thief in the locality. But later on when she realizes that Madhavan's sisters marriage was cancelled because of her father, she slowly started falling for him and later both fall in love with each other. The sub inspector in the village Eappen Pappachi ([[Indrajith Sukumaran|Indrajith]]) has an eye on Rukmini.

It becomes Madhavan's responsibility to find the culprits and he does that with his mentor's help and thus uniting with his girl friend.  
Minority Report (film)
 In April 2054, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]'s PreCrime police stops murderers before they act, reducing the murder rate to zero. Murders are predicted using three mutated humans, called "Precogs", who "previsualize" crimes by receiving [[precognition|visions of the future]]. Would-be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality. The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program.  Since the disappearance of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton has both separated from his wife Lara and become a drug addict. While [[United States Department of Justice]] agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program, the Precogs generate a new prediction, implying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow, but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman, the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes, one of the Precogs, usually Agatha, has a different vision than the other two, a "minority report" of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence.  Anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the citywide [[Retinal scan|optical recognition system]]. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]]. Anderton takes Agatha to a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.  Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's hotel room as the 36-hour time nears, finding numerous photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had [[Sobriety|sobered up]] and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.  Witwer, studying Crow's death, suspects Anderton is being framed. He examines the footage of Lively's murder and finds there were two attempts on her life, the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second, occurring minutes later, having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess, but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton's gun. With the Precogs still offline, the murder is not detected.  Lara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her, and Anderton is captured, accused of both murders, and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep. As his body is deposited into the prison, the warden tells him, "that all your dreams come true".  Agatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system. While attempting to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.  After Burgess's death, the PreCrime system is shut down. All the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released, although they are kept under occasional surveillance. Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together. The Precogs are sent to an undisclosed location to live their lives in peace.

A Midsummer Night's Rave
 ''A Midsummer Night's Rave'' transposes ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' to modern [[rave culture]]. Unlike ''[[Rave Macbeth]]''âreleased a year earlier and also adapting a Shakespeare play, ''[[Macbeth]]'', into the context of rave cultureâ''A Midsummer Night's Rave's'' plot also explores the characters' activities outside of the rave: Xander (Lysander) and Mia (Hermia) needs the aid of a rave and a green glowing drug, provided by a British mystic, O. B. John (Oberon), to admit their love for each other; a drug dealer, apparently modelled on [[Shylock]], named Doc wants his stolen drug money; and Nick (Nick Bottom) dons a donkey costume at a daycare center. The plot is significantly altered from the original to "accommodate a homosexual relationship and to allow one liberated woman, Elena, to reject her callow lover."

One day Kago and Tsuji serve a particularly enthusiastic customer (played by [[Ai Takahashi]]) who says she has never had such a delicious cake before.  When the waitress explain they do not know the secret ingredient that makes the cakes so good, Takahashi decides to sneak into the cafÃ¨ later find out what it is and steal it.  Meanwhile, Mika has prepared a large cake in the shape of a [[castle]] for the Minimoni CafÃ¨'s second Anniversary party being held at the cafÃ¨ tomorrow.  They store the cake in a refrigerated case unit so that the cake stays fresh until tomorrow. Mika and Yaguchi also set alarms to ensure the safety of the cake and the bakery. Later that night four servant [[fairies]] (played by 4KIDS) and their fairy queen (voiced by [[Yuko Nakazawa]]) sneak into the bakery and turn the cake castle into stone.  The queen remains in the castle while the fairies proceed to change the rest of the pastries in the bakery to stone.  In the meantime Takahashi has sneaked into the bakery in a cat burglar disguise. Unfortunately for her, Tsuji and Kago also sneak into the bakery to steal some food and trip the alarm.  The alarm brings Yaguchi and Mika to the kitchen and confuses the fairies.  In the end all of Minimoni and Takahashi get hit with fairy dust, which turns them into small computer animated people.  The team learns that the queen has taken over the cake castle and Yaguchi decides to go after her.  They enlist the help of the fairies to bring them to the castle however upon arriving Minimoni gets captured and locked in the dungeon.  Takahashi, who had tagged along, eluded capture however and manages to enlist the help of a talking [[refrigerator]] to help her free Minimoni. After Minimoni is freed, they go with Takahashi and the refrigerator to see the fairy queen.  Along the way they encounter a large pastry monster and learn why the fairy queen wants to turn cakes to stone, is because if she eats them she will return to her short fairy body and she thinks her tall thin one is more beautiful. Eventually the team reaches the fairy queen and they all work together to make a cake that tastes so good that it would change the queens mind about cakes, which it does but it also reverses all of the magic the queen used up till now.  However, since the spell is finally broken the castle begins to melt since it is no longer stone and it was not kept cold.  With the help of the fairies and the refrigerator, Minimoni and Takahashi successfully escape the castle.  When they reach the bakery floor everyone turn back to normal. Except the refrigerator which just becomes normal size and the fairies which turn into little children (played by 4KIDS).  After comforting the children, Yaguchi leaves the bakery and returns with new uniforms to give to her bandmates.  Yaguchi however gives the fourth costume to Takahashi instead of wearing it herself explaining that Takahashi must take her place in the cafÃ¨ because  Yaguchi has to take care of the children that used to be fairies and show them how to survive in the world.  Takahashi accepts this offer thus beginning the second generation of Minimoni.

Mondays in the Sun
 After the closure of their shipyard in Northern Spain, a few former workers â Santa, JosÃ©, Lino, Amador, Serguei and Reina â keep in touch. They meet mainly at a bar owned by their former colleague Rico. Santa is the most superficially confident and the unofficial leader of the group who dreams of one day going to Australia. A court case hangs over him that concerns a shipyard street lamp he smashed during a protest against the closure, which he claims to not want to pay, not because of the financial cost but of what it stands for. JosÃ© is bitter that his wife, Ana, is employed while he is not. The gap between them is widening and he is fearful that she will leave him for a co-worker. Despite arthritic legs, Ana endures night shifts at a fish factory and thinks her looks are now lost. Not everyone seems to agree, including her boss. Lino, an aging family man, doggedly pursues positions beyond his qualifications. The oldest member of the group, Amador, has degenerated into alcoholism after being abandoned by his wife; maintaining an increasingly transparent pretense that his wife will soon return from holiday. Reina has managed to find a job as a watchman at a football club, smuggling his friends into a game. Lino attends job interviews despite applicants being near his son's age. This group of friends is observed by Nata, the landlord's teenage daughter who franchises her babysitting job to Santa. While babysitting, Santa invites his friends around to have a few beers outside where Serguei claims his career as an astronaut was forestalled by economic measures in the Soviet Space program.   One night at the bar, Amador drinks too much and has to be assisted home by Santa, the two of whom share a long and meaningful conversation on the way back. As a result of his drunken state and the newly deepened friendship, Amador, who has never allowed any of the group to go inside his 4th floor apartment, lets Santa in to help him upstairs. After putting Amador to bed, Santa goes to wash some glasses only to find that there is no running water, leading him to explore the apartment which he sees is rundown and in a state hardly better than if he were living on the street.  Santa finally agrees to pay off the debt in court. After driving off with his lawyer, they drive past the newly-repaired street lamp where Santa tells the lawyer to pull over. Santa leaves the car, walks over to the lamp and smashes it again before driving off.  Later that night, Santa goes to Amador's house to collect him to go to the bar but gets no response at the door. The flickering light above him brings attention to a partially caved-in roof. Santa steps backwards slowly, realising that the damage to the roof is due to Amador having jumped from his window while drunk, killing himself. His friends give him a dignified funeral albeit with a stolen floral arrangement. Meanwhile, Ana is at home packing in preparation to leave JosÃ©. She waits for him on the couch with her bag on the floor. Upon returning from the funeral, JosÃ© sits on the couch and lays across Ana's lap, telling her about the funeral and trying to make amends for the fighting they've been doing. Ana pities him and begins to cry as well, placing a blanket over her bag and deciding to stay without JosÃ© ever knowing she had intended to leave.   That same day, Lino is waiting in line for another job interview and before being called for his turn, he looks ahead seeing a reflection of himself, ultimately deciding that he is wasting his time looking for employment in such places.   At night, the friends meet up again in the bar with the ashes of Amador and after pouring 'one last drink' in his urn, they make a decision and set off to spread the ashes. The friends go down to the shipyard and eventually find the ferry that they always took together and where it is implied that they met. Two of the men climb on board while the other two stand guard. The two on-board break into the cabin and find a way to start the ferry. Once they get it started, the other two climb aboard and they set off for the middle of the passage. Upon getting there, they realise that each one of them thought another had brought the urn and that they had left it behind. They chortle. The group of friends stay out all night in the middle of the passage without any cares and by morning there is a large crowd around the ferry terminal watching the men from afar. The men chat casually while sitting in the morning sun as the credits begin to roll.  
Mitr, My Friend
 "Mitr, My Friend" is a film about the plight of women who sacrifice their life for the betterment of their family. It also describes the cultural differences experienced by a small town girl on moving to a transposed environment living.  The film opens with a typical South Indian wedding being performed between Lakshmi ([[Shobhana]]) and Prithvi (Nasir Abdullah). The marriage has been [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by their parents in the usual Indian manner. Lakshmi is a typical South Indian girl from [[Chidambaram]], [[Tamil Nadu]]; Prithvi is a software engineer working in California. After the wedding, they move to the USA where Lakshmi gradually tries to fit into her new surroundings. The marriage is a happy union: Prithvi works hard at work, Lakshmi manages the home, and they grow to love one other deeply. Within a year, they are blessed with a baby girl Divya (Preeti Vissa).  The film flashes forward 17 years. Divya is a typical adolescent: she goes to school, plays soccer, and occasionally attends parties (not always with her parents' knowledge or permission). Lakshmi does not take to the partying very well, and tensions rise between mother and daughter. Divya aspires independence, and expresses herself by sidelining Lakshmi; Lakshmi wants her to be responsible, and expresses this by checking up on Divya a bit too much for Divya to be comfortable. Prithvi understands both sides, and tries to cope with Divya's growing up, but not always with full cognizance of Lakshmi's feelings.  Things escalate one evening when Divya kisses her boyfriend Robbie outside her home. Lakshmi is furious, because her traditional values do not permit physical intimacy outside of marriage. In her fury, she bursts forward and drives Robbie away from the porch. Divya is furious at this kind of interference. She moves out of her parents' house and begins to cohabit (without marriage) with Robbie. Lakshmi is overwhelmed by this, and Prithvi is also angered, because he feels that Lakshmi has acted in haste and mishandled the situation. He begins to drift away from Lakshmi. Amid this storm, Lakshmi seeks a shoulder in an internet [[chat room]], where she meets a "mitr" (Sanskrit: friend), with whom she is gradually able to share her thoughts and feelings. This connection yields another result: "mitr" points out that Lakshmi is too committed to her family to relax or be happy for herself. Lakshmi digests this and begins to explore her own interests in carpentry, dance, and hairstyling; she thereby establishes a new identity and personality for herself. She becomes fast friends with her new neighbors Steve (a computer security consultant) and his kid brother Paul.  Prithvi keeps his distance from these neighbors and all of Lakshmi's new friends. He is chagrined that the new Lakshmi is no longer his doting, traditional wife: she is still affectionate, but has now learned the notions of space and tacit distance. While he is inwardly glad she is growing, he discovers that there is depleting room for him, particularly at a time when he is coping with his daughter's absence. Things come to a head when he overhears Lakshmi laughing with Steve, assumes the worst, and uses a convenient work-related excuse to move out for a few days.  The film takes a turn when Lakshmi, now alone at home, receives a call from the hospital. Divya has broken up with Robbie and is now hurt. Divya realizes that she cannot cope with the vagaries and lack of commitment inherent in relationships with non-Indian people; she regrets her previous decisions and decides to return home. Mother and daughter spend some quality time and bond over Lakshmi"s narration of nostalgic stories about her arrival to a new life in the USA. She is in touch with her "mitr" all through.  The film builds to its climax when she asks, at Divya's urging, "mitr" to meet in person at the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. All is revealed when "mitr" turns out to be none other than Prithvi himself.

Mistaking the gun for his own, Ma refuses to back down. The thief fires, only to reveal that the gun he holds is a fake.  Meanwhile, a murder has taken place in town. A man has sneaked into Zhou's home and shoots Li with the missing gun. Upon interrogation, Zhou insists that he was not the intended target. However, Ma investigates on his own and reveals that Zhou runs an underground factory which produces counterfeit wine. Ma then retains Zhou, exchanges clothes with him, and boards a bus heading out of town. True to his prediction, the criminal trails Ma, thinking that he is Zhou, shoots him from behind at the railway station but fails to kill him instantly. As the criminal approaches to confirm his kill, Ma turns over and locks the two of them together with his handcuffs.  The criminal turns out to be Stammer Liu, a local bricklayer whose family was poisoned from drinking Zhou's  illicit wine. Liu begs Ma to let him go to avenge his family but Ma refuses. Ma then draws out the fake gun he confiscated from the thief  and Liu, in fear, fires and spends the last bullet.  Ma bleeds profusely and feels faint, lying on the ground.  The police arrive, and as they rush over to apprehend Liu, Maâor his hallucinationâis shown to suddenly stand up and walk away with his recovered gun, apparently unhurt and laughing (or perhaps crying) at finding his lost weapon.

Miss Lettie and Me
   
Mr. Deeds
 Multibillionaire Preston Blake freezes to death while on a mountain climbing expedition. With no widow or legitimate children, it is initially unclear who would earn the right to Blake's massive fortune.  It is found that Blake has a living grandnephew named Longfellow Deeds ([[Adam Sandler]]), who runs a [[pizzeria]] in Mandrake Falls, [[New Hampshire]] and also writes [[greeting card]]s in the hopes that [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] may be interested in one. Deeds is contacted and flown to [[New York City]] by businessman Chuck Cedar ([[Peter Gallagher]]), who is temporarily in control of Blake Media. Deeds' unorthodox helicopter trip includes a stop at [[Wendy's]] for a [[Frosty (frozen dairy dessert)|Frosty]] as well as a singing of [[David Bowie]]'s [[Space Oddity]]. Once Deeds arrives in New York, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days while all the legal details are worked out.  The story is major news, and [[reporter]] Babe Bennett ([[Winona Ryder]]), who works for a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] show called ''Inside Access'', has a co-worker pretend to [[Robbery|steal her purse]] in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated that Deeds wanted to meet a girl by "rescuing" her, the same way his father had met his mother. Deeds does so, and beats up her "robber", and Babe [[courtship|goes out]] with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson, a school nurse from a made-up town called Winchestertonfieldville, [[Iowa]] (which later turns out to be a real town, which Babe is flabbergasted to find out).  Though Babe initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the unfailingly kind-hearted Deeds, and decides to tell him that she is not who she says she is, but Inside Access, in concert with Cedar (who was fed the truth by the fake robber and was smitten with Babe) reveals it to Deeds first. Heartbroken and upset, Deeds decides to return home to Mandrake Falls and makes plans to donate his $40 billion inheritance to the [[United Negro College Fund]]. After returning to Mandrake Falls, he learns from Crazy Eyes ([[Steve Buscemi]]) that Cedar intends to sell off the company, which will cause thousands of people to lose their jobs (Cedar had convinced Longfellow to sell his shares by lying that he will work commanding the company in honor of Preston's lifetime of work). Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back, but after saving her life when she falls through the ice over a lake, he rejects her, saying he does not really know who she is.  At a shareholders meeting, Cedar has everyone convinced to sell the company, until Deeds (who has bought a single share) arrives and manages to convince everyone not to sell. But Cedar claims control of a majority of the shares and the sale is approved. Bennett arrives and reveals that, having studied Blake's personal journal after she stole it from Deeds earlier, she has determined that Emilio Lopez, Preston Blake's longtime butler, is Blake's [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] and the true heir as a result of a younger Preston having an amorous affair with his maid in 1958 (at one point he ''had'' told Deeds that Blake treated him "like a son"). Realizing Emilio is his cousin, Deeds convinces him they must stop Cedar and that he is the rightful CEO. As a result of Emilio supplanting Longfellow as the heir, Deeds' sale of shares are retracted and Cedar is dismissed.  Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media. Babe then reconciles with and kisses Deeds after professing her love for him. As they leave the meeting, Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and offers him a billion dollars, some of which Deeds spends on red [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvettes]] for everyone in Mandrake Falls. When he returns to the pizzeria with Babe, he learns that Hallmark is interested in buying one of his greeting cards: the one he wrote for Babe when he professed his love for her. They both share a kiss as the movie ends with Crazy Eyes crashing his Corvette and coming out unharmed.

Detective Cassie Mayweather and her new partner, Sam Kennedy investigate.  Cassie sleeps with Sam early onâas she has with previous partnersâbut won't let him see her chest, and curtly sends him home afterward.    Footprints at the crime scene lead to Richard, and vomit nearby implicates Justin.  Both have alibis, and deny knowing each other, but Cassie is convinced that Richard is the murderer and Justin is involved.  Sam criticizes her refusal to consider other suspects, as most of the physical evidence points away from the two boys.  Cassie's boss, Captain Rod Cody, and her ex, Assistant D.A. Al Swanson, fearing Richard's influential parents, take Cassie off the case. Sam, following the (planted) evidence, tracks down Ray.  When Ray is found dead, apparently a suicide (actually killed by Richard), the woman's murder appears solved; but Sam decides that Cassie may be right, and continues the investigation.

Sam and Cassie bring Richard and Justin in for separate interrogations, trying to induce each to implicate the other, but neither will talk, and both are released.  At the victim's home, Cassie determines how the boys carried out the abduction and altered the physical evidence.

As for Ludovic and his geography teacher, it soon becomes apparent that his obsession with them is grounded in more than just artistic pursuits. Etienne's burgeoning [[homosexual]] tendencies become more and more clear both to him and the audience over the course of the movie.  Even though Etienne is determined to make this year "the year of love", the year when everything turns around for him, things do not go as well as anticipated. He makes a blunder in his figure skating performance and only achieves second place. And when he starts, very carefully, to talk to Ludovic about the possibility of two men being in love, Ludovic runs away.  In the final minutes of the film, the purpose of Etienne's video diary gets clear: Feeling he has failed in what he set out to do and being deeply hurt by Ludovic's resentment, Etienne decides to jump from the cliff and leave the camcorder (which he sets up to film his suicide) behind to explain to his family what he went through.  Luckily, a stranger walks by at that moment and notices the boy close to the cliff and his camera nearby. The final scene shows the stranger and Etienne in bed after sex, with Etienne seeming truly happy for the first time.  
My Big Fat Greek Wedding
 Being 30-years-old and single, Fotoula "Toula" Portokalos is her family's [[black sheep]]. The daughter of staunchly proud Greek immigrants, she was raised to follow her cultural tradition of marriage and motherhood. Her golden-child sister Athena met her family's expectations by marrying young to another Greek and becoming, in Toula's words, "a Greek baby-breeding machine". Toula still lives with her parents and works at Dancing Zorba's, her family's restaurant in Chicago. Toula longs for her own life away from the restaurant and her intrusive family. Frumpy and cynical, she fears her life will never change. One day at the restaurant, Toula notices a handsome young customerâIan Miller, a school teacher. She tries to speak to him, only to embarrass herself with her social awkwardness. Ian is bewildered by her behavior, and Toula figures she's lost her chance to get to know him.  Toula's idea for independence is taking computer classes at a community college. When Toula approaches her father Gus about the classes, he forbids it, thinking she wants to leave her family. He insists she's "smart enough for a girl" and it is too dangerous for her to be out in the city alone. After some crafty persuasion by his wife, Maria, Gus reluctantly permits Toula to attend classes. As her classes progress, Toula gains self-confidence. She trades her thick glasses for contact lenses and her baggy, drab clothes for flattering, colorful outfits. She updates her hairstyle and learns to apply makeup. With her new computer skills and polished image, Toula asks her mother and her Aunt Voula to convince Gus that Toula should work at Voula's travel agency instead of the restaurant.  Toula thrives in her new job, and one day she sees Ian walking by the travel agency. He notices Toula, not recognizing that she is the same woman who tried to talk to him at Dancing Zorba's. Despite Toula's lingering shyness, they introduce themselves and begin dating. When Ian realizes Toula was the woman at the restaurant, Toula is sure Ian will lose interest. Instead, he loves her even more for who she is, and they become a couple.  Because Ian is not Greek, Toula keeps the relationship secret from her family, but her parents find out when a family friend sees them kissing in a parking lot. As she feared, Gus is angry because Ian is not an ethnic Greekâreferring to Ian as a "Xeno"âand both Gus and Maria tell Toula to end the relationship. Toula insists she loves Ian. Her parents try to dissuade her by bringing various Greek bachelors home to meet her, all to no avail.  When Ian proposes to Toula, she happily accepts, but Gus is upset that Ian did not ask him for permission to date Toula, let alone marry her. Ian tries to adapt to the family's Greek customs and mannerisms. Ian and Toula cannot marry in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] unless Ian converts, and Toula is already worried the wedding will be a fiasco. She suggests to Ian that they elope instead. He refuses, saying if it's that important to her family to marry in their religion, then he will be [[baptized]] Greek Orthodox. Ian's willingness to do this encourages Gus and Maria to gradually accept Ian into the family.  As Toula feared, her numerous well-meaning female relatives take over much of the wedding plans, while the men keep testing Ian. Her cousin Nikki selects tacky bridesmaids dresses without Toula's permission; her brother Nick semi-jokingly threatens Ian that he'll kill him if he ever hurts Toula. Other cousins trick Ian into saying inappropriate things in Greek. When Toula invites Ian's quiet, reserved parents to meet her parents at their home, she insists that it be a simple dinner with just the six of them. Toula and Ian arrive to find all of Toula's extended family at the dinner, where they dance and drink for hours. Ian's parents are unaware of Greek culture and are shocked by the family's rambunctiousness.  On the wedding day, Toula is nervous and surrounded by relatives, but the traditional Greek wedding goes perfectly. At the reception, Gus gives a speech accepting Ian and his parents as family. He then presents the newlyweds with a deed to a house. Both Ian and Toula are deeply touched by Gus's generosity. Following the reception, Toula and Ian leave for a honeymoon in Greece, both appreciating the craziness of their Greek family.  An epilogue shows the couple's life six years later. Toula got pregnant "a minute later" after their honeymoon with their daughter Paris. As Ian and Toula are walking Paris from their house to Greek school, Paris asks why she has to go to Greek school. Toula replies that she had to go to Greek school as a child, so Paris will too. But she assures her that when the time comes, she can marry whomever she wants. As they walk, it is revealed that their home is next door to Toula's parents.  
My Little Eye

If anyone leaves, then no one wins the money. Nearing the end of the six months, tension between the contestants rises after Emma finds strange messages she believes are from a man from her past and the food packages arrive containing a letter that claims Danny's grandfather has died, and a gun with five bullets.  One night, a man named Travis Patterson ([[Bradley Cooper]]) arrives, claiming he is lost in the woods and that his GPS has died. Despite claiming to be an internet programmer, he claims to not recognise any of the contestants or ever having heard of the show. Later that night, Travis has sex with Charlie, and then secretly talks directly into a camera, to communicate with whoever is watching them. The next morning, Travis leaves and Danny discovers his backpack outside covered in blood and shredded to pieces. The contestants assume he was attacked by an animal but Rex believes Travis works for the people running their show and that it is all a trick to make them leave the house and forfeit the prize money.  Emma discovers her underwear among Dannyâs belongings and confronts him, unaware that Travis planted them there the previous night. Danny denies it and attempts to make peace by giving her a crudely carved wooden cat, which Emma and Charlie ridicule, while Danny overhears. The next morning, the group finds Danny has committed suicide by hanging himself from the staircase balcony with a rope. The guests finally decide to leave, but after being unable to contact anyone via radio, decide to wait until the next morning. Rex uses the [[GPS]] unit from Travis' bag and his [[laptop]] to gain access to the internet to find out more about the show but is unable to find any evidence of their show online. He is only able to find a heavily [[encrypted]] [[beta site]], that requires a $50,000 fee to access, and displays a web page with their pictures and betting [[odds]]. The group decides they will leave the next morning, though Rex and Emma go up to the roof to set off a [[flare]]. While Charlie and Matt remain in the house, Matt asks a camera if he should kill her, before suffocating her with a plastic bag.  Later, while Emma is sleeping, Rex comes downstairs and is decapitated with an axe by Matt. Matt awakens Emma and brings her up to the attic, telling her he is being chased and the others are dead. He then makes advances on Emma, who refuses, and attempts to rape her, before she stabs him in the back and runs off. Emma runs outside and finds a police officer, who handcuffs her inside the car and enters the house. An injured Matt then crawls out, begging the cop to let him kill Emma, since he spent six months in the house with her. Realizing they are working together, Emma escapes the car and tries to run but is shot in the back with a rifle by the cop. Matt and the cop sit in the kitchen discussing the setup they created with Travis for their high paying clients who want to witness the murders. When the cop says there are always "five suckers" to play the game with, Matt corrects him to four, and is then shot in the head. The cop then leaves, talking to Travis over the radio, while Emma is seen locked in a small room, unable to escape. As she collapses screaming, the cameras filming all shut off, one by one.

My Wrongs 8245â8249 & 117
 The protagonist ([[Paddy Considine]]) is a man tasked with looking after his friend Imogen's house, and is specifically instructed to take her dog Rothko for walks, but not to let him off the leash. After putting Imogen's keys through the mail slot in her door (so they don't get lost), the man ensures that he won't lose Rothko by tying the dog's leash around his own neck. Rothko leads him to a park, where he viciously attacks and kills a duck in front of onlookers. As they shout at the man, Rothko ([[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]) begins to speak to the man, taunting him.  The pair run away onto a bus, where the dog tells the man that he is his lawyer and is defending everything the man has ever done wrong. The man recalls a time where he was spoken to similarly by a gerbil as a child, telling him his father was cheating on his mother. The man and dog are kicked off the bus after the conductor finds out the man has no money.  The dog, enticed by a little girl's used handkerchief, follows her into a church, dragging the man with him. Inside, a christening is going on, and the dog tells the man he's brought him here for forgiveness for what he's about to do. The baby being christened speaks to the man, telling him to speak up and tell everyone in attendance that the priest is a pedophile and the baby's mother is a prostitute. Urged on by Rothko, the man does so, only for the baby to say, "Only joking!"  In the resulting commotion, the priest is knocked over, the baby is sent flying, and Rothko breaks free. The man catches the baby and chases Rothko out of the church, only to see the dog struck by a vehicle. The dying dog tells the man that he should now seek out legal counsel from the baby before he dies. When the man asks to speak to the baby, the baby's father punches him.  In a closing monologue, the man reveals he left a note to Imogen apologizing for the keys and dog, and imagines her being satisfied with it, but he is sure she isn't. He no longer goes to the park, as he hears the ducks tell passers-by that he thought a dog could talk, and they refuse to stop when he tells them to.

Naked Weapon
 The movie opens with the assassination of a man of unknown identity. A team of three [[CIA]] officers, including Jack Chen ([[Daniel Wu]]), a rookie, watch through surveillance as a sexy female assassin named Fiona Birch ([[Marit Thoresen]]) enters the man's heavily guarded apartment suite and, after having sex with him, kills him by breaking his spine with her bare hands. As she makes her escape in her white [[Porsche 911 GT3]], her car is hit by a rocket. As the officers rush over to extricate her from the wreckage, a woman in a limousine shoots her to death.  The woman in the limousine is revealed to be Madam M ([[Almen Wong]]), the leader of a mysterious assassin organization, to which the killed assassin belonged. After the incident, young girls across the globe start disappearing one after another. The only relationship among them is that they are all trained in martial arts or sports. As Jack correctly theorizes, these girls have been abducted by Madam M and transported to an island to be trained to become professional assassins. After six years of gruesome training, only Charlene Ching ([[Maggie Q]]), Katt ([[Anya Wu]]) and Jing ([[Jewel Lee]]) survive and "graduate". The last test in order for them to graduate was a fight for survival/to the death test. Katt and Charlene, being friends, could not kill each other, and so each is accepted as a survivor. To celebrate, Madam M gives them all different wines which have drugs in them. As the drugs take effect Madam M calls her guards to brutally rape the girls, thus (in Madam M's words) making them ready for what was to come.  The three girls are then sent on several missions around the world. During one of her missions in Hong Kong, Charlene coincidentally runs into her long-lost mother, Faye Ching ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]). Jack, who has been following Madam M's case for the last six years, tracks Charlene down, but Charlene manages to knock him out and escape. Believing that Charlene would return to seek her mother, Jack waits outside Faye's house. However, Jing shows up first and stabs Faye. Jack tries to fend her off but he is no match for her. Charlene shows up and kills Jing after a fierce fight. She and Jack then escort the wounded Faye to the hospital.   In order to regain their freedom, Charlene and Katt accept a final mission from Madam M. A [[yakuza]] boss, Ryuichi ([[Andrew Lin]]), has contracted Madam M to eliminate a traitor in his gang. The mission turns out to be Ryuichi's trap to avenge his partner, who was assassinated previously by one of Madam M's girls (Charlene). Ryuichi kills Madam M and captures Katt, while Charlene escapes.  While Jack is at the hospital, Charlene calls him to meet her at the beach. They end up making love, and the next morning she leaves a note in his shoe saying if they are destined, then they will meet again. When Charlene returns the next day to rescue Katt, she watches helplessly through a bullet-proof glass as Katt, after being tortured, is killed by Ryuichi with a sword. The enraged Charlene battles Ryuichi in an intense fight, and finally manages to kill him using the technique used by Fiona Birch.  Jack and Faye are at a Chinese temple offering prayers. Faye jokingly says that these things (the gods that she has been praying to) must have been all nonsense in Jack's point of view. But Jack tells her that although he never had a religion, he feels peace every time he is in the temple. Faye commends his behavior and says that he should visit the temple more often. Meanwhile, Charlene is in a different temple praying for Katt's soul to rest in peace, and she tells the deity that she wishes to be with the one she truly loves, Jack.  Jack claims at the end of the movie that there are times when he is sure that Charlene is beside him; the last scene of the movie is Charlene watching Jack rush through the crowd looking for her.  
Nagarahavu (2002 film)
 Based on Ira Levin's 1953 novel A Kiss Before Dying, it is a contemporary thriller about revenge. The main character is Ajay Sharma ([[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]]). His father, Vishwanath Sharma ([[Shrinath]]), once owner of a great business empire,  was defrauded by Madan Chopra ([[Dalip Tahil]]), a trusted employee in Vishwanath's company. The Sharma family is ousted from their own company and loses everything they owned. Soon afterwards, Ajay's father and his young baby sister die due to illness, unable to buy medicine because of their destitute state. His mother is now suffering from [[mental illness]] and memory loss. Driven over the edge, Ajay becomes obsessed with killing Chopra and destroying his family.  Ajay begins dating Seema Chopra ([[Jyothika]]), the daughter of the owner of Chopra business empire. They meet secretly as her father would not approve of a poor son-in-law. Meanwhile, the younger daughter Priya Chopra ([[Jyothika]], dual role) travels with her father Madan Chopra to Madras (now [[Chennai]]), for Madan's final kart race before he retires permanently. Madan has never lost before, but comes across Vicky Malhotra (Ajay Sharma in a disguise of brown contact lenses). Vicky allows Madan to win by slowing at the last corner and tells him that he couldn't beat his "[[guru]]". Vicky then charms Priya by saying that he lost the race as he couldn't break the heart of a beautiful girl. Thus his ploy of winning in spite of losing (meaning ''Baazigar'') succeeds as he wins Priya's heart. This way, he manages to date both Seema and Priya simultaneously using different identities.  Ajay is (incidentally) photographed lurking outside the birthday party of Seema by one of her friends. Later Madan Chopra arranges for Seema to be married off to another business family. Seema is heartbroken, and Ajay decides that they will write identical suicide notes and commit suicide. After they each write their suicide notes, he tells her that the suicide note was just a test. He says that only cowards commit suicide and destroys his note, while keeping Seema's. They decide to marry secretly the next day. When they arrive, the registrar is closed, so they go up to the roof of the building for sightseeing. He makes her sit on the parapet and tells her the truth about himself, after which he throws her to her death from the rooftop of the building. He then posts the suicide note and leaves, but arrives later (as Vicky) with Priya. He helps the Chopra family with the funeral. The letter written by Seema implies that she has committed suicide, and the murder investigation is closed. Priya cannot believe that, and asks her father to re-open the case. However, he disagrees, saying he doesn't want to lose his reputation due to Seema's affair. Priya then asks Karan (Siddharth), who is her former classmate and a current police inspector, for help.  Priya tries to investigate Seema's death, however her attempts prove unsuccessful. Ravi, Seema's college friend, offers to help her, but is brutally killed by Vicky. As Vicky forces him to sign a suicide note before hanging him, Karan thinks that Ravi must have been in love with Seema and hence her murderer. Later, Priya and Vicky meet Seema's college friend, Anjali, who becomes suspicious of him. When she finds out that he was Seema's boyfriend back in college, she calls the Sharma household during Vicky's and Priya's engagement party. Vicky intercepts the phone and impersonates Chopra, and then arrives at her place. He strangles her, then fits her body in a suitcase and throws it in the river.  Vicky vows to destroy Madan Chopra, confiscate his assets and throw him out of his office and onto the street, just like Chopra did many years ago to Ajay's father. Chopra needs to go on a business trip, and knowing that Vicky's his soon to be son-in-law, gives Vicky the [[Power of attorney]]. Vicky does a carbon copy of the previous montage of Chopra, and within days seizes everything. One day in a club Vicky takes Priya to calm her mind, where they meet Ajay's childhood friend, who greets him as ''Ajay''. While Vicky tries to ignore him, Priya tells the man that he is mistaken, and that Ajay is Vicky Malhotra. Ajay's friend repeatedly tries to remind Vicky (who is actually ''Ajay'') about their friendship. Vicky feels trapped and tries to get out of the mess by abusing him and gets in a scuffle with him. Priya visits Ajay's friend and the whole truth is revealed to her.  When Chopra returns, Vicky reveals himself as Vishwanath Sharma's son Ajay and gives him the exact sendoff that Chopra did 15â20 years ago. Priya finds Ajay's home address, and finds out his real identity. Ajay comes in and they argue about Seema's murder. Ajay wins her over by telling her the history of their two families. Madan charges in with a group of thugs and shoots Ajay in the shoulder before he is severely beaten and wounded. Ajay's Mother is then knocked unconscious trying to defend Ajay. This prompts him to recover and fight Madan and his gang all alone. Chopra eventually picks up a stake and mortally stabs Ajay. However, Ajay manages to impale him with the same stake by walking into him, and they jump off a small cliff. Chopra dies, and Ajay (knowing that he is dying) manages to stagger back to his mother. He tells her that he has reclaimed what is rightfully hers. Mrs. Sharma is cured of her illness, but is beset by sorrow, along with Priya crying beside her, as Ajay dies in their arms.  
My Wife Is 18
 The film begins in the city of [[London]], where a 30-year-old man sits in front of a university board of 3 women. Apparently, the subject the man is being assessed in is Psychology of women, so hence the unisexual university board.

Narc (film)
 Undercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis chases a drug dealer through the streets of Detroit after Tellis' identity has been discovered. During the pursuit, the dealer holds a child hostage. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer, but a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to [[miscarriage|miscarry]].   Eighteen months later, the [[Detroit Police Department]] asks Tellis to investigate the murder of an undercover narcotics officer named Michael Calvess. Tellis is initially reluctant, but reads the investigation files and agrees to take the case on two conditions. First, he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. Second, he is partnered with detective Henry Oak, whom Tellis is aware of from the files. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him. The department chief informs Tellis of Oak's reputation, but also warns him about his instability. Oak is assigned to the case.  Oak believes the department wants the Calvess case buried. He reveals that his wife died of cancer, and they had no children. He recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a ten-year-old girl who was being sold into prostitution by her stepfather, resulting in Oak beating the man. He sees parallels between that case and the current one.   Meanwhile, Tellis' wife is worried about her husband. Tellis visits Calvess' widow Kathryn, and asks about her relationship with her husband while he was on the street. Oak, who is protective of Kathryn and her children, turns up at the house and is furious at Tellis.  Tellis and Oak visit the scene of an apparent murder of a drug dealer, shot dead in his bathtub. Tellis discovers the bullet had no fire-pin mark, and surmises that the man used it as a bong and forgot it was loaded. Once heated, the shotgun discharged, killing him. Tellis also notes that the shotgun in question is a SWAT weapon with the serial number filed off.  Determining that this lead is fruitless, they visit the house of a man involved in the initial shootout involving Tellis. Although they find no evidence to suggest he murdered Calvess, they find another officer's badge on the premises. The man pulls a gun and wounds Tellis before Oak kills him in self-defense.  At home, Tellis' wife leaves him. The case is closed as Sheps is determined to be Calvess' killer. Tellis and Oak are furious as they believe the killer is yet to be found, and continue to investigate independently.   Oak determines that suspects are in an auto body shop. There, Oak finds and disarms one suspect while Tellis chases another outside and shoots him in the leg. After they are bound, Oak attempts to force a confession out of them. Tellis is increasingly suspicious of Oak's tactics, especially after viewing files that suggest Oak had thrown out prostitution charges for a woman. Oak finds police issue guns in the trunk of one man's car, including one that belonged to Calvess, and he beats both men until Tellis tells him to get [[forensic science|CSI tools]] from the car.   When Oak leaves the room, Tellis locks the door, turns on the tape recorder, and asks for the truth. The dealers explain that Calvess blew Tellis' cover eighteen months before, causing the shootout. They recount Calvess' degeneration into chemical dependency. On the day of the murder, Calvess tried to deal with the two dealers, but it went badly. At that point Oak arrived, having trailed Calvess to confirm rumors that he was an addict. Calvess went for his weapon, which was the dealers' justification for attacking him. The two men ran off as Oak shot at them.  Tellis confronts Oak, telling him that the dealers claim Oak shot at them, hitting one in the shoulder, before murdering Calvess. Oak denies this, then Tellis raises the issue of Oaks' relationship with Calvess' wife Kathryn.   Kathryn was the ten-year-old girl who was pimped out by her stepfather. Oak considers her the daughter he never had, and has remained close. He has been protecting her by covering crimes she committed in her teenage years. Tellis tells Oak he will make the arrest, and Oak beats him with the shotgun, and resumes brutalizing the dealers. He turns the tape recorder on and attempts to beat a confession out of the men, threatening to shoot them. Tellis breaks into their car, retrieves a gun, calls for back-up, and re-enters the building. He shoots Oak when Oak refuses to put his gun down. Tellis moves to aid Oak, and, realizing he's dying, pleads for the truth of what happened the night Calvess died.  Oak explains that Calvess shot at the dealers as they fled from Oak, leaving the shoulder wound. Oak argued with him, explaining that he had had enough of defending Calvess and would turn him in to the Department. In despair, Calvess took his gun and shot himself. Oak had been protecting his name and family, so Calvess' wife could receive his pension. Oak's motive was to convict the dealers who he felt made Mike a junkie. Oak dies in Tellis' arms, leaving the confession on tape.

Night of the Ghouls
 The basic plot involves the police investigating a supposed [[haunted house]]. The house is discovered to serve as headquarters for a [[confidence trickster]] who pretends to be able to contact the dead, and charges naive customers large amounts of money to allow them to speak to their deceased loved ones.<ref name="Craig" />  The movie features a prologue and a brief acting role by [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]], who also narrated Wood's ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. The prologue has Criswell rising from a [[coffin]], leaving unclear if the "metaphysical" narrator is awaking from a normal sleep, or whether he is actually a corpse returning to life. The latter implication can be seen as [[foreshadowing]] the final scenes of the film.<ref name="Craig" />  One of the opening scenes features a montage of seemingly unrelated events, which seem to feature Wood's view of the [[post-war]] era and its social problems: [[juvenile delinquency]], [[street fighting]], and [[driving under the influence]]. A memorable sequence has a car driving off a cliff and crashing. The sequence ends with the bloody corpse of the drunk driver staring blankly at the camera. According to Criswell's narration, this is a rather typical end to "a drunken holiday weekend".<ref name="Craig" /> The narrative properly begins with a teenaged couple kissing in a [[convertible]], parked at night in what is probably a [[lovers' lane]]. When the boy gets too aggressive, the girl ends the embrace with a [[Slapping (strike)|slap]] and exits the car. At this point the narrative introduces the Black Ghost which lurks in the woods near them. In short order, first the girl and then the boy are attacked by the [[undead]] creature and die. According to Criswell's narration, the two murders received press attention but were thought to be the work of a maniac.<ref name="Craig" />  In a police station of [[East Los Angeles, California]], Inspector Robbins is waiting for Detective Bradford at his office. Bradford soon arrives, dressed in a [[top hat]] and  formal evening wear. He was called to work while on his way to the [[opera]], and he protests the idea of working an unexpected assignment. But Robbins informs him that the case involves the "old house on Willows lake", which played a part in an earlier case investigated by Bradford. (This is a reference to the events of ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''). The house was destroyed by lightning, but someone rebuilt it. A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene establishes that the elderly Edwards couple had a terrifying encounter with the White Ghost by this house.<ref name="Craig" /> Having heard the story, Bradford accepts the assignment to investigate the old house. Robbins assigns Kelton to escort the Detective, despite the protests of the man that "''Monsters! Space people! Mad doctors! They didn't teach me about such things in the police academy! And yet that's all I've been assigned to since I became on active duty"''. The line is used to recall Kelton's experiences in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', and to explicitly connect this film to its predecessors.<ref name="Craig" />  Bradford drives a [[Pontiac Bonneville]] to the house and enters through an open door, to be confronted by Dr. Acula (played by [[Kenne Duncan]]). Dressed in a [[turban]] and cryptically mentioning that there are many already in the house, both living and dead, Acula is a rather strange figure. But Bradford convinces Acula that he is just another prospective client, so his entrance is accepted.<ref name="Craig" /> The narrator soon establishes that one of "the many" in the house is a remnant of its past, Lobo. A character from ''Bride'', Lobo is depicted as disfigured from the flames which once destroyed this house. Outside the house, Kelton arrives late and has brief encounters with both the Black and the White Ghost. The scene shifts to a strange [[sÃ©ance]], where Acula and his clients share the table with human skeletons.<ref name="Craig" /> A subsequent scene both confirms that Dr. Acula is a fake [[psychic]] by the name of "Karl", as Bradford suspected earlier, and reveals that the White Ghost is an actress by the name of "Sheila".<ref name="Craig" /> Her role is to scare away intruders.<ref name="Hogan">Hogan (1997), p. 233</ref><ref name="Ruffles">Ruffles (2004), p. 211</ref> She is concerned by the presence of the Black Ghost which is not part of their hoax, though the cynical Acula dismisses her fears. He doesn't believe in the supernatural.<ref name="Craig" />  Both Bradford and Kelton have strange and sometimes violent confrontations within the house, and are eventually joined by reinforcements. As their accomplices fall to the police, Karl and Sheila attempt to escape through a [[Morgue|mortuary room]]. There they are confronted by a group of undead men, including one played by Criswell. The latter is the only one of them who speaks, explaining to Karl that the supposedly "fake" psychic does have genuine powers and his [[Necromancy|necromantic]] efforts actually worked. These dead men were restored to life, if only for a few hours, but they intend to take Karl with them in their return to the grave.<ref name="Craig" /> As Karl dies, Sheila escapes the house to meet her own fate. The Black Ghost, genuinely undead, takes control of the impostor and tells her that it is time to join "the others" at the grave. As the police try to understand what happened to the deceased Karl, the narrative ends with a shot of an undead Sheila, now truly a White Ghost.<ref name="Craig" />  In a brief epilogue which also closes the frame story, the narrator returns to his coffin. Claiming that it is time for both the old dead and the new to return to their graves, he reminds the viewer that he/she too can soon join them in death.<ref name="Craig" />

Nicholas is horrified to discover his employers, the sadistic Mr and Mrs Squeers, run their [[boarding school]] like a prison and physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse their young charges on a regular basis.

Nicholas is reunited with his family, who welcome Smike as one of their own, and finds clerical employment with the friendly Cheeryble brothers. While thus employed, Nicholas makes the acquaintance of Madeline Bray, an artist who financially supports both herself and her tyrannical father, as her father gambled away his fortune and that of his late wife. Nicholas meanwhile discovers his sister Kate has been subjected to humiliating sexual attention from the lecherous Sir Mulberry Hawk, a client of their uncle, who has encouraged the man to seduce his niece in the hope that she will succumb and thus cement Hawk's business relationship with him.  Nicholas' determination to defend his sister's honor leads his uncle to vow he will destroy the young man. What ensues is a series of adventures in which the upstanding Nicholas manages to survive the schemes of his evil uncle, including an attempt to return Smike to Squeers by kidnapping him and an effort to abort Nicholas' growing relationship with Madeline by promising her father he will excuse his debts if the girl weds Hawk. Ralph's designs on Madeline are thwarted when her father dies unexpectedly. Unfortunately, Smike falls ill and soon dies. Soon after, a sinister secret Ralph has harbored for years surfaces, and it is revealed Smike was Ralph's son, whom he had thought dead.

Nizhalkuthu
 The plot is set in the 1940s in a village of [[Travancore]], [[British India]]. Kaliyappan, the last hangman of Travancore dynasty is dragging his remaining life by consuming alcohol and worshipping the Mother Goddess. The reason for this self-destruction is the remorse born out of the feeling that the last man he hanged was an innocent.  While pulling on his life by boozing, worshiping the Goddess and treating ailing people with the ash obtained by burning the hanging rope, one day the King's messenger once again arrives with the King's order of appointing him for executing a convict termed as 'a killer, proved beyond doubt'. He leaves to the jail with his Gandhian, freedom fighter son to assist him in his job.  As a tradition, the hangman has to spend the eve of the execution awake. When alcohol fails to keep Kaliyappan awake, the jailer starts telling a 'spicy tale' to keep him awake, the tale of a 13-year-old girl raped and killed by her own brother-in-law and an innocent musician boy convicted for this charge.  When Kaliyappan comes to know the condemned person he is about to hang is that very same musician boy, he breaks down. The job of executing the convict is passed on to his assistant, his son. The Gandhian, freedom fighter son completes the job. His motivations are not spelt out, but the choice of title hints that the son perhaps punishes the father by reminding him that any of his prior executions may have been a farce just like this one.  Just like the witch hunter's wife in Mahabharata, the son's sense of punishment completely ignores the innocent victim who would be executed. We are reminded that what we think of something as just may not always be so.  
Nine Lives (2002 film)
  Tim ([[Patrick Kennedy (actor)|Patrick Kennedy]]) invites eight friends of his to his Scottish mansion for a weekend celebration for his 21st birthday. Among the guests is his former college roommate Pete ([[David Nicolle (actor)|David Nicolle]]), Pete's former girlfriend Laura ([[Amelia Warner]]), her best friend Emma ([[Rosie Fellner]]), Emma's former roommate Lucy ([[Vivienne Harvey]]), Lucy's New York socialite friend Jo ([[Paris Hilton]]), Jo's Manchester boyfriend Tom ([[Lex Shrapnel]]), and fellow college friends Damien (James Schlesinger) and Andy ([[Ben Peyton]]).  During the night of a sudden snowstorm which strands everyone in for the night, Tom finds an old book behind a bookcase about a local Scottish lord, named Murray, who was put to death in 1746 during the last Scottish uprising. Upon reading the book, the spirit of Murray emerges from the book and possesses Tom, causing his eyes to turn black, and goes on a killing rampage starting with Jo whom he kills in a bathroom. Next, Tom kills Emma in her bedroom as she is preparing for bed, until he is stopped by Tim who stabs him to death. But then, Tim is possessed by Murray, continuing the killing spree.  When Lucy is stabbed and severely wounded by the possessed Tim, the five survivors hole themselves up in the parlor where they try to make sense to what is going on. While Pete tries to rationalize an explanation, Laura discovers the book that contained the evil spirit of Murray and begins to put two and two together about the possession: whenever the possessed person is killed, the spirit of Murray will pass onto whoever killed his host. Pete and Damian leave the parlor and confront the possessed Tim in the mansion cellar. In the struggle, Damian accidentally kills Tim, and in turn, gets possessed as well.  Leaving Andy behind to look after the wounded Lucy in the parlor, Laura and Pete attempt to capture the possessed Damian, only to have him slip past them when they attempt to trap him in one of the mansion's many bathrooms. The possessed Damian breaks into the parlor and attacks Andy, only to be accidentally killed by the fireplace poker Andy had earlier given to Lucy to defend herself. Realizing that she is now possessed, Andy stabs Lucy with a shard of glass, taking the spirit into himself.  When Laura is attacked and stabs the possessed Andy in self-defense, she realizes that the spirit will pass onto her, so she first pleads with Pete (who has locked himself in the parlor) to kill her before Andy dies. But when Pete is unable to, Laura makes the ultimate sacrifice of stabbing herself so the spirit will not pass onto her. Pete opens the door to prevent her from doing so, but is too late. Laura dies just before Andy expires, and thus saving Pete from being possessed as well.  By the next morning, Pete finds himself the sole survivor of the massacre and after finding the cursed book, he burns it to ensure that nobody else will ever read it and restart the cycle ever again. Pete also realizes as the lone Scot of the group, he was the only one Murray ever intended to spare, albeit alone and emotionally scarred.

Nothing So Strange
  At the very beginning of the film, Bill Gates (played by Gates double Steve Sires) walks onto the stage of the pavilion in [[MacArthur Park]], [[Los Angeles, California]] on Thursday, December 2, 1999, to give a check for one million dollars to "Literacy For Life" as part of the "Bill Gates Foundation." (The filmmakers intentionally avoided mentioning Gates' family members in the film; thus, they refrain from naming the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]].) Upon reaching the stage, Gates is shot dead by a sniper, first in the right shoulder, then the head.  While chasing after the unknown sniper through an abandoned building, a rookie police officer fatally shoots Alek J. Hidell (a known alias of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]] [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|killer]] [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]), a minor anti-establishment figure and minority, in the head. Hiddell is named as the assassin of Gates, a report to this effect is filed by [[district attorney]] [[Gil Garcetti]], and the case is closed.  Beyond this point, which occurs before the opening credits are finished, Gates does not reappear and is mentioned only as a wealthy, successful man and the subject of the assassination being investigated. The word "[[Microsoft]]" barely makes an appearance in the film, and Gates is portrayed as a well-liked and missed public figure; a very passing mention is made of the existence of anti-Gates sentiment.  However, a group of people dissatisfied with the official version of events organizes into the activist group Citizens for Truth, and sets out to examine the available evidence of the assassination. The organization uncovers numerous details that create reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Hiddell in the assassination, and the possibility that the real assassin is still at large.  The [[mockumentary]] follows the organization as they grow in numbers, political prominence, and progress in their investigative efforts. The organization's success reaches a climax at their first annual convention, which is followed by their rapid drop in credibility and visibility to become effectively irrelevant.

He quickly discovers that during his absence his family has moved without telling him. Oblivious to society's rules, Jong-du again ends up in police custody for non-payment of a restaurant bill. He is bailed out by his younger brother Jong-sae ([[Ryoo Seung-wan]]) and reunited with his estranged family who reluctantly take him back in. Slightly mentally disabled and an incurable social misfit, Jong-du is hired as a delivery boy for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant on the recommendation of his older brother Jong-il ([[Ahn Nae-sang]]).  In an awkward attempt at reconciliation, Jong-du seeks out the family of the man killed in the hit-and-run accident. He finds the man's son, Han Sang-shik ([[Son Byong-ho]]), in the process of moving out of the apartment. Sang-shik is leaving his [[cerebral palsy]]-stricken sister Gong-ju ([[Moon So-ri]]) behind to be cared for by the neighbors, while he uses her disability status to get a better and subsidized apartment where he pretends she is living. The family is horrified at Jong-du's intrusion and he is told to leave, but not before he has become intrigued by Gong-ju.  Jong-du decides to woo her by sending flowers and, while spying on Gong-ju's apartment, discovers where her house keys are hidden. Later, he lets himself in at a time when he knows she is alone. Trying to reassure and pacify the startled Gong-ju, he loses control and starts to impose himself on the helpless young woman, stopping only when she faints. In classic Jong-du fashion, he impulsively leaves his phone number in her room before he departs so that Gong-ju would know where to find him.  Fired from his delivery job after crashing the scooter, Jong-du is given the opportunity to work in his brother's auto repair shop, where he also sleeps at night. A couple of days later to his surprise and delight, Gong-ju calls him in the middle of night.  After a number of secret encounters and outings, several times nearly being discovered by Jong-du's brother or the neighbors, the two misfits become inseparable. Uninhibited and wanting to share her feelings with Jong-du, Gong-ju tells him how frightened she is of a shadow from a tree outside of her window that reflects on a picture hanging in her room. In his protective yet comforting manner, Jong-du promises Gong-ju that she no longer has to be afraid because he will make the shadows disappear by magic.  On their adventures outside of the apartment, the couple is faced with the harsh reality of a discriminating society but is comforted by the innocent sanctity of their shared love. When Jong-du naively brings Gong-ju to his motherâs birthday celebration, tempers flare, and viewers learn that his older brother was the actual culprit of the hit-and-run, though his family was glad when Jong-du volunteered to go to jail in his place. The last thing Jong-du's brother wants is for him to be socializing with a family member of the victim.  Wanting to feel and be treated like a woman, Gong-ju invites Jong-du back to her apartment where they make love. When her brother arrives on a surprise visit, chaos erupts. Jong-du is arrested and charged with raping a helpless, handicapped woman. Gong-ju's family makes sure that no one hears her side of the story. But in one final burst of passion, Jong-du escapes from the police and rushes to Gong-ju's apartment. The couple manages to reaffirm their love as Jong-du fulfills his promise of making the shadows disappear, by climbing the tree adjacent to her apartment and cutting the branches off, before falling and being hauled off to prison. In the last scene Gong-ju is cleaning her apartment alone, while Jong-du's voice is heard reading a letter to her, promising to come back when he is released.

Several hours later and with no sign of any help forthcoming, the occupants are resigned to dying. Michael, much to the chagrin of Stuart, makes a smutty, suggestive remark to Melanie. Ever the loyal manager, Stuart is quick to defend the young woman, only to reveal his troubled and disturbing past, involving several incidents of wearing his dead mother's underwear to school and a criminal conviction for horse buggery.

Orange County (film)
  Shaun Brumder ([[Colin Hanks]]) is a teenager from affluent [[Orange County, California]]. Although bright and intelligent, he has very little interest in education or studying, instead trying to lead a carefree [[Southern California|SoCal]] lifestyle of [[surfing]], drinking, and partying. A turning point comes when Shaun's best friend Lonny ([[Bret Harrison]]) is killed in a surfing accident, causing Shaun to rethink his own life. One day, he finds a novel on the beach by the author Marcus Skinner, which quickly inspires him to become a writer. Upon learning that Skinner is an English professor at [[Stanford University]], Shaun makes it his goal to attend Stanford and study under him.   Shaun dramatically improves himself academically, obtaining high grades and [[SAT]] scores as well as becoming the president of his graduating class. Following the advice of his guidance counselor, Ms. Cobb ([[Lily Tomlin]]), Shaun applies only to Stanford. This severely backfires as Shaun later finds out that he is rejected from Stanford, because Ms. Cobb mixed up his [[transcript (education)|academic transcript]] with that of a much less intelligent student. Shaun then reaches out to his wealthy father Bud ([[John Lithgow]]), who had left his wife and family to marry a much younger woman ([[Leslie Mann]]), pleading him to donate money to Stanford in order to increase his chances of being accepted. Bud, however, disapproves of Shaun's dream of being a writer and refuses. In an attempt to help him, Shaun's girlfriend Ashley ([[Schuyler Fisk]]) successfully convinces her friend Tanya ([[Carly Pope]]) to allow Shaun to be interviewed at his home by Tanya's grandfather, a Stanford board member, so Shaun can explain his situation. Unfortunately, the antics displayed during the interview by his dysfunctional family members, including his [[alcoholic]], emotionally fragile mother Cindy ([[Catherine O'Hara]]) and his dim-witted [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]] brother Lance ([[Jack Black]]), cause Shaun's interviewers to storm out in anger and disgust.  In a last-ditch effort to get him accepted, Ashley and Lance convince Shaun to drive to [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] and plead his case directly to Stanford Admissions Director Don Durkett ([[Harold Ramis]]).  By the time the trio arrive on campus, the admissions building is already closed. While Lance distracts (and seduces) the secretary on duty, Shaun and Ashley steal the address to Durkett's house. They arrive at his home, where Shaun shows him his real transcript. Although impressed with Shaun's credentials, Durkett is reluctant to admit him, as it is already very late in the admissions process. After much groveling, Shaun finally convinces Durkett to give it a second thought. Disaster strikes again, however, when Ashley drugs Durkett by accident with Lance's ecstasy, thereby causing Durkett to become [[Substance intoxication|high]]. When Shaun and Ashley arrive at the Admissions Building, they find it engulfed in flames, caused by Lance starting a fire while he was seducing the receptionist; Lance is now wanted for arson. They abandon Durkett and flee the scene to avoid being arrested.  Ashley finally becomes frustrated with Shaun's obsession of only getting into Stanford, and points out that his attending would mean they would be separated, thus ending their relationship. She then angrily leaves Shaun on his own. Depressed, Shaun wanders the campus and meets a female student who invites him to a [[fraternities and sororities|frat party]]. There, he witnesses the behavior of the Stanford [[coed]]s and is disappointed to learn that they are just as vapid and ditzy as the girls he knew from Orange County. After leaving with a more cynical view of college, Shaun, by chance, runs into Professor Skinner ([[Kevin Kline]]) and is invited to his office to chat. Skinner is amused with Shaun's belief that he must study and work in a highly intelligent environment in order to become successful, pointing out that many famous authors such as [[James Joyce]] and [[William Faulkner]] grew up in places that were not intellectually stimulating, but still became great writers. Having an epiphany, Shaun realizes his previous misguided intentions and seeks out Ashley to apologize to her. After catching up with her, the two also pick up Lance (who is still hiding from the police) and drive home.  Back in Orange County, Shaun's parents seek out each other to determine how to deal with Shaun's problem.  They end up reconciling, realizing that they are much happier together than with their respective new spouses. They also conclude that they have not been very good parents to Shaun and, to make amends, Bud donates enough money to Stanford for the construction of a brand new Admissions Building. This action gets Shaun accepted into Stanford. Although Shaun is initially ecstatic, he then remembers what both Ashley and Professor Skinner had told him.  Shaun finally decides to stay in Orange County with Ashley and his family because he loves them too much to leave them, and he is now able to view living in Orange County as a positive influence for his writing career, rather than a detriment. The film ends with Shaun going surfing with his friends again for the first time since Lonny's death.

While inspecting his photos for the last time, Sy discovers that Will Yorkin ([[Michael Vartan]]) is having an [[extramarital affair]], and his idyllic conception of the Yorkins as the perfect family is shattered. Sy surreptitiously places the photos of Will and his mistress, Maya Burson ([[Erin Daniels]]), into a packet of photos that Nina was scheduled to pick up.   In retaliation, Sy follows and takes pictures, [[paparazzi]] style, of Bill's young daughter, and sends them to Bill as a threat. Yoshi, another SavMart employee, discovers the pictures and turns them over to Bill, leading to a police investigation against Sy.  While detectives Van Der Zee ([[Eriq La Salle]]) and Outerbridge ([[Clark Gregg]]) discover Sy's obsession, Sy confronts Will and Maya during a rendezvous in their hotel room. Armed with a knife and a camera, Sy forces the lovers to pose naked in sexual positions while he takes pictures. After the confrontation, Sy sees that the police have arrived at the hotel and he escapes through an emergency exit. The exit door trips an alarm and Van Der Zee pursues him while Outerbridge discovers Will and Maya, physically unharmed but deeply traumatized. The police apprehend Sy in the parking garage. Upon being arrested, Sy claims, "I just took pictures."  Van Der Zee asks Sy why he terrorized the Yorkins. Sy says that he can tell Van Der Zee is a good father who would never take "disgusting, sick, degrading pictures" of his children, suggesting that Sy's own father exploited him for [[child pornography]]. Sy then asks for the pictures that he took at the hotel, which Van Der Zee described as "evidence." They appear to be only shots of objects and furnishings of a hotel room. The film closes with an imagined family picture of the Yorkins with Will's arm around a smiling Sy.

The Original Latin Kings of Comedy
 The show begins with a recording of [[lowrider]] cars decorated with the common "[[Cholo]]" themes including large paintings of [[The Virgin Mary]] and extremely detailed wall painting in the hoods and roofs of the car. The cars previously mentioned are heading to the theater in "El Paso, Texas" where The Original Latin Kings of Comedy are giving their show.  The next scene shows an auditorium full of people awaiting for the stand up comedians to appear. After that, Cheech Marin appears in the stage and greets the audience, including the ones who couldn't get in to the show because "they did not buy tickets". Marin begins with light jokes to later introduce the first big comedian of the night: Joey Medina.  Medina goes into stage and greets all the people and begins to joke about the oddities of El Paso, which includes the children who sell chewing-gum, the Mexican immigration checking Latinos out, and that you can, supposedly, drink all night in Mexico with just 5 Dollars. The next subject of fun that Medina starts to talk about is the races, he compares races and what positive and negative things they do. He finally ends up with jokes about Men and Women.  As Joey Medina walked out the stage, Cheech Marin appears again releasing some jokes to immediately after introduce Alex Reymundo. Reymundo's first subject is couples and genders and the differences in their performing in society. He continues to talk about the typical Mexican father and the myth that Mexicans are lazy.  When Alex Reymundo walked out the stage being cheered by the public, Marin walks again into stage to continue with his simple jokes and introduce the third comedian of the night: George Lopez.  Lopez began joking pretending that he was using a microphone with translator and when he spoke in English he was very polite but in Spanish he was cursing Americans. As he continued the main theme of the jokes was the Mexican living inside the family and friend circles. The main point was that Mexicans are ruled by tradition of not being happy to ever have a casual meeting with anyone and that we can be very negative when it comes to some subjects. George Lopez was one of the most applauded comedians.  As Cheech Marin walked again for a last time again he tells again of his jokes and introduce to the "chief" of the show and the most awaited comedian: Paul Rodriguez.  Paul Rodriguez goes into scene talking about the weather in El Paso, to later compare it with Chicago and how it affects mainly men. He continues to joke about his family that was composed of 12 brothers and sisters plus their parents.   As the show continues, he explains that the name of place, Payaso CafÃ©, is a tribute to his mother as she always reprimanded him for "running around and telling jokes" and that it was not going to take him anywhere in life. He stopped so people could realize that he became a successful comedian, and later said that she doesn't says that anymore and she only asks "Mijo, no tienes otro thousand?" ("Son, don't you have another thousand (dollars)?").   He ended up with a joke about him washing his father cars with a feminine towel, because he never was told anything about sex, because Mexican parents don't teach their children about it. The main point was that her sister was very worried 28 days later after he washed the car, and approached to her mother to say that she got the "pussy green", and her mother asking that why was that and that if she had been eating too much "Guacamole". The last line is her sister saying after her mom asked if it hurt. "No it doesn't really hurts, and you know the hair is really shiny". Paul closed the show with that and the people stood to cheer him.

His young son, Benjo ([[Thomas Curtis (actor)|Thomas Curtis]]) wants to go with him, but Ben tells him to stay home, "to protect your mother" - his wife, Rebecca ([[Naomi Watts]]).  As Yoder is pulling a rescued sheep from the river, he happens upon two men cutting a fence where the rest of the flock are stabled, henchmen of ruthless cattle baron Fergus Hunter ([[John Noble]]). An argument ensues between Yoder and the henchmen about whether or not the land is "open range" or "legally homesteaded". Using the rope still tied around his waist from rescuing the stray sheep, Yoder winds up being dragged several feet by his horse, until he finally manages to cut himself free with a small knife. He angrily insists to Fergus Hunter to get off his land; "I won't sell." Hunter retorts, "No, I guess not...but your widow will." With tears in his eyes, Ben Yoder drops his knife, refusing to fight back against the men he knows are going to kill him. A few hours later, Rebecca and Benjo find him hanging from a large tree; this has an incredibly traumatizing effect on the little boy.  At the Yoder homestead, the religious community they belong to - a group resembling the [[Amish]] that refer to themselves as the "Plain People" - are gathered. The town doctor, Lucas Henry ([[David Carradine]]), offers Mrs. Yoder a pill of some sort, but one of the men, Noah Weaver ([[Keith Carradine]]) responds coldly, "She does not need your pills, doctor. She will pray." Meanwhile, members of Rebecca's family - including her father, who leads the church - are frustrated that the sheriff and his men refuse to do anything about Ben Yoder's murder, other than have Hunter's men fix the fence they originally cut.  Several months pass by, and winter arrives. Rebecca and Benjo manage the homestead on their own; the latter has almost stopped speaking entirely since he found his father dead. However, he quietly alerts his mother when a wounded man approaches them, staggering through the snow. When he passes out in front of them, Rebecca sends her son into town to fetch Doc Henry, urging him to communicate however necessary to get the doctor to come out to their house. As Benjo hurries to town, Rebecca drags the unconscious man back into her home and begins disarming him, her alarm growing as she finds more and more guns on his person.  Wounded outlaw Johnny Gault (Tim Daly) is given refuge by widowed sheep farmer Rebecca Yoder. This puts Rebecca on the outs with her own people. They incur the wrath of a ruthless cattle baron who wants the land of the religious group.<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-outsider-v276077</ref>  The two enter into a relationship which is forbidden since he is an "outsider" from their religion and way of life. She is shunned from the fold until she is ready to confess her sins from this illicit union and be forgiven.  She decides she must go back to her old way of living. When the time comes for her to do so, she is not able to walk away from her new life with Johnny.  She leaves the meeting that had been set up and runs back to Johnny.    In an attempt to help Johnny in a shoot out, during which Johnny kills also the cattle baron, Rebecca is hit by an enemy's bullet.

 A secret agent is about to face her most dangerous mission yet.  
Panic Room
  Recently divorced Meg Altman, and her eleven-year old daughter, Sarah, move into a four-story [[brownstone]] on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[New York City]]. The house's previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, installed a "[[safe room|panic room]]" to protect the house's occupants from intruders. The room is protected by concrete and steel on all sides, a thick steel door, and an extensive security system with multiple [[surveillance cameras]], a public announcement system, and a separate phone line. On the night the two move into the home, it is broken into by Junior, the previous owner's grandson; Burnham, an employee of the residence's security company; and Raoul, a gunman recruited by Junior. The three intruders are after $3 million in [[bearer bond]]s, which are locked inside a floor safe in the panic room.  Discovering that the Altmans have moved in earlier than expected, Junior convinces a reluctant Burnham, who had assumed the house was unoccupied until he had noticed a glowing night light, to continue with their heist. As they begin the [[robbery]], Meg wakes up and happens to see the intruders on the video monitors in the panic room. Before the three can reach them, Meg and Sarah run into the panic room and lock the door. They are unable to use the dedicated phone in the room, which was never hooked up by Meg. Intending to force the two out of the room, Burnham introduces propane gas into the room's air vents. Raoul, in conflict with Burnham and Junior, dangerously increases the amount of gas. Unable to seal the vents, Meg ignites the gas, while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets, causing an explosion which vents into the room outside and causes a fire, injuring Junior.  The Altmans make several attempts to call for help, including signaling a neighbor with a flashlight through the opening of a ventilation pipe, but the neighbor ignores it. Meg then taps into the main telephone line and gets through to her ex-husband Stephen, before the burglars cut them off.  All attempts to get into the room fail.  Junior lets slip that there is much more money in the safe than he let on, and gives up on the robbery. About to leave the house, he is shot dead by Raoul, who then forces Burnham, at gunpoint, to finish the robbery. Stephen arrives at the home and is taken hostage by Burnham and Raoul&mdash;who severely beats him. Sarah, who has [[diabetes]], suffers a  seizure. Her emergency [[glucagon]] syringe is in a refrigerator outside the panic room. Raoul dons an unconscious Stephenâs trench coat to trick Meg into momentarily leaving the panic room. Burnham enters and finds Sarah motionless on the floor. After retrieving the glucagon syringe, Meg struggles briefly with Raoul, who is thrown into the panic room, his gun knocked out of his hand. As Meg throws the syringe into the panic room, Burnham frantically locks himself, Raoul, and Sarah inside, crushing Raoul's hand in the sliding steel door. Meg, who now has the gun, begs the two intruders over the PA system to give Sarah the injection. Burnham, who has shown no interest in hurting either Meg or Sarah, injects Sarah. While doing so, he tells Sarah he did not want this, and the only reason he agreed to participate was to give his own child a better life. Sarah thanks him for the injection and he tells Meg that Sarah is now alright.  Having earlier received a call from Stephen, two policemen arrive, which prompts Raoul to threaten Sarah's life. Knowing the danger to her daughter, Meg lies to the officers and they leave. Burnham opens the safe and finds $22 million in bearer bonds inside. As the robbers attempt to leave, using Sarah as a hostage, Meg hits Raoul with a sledgehammer and Burnham flees. After a badly injured Stephen shoots at Raoul and misses, Raoul disables him and prepares to kill Meg with the sledgehammer, but Burnham, hearing Sarah's screams of pain, returns to the house and shoots Raoul dead, saying, "You'll be okay now,â to Meg and her daughter before leaving. The police, alerted by Meg's suspicious behavior earlier, arrive in force and capture Burnham, who lets the bearer bonds go and they fly away with the wind.  Later, Meg and Sarah, having recovered from their harrowing experience, begin searching the newspaper for a new home.  
Paid in Full (2002 film)
 Ace ([[Wood Harris]]) is a young man from [[Harlem]] stuck in a dead end job at a dry cleaning shop. His sister's boyfriend, Calvin (Kevin Carroll), is a local cocaine dealer who tries to lure Ace into the drug trade with promises of fast money and women. Ace resists Calvin's temptations, not caring for his unsophisticated ways. Likewise, Ace's close friend Mitch ([[Mekhi Phifer]]) is a flashy, popular drug dealer who exposes Ace to drug dealing lifestyle. When Calvin gets arrested on drug charges, Ace ends up filling his position on the street. This happens after Ace starts getting cocaine from Lulu, one of the customers at the dry cleaners shop. Lulu has a top-quality supply of cocaine which Ace sells on the street at a cheap price, quickly luring away customers from other drug dealers. Ace operates on the mantra that there is plenty of money to go around and that everyone can "live and maintain." While Ace is building up his drug operation, Mitch is arrested for killing a stickup man who robbed one of his workers. When a fight breaks out between Mitch and another inmate, Mitch is aided by East Harlem inmate Rico ([[Cam'ron]]) who impresses Mitch by his ferocity and show of solidarity.  Mitch is able to beat his murder charge and both him and Rico join Ace's drug empire. The trio become extremely wealthy, buying foreign cars, jewelery and expensive champagne. Ace continues to more or less stay behind the scenes, while Mitch returns to his flamboyant lifestyle as a popular hustler. Rico is a ruthless enforcer who worries Ace with his overzealous behavior and high-profile lifestyle. When Calvin is released from prison, he tries to regain his position of power on the streets. Ace gives him a job overseeing his old drug spot, but Calvin feels dissatisfied with his menial position. When Ace refuses to let Calvin run his old block, Calvin retaliates by attempting to rob Ace at his Aunt June's ([[Elise Neal]]) apartment, holding June and Dora hostage. When Ace is unable to open the safe, June and Dora are executed by Calvin as another associate shoots Ace in the head, leaving him for dead. Despite his wounds, Ace survives as his baby is born around the same time. Feeling the physical and psychological effects of the shooting, Ace decides to quit the drug trade. Rico tries to assuage Ace's concerns by admitting to killing Calvin in retaliation (a flashback shows Rico on a motorbike executing Calvin in his car), as a show of strength of the organization to potential enemies. Ace strongly disagrees with Rico's decision. Mitch understands Ace's perspective that the drug game does not reciprocate any love or generosity. Mitch decides to stay in the drug game because he loves the hustle, comparing himself to professional basketball players that continue to chase glory despite having enough money to retire. Ace eventually decides to let Mitch and Rico take over in his place, vowing to introduce them to the connect.  While Ace is recovering, Mitch's kid brother Sonny is kidnapped for ransom. Mitch goes to Ace for help, as Ace provides him with enough cocaine to pay Sonny's ransom and allow Mitch and Rico to go back to business as usual on the streets. When Ace comes home, he finds his girlfriend Keisha ([[Regina Hall]]) in tears. Fearing the worst, Ace believes that Sonny was killed; Keisha informs Ace that it was actually Mitch who was killed. Ace thinks back to a conversation with Mitch explaining that Mitch was supposed to meet up with Rico. A flashback shows Mitch reaching out to Rico for help with Sonny; however, Rico double-crosses Mitch and fatally shoots him twice before executing him with a final shot to the head. Ace eventually meets up with Rico to fine out about Mitch. Rico lies to Ace about his whereabouts that night, not knowing that Mitch had told Ace they were going to meet up the night of his death. Ace settles the issue by giving him the contact to a pair of undercover FBI agents Ace had spoken to and avoided previously.  Rico is arrested and is last seen in custody giving up information on his out-of-town drug connections in [[Washington D.C.]] in order to avoid a 25-to-life sentence. He refuses to inform on anyone in Harlem, intending on reclaiming his position when he is eventually released from prison. Sonny's kidnapping and subsequent murder were orchestrated by his own uncle who resented Mitch for not providing him with money and for kicking him out of his family's apartment. Ace manages to retreat from the criminal underworld and makes a new life for himself and his family using diamonds that he had previously found in Lulu's apartment after his death.

Ram and Mythili stop the hijacking and save the passengers. Soon after, they fall in love and get married. Ram's four closest friends, Ayyapan Nair, Vendantham Iyer, Ganesh Hegde and Hanumant Reddy attend the wedding.  After marriage, Ram quits his playboy character and remains faithful to Mythili. One day, when Ram prevents Hegde's ex-girlfriend, Nirmala, from committing suicide, Mythili misinterprets the situation. She presumes that he is having an affair with her and leaves him to be with her parents. Further misunderstanding occurs when he sets out to meet Mythili, drunk, in the middle of the night and enters the wrong house.  To take his mind off Mythili for a while, Ram's four friends drive him down to [[Bangalore]] and rent a room to hire [[call girl]] Maragathavalli alias Maggie. Ram, who is still not able to forget Mythili and does not wish to betray her, gets into a fight with Maggie. To salvage the situation, Iyer hurries back to Maggie's room, only to find Maggie dead. Panicking, Nair, Iyer, Hegde and Reddy decide to discreetly dispose of the body in spite of Ram's pleas to call the police. They manage to roll the body in a blanket, dispose it in a dry river and drive back to Chennai to return to their normal lives.  Ram discovers a cache of diamonds inside Maggie's mobile phone. He does not report about it to the police, fearing he would be arrested for murdering Maggie, which he did not commit. A few days after, the friends get very nervous when they learn of a news article regarding the discovery of a dead body in the same area where they disposed Maggie's body. At that time, the wives of Ram's four friends plan to unite Ram and Mythili by holding a party on the traditional festival of [[Ugadi]]. The wives invite Mythili to the party to be reunited with Ram.  At the party, the supposedly-dead Maggie appears, demanding her diamonds back. Maggie then reveals the truth behind her death. The diamonds belong to a smuggler, and that she stole it from him for her own personal gain. She chose to merely fake her death as she realised that the diamonds would be temporarily safe in Ram's possession. She also blackmails Ram that she would reveal about their rendezvous in Bangalore to Mythili if he does not give the diamonds back. The smuggler then arrives and kidnaps Maggie, Ram and his friends. Mythili spots Ram and Maggie together. She again believes that Ram has not changed his ways. Mythili, along with an undercover police inspector, follows them.  While the smuggler demands his diamonds back, Mythili appears. Upon seeing Ram and Maggie together, she believes that Ram is having an affair with Maggie in front of his friends and the smuggler instead of believing that Ram, Maggie and his friends are kidnapped. She swallows some sleeping pills, which turns out to be where Ram hid the diamonds. Mythili decides to commit suicide and runs away. Ram and his friends save her and help the undercover police inspector arrest Maggie and the smuggler. Mythili, on being informed by Ram of all that happened, promises to reform her suspicious ways. The two then reunite.

Philanthropy (film)
 Ovidiu Gorea is a jaded, mid-40s, high-school teacher and novice writer, still living with his parents. He has just published a collection of short stories called 'Nobody Dies For Free', that the bookstores reject because no one buys it.  The high school principal asks him to deal with a problem-student, Robert. Ovidiu has Robert call one of his parents for talks, but the boy sends his sister, Diana, a gorgeous teenager, instead. Ovidiu is smitten. He convinces Diana to go on a date with him, but what he thinks will be a quiet evening over coffee turns into a bar-hopping binge that leaves him nearly broke.  One night, he meets a shabby-looking drunk beggar who offers to recite poems in exchange for vodka. The two start talking and Ovidiu learns that the guy makes two or three times more money than him in a month out of this. He asks for an explanation and the beggar refers him to the Filantropica Foundation.  Located in a desolate basement, the Filantropica Foundation is actually the lair of Bucharest's [[beggar]]s' leader, Pavel PuiuÅ£. A former convict, he realized that begging leads nowhere "unless there is a touching story behind the hand that begs", so he created an organized network of beggars, each with an invented, tear-jerking, background story that yields millions. PuiuÅ£ listens to Ovidiu's story and thinks he is perfect for his new "project".  He pairs Ovidiu with Miruna, his secretary, and sends them to high-profile restaurants, where, in collusion with a waiter, they pose as a couple of poor teachers celebrating their wedding anniversary who find, at the end of their dinner, that they don't have enough money to cover the check; Ovidiu is responsible with making a scene that would strike a chord with one of the rich people present, who would pick up their check out of pity; later, out in the back, Ovidiu, Miruna and the waiter would split the money.  After several such performances, Ovidiu makes enough money to impress the material Diana. He rents a roadster, takes her to lakeshore clubs, his sole purpose being sleeping with her. The reluctant PuiuÅ£ even gives him access to the foundation's "show-house" (a day-rental house meant to impress third parties), but a poorly timed customer call gives Ovidiu's cover away and an angry Diana leaves him.  Meanwhile, Miruna falls for her partner in crime and is angry that he keeps "bitching" about that "bimbo", instead of going for a "real woman". She manages to get him into her bed and Ovidiu is surprised to find out she is a former prostitute.  The scam goes terribly wrong when Ovidiu and Miruna go to a [[karaoke]] bar, where their scene has no effect and the waiter, who is not in on it, takes Ovidiu to the back and beats him. PuiuÅ£ then unveils the grand purpose of his "project": he sets the unsuspecting Ovidiu to appear with Miruna "in character" on a popular TV night show and tell the karaoke bar beating story; he then calls, pretends of being revolted and announces that his foundation has opened an account for people who want to offer money for the "poor teachers".  Meanwhile, in school, Ovidiu is visited by two thugs who ask him about Robert, who owes $3,000 to "a person" and who only has two days to make good. Ovidiu withdraws the amount from the foundation's account, calls Diana and gives her the money for her brother. She pretends being impressed and teases Ovidiu by telling him to visit her later that night. Naturally, she deceives him once more, by leaving the city in the afternoon. To top it off, Ovidiu finds Robert in a park, turned into a beggar, who tells him that "Diana" was not his sister, just some "chick".  Now $3,000 short, Ovidiu goes home to find the media and PuiuÅ£ claiming he has just won the big prize in the lottery. It is again one of PuiuÅ£'s scams, who reminds Ovidiu he "has him" because of the $3,000. Ovidiu accepts his fate and Miruna as his wife.  The movie has an ominous ending, with PuiuÅ£ finding Robert in the street, convincing him to join his operation and then [[breaking the fourth wall]]: "Do you feel pity for this piece of trash? Hah! Got your money!".

The Powerpuff Girls Movie
 [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Professor Utonium|Professor Utonium]] creates a mixture of [[What Are Little Boys Made Of?|sugar, spice, and everything nice]] in hope of producing the "perfect little girl" to improve Townsville, a city plagued by [[crime]] and injustice. He is shoved by his laboratory assistant, the destructive [[chimpanzee]] [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Mojo Jojo|Jojo]], causing him to accidentally break and spill a flask of Chemical X into the concoction, which explodes in Jojo's face. The experiment is successful, producing three little girls whom the Professor names [[Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup]]. He also discovers that the girls have gained [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] from the added Chemical X. Despite the girls' recklessness with their powers, they all immediately grow to love each other as a family.  During their first day of school, the girls learn about the game [[Tag (game)|tag]] and begin to play among themselves, which quickly grows destructive once they use their powers. The girls take their game downtown, accidentally causing massive damage to the city until the Professor calms them down. The next day, the girls are treated as outcasts by the citizens of Townsville as a result of the destruction they have caused, and the Professor is arrested for creating the girls. Realizing that using their powers again will only anger the townspeople more, the girls try to make their way home from school on foot. They become lost in an alleyway and are ambushed by the [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Gangreen Gang|Gangreen Gang]], only to be rescued by Jojo, whose brain has been mutated by the Chemical X explosion, giving him [[superintelligence]].  Planning control of the city, Jojo gains the girls' sympathy by saying he is also hated for his powers. Jojo convinces the girls to help him build a laboratory and machine powered by Chemical X, which he claims will earn them the affections of the city. Jojo rewards the girls with a trip to the local zoo, where he secretly implants small transportation devices on all the primates there. That night, Jojo transports the primates into his lab and uses his new machine to inject them with Chemical X, turning them into evil mutant primates like himself. The next morning, after the Professor is released from prison, the girls show him all the "good" they have done, only to discover the city under attack by the primates. Jojo, renaming himself Mojo Jojo, publicly announces the girls as his assistants, which further damages their reputation and even turns the distraught Professor against them. Dejected, the girls exile themselves to an asteroid in outer space.  Mojo Jojo announces his intention to rule the planet, but becomes frustrated when his minions begin concocting their own plans to terrorize the people of Townsville. Overhearing the turmoil from space, the girls return to Earth and rescue the citizens, realizing they can use their powers to fight the primates. With his army defeated, Mojo injects himself with Chemical X and grows into a giant monster, overpowering the girls after an intense battle. Rejecting Mojo's offer of alliance against the people who have shunned them, the girls push him off a decrepit skyscraper as soon as the Professor arrives with an antidote for Chemical X to help the girls. Mojo lands on the Antidote X, which shrinks him down to his original size, battered and defeated.  The girls consider using the Antidote X to erase their powers, thinking they would be accepted as normal girls. The people of Townsville protest, apologizing for misjudging the girls and thanking them for their heroic deeds. At the insistence of the [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#The Mayor of Townsville|Mayor]], the girls agree to use their powers to defend Townsville with the Professor's permission, becoming the city's beloved crime-fighting superhero team who are dubbed "the Powerpuff Girls".  
PokÃ©mon Heroes
 The film is set in the [[Venice|Venetian]]-esque city of Alto Mare, protected by the dragon siblings [[Latias and Latios]]. Their father, also a Latios, is said to have saved the city from an evil PokÃ©mon Trainer and their [[Kabutops]] and [[List of generation I PokÃ©mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] whilst transforming the city's streets into canals. The citizens built the Defence Mechanism of Alto Mare (or âD.M.A.â for short) to protect the city if necessary, but have never had to use it. The father Latios died, leaving behind the Soul Dew, said to contain his own soul and can power the D.M.A.  In the present day, [[Team Rocket]] agents Annie and Oakley acquire a book detailing the history of Alto Mare, plotting to control the D.M.A. Ash, [[Misty (PokÃ©mon)|Misty]], and [[Brock (PokÃ©mon)|Brock]] are touring by and see an invisible Latias. Annie and Oakley stalk Latias, who disguises herself as a human girl, trying to capture her using their [[Espeon]] and [[Ariados]]. Ash and Pikachu come to the rescue, guiding Latias to safety but she vanishes when Ashâs back is turned.  Visiting the museum, the trio meet the curator Lorenzo who details Alto Mareâs history, the D.M.A., and the fossilized PokÃ©mon on display. Ash spots a girl, Bianca, who resembles Latiasâ disguise, and chases her across the city, but she does not recognise him. Latias herself appears, guiding Ash and Pikachu to a hidden garden where she and Latios live, protected by Lorenzo and Bianca, his granddaughter. While Pikachu plays with Latias and Latios, Lorenzo shows Ash the Soul Dew, unaware that Annie and Oakleyâs [[UAV|drone]] has infiltrated the sanctuary.  That night, Annie and Oakley sneak into the garden, successfully capturing Latios and the Soul Dew, but Latias escapes. Bianca and Lorenzo attempt to stop the thieves from using the D.M.A. but are captured, the Soul Dew and Latios are used to power the machine. Latias goes to Ash for help, with Latiosâ âSight Sharingâ ability allowing them to witness the events in the museum. Oakley becomes power hungry, using the D.M.A. to resurrect Kabutops and Aerodactyl, and initiates a citywide lockdown to prevent interference. Ash, Pikachu and Latias evade the lockdown, racing to the museum while being pursued by the fossilised PokÃ©mon.  Oakley tries to drown Ash, Pikachu and Latias, but the latterâs psychic powers cause the D.M.A. to go out of control. Reaching the museum, the trio rescue Latios and shut down the machine. However, Annie tries to take the blackened Soul Dew, which shatters, causing all of the cityâs water to flow out and return as a tidal wave. Latias and Latios combine their powers to stop the wave, Latios giving his life in the process. Kabutops and Aerodactyl perish again, while Annie and Oakley remain trapped in the D.M.A..  Ash and friends find Latias, realising Latios has died, but they share one last vision as he passes away. Several days later, Ash, Misty and Brock get ready to leave Alto Mare, saying goodbye to Lorenzo, but Bianca does not appear. On their way out of the city, they spot Bianca on the docks but she isn't wearing her hat (the usual difference between Bianca and Latias). The girl gives Ash a sketch of him and Pikachu, kisses him on the cheek, and leaves without saying a word. Whether the girl was Bianca or Latias is left to the viewer.  
Poolhall Junkies
 Most of the film takes place in a [[pool hall]] run by Nick (Rod Steiger). Obsessed by the world of pool, Johnny (Mars Callahan) could be one of the best. But his mentor Joe (Chazz Palminteri), a shady , trains Johnny as a [[Hustling|hustler]], and decides how and who Johnny plays. Unbeknownst to Johnny, Joe has been holding him back from his dream: playing in the legitimate pro tour.  When Johnny finally learns that Joe intercepted and threw away an invitation for Johnny to join the pro tour, he breaks from Joe, [[Match fixing|throwing a game]] with a large .  Losing both that stake money and his hustler income source sparks Joe to violence, and he breaks Johnny's  hand outside the pool hall (an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to a similar scene in the classic pool film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'').  Joe is later beaten up by some of Johnny's friends as a warning to leave him alone.  After an ultimatum from his girlfriend Tara (Alison Eastwood), Johnny largely leaves the world of pool hustling, and finally commits to a "real" job in the construction business, but is soon miserable there. He finds himself spending most of his time with his younger brother Danny (Michael Rosenbaum), a musician with aspirations of following in Johnny's hustler footsteps, despite Johnny's discouragement of this path.  Johnny meets Tara's wealthy uncle, Mike (Christopher Walken); he and Johnny hustle some of Mike's business associates, one an executive at Tara's employer. Rather than bet money or on himself, Johnny wagers a high-placed position for Tara, with Mike putting up an expensive car as their side of the stake.  Johnny wins a challenging trick-shot bet (to duplicate a difficult shot Mike had made in the previous game), and the promotion for Tara, but keeps the reason for her new opportunity a secret. (She eventually figures out the reason behind her advancement to such a competitive position, but understands that Johnny was just trying to help her the only way he knew how.)  As for Joe, he is bent on revenge for the beating he took, and soon he has a new protÃ©gÃ©, Brad (Rick Schroder), who is just as good as, if not better, than Johnny. Joe also has his eye on Johnny's brother as a  for Brad's hustling.  Brad and Danny play a high-stakes game of pool which ends in a huge debt owed to Joe by Danny, who was no match for Brad.  Johnny later finds that his brother is in jail for trying to steal the money he owes, and that Joe is going to come after Johnny for the money.  The only way out is for Johnny to play against Brad for an even larger sum â to pay off Joe and fund his brother's legal defense.  This results in a -to-nine showdown that pits two of the greatest players against each other for a large sum of money â and perhaps even for Johnny and Danny's lives.  One of the brothers' affluent friends, puts up some of the stake money, and Mike provides the rest, then even increases the stakes.  During a tense time-out, Mike delivers a memorable monologue (in Walken's intense style, as most famously used in ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''), likening Johnny to a slumbering lion whose time has come to rise up and chase off the hyenas and jackals.  Mike then raises the stakes, to a level that will bankrupt Joe if Brad loses.  The match comes down to a very difficult final shot for Brad. Johnny s Brad while he is calculating how to take the shot, telling him how easy the shot is and how Johnny would even pay to take that shot for him. Smelling an opportunity to get more money from Johnny, Joe agrees and makes Brad let Johnny attempt the shot.  Johnny does so, but does not  the final ball. As Brad prepares to take the winning shot, Johnny stops him: since he paid for the privilege of taking Brad's turn for him, it is now Johnny's own turn again.  Before Brad or Joe can react, Johnny easily pockets the last ball and wins the match, having exploited the hustling techniques he learned from Joe to do so.  Joe is prepared to resort to violence again, but Johnny predicted this and has the same friends who roughed up Joe before drag him away.  Brad stays out of it, and on his way out of the pool hall suggests Johnny should get onto the pro tour.  In the closing shot, Johnny is shown happily playing a pro-tour match.  (The resolution of Danny's legal trouble is left as a [[Plot hole|loose end]].)

The Princess and the Pea (2002 film)
 The glory of the old kingdom in now gone, the story of how a [[princess]] was discovered by a pea is lost and wars and tragedy have destroyed the land. Sebastian the Raven tries to restore some of the old tales using an old tapestry found by a young Prince Rollo, but it is almost destroyed. In the meantime, Prince Heath is crowned King without the consent of his older brother and primary candidate for the throne, Prince Laird, though he is a far kinder and fairer ruler. Laird is named the ruler of the Pig Kingdom where he vows revenge. Nine months later Heath's wife Mariana gives birth to a daughter, but dies during the child's birth, at the same time Laird's wife Helsa also gives birth to a daughter. Laird conceives an evil plan. He sends Helsa to take care of Heath's daughter, making the King believe Helsa lost her baby. During the night Laird trades Helsa her own daughter and gives the Princess away to some farmers. Helsa feels some remorse and makes Laird promise not to hurt the baby, because she lost her mother as a child too.  As the years pass, Heath's daughter is named Daria and grows up as a beautiful, kind, gentle and sweet girl, working for her horrible farmer "stepfamily", while on the other side, back at the castle, her cousin Hildegarde (Laird's daughter) grows up cruel, wicked, selfish and vain in her place as the princess. And Prince Rollo, now grown, returns to Heath's castle, dreaming of happiness with someone he loves. Hildegarde, upon seeing him, and hearing how wealthy he is, decides to marry him, but Rollo refuses and flees. Hildegarde gives chase, but loses his trail. During her search, Helsa and Laird see each other again, and Laird tells Helsa that the time has come to tell Hildegarde of her true lineage. Needless to say, she doesn't take it well.  Meanwhile, Rollo, while on a quest, meets Daria, and her trusted pig companions; Princess, Hungry, and Fearless. (She had hoped to give Fearless a name to live up to, but it hasn't worked yet.) The two fall in love and soon after, are separated. Rollo continues in his search for a real princess to marry; one of proper lineage, beauty, grace, and class. Every prospect disappoints him. He realizes he shouldn't love someone because of their titles, but because of who they are and decides to marry Daria, and rushes to tell her.  And all the while, Sebastian the Raven, has been searching for this lost prophecy, now only deducing that to discover true nobility, one must place a pea beneath twenty mattresses. By now, King Heath, utterly disappointed with how Hildegarde turned out with her raising, decided to disinherit her, and leave his kingdom to Rollo and whoever he chooses as his bride. He asks Sebastian to deliver the message to Rollo telling him all of this. Learning about Heath's plan, Helsa intercepts the message, and brings it to Laird's attention. Laird turns the entire Pig kingdom against Daria, claiming she is a witch who can talk to animals. The mob pursues her through a forest and burn down her hiding place, where she'd met Rollo.  Rollo returns and tries desperately to save her, but with the help of her animal friends she and her companions escape. Sebastian, meanwhile, finally discovers the full prophecy in the ballroom of Daria's hiding place. Above the prophecy is a stained glass window showing the image of a great Queen, Daria's ancestor, who bought about the Golden Age of the Kingdom before the Dark Ages took it over.  The prophecy reads:  "To Reveal the Heart of True Nobility  Place the Pea Twenty Mattresses Deep  The Princess True is Love and Sensitivity  Upon Such, She Can Never Sleep"  Delighted at finally solving the obstinate mystery, Sebastian dances around, forgetting to evacuate the burning building. Rollo saves him and exits the place, too exhausted to continue searching, and cries for Daria one last time before passing out in front of the mob. Laird lies to the crowd telling them that he cried for Hildegarde, wanting to marry her. Rollo is taken to the castle and treated for his injuries. And, hearing the news of his wish to marry Hildegarde, Heath plans the wedding, and upon Hildegarde's orders, the wedding is to take place the moment Rollo feels better. While mourning Daria, whom he believes to be dead, he gets off the bed, and Hildegarde sees him, and immediately starts the wedding.  Daria, finally leaving her stepfamily, tries to find Rollo, and is rudely pushed aside by the people. She helps a servant in the castle, who fell and hurt herself. She takes her into the castle kitchen, and seeing Sebastian's twenty feather beds, decides to lie down for a moment, but she is unable to, saying there appeared to be something hard under them all. Seeing this, Sebastian deduces that Daria is the real Princess for she felt the pea through twenty mattresses. And then sees Daria's birthmark, a heart on her foot, which he remembers the Princess to have when he saw her many years ago. But his plan to tell everyone is intercepted when Laird and Helsa stop him, by tying him up. He escapes and interrupts the wedding revealing the truth. But, before telling everyone who is the real princess, since Hildegarde is not, Laird shows up holding Daria hostage. He tries to eliminate Rollo by throwing a chandelier on top of him, but Heath saves him, and miraculously lives.  Laird, along with Helsa and Hildegarde, flees taking Daria hostage. He sets up a trap to get rid of Rollo to Heath whom he knows to be following him. Rollo confronts him, and miraculously survives another fatal attempt to eliminate him. Atop the castle tower, Laird and Helsa are defeated and arrested. The little pig, Fearless finally lives up to his name by helping defeat Hildegarde.  Rollo and Daria are reunited, and Rollo introduces Daria to Heath, her father. She and Rollo end up married, and live happily ever after.

After they return home, the four brothers ram their car into Barry's, leaving Lena mildly injured. With his new-found freedom from loneliness in jeopardy, a surprisingly aggressive and poised Barry adeptly fights off all four of the goons in a matter of seconds, using a [[tire iron]] as a weapon. Wanting to make sure Lena is never hurt again, Barry leaves Lena at the hospital and tries to end the harassment by calling the phone-sex line back and speaking to the "supervisor", who turns out to be Dean Trumbell, who is also the owner of a mattress store. Barry travels to the mattress store in Provo, Utah, to confront Dean face to face. Dean, at first trying to intimidate Barry, finds Barry more intimidating after Barry tells him that he is in love and it makes him stronger than anyone else. An end to the harassment is implied, when Dean learns that Barry has not gone to the police, but has come all the way from LA to confront him, with Dean trying to save face by getting in the last word.  Barry returns to Lena's apartment, and tells her everything, about the phone-sex episode, and Dean's goons, and begs her for forgiveness, pledging his loyalty and to use his frequent-flier miles to accompany her on all future business trips in just six to eight weeks after his pudding miles are processed. She readily agrees, and they embrace happily. Some time later, Lena approaches Barry in his office while he plays the harmonium. She puts her arms around him and says, "So, here we go."

Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)
 Set in 1931, two sisters, 14-year-old Molly and 8-year-old Daisy, and their 10-year-old cousin Gracie live in the [[Western Australian]] town of Jigalong. The town lies along the northern part of one of the fences making up Australia's rabbit-proof fence (called Number One Fence), which runs for over one thousand miles.  Over a thousand miles away, the official Protector of Western Australian Aborigines, [[A. O. Neville]] (called Mr. Devil by them), signs an order to relocate the three girls to his re-education camp. The children are referred to by Neville as "[[half-caste]]s", because they have one white and one Aboriginal parent. Neville's reasoning is portrayed as: the Aboriginal people of Australia are a danger to themselves, and the "half-castes" must be bred out of existence. He plans to place the girls in a camp where they, along with all half-castes of that age range, both boys and girls, will grow up. They will then presumably become labourers and servants to white families, regarded as a "good" situation for them in life. Eventually if they marry, it will be to white people and thus the Aboriginal "blood" will diminish. As such, the three girls are forcibly taken from their families at Jigalong by a local constable, Riggs, and sent to the camp at the [[Moore River Native Settlement]], in the south west, about 90&nbsp;km (55 miles) north of Perth.  [[File:Rabbit proof fence map showing route.PNG|thumb|150px|left|Map of the [[rabbit-proof fence]] showing the trip from Moore River to Jigalong.]]  During their time at the camp, Molly notices a [[rain cloud]] in the sky and infers that if she, Gracie and Daisy were to escape and go back to Jigalong on foot, the rain will cover their tracks, making them difficult to follow. Gracie and Daisy decide to go along with Molly and the three girls sneak off without being noticed and run away. On the same day, however, their absence is noted, and Aboriginal tracker, Moodoo, is called in to find them. However, the girls are well trained in disguising their tracks. They evade Moodoo several times, receiving aid from strangers in the harsh Australian country they travel. They eventually find the rabbit-proof fence, knowing they can follow it north to Jigalong. Neville soon figures out their strategy and sends Moodoo and Riggs after them. Although he is an experienced tracker, Moodoo is unable to find them.  Neville spreads word that Gracie's mother is waiting for her in the town of [[Wiluna, Western Australia|Wiluna]]. The information finds its way to an Aboriginal traveller who "helps" the girls. He tells Gracie about her mother and says they can get to Wiluna by train, causing her to leave the other two girls in an attempt to catch a train to Wiluna. Molly and Daisy soon walk after her and find her at a train station. They are not reunited, however, as Riggs appears and Gracie is recaptured. The betrayal is revealed by Riggs, who tells the man he will receive a [[Shilling (Australian)|shilling]] for his help. Knowing they are powerless to aid her, Molly and Daisy continue their journey. In the end, after a nine-week journey through the harsh Australian outback, having walked the 2,400&nbsp;km (1,500 miles) route along the fence, the two sisters return home and go into hiding in the desert with their mother and grandmother. Meanwhile, Neville realizes he can no longer afford the search for Molly and Daisy and decides to suspend the pursuit.  ===Epilogue=== The film's epilogue shows recent footage of Molly and Daisy. Molly explains that Gracie has died and she never returned to Jigalong. Molly also tells us of her own two daughters; she and they were taken from Jigalong back to Moore river. She managed to escape with one daughter, Annabelle, and once again, she walked the length of the fence back home. However, when Annabelle was 3 years old, she was taken away once more, and Molly never saw her again. In closing, Molly says that she and Daisy "... are never going back to that place".

The Quiet American (2002 film)
 The story is set in 1952 in [[Saigon]], [[Vietnam]] ([[French Indochina]] at that time), toward the end of the [[First Indochina War]] (1946-1954) in which French forces fought the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]]-led [[Viet Minh]] rebels. On one level, ''The Quiet American'' is a love story about the [[love triangle|triangle]] that develops between Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in his fifties; a young American idealist, supposedly an aid worker, named Alden Pyle; and Phuong, a Vietnamese woman. On another level it is also about the growing American involvement that led to the full-scale [[Vietnam War|American war in Vietnam]].   Thomas Fowler ([[Michael Caine]]), who narrates the story, is involved in the war only as a reporter, an unengaged observer, apart from one crucial event. Pyle ([[Brendan Fraser]]), who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative sent to steer the war according to Americaâs interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a "third force" to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. Pyle sets about creating a "Third Force" against the French and the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General ThÃ© (based on the actual [[Trinh Minh The]]). His arming of ThÃ©'s militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.   Meanwhile, Pyle has taken Fowler's Vietnamese mistress Phuong ([[Do Thi Hai Yen]]), promising her marriage and security.  When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates.  He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh ([[Tzi Ma]]), and Hinh's Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him.  Phuong subsequently returns to Fowler, and while the local French police commander ([[Rade Å erbedÅ¾ija]]) suspects Fowler's role in Pyle's murder, he has no evidence and does not pursue the matter.  
Raaz (2002 film)
 The film starts with a group of college students enjoying a picnic in a beautiful forest in [[Ooty]]. One of the girls, Nisha ([[Mink Brar]]) in that group, dies after being attacked under mysterious circumstances outside a bungalow in front of the forest. She had attacked her boyfriend too, who, though injured, managed to live on. She was rushed to the hospital, where just before dying, her facial look and voice changed completely for a short while, thus confusing all the attending doctors. Professor Agni Swaroop ([[Ashutosh Rana]]), who is supposedly an expert in phenomena involving the unexplained and the supernatural is called by the police to look into the matter. Prof. Swaroop and the police visit the forest at the same place where Nisha was attacked and after investigating from Nisha's boyfriend, Prof. Swaroop declares that she was attacked by a spirit. He further reveals that this spirit has waked for some purpose and it will not stop until that purpose is fulfilled.  The story then turns to Sanjana Dhanraj ([[Bipasha Basu]]) and Aditya Dhanraj ([[Dino Morea]]) in Mumbai in a business party, where Aditya seems too busy to pay heed to the fact that his wife is longing to talk to him. She snatches the car keys from Aditya's pocket and leaves the party to return home. On her frantic drive home, she hears a voice in her head and loses control of the car. However, miraculously, she escapes the accident unscathed. After her recovery, Sanjana asks her husband for a divorce; Aditya, however, realises his fault and suggests a vacation to work out their problems. He offers Sanjana a trip to any corner of the world for some days and Sanjana chooses to return to Ooty (where their relationship first began) to save their failing marriage. In Ooty they stay in the same bungalow behind which Nisha was attacked. Initially, the couple enjoy their stay at the cottage but soon Sanjana starts experiencing mysterious things, such as hearing a woman screaming in the forest behind the cottage and inexplicable falling of objects. She later learns that their housekeeper's husband, Robert, also used to hear strange voices from the forest, and that he ran from the house in fear once he could bear it no more.  She shares her problems with her friend Priya ([[Shruti Ulfat]]), a local girl, who advises Sanjana to visit Professor Swaroop. Prof. Swaroop arrives at the cottage and after a short investigation announces the presence of a spirit in the house. He also tells Sanjana about the earlier incident involving the girl who was attacked and killed by an evil spirit in those very woods. He then revisits the same spot in the forest where Nisha was attacked, this time accompanied by Priya and Sanjana. Sanjana goes alone to talk to that spirit, where after some time, she discovers a revolver. All three of them go to an arms store to learn more and are told by the shopkeeper that the revolver was licensed to a retired colonel named Col. Arjun Malik. They visit the colonel's house, suspecting him to be a murderer of innocent girls, but soon learn from the colonel that the spirit is actually his own daughter, Malini ([[Malini Sharma]]), who was mentally ill and had managed to escape from the mental asylum several times.  Using the methodology suggested by Prof. Swaroop, Sanjana summons the spirit, believing that the spirit wants to tell her something. The spirit conveys that Malini had met Aditya when he came to Ooty the previous year for work. When Sanjana confronts Aditya, he admits that he had stayed at the same cottage where Sanjana and Aditya are currently staying. They eventually learn that Malini and Aditya had an affair and that Aditya rebuked Malini's demands that he leave his wife, claiming that the affair was never meant to be anything more than physical. An enraged Malini commits suicide in front of Aditya inside of his home. Aditya, with the help of his then manservant Robert, buried the dead girl's body in the forest behind the cottage.  Sanjana storms off in anger leaving Aditya alone. Prof. Swaroop tells Sanjana that all this was an attempt by Malini's spirit to separate Sanjana and Aditya to take him with her into the afterlife. He believes that the spirit's next step would be to kill Aditya and that they should rush to Aditya before Malini attacks him.  Sanjana goes to Aditya and tells him that she is doing this just to save him and that they should leave for Mumbai in their car immediately. After they leave, Sanjana, Priya and Prof. Swaroop arrive at the cottage where the bewildered maid tells them that Aditya just left with her. Prof. Swaroop realises that the earlier Sanjana was Malini's spirit in disguise and they rush after the car.  Malini's spirit meanwhile causes the car in which Aditya is travelling to fall off a cliff. Aditya goes into a coma and is hospitalized. To prevent the spirit from succeeding in her plans, Sanjana, Priya and Prof. Swaroop go into the forest to locate the girl's body to burn it. Prof. Swaroop uses the lemon tied to a small thread for locating the dead body, believing that it will turn red after reaching the exact spot where dead is supposed to be. As he is getting the petrol from the car, a nearby power pole suddenly falls down and kills him.

[[Jesse Reeves]], a researcher for the paranormal studies group [[Talamasca Caste|Talamasca]], is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics after hearing one of his songs play on TV and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, [[David Talbot (The Vampire Chronicles)|David Talbot]], takes her aside and tells her they know what he is and that a vampire called [[Marius de Romanus|Marius]] made him. David also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and gives it to Jesse for her to read. In the journal, Lestat recalls how he was turned into a vampire by Marius and how he awoke [[Akasha (The Vampire Chronicles)|Akasha]], the first vampire, with his music. Unsatisfied with what she read, Jesse tracks Lestat down to a London vampire club called The Admiral's Arms, where he saves her from three vampires and confronts her about Marius.   In Los Angeles, Lestat is visited by Marius, who warns him that the other vampires will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile. Marius also reveals that Akasha has awaken due to Lestat's new music and begs him to cancel his concert, which he refuses. Meanwhile, Akasha, who is searching for Lestat, arrives at The Admiral's Arms. After the vampires reveal their plan to kill Lestat at his concert, Akasha torches the club and kills all the vampires inside. Jesse arrives at Los Angeles and gives Lestat his journal back. She then asks him to show her what being a vampire is like. Lestat scoffs at the idea, but Jesse convinces him to spend his last moments before the concert with her. The two spend some time together and Jesse later asks Lestat to turn her, telling him she wants to be with him and that she wants to know everything he does. Lestat angrily refuses, showing her what it's like for a vampire to feed on a human, then leaves.   While performing at his concert in [[Death Valley]], a group of vampires attack Lestat. With Marius' help, they both fend off most of the vampires until Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her. Akasha brings Lestat to her new home, where the two vampires mutually feed on one another, during which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her, and Akasha proclaims Lestat her new king. After the concert, Jesse is taken to the home of her aunt, [[Maharet]], who later reveals herself to be one of the Ancient Vampires. Knowing Akasha's plan to take over the world, the Ancient Vampires discuss their plans to destroy the Queen by drinking from her and draining her of her blood. However, they believe that whoever drinks the Queen's last drop will not survive.  Empowered by Akasha's blood, Lestat and the Queen confront the Ancient Vampires. When they refuse to join her, Akasha then commands Lestat to kill Jesse, as The Queen sees her both as an enemy, due to being Maharet's descendant, and as food, with Akasha making an example out of her for those who dare disobey her command. Lestat ostensibly obeys, but after drinking Jesse's blood, comes to his senses and is released from Akasha's power. He angrily requests for his "crown" and Akasha openly gives him her arm to feed on. Lestat then turns on her and begins to drain Akasha's blood. With the help of the Ancients, Akasha's power diminishes. Maharet is the last to drink Akasha's blood, killing Akasha. Lestat goes to Jesse and, cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood as Maharet turns into a marble statue and "sleeps", becoming the new Queen of the Damned.   Lestat and Jesse, who is now a vampire, visits David and return Lestat's journal. When asked by David what it is like, Jesse jokingly offers to turn him into a vampire and bids David goodbye. The film closes with Lestat and Jesse walking hand in hand, among mortals, into the night.

Reign of Fire (film)
 The film opens at an unspecified date in the early 21st century. During construction on the [[London Underground]], workers penetrate a cave. A huge [[European dragon|dragon]] emerges from [[hibernation]], incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen ([[Alice Krige]]) - the construction crew chief - is crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. It is revealed through newspaper clippings and the narration that dragons are the species responsible for the extinction of the [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]]. They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. After the dragons reawaken, humanity resists with military force, including with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] in 2010. This, however, only hastens the destruction, and within a few years, humans are [[Endangered species|nearly extinct]].  In 2020, Quinn ([[Christian Bale]]) leads a community of survivors in a [[Northumberland]] [[Castle|castle]]. They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon; one man is killed, and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy ([[Gerard Butler]]), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping.  The [[Kentucky]] Irregulars, a group of [[Americans]] led by Denton Van Zan ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), arrive on a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy with a [[Chieftain tank]] and [[AgustaWestland AW109]] utility helicopter, the latter of which is piloted by Alex Jensen ([[Izabella Scorupco]]). Van Zan has a system for hunting dragons and knows their weakness; poor vision before sunset. With Quinnâs help, Van Zan, Alex and their team hunt and slay the dragon who destroyed the crops.  The survivors enjoy a celebration at the castle that night but Van Zan bereaves with the lost of several of his men. Van Zan and Alex tell Quinn all the dragons they have found have been female. The Americans believe there is only one male - if they kill it, the dragons can no longer reproduce. Although Quinn knows about the male dragon, which killed his mother, he refuses to help.  Van Zan orders his soldiers to enlist the castle's best men. Quinn argues that if they find the male, it will kill them and find the castle. This soon results in the two menâs heated relationship coming to a head where Quinn attacks Van Zan but in the brief ensuing fight, Van Zan gives Quinn a terrible beating and the crowd is forced to pull Van Zan off, after Van Zan gave Quinn the beating they depart. Later true to Quinns warnings, Van Zan's caravan is set up and attacked by the dragon in the ruins of a town  from London. In a display of intelligence, the dragon then follows the groupâs tracks back the castle and kills most of the inhabitants in a preemptive strike. Quinn tries to get the survivors to a [[Bunker|bunker]] but is trapped when the dragon returns for a final assault. Creedy is killed in the melee.  Van Zan and Jensen return and free everyone trapped in the bunker. Quinn tells Van Zan and Alex that he will help them hunt down the male dragon. They fly to London and find hundreds of dragons, with smaller ones cannibalized by the starved larger male. Van Zan tells Quinn about their plan to shoot explosives down the dragon's throat with a [[Crossbow|crossbow]]. Van Zan fires, but the dragon destroys the arrow and eats Van Zan. Quinn and Alex lure the dragon to ground level, where Quinn fires into the dragon's mouth, killing it.  Later, Quinn and Alex erect a [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]] on a hill overlooking the [[North Sea]]. There has been no dragon sighting for over three months. Jared arrives to say they have contacted a group of [[French people|French]] survivors who want to speak to their leader. Quinn tells Jared he is now their leader and dedicates himself to rebuilding.  
Red Dragon (2002 film)
 In 1980 Dr. Hannibal Lecter attends an orchestral performance of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He is irritated by a flute player who repeatedly misses his part. Later, he hosts a dinner party in his townhouse for the orchestra's board of directors. During conversation, the disappearance of the flute player is brought up. When one of the guests asks about the dish Lecter made, he responds that if he tells her, she might not try it.  Lecter is visited by Will Graham, a gifted FBI agent who has the ability to empathize with [[psychopath]]s. Graham has been working with Lecter on a [[Offender profiling|psychological profile]] of a [[serial killer]]. The killer removed edible body parts from his victims, leading Graham to believe him to be a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]]. During the consultation, Graham discovers evidence implicating Lecter. Lecter immediately attacks Graham with a knife and almost disembowels him, but Graham impales Lecter with several arrows and then empties his handgun into him. Lecter is sentenced to life imprisonment in an institution for the [[criminally insane]]. Graham is deeply traumatized by the experience and retires from the FBI.  Six years later, another serial killer, nicknamed The Tooth Fairy, appears. He stalks and kills two entire families during sequential full moons. Special Agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] seeks a reluctant Graham's assistance in developing the killer's psychological profile. With the death of another family seemingly weeks away on the next full moon, Crawford guilt trips him into agreeing. After visiting the crime scenes and speaking with Crawford, Graham concludes that he must once again consult Lecter.  The Tooth Fairy is [[Francis Dolarhyde]], who kills at the behest of his alternate personality whom he calls "The Great Red Dragon". He is obsessed with the [[William Blake]] painting ''[[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun]]'', and has the painting tattooed on his back. He believes that each victim he "changes" brings him closer to "becoming" the Dragon. His [[psychopathology]] is born from the severe abuse he suffered as a child at the hands of his sadistic grandmother.  Meanwhile, [[Freddy Lounds]], a tabloid reporter, who hounded Graham after Lecter's capture, follows him again for leads on The Tooth Fairy. There is a secret correspondence between Lecter and Dolarhyde. Graham's wife and son are endangered when Lecter gives The Tooth Fairy the agent's home address, forcing them to relocate to a farm owned by Crawford's brother. Hoping to lure out The Tooth Fairy, Graham gives Lounds an interview in which he disparages the killer as an impotent homosexual. This provokes Dolarhyde, who kidnaps Lounds and glues him to an antique wheelchair. Dolarhyde forces Lounds to recant his allegations, bites off his lips, and then sets him on fire outside his newspaper's offices. [[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun (Rev. 12 1-4) - William Blake.jpg|thumb|right|''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun'', ca. 1803â1805 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]] Later, at his job in a St. Louis photo lab, Dolarhyde falls in love with Reba McClane, a blind co-worker. He takes her home, where they make love. However, his alternate personality demands that he kill her. Desperate to stop the Dragon's "possession" of him, Dolarhyde goes to the [[Brooklyn Museum]], tears apart the original Blake painting, and eats it.  Meanwhile, Graham deduces that the killer knew the layout of his victim's houses from their home videos. He concludes that the killer works for the company that edits the home movies and transfers them to video. He starts searching the company processing plant and asks for the workers' personnel files, overheard by Dolarhyde as he returns from Brooklyn. Dolarhyde then leaves the plant unseen and goes to Reba's house.  Dolarhyde finds that she has spent the evening with a co-worker, Ralph Mandy, whom she actually dislikes. Enraged by this apparent betrayal, Dolarhyde kills Ralph, kidnaps Reba, takes her to his house, and then sets it on fire. Finding himself unable to shoot her, Dolarhyde apparently shoots himself. Reba is able to escape the house as the police arrive.  Dolarhyde, having staged his own death, turns up at Graham's home in Florida. He holds Graham's son hostage, threatening to kill him. To save his son, Graham slings insults at the boy, reminding Dolarhyde of his grandmother's abuse. Enraged, Dolarhyde attacks Graham. Both men are severely wounded in a shootout which ends only when Graham's wife kills Dolarhyde. Graham receives a letter from Lecter which praises him for stopping The Tooth Fairy, bids him well, and says they are going to cross paths soon.  Some time later, Lecter's jailer, Dr. [[Frederick Chilton]], tells him that he has a visitor, a young woman from the FBI. Lecter asks her name.  
Real Women Have Curves
  18-year-old Ana GarcÃ­a struggles to fulfill her dream of going to college while considering family duty, and a tough economic situation. The thought of Ana going to college torments Ana's mother, Carmen, because she wants to keep her family together. Carmen also wants Ana to help work in the family-owned textile factory, run by Ana's sister Estela. The factory itself is in danger of closing; Estela cannot afford to make the rent and pay her employees. Although Ana does consent to spend sweaty summer days working in the factory, she spends her nights writing her college entrance essay for Columbia University and sneaking out to see her American boyfriend Jimmy. Ana defies Carmen (her mother) and applies to college, despite warnings against such behavior.  As the summer goes by Ana grows into a confident woman through experiences with Jimmy, and positive self-affirmation. She challenges cultural and socioeconomic boundaries, in favor of a life independent from her family. Despite the warnings of her critical mother, Ana gains support from her sister and father to pursue success beyond the borders of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. She also starts to call out her mother on her critical and [[emotionally abusive]] ways.   The film begins in a Hispanic neighborhood in Los Angeles. An old woman is standing at her front gate, singing enthusiastically. The camera then brings us into the living room of a home on the same street. We see a young woman, Estela (Ingrid Oliu) trying to convince her younger sister, Ana (America Ferrera) to go look after their mother Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros). Carmen is moaning and groaning in bed, looking quite ill.   Ana rolls her eyes and goes inside her parents' bedroom. Carmen asks Ana to come nearer, whispering that she needs Ana to cook for the family that day because she is sick. Ana erupts and says she absolutely refuses to miss her last day of high school and stomps out of the room. Moments later, Carmen gets out of bed and is apparently quite alright.    Ana catches two buses to get to her Beverly Hills high school. At the end of the day, her teacher asks her to consider applying to colleges. Ana explains that her family won't be able to afford it, and remarks that "it's too late anyway". Her teacher disagrees and tells her that he knows the dean of admissions at Columbia University and could possibly have her application looked at, even if it is past the deadline. Ana tells him she will think about it.   That night, Ana's family throws her a little party to celebrate the end of her high school years. As the night continues onward, however, the festivities turn to well-worn topics: Her mother nags Ana about not eating too much cake because of her weight, and emphasizes the need for Ana to get married and have children. Ana's grandfather and father try to defuse the situation, until her mother and Estela start discussing the family factory â a very small run-down dressmaking warehouse that Estela runs, and Carmen works at. Carmen tells Ana that it's time she started working at the factory. Estela protests, saying there isn't enough to pay Ana. Carmen insists, saying it's time Ana starts working for the family, no matter how little money she gets paid. Ana wants to do something else, but doesn't have a job. At that moment, her high school teacher arrives at the house, and asks to talk to Ana's parents about the possibilities of Ana going to college. Ana's mother is resolute, saying that there is absolutely no way Ana will go away. Carmen says Ana belongs at home and that's the end of the story. Ana's father seems open to the idea, but does not say anything in the face of his wife's strong stance. He does assure Ana's teacher that he will think about it.   Later, Ana tries to convince Estela to face down the executive in charge of her clothing line to grant her an advance so she can keep the factory running. The woman refuses, and instead Ana convinces her father to give Estela a small loan after Ana sees how hard Estela works to produce clothing she is proud of. Meanwhile, Ana works with Mr. Guzman to produce an essay for her application to [[Columbia University]] in New York.  Ana develops a relationship which later becomes sexual with Jimmy, a boy from her high school who thinks that people in the [[United States]] have it too easy, because everything is given to them. Carmen confronts Ana about her sexual activities, and Ana insists that she as a person is more than what is between her legs. Later, at the factory, all of the women working there except Carmen grow exhausted of the heat and Carmen's critiques of their bodies and strip down to their underwear, comparing body shapes, stretch marks, and cellulite, inspiring confidence in one another's bodies. Carmen leaves the factory in a huff over her family and co-workers' lack of shame as Ana declares that they are women and this is who they are.  Mr. Guzman comes by the house to inform Ana and her family that Ana has been accepted to Columbia with a scholarship opportunity, though it would mean moving across the country from Los Angeles to [[New York City]]. At first, Carmen convinces Ana and the rest of the family that her place is in Los Angeles with her family, but eventually Ana decides that she needs more out of her life and more importantly needs to break free from her domineering mother and her father agrees to support her. At the end of the film, Ana is dropped off at the airport by her father and her loving abuelo while Carmen refuses to leave her room and even refuses to say goodbye to Ana, and the final scenes show her striding confidently through the streets of New York.  
Repli-Kate
 Max Fleming is a [[graduate student]] who has developed a powerful [[cloning]] machine for the egotistical Dr. Jonas. Jonas steals all the credit and leaves Max to toil in obscurity. One day, Max meets Kate Carson, a young and attractive magazine reporter preparing a story on the cloning research at the university. During the interview, Kate accidentally cuts herself, and a few drops of her blood mingle with one of the cloning samples. Later that night, Max runs a test of the machine, and to his surprise he ends up with a replicant of Kate, which he names Repli-Kate.  Repli-Kate is fully adult (being exactly the same age the original Kate is currently at), but she has no knowledge. Max and his roommate Henry thus set out to educate her, but with a male perspective. They want to turn her into the perfect woman: the beer-drinking, sport-loving, sexually aggressive girl of their dreams. She also becomes Max's girlfriend as result. However, when Max contemplates the resulting woman, he realizes that the girl of his dreams was Kate all along, not Repli-Kate.  Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas learns of the existence of Repli-Kate. He captures both her and the original Kate. He then decides to present the results of the human cloning in front of scientists from all over the world, with the aim of advertising "his" cloning machine. Fortunately, Max and Henry learn of Jonas's plan, and they formulate a rescue mission. Using a newly created Repli-Jonas, the pair are able to create enough confusion to save Kate and Repli-Kate.  Jonas and Repli-Jonas are sent to a cloning research lab as test subjects. Max inherits the university's cloning lab, and his cloning chamber brings him great fame and money. Max and Kate fall in love, as do Henry and Repli-Kate. Unfortunately, Repli-Jonas manages to escape, and when Felix asks Max about what to do, he replies that Repli-Jonas is too dumb to go anywhere. The last image is Repli-Jonas, who is the new president. His discourse is just the word 'penis'.

Resident Evil (film)
 Underneath Raccoon City exists a [[genetic research]] facility called the Hive, owned by the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]], seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.  [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] awakens  naked in the bathroom of a deserted mansion with amnesia. She dresses, checks the mansion, and is subdued by an unknown person. A group of Sanitation Team commandos led by James Shade breaks into the mansion and arrests Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. The group travels to the underground train under the mansion that leads to the Hive, where they find Spence. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence are security guards for a Hive entrance under the disguise of a couple living in the mansion. Five hours prior, the Red Queen had shut down the entire facility and killed everyone inside, and also caused Spence and Alice's amnesia by flooding the mansion with nerve gas.  At the Queen's chamber, a laser defense system  kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's urgent pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables the Red Queen systems, and the power fails, opening all of the doors in the Hive. This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing Lickers, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. When everyone regroups, they are ambushed by a horde of zombies and a gunfight ensues. J.D. perishes as the group becomes overwhelmed. A bitten Rain retreats with Kaplan and Spence; Matt becomes separated from Alice, who starts regaining her memories.   Matt looks for information about his sister Lisa and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.  Alice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.  On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding on the train and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a trapdoor button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open and a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis Program]].  Some time later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table, with no memory of what happened since her capture. After escaping, she goes outside to find Raccoon City [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|abandoned and ruined]]. Alice arms herself with a shotgun from an abandoned police car as the camera pans out.

Four years later, Jane refuses to believe in stories about Peter Pan and refers to them as "childish nonsense", which leads to an argument with her mother and brother one night (after Wendy is informed and tells Jane that she and Danny, along with the other children in [[London]], are being [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to the countryside for safekeeping due to the German soliders invading the city). Later while sleeping, she is mistakenly abducted by [[Captain Hook]] and his crew, who sail through the sky on their pixie-dust enchanted ship, evade an air raid alert and escape back to Neverland.  There, Hook plans to feed Jane to the octopus (who replaced Tick-Tock the Crocodile) in order to lure Peter into a trap. However, Peter rescues Jane and Hook escapes from the octopus, returning to the ship. After recognizing and asking Jane to follow Wendy's footstep, Peter takes her to his hideout to be the mother of the Lost Boys, but Jane refuses and gets stranded. The next day as the boys fail to teach Jane about flying, she upsets them and does not believe in fairies, making Tinker Bell sick. That night, Hook tricks Jane by lying that he will not harm Peter and she agrees to help him find the treasure. Hook gives Jane a whistle to signal him when she finds it and leaves.  Jane asks Peter and the boys to play a game of "treasure hunt", and they wish Jane to believe in fairies and save Tinker Bell. As Jane finds the treasure and changes her mind into discarding the whistle, the boys make her the "Lost Girl" before Tootles finds and inadvertently blows the whistle. As the pirates arrive to capture the boys, Hook reveals Jane was an accomplice. As Jane tries to tell Peter she never agreed to anything, Peter scolds her for her treachery and tells her that Tinker Bell was knocked out by Jane's disbelief in fairies. Horrified, Jane rushes back to the hideout to Tinker Bell's body, but she revives. They head to the ship and see Hook forcing Peter to walk the plank. With Tinker Bell's help, Jane learns to fly. As Peter drops the anchor on the ship and sinks into the sea, the pirates, riding on a rowboat, are pursued by the octopus.  After saying goodbye to the boys, Peter escorts Jane back home, where Jane reconciles with Wendy and Danny. Peter and Tinker Bell meet Wendy again, though she is already an adult, and they say goodbye. As Edward returns home from the war, Peter and Tinker Bell fly back to Neverland.

Respiro
  Grazia, played by Golino, is a free-spirited mother of three married to shy fisherman Pietro (Vincenzo Amato) and living on the idyllic but isolated island of [[Lampedusa]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. She shows signs of [[Bipolar Disorder|manic depressive]] behaviourâone moment she's laughing wildly and swimming half-naked in the sea, while the next she's curled in a ball on her bed. Out of her earshot, the adult members of her extended family vaguely discuss sending her to a facility of some sort in Northern [[Italy]].  Grazia is closely shepherded by her oldest son Pasquale, played by Casisa, who appears to be about fourteen years old and often assumes more of a parental role with his mother. After Pietro puts down one of Grazia's dogs because he thinks it might be dangerous, impulsive Grazia sets all the stray dogs free in the town's makeshift kennel. After the dogs swarm over the island, the locals demand that Pietro do something about his wife. But when he tells her he plans to send her away to Northern Italy, she runs away and hides in a cave on the shore, where she's secretly tended by young Pasquale, who brings her food every day.  Pietro and some friends doggedly search the island for Grazia, so Pasquale leaves one of her dresses by the edge of the sea as a ruse. Pietro finds the dressâthe one she was wearing the day she disappearedâand nearly everyone presumes she has drowned. Pietro, however, continues to search for her, and just before an important local religious festival, he sees her swimming in the water. He dives in to assist her, thinking a miracle has occurred, and many of the villagers follow suit, thus providing a sheltering circle around her as she is brought safely to shore.

Rachel discovers that Katie's friends were killed in bizarre accidents on the night of her death. She also learns that Becca has been institutionalized after witnessing Katie's death. Rachel goes to Shelter Mountain Inn, the mountain retreat where Katie and her friends watched the supposed cursed tape. She rents the same cabin and watches the tape; it contains gruesome and disturbing imagery. After the tape ends, she receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers "seven days".  Rachel recruits the help of her ex-boyfriend Noah, a skeptical video analyst. He watches the tape and Rachel makes him a copy so they can both investigate where it came from. Rachel experiences supernatural symptoms of the curse, including irregular nosebleeds and having cords stuck in her throat, which she is forced to vomit out. She discovers hidden imagery of a lighthouse and identifies a woman on the tape: a horse breeder, Anna Morgan, who committed suicide after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island.

Realizing Samara's evil is still at large, he electrocutes himself in the bathtub. Noah arrives and he and Rachel enter the barn. In a loft converted to a bedroom to isolate Samara from her mother, they find an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.

A hand grabs her, and Rachel experiences a vision of Anna suffocating and dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for seven days. Samara's corpse surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued from the well, they arrange a proper burial for Samara. Noah tells Rachel that they are now safe as more than seven days have passed since she watched the videotape.  Aidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to try to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's seven days are up and rushes to save him, but the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara materializes on his TV screen, crawls out of it and kills him. Rachel finds his disfigured corpse and returns home to destroy the tape. She concludes she was spared because she made a copy, which Aidan watched.

The Rookie (2002 film)
 The film tells the story of  [[Jim Morris]], the son of a career Navy man, who moves the family from [[Hollywood, Florida]] to [[Big Lake, Texas]], in order to maintain job security. Jim is shown to be a very skilled pitcher, though his father disapproves of Jim's dream of making it to [[Major League Baseball]]. It is later mentioned that the town to which Jim's family moved, Big Lake, has lost its love for baseball, preferring football instead. Thus, he was unable to play baseball in high school. He later gets a chance when he is drafted by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], but he tears up his shoulder, ending his hopes of achieving his lifelong dream.  Years later in 1999, Jim, married with three children, is a high school science teacher, as well as head baseball coach. His team, the Big Lake Owls, is very unsuccessful with many of his players skilled, but unmotivated, especially with very little community support. One day after practice, the team catcher offers to play catch with Jim. There it is revealed that Jim may still have his fastball, and it is soon displayed to the rest of the team. The Owls believe that Jim could possibly pitch in the major leagues and offer him a deal: If the Owls can win district and make the state playoffs, Jim will try out again, which Jim accepts. Furthermore, the team urges him to throw his fastball in batting practice, which immensely improves their hitting.  The Owls end up winning district and after their final win, the team tells Jim that, since they kept up their end of the deal, it is now his turn to do his part.  After the Owls' season ends with a loss in the state tournament, Jim is told of a tryout nearby for the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], and Jim goes, without telling his wife, afraid that her fear of him re-injuring his shoulder would keep him from going. After his tryout, the professional scouts discover his ability to repeatedly throw a baseball at 98 miles per hour. The lead scout tells Jim that he could be signed to a minor-league deal. Jim's wife finds out after getting two phone messages from the Tampa Bay scouts and she is at first reluctant to let Jim go, citing his home responsibilities, but after seeing how Jim is inspiring their son, Hunter, she allows him to go. Jim tells his father, with whom he still has a cold relationship, of his situation, and his father once again tries to dissuade Jim from trying to achieve his dream again, telling Jim, "It's OK to think about what you ''want'' to do until it's time to start doing what you were ''meant'' to do."  He is initially assigned to the minor league Class AA [[Montgomery Biscuits|Orlando Rays]] (now the Montgomery Biscuits) but quickly moves up to the AAA [[Durham Bulls]]. Concerned for his family due to mounting bills (the pay in the minor leagues being low) Jim decides to give it up and come home. But his wife Lorri talks him out of it, not wanting Jim to give up again. Jim gets inspired again when he watches a Little League game one night, remembering the same love for baseball he had as a kid.  In September, Jim is told that the Major League club has called him up, and that they will be playing in Texas against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]]. Jim calls his family, who in turn informs the town. Advising his wife of the dress code in the majors, Jim finds his sports coat, a necktie and his [[Rita of Cascia|St. Rita]] necklace hanging in his locker. St. Rita is the saint of impossible dreams. His family, high school players and many townspeople go to the game. Jim impresses many of the coaches in warm-ups with his fastball, and late in the game, with Tampa Bay losing badly, Jim is called into the game to pitch to [[Royce Clayton]] and end the inning. Jim ends up striking out Clayton on three straight fastballs. After the game, Jim gets interviewed by the press. During the interview, Jim notices his father had also come to the game. Jim's father finally admits that he is proud of what Jim has done and also apologizes for never supporting him. Jim thanks him and gives him the ball with which he had gotten the strikeout, and the two finally repair their relationship. Jim then meets with his family and all the townspeople who had come to the game, applauding Jim on his amazing success story.  The final scene shows the Big Lake high school trophy case, which has Jim's Major League jersey prominently displayed. It is then mentioned that Jim would go on to pitch in the majors for two seasons before retiring and returning to teaching in Texas.  
The Rosa Parks Story
 This is an account of the life of Mrs. Rosa L. Parks and her actions in the civil rights movement. After she refused to give up her seat for a white man on a racially [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] bus after a long day at work, she was arrested. Her example and treatment prompted a bus boycott as a major [[civil rights]] demonstration in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]; it lasted 381 days from 1955 to 1956.   The film shows her background and indicates the issues in the segregated society of Alabama and the Deep South. As a child, Rosa was educated at a private school run by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), where she was encouraged to overcome the limits of segregation. In her late-adolescence, she married Raymond Parks, a barber and advocate of equal rights. She joins the local branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], although her husband believes that the organization has been ineffective in its battle against legalized [[racism]]. She worked as a seamstress in a department store.  On December 1, 1955, after a tiring day at work, Rosa Parks took a seat in the designated "colored" section of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. When the "white" section at the front filled up, the driver, James Blake, ordered Parks to relinquish her seat, as was the practice. She refused, and was arrested and jailed. Civil rights activists organized a one-day bus boycott the day of her trial (she was fined). With its success, they founded the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]], and began a citywide bus boycott, led by a new local minister, Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. The boycott lasted 381 days, made to work by African-American citizens, many of whom made sacrifices of time and energy to walk to work and other destinations. As they comprised the majority of bus passengers, the boycott greatly reduced the profits the bus company earned. Eventually [[Browder v. Gayle|a ruling]] by the [[United States Supreme Court]], in a related case, declared bus segregation unconstitutional. The boycott was important for mobilizing people in the civil rights movement both in the Deep South and on a nationwide basis across the United States.  
Rose Red (miniseries)
 Dr. Joyce Reardon, an unorthodox university psychology professor, leads a team of psychics to the massive and antiquated [[Seattle]] mansion known as Rose Red in an attempt to record data which would constitute scientific proof of [[paranormal phenomena]].

Reardon's team awakens the evil spirit possessing the house, leading to several deaths and the revelation of the mansion's deadly secrets.  ===History of Rose Red=== According to information revealed at various points in the miniseries, and Ellen's diary, Rose Red was built in 1906 by wealthy [[oil]]man John Rimbauer as a wedding gift for his young wife, Ellen. Rimbauer used much of his wealth to build the mansion, which was in the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] style and situated on  of woodland in the heart of Seattle on the site of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial ground. The house was rumored to be cursed even as it was being constructed; three construction workers were killed on the site, and a [[construction foreman]] was murdered by a co-worker.  While [[honeymoon]]ing in Africa, Ellen Rimbauer fell ill (from an unspecified sexually transmitted disease given to her by her unfaithful husband) and made the acquaintance of Sukeena, a local tribeswoman. The two women became very close while Sukeena nursed Ellen back to health, and Sukeena accompanied the Rimbauers back to the newly completed Rose Red to work there full-time as a servant. The Rimbauers soon had two children, Adam and April (born with a withered arm), but Ellen quickly became unhappy with her marriage to her philandering, neglectful, and misogynistic husband. After a [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[SÃ©ance|seance]], Ellen came to believe that if she continued to build and expand the house, she would never die.  Bizarre deaths and unresolved disappearances became more commonplace at the house throughout the years. Several female servants disappeared and one of John Rimbauer's friends died of a bee sting in the [[Sunroom|solarium]], while his business partner (whom Rimbauer had cheated out of his share of the oil company's profits) hung himself in front of Rimbauer's children in the parlour room of Rose Red. Six-year-old April also vanished while playing in the kitchen, never to be seen or heard from again. Sukeena, who was babysitting April, was the last person to see her alive and was tortured mercilessly by the local police after being suspected of April's murder. During April's disappearance eight-year-old Adam was sent off to attend boarding school and kept away from the house as much as possible. John Rimbauer died in an apparent [[suicide]] by throwing himself from an upper stained-glass window; in actuality, however, he was murdered by Ellen and Sukeena.  Ellen used nearly all of her dead husband's fortune to continually add to the home over the next several decades, enlarging it significantly. The mysterious disappearances continued to occur: a famous actress and dear friend of Ellen's, Deanna Petrie, vanished within the house's billiard room during a party in the 1940s. By the 1950s, both Ellen Rimbauer and Sukeena had disappeared in Rose Red.  For several years after Ellen's disappearance, only servants occupied Rose Red. Eventually, all left one by one out of fear. Adam Rimbauer, who inherited the house, lived there for a short time with his wife. However, he abandoned Rose Red after witnessing several [[paranormal]] events, such as seeing the ghost of his long-lost little sister April, and watching rooms alter their size and shape before his very eyes. After his death, and with the family fortune depleted, his wife generated income by permitting the Seattle Historical Society to give tours of the house. These ceased in 1972 after a female participant disappeared while on a tour of the mansion. Investigations for paranormal phenomena were conducted on the property in the 1960s and 1970s. But these also ended, and the house fell into disrepair.  The miniseries begins in the year 2001. Steven Rimbauer, the great-grandson of John and Ellen Rimbauer, has inherited Rose Red. He has been offered a substantial sum of money to have the house torn down and the site developed into [[condominium]]s. He is intrigued by the paranormal history of the house, and has agreed to allow one more investigation of the mansion.  ===Part 1=== In 1991 Seattle, young Annie Wheaton is drawing a picture of a house as her parents and older sister, Rachel, argue outside her room. As she draws lines down over the house in her picture, rocks fall through the roof of an identical house belonging to an elderly couple down the street whose dog had bitten Annie, severely damaging the building.  Ten years later in 2001, Dr. Joyce Reardon is a professor at the fictional Beaumont University who teaches classes on [[psychic phenomena]]. Kevin Bollinger, a reporter for the campus newspaper, skeptically questions her about a trip she will be taking to Rose Red, an ostensibly haunted and abandoned mansion in Seattle. Professor Carl Miller, Joyce's [[Academic department|departmental]] chair who questions the validity of Joyce's research, orders Bollinger to follow Reardon and spy on a meeting with the group of psychics she is taking to Rose Red. The group includes Victor "Vic" Kandinsky, an elderly [[Precognition|precognate]] with [[heart disease]]; Pam Asbury, a young [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometric]]; Cathy Kramer, a middle-aged [[Automatic writing|automatic writer]]; Nick Hardaway, a [[Telepathy|telepath]] with [[remote viewing]] capabilities; and Emery Waterman, a young [[Retrocognition|post-cognate]]. The group meets with Steve Rimbauer, the last descendent of Ellen and John Rimbauer, in an auditorium at the college. Bollinger takes a photo of the group joining hands in a circle, and the photo and an article ridiculing Joyce are published in the campus newspaper. Dr. Miller takes Bollinger to Rose Red and drops him off, instructing him to obtain additional embarrassing photos once the group of psychics arrives. The reporter is greeted by Sukeena at the front door, who tells him that he is expected. Not realizing she is a [[ghost]], Bollinger enters the mansion.  He becomes trapped in the solarium, where he is pulled off-screen by an unseen force.  The [[Back-story#Backstory in fiction|back-stories]] of psychics Emery Waterman and Annie Wheaton are introduced. Emery Waterman is a rude, sarcastic, and obnoxious young man under the control of his domineering mother, Patricia Waterman. The audience learns that Rachel Wheaton now cares for Annie Wheaton, who rarely speaks and who refers to Rachel as "Sister". The audience also learns that Joyce is having a sexual affair with Steve, although the film remains unclear whether she loves him or is merely using him to gain access to Rose Red.  ===Part 2=== Joyce and the group of psychics, now joined by Rachel "Sister" Wheaton and a teenaged Annie Wheaton arrive at Rose Red. The team tours the mansion. Joyce and Steve point out that the home contains many [[optical illusion]]s as well as an upside-down room and a library with a mirrored floor. The team finds Bollinger's cellphone, and Steve calls Miller to confront him over his attempt to discredit the group. That night, Emery sees the ghost of an actress that disappeared from the house decades earlier; Pam dreams of the [[Decomposition#Human decomposition|decomposing body]] of Kevin Bollinger; the Wheaton sisters are visited by a ghost under the bed and in the closet; and Cathy sees something moving under the carpet and her blankets. Later in the night, Pam is lured outside by a doppelganger into the garden pond and is presumably drowned.  The next morning, when Dr. Miller receives Steve's [[voicemail]] message, it instead says that Bollinger slit his wrists and wrote Miller's name in his blood before expiring. The message unnerves Dr. Miller and he goes to the mansion to learn more. Patricia Waterman also has driven to the mansion after being unable to reach her son via his cell phone. The two arrive simultaneously, and their cars collide in the driveway when Mrs. Waterman swerves to avoid what she believes to be a figure running across the road. Terrified, Mrs. Waterman begins to run through the forest on the grounds of the mansion while calling for her son. Miller, wanting to get her insurance information, pursues her. Inside Rose Red, Emery hears his mother's cries but dismisses them as an [[auditory illusion]] created by the haunted house.  On the other side of the house, Pam leads Vic into the garden toward a pond with a statue of Ellen in it. She suddenly disappears. When Vic looks down into the pond, he sees what he believes to be Pam's dead body. He attempts to pull her out of the water, but the body vanishes and he is left clutching only her nightgown. He panics and runs back toward the house. Looking back, he sees the statue come to life and has a [[heart attack]]. Vic tries to draw the attention of Emery (who is inside the house), but Emery again believes this to be an apparition and refuses to open the window. Nick arrives and tries to open the window, but it will not open and the glass cannot be broken. Vic collapses and dies in full view of Emery and Nick. Out in the woods, Mrs. Waterman is stopped and knocked unconscious by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.  ===Part 3=== Annie Wheaton has discovered a dollhouse that is a miniature replica of Rose Red. While standing on a chair in an attempt to reach the dollhouse, she falls and is knocked unconscious. Rachel Wheaton and Steve Rimbauer see her fall and attempt to render first aid. Meanwhile, on the other side of the house, Rose Red's windows and doors mysteriously open again. Emery Waterman, realizing that his mother's screams were not an illusion, rushes outside to look for his mother. He runs into Dr. Miller, who warns him to stay away and then flees. Emery chases Miller but cannot catch him, so he returns to Rose Red. Miller, continuing to frantically run around the grounds of the house, is found and attacked by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.  Emery attempts to convince the others that they should all leave. They refuse, and Emery tries to depart on his own. As he does so, he runs into the ghosts of Pam Asbury and Deanna Petrie ([[Yvonne SciÃ²]]), the movie star who vanished in the house in the 1940s. Emery has the power to make apparitions disappear by repeating the phrase "not there," and avoids the deadly fate of his mother and Dr. Miller. As Emery is about to leave Rose Red, Annie Wheaton wakes and via [[psychokinesis]] causes the doors of Rose Red to slam shut. Emery's hand is caught in the door, and some of his fingers are [[Amputation|severed]]. While the others assist Emery, Joyce Reardon asks Annie to continue to keep the doors and windows sealed, promising to give her the dollhouse if she does so. However, Steve soon discovers that he is able to communicate with Annie telepathically, and she begins to form a friendship with him.  Later, Steve relives some [[repressed memory|repressed memories]] of a visit to the house with his drunken mother during which a ghostly Ellen Rimbauer appeared to him and called on Steve to aid her in continuing Rose Red's unending construction. Meanwhile, Emery suspects that Annie, not some "spirit of Rose Red", is keeping the house sealed. Nick confirms Emery's suspicions, and then informs the group that Bollinger appeared to have hanged himself in the library. The group begins to speculate that Rose Red has never been in a dormant state, and that the mansion's supernatural powers are linked to Annie and Steve (whose psychic abilities become apparent only when he is in the house because of his familial connection to the property). Nick correctly guesses that Joyce brought the psychics to the house in an attempt to reawaken Rose Red rather than simply investigate it.  The wounded Emery suggests that Annie be killed in order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room and slams the door behind her, turning around just in time to see a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the [[attic]]. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.  The group reunites in the main hall.  Emery attempts to attack Annie with a [[fireplace poker]]. Using psychokinesis, Annie animates a [[armour|suit of armor]] and attempts to kill Emery with a [[halberd]]. Neither attack succeeds, and Joyce calms both individuals.  In an attempt to uncover the secret of Rose Red, Steve creates a telepathic link between Cathy and Annie, and Cathy begins to engage in automatic writing. Annie begins to draw pictures of boulders striking the house, smashed doors, and broken glass, and soon doors and windows all over the house are opening and closing violently and glass in the windows shatters. Rocks begin to fall, destroying Mrs. Waterman's car and causing severe damage to Rose Red. Cathy automatically writes "help us" and "open the doors," prompting Annie to unseal the house.  Steve, Emery, Cathy, Rachel, and Annie make their escape from Rose Red, but Joyce, now clearly insane, refuses to leave. The group is attacked by the spectre of Ellen Rimbauer, but Annie prevents Ellen from coming after them. Mrs. Waterman's ghost leaps from a mirror and attempts to draw Emery into the spirit realm, but Emery, with the assistance of Steve and Cathy, resists his mother for the first time in his life, and Mrs. Waterman vanishes again.  The survivors flee to their cars as boulders rain down on Rose Red. Back in the house, Joyce suddenly realizes too late that she does want to leave, but is surrounded by the ghosts of Rose Red: Nick, Pam, Vic, Mrs. Waterman, Miller, Bollinger, Sukeena, and Deanna Petrie. She screams in terror as the film fades to black.  Six months later, the survivors visit Rose Red, just before the mansion is due to be demolished and replaced by condominiums. They pay their last respects to the dead by laying red roses on the path leading up to the house.  As they drive away, the ghosts of Ellen Rimbauer, Sukeena, and Joyce watch the survivors depart from the tower window.  
Roger Dodger (film)
 After cynical New York advertising copywriter Roger Swanson ([[Campbell Scott]]) is dumped by his on-again/off-again girlfriend, Joyce ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) â who is also his boss â his painful workday is further complicated by the unexpected arrival of his 16-year-old nephew, Nick ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]). After asking to spend the night at Roger's, Nick reveals that he has come to ask for helpâin hopes of ditching his virginal status, Nick begs Roger for a lesson in the art of seduction. Embittered Roger then takes on the role of a nocturnal drill sergeant in an imaginary war between the sexes, starting Nick's training at an upscale singles bar. There they meet two beautiful women ([[Elizabeth Berkley]] and [[Jennifer Beals]]) who turn out to be less malleable than Roger expects.  Although this first attempt to seduce women is unsuccessful, Nick chooses to continue the quest, which takes them to a  party at Joyce's. There they find Joyce's secretary drunk and attempt to capitalize. Once in the bedroom Nick's conscience gets the better of him and he allows her to fall asleep untouched.  With Roger spinning out of control and Nick's window of opportunity closing rapidly, they agree to go with the "Fail Safe" plan. This turns out to be an underground brothel. At the underground location Roger finds he cannot let Nick lose his virginity in such an emotionally barren atmosphere, and drags him back to his apartment to sleep things off. Roger has failed to introduce his nephew to the mysteries of the world, but has perhaps gained a glimmer of a conscience. Nick travels back to Ohio but Roger shows up unexpectedly to tutor Nick and his classmates on their home turf, bonding with the younger men in a more potent way in an atmosphere populated by adolescent peers.  At the closing, it is left open which way Nick will go.

Russian Ark
 On a winter's day, a small party of men and women arrive by horse-drawn carriage to a minor, side entrance of the Winter Palace, dressed in the style of the early 19th century to attend a ball hosted by the [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]]. The narrator (whose [[Perspective (visual)|point of view]] is always in first-person) meets another spectral but visible outsider, "the European", and follows him through numerous rooms of the palace. "The European", a 19th-century French diplomat who appears to be the Marquis de Custine has nothing but contempt for Russians whom he tells the narrator are unable to create or appreciate beauty as Europeans do, while remaining oblivious to the treasures around him. Each room manifests a different period of Russian history, but the periods are not in chronological order.  Featured are [[Peter the Great]] harassing and striking one of his generals; a spectacular presentation of operas and plays in the era of [[Catherine the Great]]; an imperial audience in which [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] is offered a formal apology by the [[Qajar dynasty|Shah of Iran]] for the death of ambassador [[Alexander Griboedov]] in 1829; the idyllic family life of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]]'s children; the ceremonial changing of the various regiments of the Imperial Guard; people touring the palace in the present; the museum's director whispering the need to make repairs during the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]]; and a desperate [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]er making his own coffin during the [[Siege of Leningrad|900-day siege]] of the city during [[World War II]].  A grand ball follows, featuring music by [[Mikhail Glinka]], with many of the participants in spectacular period costume, and a full orchestra conducted by [[Valery Gergiev]], then a long final exit with a crowd down the grand staircase. Custine tells the narrator that he belongs here, in the world of 1913 where everything is still beautiful and elegant, and does not want to go any further. The narrator then walks backwards out the hallway and sees many people from different time periods exiting the building together. As he watches them, the narrator quietly departs the procession, leaves the building through a side door and looks out upon an endless ocean.

The Rules of Attraction (film)
 Set in the fictional Camden College in [[New Hampshire]], the film opens at the "End of the World" party, where students Lauren Hynde, Paul Denton, and Sean Bateman give apathetic interior monologues on their lives and briefly exchange glances with one another. Lauren, previously a virgin, takes a film student upstairs to have sex and passes out; she wakes to find herself being raped by a [[Town and gown|townie]] while the film student records it, and reflects on how she had planned to lose her virginity to Victor, her now ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Paul, who is gay, tries to have sex with a jock, only to be [[Gay bashing|bashed]] when it turns out the jock is deeply [[closeted]]. A bruised and beaten Sean is shown drinking a whole bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]], tearing up a series of purple letters, before approaching and having sex with a blonde girl at the party.  The plot then moves backwards several months to the beginning of the school year, and explores the [[love triangle]] between Lauren, Paul, and Sean. Misinterpreting Sean's willingness to spend time with him, Paul makes several advances, to which Sean is oblivious. Paul fantasizes about having sex with Sean while [[masturbating]]. Concurrently, Lauren also finds herself attracted to Sean despite saving her virginity for her traveling boyfriend, Victor. Sean reciprocates her feelings, and assumes the anonymous, purple love letters he has started receiving are from Lauren. Sean masturbates to reading these letters and fantasizes about Lauren.   While Paul is visiting his friend "Dick", Sean has sex with Lauren's roommate Lara at the "Dressed to Get Screwed" party. Sean regrets it immediately, and realizes that he is in love with Lauren. It is then revealed that another, unnamed cafeteria girl is the author of Sean's love letters; after seeing him leave the party with Lara, she sends him a suicide note before cutting her wrists in the dorm bathtub. Lauren, finding Sean with Lara, runs to the girls' bathroom in tears, only to find the unnamed girl's body, leaving Lauren extremely distressed. Sean, still believing Lauren wrote the purple letters, misinterprets the unnamed girl's suicide note and assumes Lauren never wants to be with him. Lauren decides to lose her virginity to her Art History professor Lance Lawson. But being married and worried about losing his tenure, he simply allows her to perform [[fellatio]] on him instead.  After numerous failed attempts at suicide, Sean fakes his death and, unaware that Lauren recently found a corpse, unintentionally upsets her further when she finds him pretending to be dead. After stealing drugs from dealer Rupert, Sean tries to speak to Lauren again, asking only to know her. Lauren tells Sean he will never know her, and abandons him. She approaches Victor, who has finally returned to Camden College, only to find that Victor is having sex with Lara and does not remember who Lauren is, leaving her completely distraught.  Paul, upon finding a drunk Sean, tries to talk to him, parroting Sean's own words by saying he merely wants to know him. Sean coldly rejects him, using Lauren's words to say that Paul will never know him. Paul throws a snowball at Sean, then angrily runs off in tears. Sean checks his campus mailbox in vain, only to find that the love notes have stopped. He is then cornered by Rupert and his Jamaican partner, Guest, and brutally beaten.  The three protagonists then attend the "End of the World" party and the plot returns to the introduction. After seeing Lauren heading upstairs with the film student, Sean finally accepts he cannot be with her, and tears up the purple letters he believes to be from her. It is then revealed that, rather than having sex with the blonde girl as he does in the intro, Sean has an epiphany, reconsiders and he instead leaves his drink and exits. Sean does not have sex with the woman, Paul does not go off with the "Handsome Dunce" and Lauren does not lose her virginity. Paul and Lauren meet on the house porch and reflect on the recent events, as well as on Sean, whom they watch depart on his motorcycle.

Danny had started his own investigation when he found out who Morgan was and delved into the drug [[underworld]] to become a believable junkie.  On the night of the deal, Danny, with the help of his best friend Jimmy ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), leads the FBI to the wrong location. Meanwhile, Danny arrives at Pooh Bear's house. At the dinner table, surrounded by Pooh Bear's armed friends, tensions rise and one of Pooh Bear's men tries to kill Danny, who retrieves the gun he stashed earlier and shoots the rest of the gang. Shot in the chest by Pooh Bear, Danny collapses to the floor.  Pooh Bear, wounded in the leg, goes to take a shot of meth while mumbling incoherently. Morgan and Garcetti arrive, find the massacre, and Garcetti kills Pooh Bear, whose drug-filled hypo drops to the floor. Garcetti is then killed by Danny, whose life was saved by a bulletproof vest. Morgan is shot twice by Danny, who reveals to Morgan that he knows he murdered his wife. Morgan manages to snatch Danny's gun away, but finds it empty. Danny finds Pooh Bear's syringe on the floor and plunges it into Morgan's neck, then picks up a pistol and briefly contemplates suicide, but then shoots Morgan several times and flees.  Back in his apartment, he dons his Tom Van Allen identity again, but is shot by Colette's "boyfriend" ([[Luis Guzman]]), who is in fact an agent tasked with exacting vengeance for the Mexicali Boys, a leader of whom Danny turned in to the police before the events of the film's present day timeline. Collette says she was forced to betray Danny because her daughter was being held hostage. The room catches fire, and Danny plays one more tune on his trumpet before passing out.  He regains consciousness to find that Jimmy has saved him from the fire and taken him to a hospital. After he recovers, he leaves the city, and the identities of Danny and Tom, behind.  
Samurai Vampire Bikers from Hell
 This film follows the lead character, ''Alexander Hell'', played by Shaw, as he rides his [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle out from the dark abyss to battle [[samurai sword]] carrying [[Vampires]] who are unleashing their vengeance on modern day [[Hollywood, California]]. Once on earth, Hell joins forces with an ancient [[Asian people|Asian]] vampire, ''Sir Katana'' who is played by [[Kenneth H. Kim]].   This film is one of Scott Shaw's early directorial works.  Nonetheless, this film shows the direction of abstract filmmaking Shaw has continued into his later feature films: *The film follows a non-linear storyline.  *It contains many [[music video]] style references where the central characters leave behind the storyline and interact solely by the presentation of visual images in association with [[techno music]]. *It is divided by unexpected edits. *The film is considered a "Zen film," as part of a distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw in which no scripts or screenplays are used.

The Santa Clause 2
  Eight years have elapsed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of [[Santa Claus]] and became subject to The Santa Clause. Now he is at the top of his game at the North Pole and could not be happier, at least until Head Elf Bernard and Curtis, the Keeper of the ''Handbook of Christmas'' break the news that there is another clause&nbsp;â the "[[Mrs. Claus]]e".  Santa/Scott is now pressed to get married before the next [[Christmas Eve]], or the clause will be broken and Christmas will fade away. At the same time, Abby the Elf delivers news that is more distressing: Santa's own son Charlie is on the naughty list, for acts including vandalizing the walls of the school gymnasium with spray paint, until he is caught by Principal Carol Newman. Scott must return to his home to search for a wife and set things right with Charlie. He brings this up when visited by the Council of Legendary Figures consisting of [[Mother Nature]], [[Father Time]], [[Cupid]], the [[Easter Bunny]], the [[Tooth fairy|Tooth Fairy]], and the [[Sandman]].  To cover for Santa's prolonged absence, Curtis helps Santa create a life-size toy replica of Santa, much to Bernard's horror. However, this replacement can't find any grace or slack in his plastic heart for minor infractions by children the world over, having followed the Handbook too strictly. Toy Santa takes control of the [[North Pole]] with an army of life-size toy soldiers. He thinks that everyone  is naughty, and he plans to give the entire world lumps of [[coal]].  Because of the impending end of his contract, Scott undergoes a "de-Santafication process" that gradually turns him back into Scott Calvin. He has a limited amount of magic to help him. Scott attempts to reconcile with Charlie, who keeps vandalizing his school to get attention. He and Charlie both face the ire of Principal Newman when Charlie defaces the lockers.  Charlie confesses to Scott how hard it is for him that Scott is never around like other fathers, and reveals the stress he is under to conceal the secret that his father is Santa. Scott vows to try harder as a dad, and he and Charlie reconcile.  After a few failed dates, Scott finds himself falling for Carol, the school principal. He accompanies her in a sleigh to the faculty Christmas party, which turns out to be dull. Using a little of his Christmas magic, Scott enlivens the party by presenting everyone with their childhood dream gifts. He makes a special presentation to Carol, and, with his last remnant of magic, wins her over and they kiss passionately. However, she balks when he attempts to explain he is Santa, believing that Scott is mocking her childhood, until Charlie manages to convince her by showing her his magic snow globe.  Curtis flies in to deliver the news about the Toy Santa's coal binge. However, Scott has used up the last of his magic wooing Carol, and reindeer Comet has eaten too many chocolate bars, making him too bloated to fly. With a little help from the Tooth Fairy, Scott and Curtis return to the North Pole. Toy Santa wastes no time in subduing Scott, but Charlie and a now-believing Carol spring him free by summoning the Tooth Fairy to fly them there. Scott goes after the Toy Santa, who has already left with the sleigh, riding Chet, a reindeer-in-training, and they both crash back into the village. With an army of elves, Carol, Bernard, Charlie and Curtis lead a snowball war to overthrow the toy soldiers. Toy Santa is reduced to his normal six-inch height, Scott marries Carol in a ceremony presided over by Mother Nature herself, Scott transforms back to Santa, and Christmas proceeds as it always has. Scott and Carol have a three-month honeymoon to go on the next day. In addition, Scott and Charlie reveal the truth to Lucy, Charlie's younger half-sister (the daughter of Laura and Neil) about Scott being Santa Claus and she can't tell anyone about his secret, but that it's more of a gift than a burden.  
Santa vs. the Snowman 3D
 Once upon a time, there lived the loneliest Snowman. He didn't any friends because, ... well, there was nobody around. And since there was nobody to talk to, he never learned to speak. Instead, his little flute was his voice. And every night, he would make his flute sing to the stars. But one particular night, the stars shouted back. A flash of light zooms past The Snowman, and shatters his little flute. Consumed with curiosity, The Snowman set off to find out exactly ''what'' the mysterious light was.  Eventually, The Snowman found himself at Santa's Village, a winter village filled with elves. The Snowman finds a toy workshop, where the elves were making various toys. Another elf comes in the workshop, and with him was the workshop owner: Santa Claus. While Santa was chatting with his elves, The Snowman finds a red-&-gold flute in the workshop. But after grabbing the flute, an alarm goes off, causing The Snowman to retreat, but Santa had sent some of his elves to retrieve the flute. While being chased, The Snowman ends up dropping the flute, and hides from the elves by jumping off a cliff, but grabbing onto an icicle stalactite, waiting for them to leave. After the elves had retrieved the flute, and went back to the village, The Snowman decided to head home.  As The poor Snowman returned warily home, his mind was in a whirl. He could not stop thinking about Santa, and his wonderful workshop. It seemed Santa had the perfect life: A marvelous home, lots of friends, plenty of toys, loved by everybody. But why wouldn't Santa let The Snowman have little toy? It just didn't seem fair to The Snowman. The Snowman started imagining himself as Santa, giving out toys, being loved by everyone around. At that moment, something occurred to The Snowman: "Why should Santa keep all that love, good tidings, and friendship for himself? That didn't seem fair. Maybe, it's time someone ''else'' got to be Santa.". And with that, The Snowman came up with a sneaky plan to take Santa's spot.  The Snowman had snuck into one of the village's attractions, before getting noticed, and kicked out. So, he came up with another idea. The Snowman started make various equipment for invading the workshop, and lots of snowman minions to assist. The Snowman went from his usual self to a much ''devious'' behavior.  The Snowman, and his minions started invading Santa's Village, but Santa sent his elves to fight back, starting a chaotic battle. The elves, and the snowman minions fought tirelessly. The elves were attempting to melt, and blow up the snowman minions while the snowman minions were freezing, and spewing out snowballs at the elves. As the battle rage on, neither was claiming an easy victory, but Santa knew that the conflict had to end. Christmas was only ''hours'' away! So, Santa decided to take matters into his own hands by going to help his elves end the conflict. But when Santa came to the battle, The Snowman unleashed a snow monster. However, Santa managed to defeat the monster by using a heating item to shrink the monster. Just when it looked like The Snowman was about to surrender to Santa, and the elves, more of his minions came to outnumber Santa, and the elves. With that, Santa, and his elves were imprisoned.  The Snowman had explained his plan to take Santa's spot, and left to deliver the toys, leaving Santa, and the elves in an ice cage. However, unbeknownst to The Snowman, one of Santa's elves, an elf named: Flippy, came to rescue Santa, and the elves.  Meanwhile, The Snowman soared above the rooftops. He was sitting in his snow replica of Santa's sleigh, while the snowman minions were being his Reindeer. It was a wonderful, magical feeling. Now, all he to do was deliver a few toys, and everyone would ''him.'' While The Snowman came across a little girl's house, Santa was making his way to The Snowman. The Snowman gave the girl an ice doll, but the doll ended up shattering. However, Santa had arrived to give the girl a real doll. Afterwards, just when it looked like Santa was going to punish The Snowman, he ended up giving The Snowman the same red-&-gold flute that The Snowman once attempted to steal, saying that the flute always belonged to The Snowman because, Santa was one who ''accidentally'' shattered The Snowman's first flute. Santa gave the advice of giving to The Snowman, and just as they were about to part ways, The Snowman discovered that his sleigh, and his minions have melted from heat of the little girl's house chimney. However, Santa offered The Snowman a ride back home. And so, Santa, and The Snowman became friends. And that's all The Snowman wanted anyway. A friend.  "Christmas giving isn't just for Santa. The spirit of giving is something that lives inside all of us." - Santa's advice of giving to The Snowman.

The Scorpion King
 "Before the time of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]," a horde from the East â led by the ruthless Memnon, who by their law, is king for being their greatest warrior â invades the prehistoric world. His many victories come from the help of a sorcerer who predicts the outcomes of battles, leaving only a few free tribes to oppose him.  Mathayus, his half-brother Jesup, and their friend Rama, the only three true remaining [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], are hired by King Pheron of the free tribes to kill Memnon's sorcerer for twenty blood rubies. This bargain upsets both Pheron's son Takmet, as the rubies are the last of their treasury, and [[Kerma Culture|Nubian King]] Balthazar, who dislikes the Akkadians. The Akkadians manage to sneak into Memnon's camp but are ambushed by his guards, having been tipped off by Takmet, who killed his own father and defected to Memnon's side. Jesup and Rama are hit by arrows, but Mathayus manages to sneak into the sorcerer's tent, where he sees that the sorcerer is actually a sorceress, Cassandra. Mathayus is ambushed and meets Memnon, who executes Jesup in front of him. Cassandra warns Memnon against killing Mathayus, saying the gods wish him to survive the night and defying them will incur their wrath and cost him his victories. To circumvent this, Memnon has Mathayus buried to his neck in the desert to be devoured by fire ants at dawn. Mathayus manages to escape with help from a horse thief called Arpid.  Deciding to finish his mission and avenge his brother, Mathayus sneaks into Memnon's stronghold, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]], and manages to enter Memnon's palace with help from a [[street urchin]]. He briefly meets Memnon's court magician, Philos, who hides him and directs him to the courtyard where Memnon is training. Mathayus tries to shoot Memnon from the watchtower, but he is forced to save the street urchin from having his hand [[Amputation#Legal punishment|amputated for theft]], alerting the guards to his presence. Mathayus barely manages to escape Gomorrah, abducting Cassandra along the way and knowing Memnon will come for her.  Cassandra tries to escape from Mathayus and tells him that she has been Memnon's prisoner since she was a child. Sympathetic, Mathayus allows her the choice of leaving, but warns her of worse dangers and that she is likely safer with him. Meanwhile, Memnon sends his right-hand man, Thorak, and a group of guards to kill Mathayus and retrieve Cassandra. Mathayus manages to slay them all under the cover of a sandstorm and in a cave. While dying, Thorak manages to stab Mathayus in the leg with a scorpion blood-laced arrow; Cassandra uses her magic to save Mathayus' life. As an insult and a warning, Mathayus sends Thorak's blood-stained pendant to Memnon.  Mathayus, Arpid and Cassandra run into Philos, who had earlier managed to flee from Memnon's palace and has perfected an explosive powder. However, they are ambushed by the rebels, now under the rule of Balthazar. Though Mathayus defeats Balthazar in a fight and earns his grudging respect and sanctuary, Cassandra has a vision of Memnon and his army slaughtering the entire rebel camp. She informs Mathayus and then prophesies that when the moonlight reaches Memnon's palace, the King on High will become the invincible Scorpion King, and Memnon believes himself to be the one destined to become the Scorpion King. Furthermore, she informs Mathayus that if he faces Memnon, he will likely die, but Mathayus assures her that he will make his own destiny and they sleep together.  The next morning, however, Cassandra returns to Memnon in order to stall and possibly kill him. Mathayus, with help from Balthazar, Arpid, Philos and the army of rebels, launches an all-out assault on Memnon's stronghold, facing Memnon personally before he can kill Cassandra. Balthazar confronts and kills Takmet, avenging Pheron, and takes on the full force of Memnon's forces alone. The battle rages on until Mathayus is shot by a guard, as predicted by Cassandra. As Memnon takes his place in the House of Scorpio to become the Scorpion King, Cassandra kills the guard while Mathayus retrieves his bow, pulls the arrow out of his shoulder and uses it to shoot the exhausted Memnon, sending him off the edge of the roof. At the same time, Philos and Arpid use the explosive powder to destroy the palace's foundation stone, bringing down the bulk of Memnon's forces. Memnon is consumed by the flames as he falls to his death. With the battle over, the remnants of Memnon's army bow before Mathayus, who by their law is their new king, the Scorpion King.  In the aftermath, Mathayus and Balthazar share a good-natured farewell as the latter returns to his own kingdom. Cassandra tells Mathayus that she sees a period of peace and prosperity coming, but warns him that it will [[The Mummy Returns|not last forever]]. Undeterred, Mathayus decides that they will make their own destiny.

Shark Attack 3
 The Movie begins with a group of divers installing a power cable at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]], when a shark swims up and kills one of them. Six months later, lifeguard Ben Carpenter (from the first Shark Attack film) and his partner Esai drive out to sea to catch some [[lobster]]. While diving, Ben finds a broken power cable with a large shark tooth stuck in it. After he pulls out the tooth, he is caught by two other divers, and soon goes back to land. Later he posts a description of the tooth online, but as he cannot find a matching shark tooth on the internet, he names it "mystery shark". Natural history researcher named Cataline "Cat" Stone gets the message, finds him and looks at the tooth. She believes it to come from a huge prehistoric shark called [[Megalodon]] (Greek for "big tooth").  Ben meets with his friend Chuck Rampart, who tells him he intends to take a look at the broken power cable. Ben tells him about the shark. Later, the animal kills two people who use a waterslide in the middle of the night. The next day Cat and her partners go out on a boat to find and tag the Megalodon. The shark shows up and smashes into their boat. Davis films it while Cat hooks a camera onto the sharks dorsal fin. The Megalodon leaves and later kills a man who is playing frisbee on the beach with his dog. Ben finds the man's severed leg and informs Cat about the attack; she in turn tells him about the Megalodon. Angry that she lied to him, he leaves.  The next day Ben, Cat, Davis and another partner go out to kill the shark, which they find out is heading toward a nearby resort. They manage to drive it back out to sea, where it kills several more people. Ben tries to get his boss, Luis Ruiz, to close the beaches. Ruiz says he will, and then tells Ben to kill the Megalodon.  The crew goes back out to sea to kill the shark for good. Ben stabs the animal, which in turn begins ramming the boat, knocking Davis out cold. Cat goes into the cabin to get her shotgun, but the Megalodon bursts into the boat, trying to eat her. Ben comes to her aid, beating the shark with a bat. Cat grabs her gun and shoots the shark, killing it. Afterwards, Esai arrives on his speedboat, when suddenly, the first shark's mother, a much larger Megalodon, enraged, surfaces and swallows him and his boat whole. The shark then capsizes the boat, and swallows Davis and his friend in one bite. Ben and Cat are rescued by a helicopter and leave. Ben shows Ruiz the shark tooth, but his boss still refuses to close the beaches. Later Ben and Cat go over to Chuck's house, loading a [[torpedo]] into Chuck's [[midget submarine]].  The next day, Ben and Chuck go down in the submarine. The Megalodon attacks a yacht, slamming into it a couple of times, knocking several people overboard. They escape to two large safety rafts. Ruiz steals a woman's life jacket and jumps off the yacht, only to be swallowed whole by the shark, as is one of the rafts. Tolley attempts to escape on a jet ski, but he ends up driving straight into the Megalodon's wide open jaw. Chuck then goes into the water and tags the shark. Ben eventually launches the torpedo, which succeeds in destroying the creature. Ben swims to the surface with Chuck and climbs into the raft. They all celebrate their success. However, at a different location near a rocky island, another megalodon appears but Ben, Chuck and Cat and the other survivors are unaware of its presence.  
Signs (film)
 Graham Hess ([[Mel Gibson]]), a former reverend, lives with his [[asthma]]tic son Morgan ([[Rory Culkin]]), his daughter Bo ([[Abigail Breslin]]) who leaves glasses of water around the house for various reasons, and his younger brother Merrill ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a failed minor league baseball player, on an isolated farm in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. Hess has lost his faith and given up his priesthood after his wife, Colleen, died in a traffic accident caused by a town local, Ray Reddy ([[Shyamalan]]).  One morning, Graham discovers a [[crop circle]] in his field. While investigating the crop circle with the local law enforcement, Graham learns of animals becoming violent across town. Morgan is forced to kill one of the family dogs when it turns violent against Bo. They hear reports of crop circles appearing around the globe, and there are reports of lights from invisible objects over Mexico. Later, Graham and Merrill find the farm is being watched by a tall dark figure which disappears into the fields when they give chase. The next day, they hear strange noises over a baby monitor, but cannot find their source. Graham approaches the crop circle but on seeing a green leg sticking out of the cornrows, flees back to the house.  After opening up to Merrill about the death of his wife, noting that her last words were "tell Merrill to swing away", Graham goes to visit Ray, the first time since the incident. When Graham is gone, Merrill and the children watch a news report about footage taken of an alien creature in Brazil, showing that the aliens can blend into their surroundings. Merrill joins the children in wearing [[tin foil hat]]s, believing that the aliens can read their minds. At Ray's, Graham finds Ray is bleeding from an injury but otherwise apologetic for the accident. After Graham accepts his apology, Ray departs for a nearby lake, saying "they" do not like water. Graham finds Ray has trapped one of the aliens in his pantry, and tries to see what the alien looks like using a kitchen knife under the door; the alien grabs at him, and Graham reacts by cutting off its fingers before fleeing. On his return, and hearing news that more lights have been seen in the skies across the globe, the Hess family decides to stay at their house instead of leaving for the lake, barricading the doors and windows.  After an emotionally charged dinner, they hear the same noises on the baby monitor before their television signal drops out, and place the final barricades and defenses before they gather together. As the aliens attempt to gain entry into the house, the family discovers they have left the attic door unguarded and quickly retreat to the basement. The aliens assault the basement door and in the subsequent chaos the light goes out as Graham and Merrill prevent their entry. However, Morgan suffers an asthma attack when the aliens attempt to enter by way of an old coal chute. By morning, reports on the radio reveal that the aliens have left Earth as suddenly as they arrived. Graham leaves the basement to locate Morgan's asthma inhaler, the others following him. But they discover an alien, the one trapped in Ray's home, is still there, and takes Morgan hostage. Colleen's last words come back to Graham, and he instructs Merrill to "swing away" with a baseball bat from his minor league days. Merrill attacks the alien but not before it attempts to poison Morgan by spraying him with a toxin from its body. Graham recovers his son when the alien drops him and takes Morgan outside with his medication. Merrill continues to attack the alien, causing it to fall onto the ground, knocking over one of the glasses of water Bo had left and splashing it with water. The water reacts like acid on its skin, making it scream in agony. Merrill, seeing their weakness to water begins knocking it into furniture, intentionally where Bo left water, and it is doused with water full on its face, and dies. Outside, Graham administers Morgan's medicine and waits for his son to wake up, hoping that due to his lungs being closed from his previous asthma attack he was spared. Then, Morgan wakes up and the family rejoices.   Some time later, the Hess family has recovered from the incident and they appear to be doing much better than before. In the final scene, Graham is shown returning to his priestly duties, apparently having regained his faith.  
Simone (2002 film)
 When Nicola Anders ([[Winona Ryder]]), the star of out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky's ([[Al Pacino]]) new film, refuses to finish it, Taransky is forced to find a replacement.  Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot.  Instead, Viktor experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno ([[Elias Koteas]]) which allows creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character.  Viktor names his [[virtual actor]] "Simone", a name derived from the computer program's title, ''Simulation One''.  Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone ([[Rachel Roberts (model)|Rachel Roberts]]) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor.  The film is immediately a huge success.  The studio, and soon the world, ask "who is Simone?"  Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that [[Streisand effect|only intensifies media demands for her to appear]].  Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture.  To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology.  Eventually it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews.    In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance.  He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology.  The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors.  Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], tying with herself in the process.  Once the pressure of serving his creation reaches a breaking point for Viktor, he decides to ruin Simone's career as an act of vengeance. Simone's next film, ''I Am Pig'', is her directorial debut and a tasteless treatment about [[zoophilia]] intended to disgust audiences, which not only fails to achieve the desired effect of audience alienation, but also serves to foster her credibility as a risk-taking, fearless and avant-garde artist. Taransky's subsequent attempts to discredit Simone by having her drink, smoke and curse at public appearances and use politically incorrect statements similarly backfire, when the press instead begins to see her as refreshingly honest. As a last resort, Taransky decides to dispose of Simone completely by using a [[computer virus]] to erase her and dumps the hard drive and floppy disks into a steamer trunk and buries it at sea, then announces to the press she has died of a rare [[virus]] contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the Third World. During the funeral, the police interrupt, open the coffin, and find only Simone's cardboard cutout.  He is arrested and shown a security camera video where he loads a large trunk on his yacht.    After being charged with her murder, he admits that Simone is not a person, but a computer program. The chest containing the computer data is brought up empty. Viktor's daughter Lainey and ex-wife Elaine enter his studio to try to help.  They find Viktor's forgotten virus source disk (''Plague'') and apply an anti-virus program to eradicate the computer virus. They revive Simone and have her appear on national television laughing while holding up a newspaper headline with her obituary.  They pick up a confused Viktor who realizes that his connection with Simone is a life sentence. At the end, Simone and Viktor are remotely interviewed at home about their new (virtual) baby. Simone is concerned about her child's future and decides to enter politics. The film shows how the fake is produced using the [[chroma key]] technique.  A post-credits sequence shows Viktor creating fake footage of Simone in a supermarket, which one of her pursuers sees, believing it real.  
Showtime (film)
 The film centers on two LAPD cops, Det. Mitch Preston ([[Robert De Niro]]) and Officer Trey Sellars ([[Eddie Murphy]]), who are paired for a reality police show and run into real trouble with a crime lord. Mitch breaks a news camera after a failed confrontation with a drug lord, who escapes by using a custom-built gun. Maxxis Television, the network that employed the cameraman, decides to sue the police department for $10 million, but will drop the lawsuit if Mitch agrees to star in a reality cop television show, which Trey later calls ''Showtime!''.  Trey enters the picture shortly after, as an LAPD officer who actually wants to be an actor while also trying to become a detective. He pays a friend to snatch the purse of the show's producer, Chase Renzi ([[Rene Russo]]), and then retrieves it after a staged fight scene. Even though the deception is embarrassingly revealed, Chase is impressed and signs Trey on anyway. It is quickly revealed that the show's producers have little interest in filming an actual police officer's existence; they build a mini-movie set in the middle of the station, and replace Mitch's nondescript personal car with a [[Humvee]]. They also hire [[William Shatner]] (who once played [[T. J. Hooker]]) to give both men tips on how to act. Trey is eager to learn, Mitch is merely annoyed.  Despite all this, Mitch tries to investigate the mysterious supergun, which is subsequently used by arms dealer Caesar Vargas to kill the drug dealer and his girlfriend. Through a clever ruse by Trey, they are able to get the arms dealer's name from the dead dealer's henchman. However, Vargas is less than cooperative, which causes a brawl at his nightclub. Trey and Mitch are able to defeat him and his henchmen, and subsequently have a relatively friendly conversation on their way home. Mitch's good humor evaporates when he finds that, in his absence, the Showtime producers have drastically remodeled his house and given him a retired K-9 dog as a pet.  Vargas and his crew assault an armored car and kill the crew, then devastate the police who respond. Trey and Mitch arrive and are pulled into the shootout. When the attackers flee in a garbage truck, Mitch gives chase in a police car. In the ensuing mayhem, the car is rammed by the garbage truck, which winds up crashing into a construction site. Mitch, ironically, survives by jumping from the police car to Trey's sports car (he had previously denounced "hood-jumping" as a useless skill). In the wake of the disaster, the police chief pulls the plug on the show, suspends Mitch from duty and demotes Trey back to patrol.  With the show ended, Mitch's car is returned and his apartment restored (but he refuses to return the dog, of which he has grown fond). While watching the final episode, Mitch sees one of his police colleagues at Vargas's nightclub. He and Trey investigate, finding that Vargas is selling the weapons at a gun show at the Bonaventure Hotel. Vargas flees with one of the weapons, taking Chase hostage in the process. The duo is able to rescue her, via a pocket pistol concealed in a Maxxis camera, but the ceiling of the room is shot. It is located just below the pool, so it floods, and Vargas is washed out the window to his death, Trey manages to save himself and Mitch by handcuffing them together. They wind up suspended from a broken beam outside the hotel.  The movie ends with Trey promoted to detective, he and Mitch still working together with a new case, and there are hints of a romance between Chase and Mitch. Showtime is revived and in its second season, this time with two young and attractive female officers, who are just as antagonistic as Mitch and Trey were.

 Rudy and Mogie Yellow Lodge are [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Sioux brothers on the Beaver Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  Mogie, unemployed and with a teenage son. Rudy, a police officer, struggles to care for his brother, nephew and the rest of the town through the hands of law.  Mogie resists Rudy's attempts, preferring to drink and joke about the depressed state of their people and town.  As a child, Rudy had been bitten by a spider, and Mogie told him it was [[Iktomi]], the trickster spider; this spider re-appears to Rudy early in the film and Rudy's attempts to help begin to wander outside the lines of the law.  When Rudy is sent on a police call to an abandoned house, he finds the bloodied, dead body of a young man who has been kicked to death.  Rudy sees someone in the darkness, but the stranger escapes and Rudy trips and falls onto a rock before he can identify his quarry.  Rudy's friend tells him that rocks are very spiritual and Rudy begins to worry that something has gotten into him, turning him vigilante. He sees a teenage boy wearing the same shoes as the figure who ran away from the scene of the murder, and follows him. Rudy overhears the boy talk with a friend about disposing a pair of boots that connects them to the murder.  Disguising himself with black paint on his face, Rudy sneaks up on the boys with a baseball bat and viciously beats their kneecaps, announcing himself as the ghost of the boy they murdered. While washing the paint off his face, he again sees Iktomi.  Angered by a news report about a liquor store in the bordering town profiting off of alcoholic Native Americans, Rudy sets out - again with a painted face - and sets the store on fire. Unknown to Rudy, Mogie was on the roof of the building trying to steal some alcohol. Mogie escapes and survives, but is burned and severely scarred. Shocked, Rudy visits a friend to get instructions on how to deal with Iktomi's spirit; a combination of home remedies and a [[Sweat lodge|sweat lodge ceremony]].  During Mogieâs stay in the hospital, the doctors discover that he is dying, because of his failing liver. After he is released from the hospital, Mogie, his son Herbie, Rudy, and Aunt Helen have dinner, and Mogie brings up [[American Horse]], an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] Indian who testified against the 7th Cavalry. This conversation brings up the story of the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], which Rudy tells to Herbie.  Rudy tells Mogie that he started the fire, and Mogie replies that the one thing he can do to make up for it is blow the nose off of George Washington's face on [[Mount Rushmore]]. Rudy calls the idea crazy, and refuses.  Responding to a police call of a man stuck in a trap, Rudy arrives outside a house to find that the victim, now dead, is Mogie's drinking partner.  The owners of the house seems to have no remorse for the man's death. When Mogie finds out the story behind his friend's death, he goes to the family's house with a gun, but is dissuaded from using it when a child appears in the room.  Mogies dies of pneumonia shortly after his son's 18th birthday.  A letter Mogie wrote before his death asks Rudy to care for his son.  Rudy finds out that the liquor store is being rebuilt, and will now be twice as big and have two drive-in windows.  He buys a large can of oil-based red paint and drives to Mount Rushmore.  He climbs to the top, and standing on the head of George Washington, he ponders whether his plan is stupid, he once again sees Iktomi crawling across the paint can. Seeing this, he makes his tribute to Mogie by throwing the can of paint so that it drips down the side of George Washington's nose, almost like a rivulet of bloody tears. On the drive back, he sees a hitchhiker that looks like Mogie in his youth and laughs.

 Shiang-chyi has returned to [[Taipei]] from her trip to [[Paris]]. She goes to the [[Skyway|skywalk]] where she first met Hsiao-kang, the salesman who sold her a watch, but some construction has taken place and the skywalk is gone. She stares at a large video screen for a while and then wanders around aimlessly. After [[Jaywalking|crossing a street illegally]], she is stopped by a police officer, who checks her ID card. Shiang-chyi then stops at a coffee shop for a short while. She realizes that her card is missing, so she goes back to the officer to ask if he still has it. He replies that he does not.  Meanwhile, Hsiao-kang is smoking in a public toilet stall. After he finishes, he washes his hands and leaves the restroom. He then walks up some stairs on the underpass. Shiang-chyi is walking down the same flight of stairs, and they pass each other. Hsiao-kang pauses at the top of the staircase to look back down at her, but Shiang-chyi does not notice him.  Hsiao-kang then goes to audition for a new job as a [[pornographic actor]]. The [[Film director|director]] asks him a few questions and then tells him to take off his clothes.

The short ends with music playing over a scene of clouds moving in real-time.  
The Skulls II
  Several years after the first film, Ryan Sommers ([[Robin Dunne]]) is a student at an unnamed university, believed to be [[Yale University]] by the sports teams logo and various [[New Haven, Connecticut]], imagery seen throughout the film. He and lacrosse teammate, Jeff, are tapped for the elite "Skulls" society.  Despite his friend Jeff's zeal for being tapped, Ryan is ambivalent toward admission into the Skulls seeing it as a form of control from his older brother, Greg (who is a member), and its distraction from his beautiful, socialite girlfriend, Ali ([[Ashley Tesoro]]).  Soon after being tapped, Ryan (having received inside information from his older brother Greg) stages an accident during one of the Skulls' secret initiation rituals by faking that he has been accidentally stabbed, only to reveal that it was a sophomoric joke.  Not amused, the senior leadership led by Parker Neal ([[Nathan West]]) decide to punish Ryan and Jeff by making them clean the attic of the Skulls tomb.  While cleaning the attic that night, both Ryan and Jeff hear someone on the roof, only to discover it is fellow Skulls member, Matt "Hutch" Hutchison and field hockey team captain, Diana Rollins. While peeping on Hutchison and Rollins as she begins to disrobe, Ryan notices her drinking from a flask that Hutchison gave her. Soon thereafter, she starts to become dizzy and then falls off the roof of the Skulls tomb. Trying to alert the other members in the tomb, Ryan is told that nothing is wrong and he must have been seeing things.  Ryan later goes to his brother Greg about the incident, believing that the Skulls have covered up Diana Rollins' death.  Greg agrees to give Ryan a key to the tomb, so that he can investigate further, but this later turns out to be a ploy in order to lure Ryan there. Ryan is told the supposed truth about what was really taking place.  He is fed a story by Parker Neal that, due to Ryan's sophomoric joke during the initiation ritual, the Skulls staged Diana Rollins falling off the roof as they had staged (years earlier) the death of a former member's roommate when he too was not taking membership seriously.  This was all a test to see if Ryan would remain loyal to the Order by not going to the authorities. The former member's roommate story is a direct reference to the first film and the death of Will Beckford, Lucas McNamara's roommate.  Not convinced by this ruse, Ryan begins to do research, and later discovers from Beckford's parents that their son was killed by the Skulls for doing an expose on the secret society and breaking into the tomb; this was the storyline from the first film.  That evening, Ryan receives a phone call from his brother Greg that Diana Rollins was killed in a car accident while returning from a supposed ski trip in New Hampshire.  At this point, Ryan knows the entire scandal has been a cover-up to protect Matt Hutchison and the Skulls from public humiliation.  Due to his digging around, the Skulls turn Ryan's life into chaos.  His brother Greg is fired from his high-level position as an attorney at Skull member Winston Taft's firm, Ryan's girlfriend Ali accuses him of assaulting her, and he is pursued by the Skulls at every avenue.  Through his friendship with Ali's roommate, Kelly ([[Lindy Booth]]), he later discovers that his apartment is bugged, and the Skulls will stop at nothing to cover up Diana Rollins' accidental death, even attempting to run him and Kelly down in the streets of New Haven.  Ryan and Kelly believe that the only true way to expose the Skulls is by getting their hands on the coroner's report, showing that Diana Rollins did indeed have drugs and alcohol in her system, and that she had been dead for days, not hours. Ryan's brother, Greg, uses his acquaintance, county coroner Dr. Phillip Sprague, to gain inside information â Sprague was offered a prostitute by the Skulls to switch the coroner's reports. Later, breaking into Sprague's office, Ryan steals the real report and goes to the police. In the meantime, Jeff has already come forward stating the Skulls covered up Diana Rollins' death and that Matt Hutchison was responsible. Hutchison is taken into custody; Parker Neal narrowly escaping arrest himself.  Back at the Skulls tomb, Skulls chairman senator George Milford states that shame and disgrace has been brought to the Order by this scandal. Believing that Ryan will be expelled from the Order, Parker egotistically states that he believes casting out Ryan is a smart move, only to discover that he is the one being expelled. Parker is seized by members of the Order and his brand of membership is removed from his wrist as he screams out in pain. Ryan casts himself out of the Order. The final scene show he and Kelly kissing in her car as they begin a new life together.

The Slaughter Rule
 A teenager at a personal crossroads finds himself questioning the things that have given his life meaning in this independent coming-of-age drama. Roy Chutney ([[Ryan Gosling]]) is a high school senior in the fictional Montana town of Blue Springs. Roy does not have an especially close relationship with his mother Evangelline ([[Kelly Lynch]]), and he has not seen his father in years. That does not prevent Roy from feeling emotionally devastated when he learns that his father has killed himself, and Roy's self-esteem takes a beating when he is cut from the high school football team shortly afterward. Roy whiles away his time by swilling beer with his best friend, Tracy Two Dogs ([[Eddie Spears]]), and falling into a romance with Skyla ([[Clea DuVall]]), a barmaid at a local tavern, but it seems that Roy's short time on the high school gridiron impressed Gideon Ferguson ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), a local character who coaches an unsanctioned high school [[six man football]] team when he is not delivering newspapers or trying to score a gig singing country songs at nearby honky-tonks.  Gideon thinks that Roy has potential and asks him to join his team; encouraged by Gideon's belief in him, Roy agrees, and he persuades Tracy to tag along. While playing hardscrabble six-man football helps restore Roy's self-confidence, he finds it does not answer his questions about his future or his relationship with Skyla. When Gideon's overwhelming interest in Roy begins to lend credence to the rumors that Gideon is gay, Roy starts to wonder just why he was asked to join the team.  
Slaughter Studios
 The film begins with an egotistical film student named Steve (Stanovich) recounting to his girlfriend Madigan (Shelton-White) the history of Slaughter Studios.  As a child he adored the horror movies that were produced there, but the studio closed down twenty years ago after an actor named Justin Kirkpatric was accidentally killed during a film shoot.    The next day Steve tells Madigan and some of his fellow students that he wants to use the abandoned studio to film one last horror movie.  The catch is that the studio is being torn down the next day, meaning that they only have 9 hours to shoot the entire feature-length picture, whose script is titled ''Naughty Sex Kittens vs. the Giant Praying Mantis''.  One of Steve's friends, Trish (Frajko), says that some of the girls in her acting class would probably love to do it.  Steve selects a young actor named Kevin (Read) to play the monster, and Madigan will be the production assistant, though she would much prefer to act in the movie, though Steve refuses to give her a part.  Later that night Steve and Madigan arrive at the studio, and they are introduced to the cast...snotty Portia (Killian), dim-witted Rebecca (Otis), floozy Darlene (Ellison), airhead Candace (McComas), and Chad (Keefe), who is playing the leading role.  Also helping out is Olie (Chulani), who is there to work as the sound department.  Steve explains to them that they have to be careful because every hour the security guard will do his rounds.  They break into the studio (accidentally disturbing a homeless man in the process) and begin to set up for the shoot.  It turns out that Chad is a truly lousy actor, so Steve sends him off to a secluded room to practice his lines so he will not disturb anyone.  While going over his lines by himself a shadowy figure sneaks up behind him and kills him with a pick ax.    Believing that Chad decided to leave, Steve casts Olie as the leading man.  Steve also improvises a lesbian sex scene to be included in the film, and gets Darlene and Rebecca to agree to it.  The two become so excited during the scene that they end up actually having sex.  Following this the two women go off to shower to clean themselves up; while finding their way back to the set they are murdered.  Steve is becoming increasingly agitated due to the disappearances and high levels of his stress medications.  Madigan is finally able to secure a part in the movie because of the shortage of actors, and she and Kevin become attracted to one another.  During this time Candace wanders off by herself to look for the ghost of Justin Kirkpatric (she is obsessed with him) and is killed.  While getting ready for her next scene, Trish is strangled to death by the unknown assailant, but unbeknownst to the murderer, her death is recorded by a hidden video camera.  Madigan finds the hidden camera and confronts Steve with it, thinking that he had hidden it in the women's dressing room on purpose.  It turns out the camera belongs to Olie, who was hoping to sell the footage to an online porn site for some extra money.  Olie decides to leave the studio for fear of facing Madigan's wrath, but on his way out he runs into the security guard, who chases him back into the studio.    Steve has Gary (Roseman), the cameraman, hook up Olie's camera to a television to see if they can use any of its footage, whereupon they stumble across Trish's recorded death.  Madigan realizes that there is someone hiding in the studio with them, and that this person has probably butchered everyone who has disappeared.  Gary, Kevin, and Madigan all think it is best to leave, but Steve, who by now is half crazed with drugs and fear, is only concerned about completing his film.  Meanwhile, Olie has discovered the bodies of Rebecca and Darlene and is being chased by the killer, who dispatches him with a spike through the head.  Portia, who is unaware of the evening's events because she was passed out after taking too much of Steve's stress medication, comes to and is angered when Kevin refuses to sleep with her.  She storms off by herself.  Gary, meanwhile, has become separated from the others and is decapitated.  Likewise, a delirious Steve has stumbled back to the sound stage and is crushed to death when the killer drops a piece of heavy equipment on him.  Kevin and Madigan come across the security guard, who proceeds to chase them throughout the studio.  Believing him to be the killer, they escape via car, but the guard gives chase.  The two eventually overpower him, and it is discovered that he is not the murderer.  In fact, he is the actor who inadvertently killed Justin Kirkpatric twenty years earlier.  The three realize that the killer is still inside the studio...and so is Portia.  Back at the set Portia is trying to find the others when the killer impales her.  It is then that the murderer is finally revealed to be the homeless man that the students scared off earlier in the evening.  He says, "It ain't right to fuck with a man's house."  Beside him sits the ghost of Justin Kirkpatric, who shares his sentiment.

Snow Dogs
 Dr. Ted Brooks is a [[Dentistry|dentist]] in [[Miami, Florida]]. Every city bus carries an advertisement for his dental practice with his picture. One day, Ted receives a letter from [[Alaska]], naming him as the only heir of Lucy Watkins, a resident of the backwoods village of Tolketna. Brooks' mother Amelia reveals that he is adopted; Lucy was his biological mother.  Ted travels to Tolketna to claim his inheritance from Lucy: seven [[Siberian Huskies]] and a [[Border Collie]] named Nana. In Tolketna, he discovers his roots. Totally out of his element, Ted is confounded by [[blizzard]]s, thin ice, [[red fox|foxes]], [[striped skunk|skunk]]s, [[grizzly bear|bear]]s, an intimidating, crusty old [[mountain man]] named James "Thunder Jack" Johnson, and the aggressive, defiant lead dog, Demon. All of this happens with the buzzing excitement of the Arctic Challenge Sled Dog Race, which is only two weeks away.   Ted tries to find out why he was given up for adoption, and who was his biological father. He meets bar owner Barb, a close friend of Lucy. Barb helps Ted to deal with the dogs and teaches him how to drive a sled, and falls in love with him. Ted has several encounters with Thunder Jack, who tries to buy the dogs, especially Demon. Barb tells Brooks that Thunder Jack is his biological father. Ted confronts Thunder Jack, who offers to tell the truth about Ted's birth in exchange for the dogs; Ted agrees. Jack takes Brooks to a cave out in the woods. During an Arctic Challenge, he and Lucy were stranded in that cave, and it was there that Ted was conceived. The next morning, when Thunder Jack woke up, Lucy was gone. He looked for her but never found her. Ted returns to Miami.  Thunder Jack adds Demon as lead dog of his team for the Arctic Challenge. Ernie has finished last in the last three Challenges, "winning" the "Arctic Flame" award as last "musher" to cross the finish line. The other mushers all camp at a checkpoint to wait out a bad storm, but Jack presses on. He is annoyed by the pretensions of defending champion Olivier, who is dining on crab legs in an elaborate tent.  In Miami, Ted recounts his experiences to his mother, who accidentally breaks a frame holding a picture of Lucy and Demon. This reveals a snapshot of Lucy and Jack with a baby. Ted is infuriated that Jack lied to him, and rushes back to Alaska. There he learns that Jack is lost on the trail, and the weather is too bad for searching. Ted decides to go searching himself, taking Lucy's dogs with Nana as lead. As he heads back down the trail, he nearly collides with Olivier, who wins the Challenge again. A few hours later, Amelia arrives and meets Barb. She learns that Ted is out on the trail, searching for Jack. The "Arctic Flame" is burning over the finish line, until the last musher arrives.  Ted eventually locates Thunder Jack in the old cave. Jack admits he and Lucy had been together when Ted was born, and that he loved her. But he and Lucy had agreed then that neither one of them could raise a baby. Ted also discovers that Demon is bad-tempered because he has a bad tooth. He pulls the tooth and Demon becomes friendly (despite keeping his name). During the journey back to Tolketna, the sled nearly goes over a cliff into a river, but the dogs pull themselves back up. Ted finally brings Thunder Jack across the finish line. Ted introduces Thunder Jack to Amelia, and Brooks and Thunder Jack decide to share the "Arctic Flame" trophy.  Some time later, Ted has moved his dental practice to Tolketna. He and Barb become a couple and get married. She has become his receptionist and is pregnant, and Nana and Demon have four puppies named Avalanche, Little Aleutia, Chinook, and Demon Jr. Back in Miami, Ted's cousin Rupert ([[SisqÃ³]]) is the new celebrity dentist, with his face on every city bus.  
Solaris (2002 film)
 The [[clinical psychologist]] Dr. Chris Kelvin is approached by emissaries for DBA, a corporation operating a [[space station]] orbiting the planet Solaris, who relay a message sent from his scientist friend Dr. Gibarian. Gibarian requests that Kelvin come to the station to help understand an unusual phenomenon but is unwilling to explain more. DBA is unsure how to proceed, as the mission to study Solaris has been sidetracked and none of the [[astronauts]] want to return home. In addition, DBA has lost contact with the security patrol recently dispatched to the station. Kelvin agrees to a solo mission to Solaris as a last attempt to bring the crew home safely.  Upon arriving at Solaris Station, Kelvin learns that Gibarian has committed suicide and most of the crew have either died or disappeared under bizarre circumstances. Both surviving crew members, Snow and Dr. Gordon, are reluctant to explain the situation at hand. The situation is further complicated when Kelvin sees a young boy running through the station. Once alone in his quarters, Kelvin dreams about his dead wife Rheya, reliving when they first met and some of their most romantic and intimate moments. He awakens shocked and terrified to encounter Rheya, apparently alive again beside him in bed. Kelvin leads this "Rheya" into an escape pod and jettisons the pod into space. Afterward, he confides his actions to Snow and comes to understand that replicas of the crew's loved ones have been mysteriously appearing (the little boy he saw earlier is apparently a replica of Gibarian's son). Rheya manifests a second time, but this time Kelvin lets her stay. Gradually, this version of Rheya comes to realize that she does not feel human; her memories feel artificial, in that she lacks the emotional attachment that comes with actually having lived them.  Through numerous flashbacks, Kelvin and Rheya's meeting and courtship are explored, with hints as to her disturbed upbringing and emotional difficulties. It is also gradually revealed through these flashbacks that Rheya once terminated a pregnancy but did not tell Kelvin about it. When he discovered her choice, Kelvin was so distraught that he walked out on her. Rheya then committed suicide and was later found by Kelvin when he returned for her.  Kelvin, Rheya, Snow and Gordon meet to discuss the situation. In frustration at Kelvin's apparent attachment to the virtual Rheya, Gordon blurts out what Kelvin did to the previous Rheya replica. An appalled Rheya abandons the meeting. Kelvin confronts Gordon, who in turn chastises him for getting emotionally involved with something that is not really human and may eventually pose a threat to human beings on the station as well as on Earth. Later, apparently during a dream, Kelvin has a vision of Gibarian, and asks him what Solaris wants. Gibarian balks at the idea of knowing an alien entity's motivations, or even that it might have motivations, and tells Kelvin simply that "there are no answers, only choices". Kelvin wakes to find Rheya dead, having committed suicide by drinking [[liquid oxygen]]. But she quickly self-resurrects, and it is revealed that other manifestations who have "died" have done the same.  Gordon develops an apparatus which can permanently destroy a replica but Kelvin objects to using it on Rheya. Driven by his own grief and guilt over the "real" Rheya's death on Earth, he begins ingesting a chemical stimulant to stay awake in order to monitor Rheya, trying to avoid repeating the past and essentially abandoning her to suicide. Kelvin eventually falls asleep and Rheya successfully petitions Gordon to destroy her with the apparatus as she has done for her own replica(s). Traumatized, Kelvin confronts Dr. Gordon who maintains she merely facilitated in [[assisted suicide]] and only strives for the preservation of the humans on the station.  Kelvin and Gordon then discover a dead body stashed away in a ceiling vent in the station's cold room â Snow. The Snow they have been interacting with is a replica. Confronted by Gordon and Kelvin, the Snow replica explains that upon being dreamed into existence, he was attacked by the real Snow and thus killed him in self-defense. He goes on to tell them that repeat usage of the apparatus has drained the ship's fuel cell reactor, making a return trip to Earth impossible. Furthermore, Solaris has begun to exponentially increase its mass, thereby gravitationally pulling the space station inexorably toward the planet. Gordon and Kelvin begin prepping a smaller space vehicle called ''Athena'' to escape.  Back on Earth, Kelvin struggles to return to normal life, haunted by the idea that he "remembered her wrong" â that is, Rheya as being invariably suicidal. When he accidentally cuts his finger in his kitchen, the wound immediately heals, and it is then that Kelvin realizes that he never returned to Earth. In a flashback, Kelvin gives up the idea of boarding the lifeboat, and Doctor Gordon leaves him behind. As the plummeting space station rattles itself to pieces around him, the replica of Gibarian's young son appears and offers his hand in assistance. In the kitchen, Rheya appears to Kelvin yet again. This time, however, she is tranquil, and assures Kelvin that they no longer have to think in terms like "life" and "death," and that all they have ever done is forgiven.

Dressed in shabby clothes and speaking in broken English, she asks Mamasan (Tomiko Lee), who runs the parlor, for a job, and Mamasan immediately puts the attractive Maya on staff. While obviously new to the world of "shower and massage" - which is about sex rather than physical therapy - Maya soon becomes one of the most popular women working the parlor, and she soon bonds with her co-workers, including the thick-skinned Asia ([[Gina Hiraizumi]]), vulnerable Yuko (Mari Tanaka), practical Jenna (Hiromi Nishiyama), and self-centered Sammy (Kate Holliday). Maya also gets to know Harry (Luciano Saber), a freelance writer and would-be poet who at the age of thirty has yet to lose his virginity. As he stops in for the occasional "massage," Maya and the painfully shy Harry find themselves developing a very non-businesslike infatuation for one another, and as she confronts her growing love for Harry, Maya must come to terms with the secret that brought her to the parlor in the first place.  
Sorority Boys
 The story starts out with the regular lives of three college friendsâDave ([[Barry Watson (actor)|Barry Watson]]), Adam ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), and Doofer ([[Harland Williams]])âwho are head of the Social Committee in a frat house called KOK (Kappa Omicron Kappa). Spence, the socially-awkward KOK President, is punishing a group of new pledges for teaching the KOK handshake to a girl, when Adam and Dave interrupt his ceremony, because they need the space for further partying, in retaliation he gets upset at them and leaves. The KOK are known for throwing heavy parties and socially discriminating against the members of the all girl sorority group DOG (Delta Omicron Gamma), who regularly protest the actions of the KOK (Fight Sexism Support Feminism) as being rude and mean to them. The KOK in retaliation to the protests, launch plastic sex-toys at their sorority house and refuse to allow them in the KOK house. The next morning, the three are accused by the KOK President Spence, of embezzling the other fraternity brothers' tuition money. They are then run out of the house for ruining the KOK members futures.  Doofer suggests that the secret video camera in Adam's room in the frat house, (which Adam uses to record having sex with the Tri Pi's and preserves as part of his Walk Of Shame collection), may show who actually stole the money. In order to infiltrate the house, the three follow Doofer's plan of dressing up as women (however rather unattractive in appearance and clothing wise) to get inside because its ladies night and also because they have been booted from the house. They are also however unsuccessful at getting the tape as Adam's younger brother Jimmy, has moved into their room, and develops a crush on Adina ([[Pseudonym|aka]] Adam). Then they are thrown out of the house when they are mistaken for members of DOG, which the KOK call "DOG-Catcher", where a whistle blows and the words "DOG CATCHER" is said aloud and a large net is thrown on top of them and they get tossed on the front steps of the DOG house.  Soon afterwards the boys now known as Adina,Roberta and Daisy pledge the sorority house DOG and soon realize just how badly they and the KOK members have been treating the DOG members and soon grow attached to them and become close friends. They also become more smarter and more understanding of what it means to be a woman as they learn about low self-esteem issues and learning how to act and look like a woman.     Adam, as Adina, tries to seduce his brother Jimmy to get the tape, by giving him a date-rape drug-laced drink while Jimmy does the same. Daisy (a.k.a. Dave) was supposed to back Adam up by being his Wingman, but is falling in love with the DOG president Leah. Dave and Leah meet on the first night when Dave gets up in the middle of the night to take a shower thinking he will be alone and can shower as a man. However Leah, without her glasses and can't see so well, decides to shower as well and an awkward unsettling situation causes Daisy (Dave) to make a hasty escape back to his room. His relationship with Leah gets in the way of Adam's attempts to get the tape back. The DOG sisters end up on the KOK-Tail Cruise after they win the powder puff football game against the Tri Pis, which includes a ticket on the ship. The Tri Pi's get on the boat before the DOG girls can, saying "No DOGS Allowed!!". Doofer then "acquires" a speedboat and delivers the girls to the boat, who then "help" the Tri Pi's off the boat by grabbing them from behind and casting them adrift on a life raft.  Leah dances with "Daisy", when she confesses that though it will be hard to have a lesbian relationship with Daisy, she is willing to commit if Daisy is, Leah replies with "That's the zinger". Daisy then tells Leah she is moving back to Minnesota. The two come to mutual understanding. While on the ship Dave needs to get out of his dress so he can meet with John Kloss and get a job in his company. He successfully gets John Kloss to accept his, Adam and Doofer's employment. While getting re-dressed as "Daisy" with Adam trying to help, Leah walks in and mistakenly thinks that Daisy (Dave) and Adina (Adam) are in a relationship, and the "Minnesota" excuse is fake. She storms out with Daisy following her. Doofer is looking for the tape elsewhere.  Jimmy finds Adina (Adam) and asks her to dance. Afterward John Kloss grabs Leah on the butt cheek and she slaps him across the face. He then organizes another "DOG-Catcher" session to throw Leah overboard, for not being receptive to his advances. Dave, as Daisy, reveals who he is to stop them throwing her overboard, while Spence catches Doofer trying to find the tape, and Adina (Adam) shows he's male too causing a big shock to Jimmy. Both the KOK and the DOG are shocked at the situation. The KOK "High Council" is convened to determine their fate, Dave describes that he feels so sorry for the way the DOGS were treated and no longer wants to be a member of KOK. Next Dave accuses Spence of stealing the money, and Doofer produces the tape to prove it. At first the tape shows Adam having sex with the Tri-Pi but then the tape shows Spence stealing the money while saying to himself "I'll teach them to humiliate me", after seeing he is the culprit he is then thrown overboard.  Later, back at the KOK house, Adam is named president of the KOK house. Afterward, he asks his brother Jimmy what happened the night they were "together" on "their date", and tries to get reassurance that "nothing" happened, which Jimmy replies "Right" but in fact something did happen. Dave meets with Leah and starts their relationship over, truthfully this time.  Sometime later, the life raft with all the Tri Pi's is still floating in the ocean somewhere, with every one of them severely sun burned and eating each other one by one due to hunger and starvation.<ref></ref>

  High-school senior [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] lives with his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]], and is a school outcast. On a school field trip, he visits a genetics laboratory with his friend [[Harry Osborn]] and love interest [[Mary Jane Watson]]. There, Peter is bitten by a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] "super spider." Shortly after arriving home, he becomes unconscious. Meanwhile, Harry's father, scientist [[Norman Osborn]], owner of [[Oscorp]], is trying to secure an important military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable performance-enhancing chemical. After absorbing the chemical, he goes insane and kills his assistant.  The next morning, Peter finds that he is no longer near-sighted, and his body has [[metamorphosis|metamorphosized]] into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds that his hands can produce webs, and his quickened reflexes let him avoid injury during a confrontation with [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter discovers he has developed superhuman speed, strength, the ability to stick to surfaces, and a heightened ability to sense danger.  Brushing off Ben's advice that "[[with great power comes great responsibility]]", Peter thinks of impressing Mary Jane with a car. He enters an underground fighting tournament and wins his first match, but the promoter cheats him out of his money. When [[Burglar (comics)|a thief]] suddenly raids the promoter's office, Peter allows him to escape. Moments later, he discovers that Ben was carjacked, and killed. Peter pursues and confronts the carjacker, only to realize it was the thief he let escape. After Peter disarms him, the carjacker flees but dies in the process. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a military experiment by Oscorp's corporate rival and kills several scientists and the military's General Slocum.  Upon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight injustice, donning a costume and the persona of Spider-Man. [[J. Jonah Jameson]], a newspaper company headmaster hires Peter as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] [[photographer]] since he is the only person providing clear images of Spider-Man.

Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unintentionally revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness.  Norman holds Mary Jane and a [[Roosevelt Island Tramway|Roosevelt Island Tram]] car full of children hostage alongside the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. He forces Peter to choose whom he wants to save and drops Mary Jane and the children. Peter saves both Mary Jane and the tram car, while Norman is pelted by civilians who side with Spider-Man. Norman then grabs Peter and throws him into an abandoned building where Peter is brutally beaten by him. When Norman boasts about how he will later kill Mary Jane, an enraged Peter overpowers Norman.  Norman reveals himself to Peter, who stops attacking. He begs for forgiveness, but at the same time controls his glider to [[impalement|impale]] his foe. Sensing the attack, Peter dodges, and the glider impales Norman. As he dies, Norman begs Peter not to tell Harry of Norman's identity. Peter takes Norman's body back to his house. Harry arrives to find a costumed Peter standing over his father's body. He seizes a gun, intent on shooting Peter, but Peter escapes and hides Norman's equipment.  At Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, whom he deems responsible for his father's death, and asserts that Peter is all the family he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she is in love with him. Peter, however, feels that he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies.

Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron
  In the 19th-century American West, a young [[Kiger Mustang]] colt, Spirit, is born to a herd of horses. Spirit soon grows into a [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]] and assumes the role of leader of the herd, whose duty  is to keep the herd safe. Spirit is a courageous leader but has great curiosity. Spotting a strange light one night not far from his herd, the stallion is intrigued and investigates. He finds restrained, docile horses and their human [[wrangler (profession)|wranglers]] sleeping around a campfire. They wake up, and seeing him as a magnificent specimen, chase and capture him, taking him to a [[US cavalry]] post.  At this time, the US [[United States Army|army]] is fighting the [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]] and taking over the soon-to-be western [[United States]]. Frightened and confused he finds himself and other horses slaves. Then, he encounters "The Colonel", who decides to have the mustang tamed, refusing to believe the idea of Spirit being too stubborn, but Spirit manages to fight off all attempts to tame him. To weaken Spirit, The Colonel orders him tied to a post for three days with no food or water. Meanwhile, a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] named Little Creek is also brought into the fort and held captive. Spirit is later supposedly broken in by the Colonel, who speaks his idea of how any wild horse can be tamed. However, Spirit gets a second wind and finally throws him off. The Colonel gets frustrated and tries to shoot him, but Little Creek (who frees himself from his bounds with a knife) saves Spirit from being shot. The two of them, along with other horses, escape the post. Little Creek's mare, Rain, meets them along with other natives who capture Spirit.  After returning to the Lakota village, Little Creek tries to tame Spirit with kindness, but Spirit refuses to be ridden. Little Creek ties Spirit and Rain together and, when he tries to leave, she insists on staying, then shows him her world. Spirit begins to warm up to Little Creek and falls in love with the mare. At the end of their time together, Little Creek tries again to ride him, but Spirit is still unwilling. He then decides that Spirit will never be tamed and frees him. As Spirit asks Rain to come with him to his herd, a cavalry regiment led by the Colonel attacks the village. During the [[Battle of Washita River|vicious battle]], the Colonel tries to shoot Little Creek, but Spirit runs into the Colonel and his horse, deflecting the shot and saving Little Creek's life. However, Rain is shot by the Colonel, knocking her into the river. Spirit dives into the river to try to rescue Rain but is unsuccessful and they both plummet over a waterfall. Spirit finds Rain dying from her injuries and stays by her side until the army captures him. Watching Spirit being pulled away, Little Creek arrives, vowing to free him to satisfy his life-debt and follows the men after tending to Rain.  Spirit is loaded onto a train and taken to a work site on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]], where he is put to work pulling a steam locomotive. Realizing that the track will infringe on his homeland, Spirit breaks free from the sledge and breaks the chains holding the other horses. They escape, and the locomotive falls off its sledge and rolls down the hill back to the work site chasing Spirit while the locomotive itself is getting more and more damaged, causing an explosion after crashing into another locomotive. Little Creek appears in time and saves Spirit from the ensuing wildfire.  The next morning, the Colonel and his men find Spirit and Little Creek, and a chase ensues through the [[Grand Canyon]]. Eventually, they are trapped by a gorge. Little Creek gives up, but Spirit manages to successfully leap across the canyon. Spirit's move amazes the Colonel; he humbly accepts defeat, stops his men from shooting the two, and allows Spirit and Little Creek to leave. Spirit returns to the rebuilt Lakota village with Little Creek and finds Rain nursed back to health. Little Creek decides to name Spirit the "Spirit-Who-Could-Not-Be-Broken" and sets him and Rain free. The two horses return to Spirit's homeland, eventually reuniting with Spirit's herd.  
Spider (2002 film)
  ''Spider'' is the story of Dennis Cleg, a man who is given a room in a [[halfway house]] catering to mentally disturbed persons. Cleg has just been released from a mental institution and in his new abode starts piecing together or recreating in his memory an apparently fateful childhood event.  He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal, and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and father. A shift takes place in the child's psyche when he witnesses his mother groping with his father in the garden and, subsequently, when he sees his mother in a silky night gown she wore for his father.  The son, as a grown man, seems to recreate in his memory the buildup to his father's murder of his mother with the passive support of a prostitute he is involved with, who then moves into the house and is presented as his mother. The young son then kills the mistress by gassing her in the kitchen, although the final shot appears to show his true mother lying dead so we are left to wonder whether she really was his mother and the prostitute was just a fantasy. After that memory he sneaks late one night to the landlady's room and appears ready to kill her, whom he sees alternatively as the mistress, his mother and the landlady, but backs away after she says, "What have you done, Mr. Cleg?" He is taken back to the asylum.

Pretending to be the cook, the two begin a close friendship. After Jianbin decides to confront Lao Hu in a scene where he lights the latter man's newspaper on fire, Jianbin and Xiaohui's relationship seems to be on the brink of self-destruction, as neither is willing to reveal the truth about themselves. Xiaohui, however, finally learns that Jianbin has lost his job and has been riding the subway for the past six months from Wang Yao, just as Jianbin leaves for his "trip." Instead of heading to the airport, Jianbin heads to the hospital to see Li Chuan's bandages to come off. But he leaves before she can see him, as Jianbin realizes that he still loves his wife. Xiaohui and Jianbin then meet in the same subway station where they first arrived in Beijing seven years ago as the film ends.

Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a [[Coup d'Ã©tat|military coup]] by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and to bring freedom to Remus. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by Romulans to plant a high-ranking spy into the Federation. The project was abandoned when Shinzon was still a child and he was left on Remus to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the ''Scimitar''. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the ''Enterprise'' crew discover that the ''Scimitar'' is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which is what had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms. There are also unexpected attempts to communicate with the ''Enterprise'' computers, and Shinzon himself violates Troi's mind through the telepathy of his Reman viceroy.  Dr. Crusher discovers that Shinzon is aging rapidly because of the process used to clone him, and the only possible means to stop the aging is a transfusion of Picard's own blood. Shinzon kidnaps Picard from the ''Enterprise'', as well as B-4, having planted the android on the nearby planet to lure Picard closer to the Border. However, Data reveals he has swapped places with B-4, rescues Picard, and returns with Picard to the ''Enterprise''. They have now seen enough of the ''Scimitar'' to know that Shinzon plans to use the warship to invade the Federation using its thalaron-radiation generator as a weapon, with the eradication of all life on Earth being his first priority.  The ''Enterprise'' races back to Federation space but is ambushed by the ''Scimitar'' in the Bassen Rift, a region that prevents any subspace communications. Two Romulan Warbirds come to the aid of the ''Enterprise'', as they do not want to be complicit in Shinzon's plans, but Shinzon destroys one and disables the other. Recognizing the need to stop the ''Scimitar'' at all costs, Picard orders the ''Enterprise'' to ram the other ship. The collision leaves both ships heavily damaged and destroys the ''Scimitar''s primary weapons. To assure their mutual destruction, Shinzon activates the thalaron weapon. Picard boards the ''Scimitar'' to face Shinzon alone, and eventually kills him by impaling him on a metal strut. Data jumps the distance between the two ships with a personal transporter to beam Picard back to the ''Enterprise'' and then sacrifices himself when he fires his phaser at the thalaron generator, destroying the ''Scimitar'', while saving the ''Enterprise''. The crew mourn Data, and the surviving Romulan commander offers them her gratitude for saving the Empire.  On the ''Enterprise'', now back at Earth for repairs, Picard bids farewell to the newly promoted Captain Riker, who is leaving to command the [[USS Titan (NCC-80102)|USS ''Titan'']] and begin a possible peace negotiation mission with the Romulans. Picard meets with B-4, and discovers that Data had downloaded the [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engrams]] of his neural net into B-4's positronic matrix before he boarded the ''Scimitar''.  
Spun
 Ross ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) is a customer of Spider Mike ([[John Leguizamo]]), a methamphetamine dealer. Spider Mike and his girlfriend Cookie ([[Mena Suvari]]) are constantly arguing, and Ross strikes up a friendship with Nikki ([[Brittany Murphy]]), a fellow addict. Nikki takes Ross to meet her boyfriend, "The Cook" ([[Mickey Rourke]]), who supplies Spider Mike with drugs from a [[meth lab]] he has set up in a [[motel]] room. The Cook gives a small amount of meth to Ross in exchange for bringing Nikki home, and says that he will get in touch with Ross if he needs a driver.  Back at his apartment, Ross gets messages from his mother and his former girlfriend, Amy, wishing him a happy birthday. Ross, assuming that Amy still loves him, sporadically calls her and leaves messages on her answering machine. He then goes to the local [[strip club]] while high, leading to an intense pornographic [[hallucination]]. He takes April ([[Chloe Hunter]]), one of the dancers he has a relationship with, home and has sex with her in a variety of positions, the last of which leaves her tied to the bed naked. As they finish, the Cook calls with an emergency regarding Nikki's dog, Taco, which needs to be taken to the [[veterinarian]]. April tells him to untie her but Ross, still high, duct-tapes April's eyes and mouth shut to keep her quiet and leaves her handcuffed to the bed, playing music to cover her gagged screams. Elsewhere, two policemen ([[Peter Stormare]] and [[Alexis Arquette]]) working with a TV crew raid the trailer where Frisbee ([[Patrick Fugit]]), another one of Spider Mike's customers, lives, falsely believing that a meth lab is located there. They take Frisbee and his overweight mother into custody and threaten him into helping them on a [[drug bust]] against Spider Mike.  After driving the Cook around town to buy [[ephedrine]] pills, beer, and [[pornography]], Ross returns to his apartment to apologize to April. In the Cook's motel room, he and Nikki have a fight after a prostitute arrives in response to the Cook's inviting her around. Nikki ends their relationship, and calls Ross and asks him to take her to a bus station so she can go back to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], which Ross does, leaving April still tied to the bed. While Ross and Nikki are out, Frisbee, now wearing a wire, visits Spider Mike to buy some meth so the cops can arrest him. When he enters, Cookie attempts to seduce him, as revenge for Spider Mike using a [[phone sex]] line, but finds the wire. As the cops burst in, a furious Spider Mike shoots Frisbee in the testicles; Spider Mike and Cookie are both arrested, and Frisbee is taken to the hospital. After Ross and Nikki go back to his apartment and find April gone (rescued by his lesbian neighbor ([[Deborah Harry]])), Ross finally drops Nikki off at the bus station, where they share a kiss, and hope to reunite if he ever goes to Vegas.  Meanwhile, the Cook's meth lab catches fire and destroys the motel room; he flees to the adult film store, where he is arrested after the owner calls the police. Once the Cook makes bail, he calls Ross asking for a ride to another dealer's house in the city, which Ross agrees to do so that he can see Amy, who also lives in the city. The dealer provides the Cook with cash, some meth, and the equipment to start a new lab. The Cook promises Ross six months' worth of meth in exchange for being his [[chauffeur]]; he agrees on the condition that he can see Amy first. Amy, who has gotten her life together, wants no part of him after seeing that he still uses drugs and can only give her $100 of the $450 he owes her. As all the other characters go to sleep, the Cook drives a depressed Ross out to an old trailer in the countryside. Ross naps in his car as the Cook sets up a new lab in the trailer, only to blow it and himself up in the process.

Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams
  The OSS now has a full child spy section, of which 13-year-old [[Carmen Cortez]] and 10-year-old [[Juni Cortez]] have become agents. Even though they were the first of the new Spy Kids Division, they were not considered the top spy kids<ref></ref>, and soon they face particularly difficult competition from Gary and Gerti Giggles, the children of double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles, whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue in the previous film. It is shown that Carmen defends Gary, and has a crush on him, which strains her relationship with Juni.  At a gala event, Donnagon somehow hacks into the [[teleprompter]] which the [[President of the United States|President]] was reading from, and is named director of the OSS. A fight ensues when a group of Magna Men arrive and render all adults unconscious. They are after the "Transmooker", a highly coveted device which can shut off all electronic devices. Juni recovers it, but drops it when Gary tries to take it from him. Gary then frames Juni for the loss, resulting in Juni being fired. In his new position as director, Donnagon can carry on with his plan to steal the Transmooker, so he can rule the world.  The next morning Carmen hacks into the database and reinstates Juni as an agent. They take a mission meant for Gary and Gerti to recover the Transmooker. She and Juni use some hints from Alexander Minion, and follow the trail to a mysterious island where all electronics refuse to work. Shortly after arriving they meet Romero, a lunatic scientist. Romero has been attempting to create [[Genetic engineering|genetically-miniaturized]] animals, so he can make a profit by selling the animals to kids in "miniature zoos." He had an experiment go wrong after accidentally pouring growth concoction onto the mutated set of animals. As a result, he is unwilling to leave his lab, out of fear of being eaten. When Carmen is captured by a Spork, a breed of flying pig, she meets Gerti, who reveals to her that Gary is genuinely evil. Carmen changes her feelings for Gary after he tries to kill Juni, and she sides with her brother. Romero, having been encouraged by Juni, finds out that his creatures are much friendlier than he thought. Carmen and Juni eventually find and recover the Transmooker, and are surprised when they are joined by their family, who were informed of their disappearance. The group is then confronted by Donnagon, who takes the Transmooker and attempts to use it to destroy the Cortez family, but it malfunctions. Gerti reveals she sabotaged it and threatens Donnagon with telling everything to her mother.  The President and his staff arrive on the island. Donnagon is fired by the President and his daughter, Alexandra; Gary is temporarily disavowed, and Gregorio is appointed director of the OSS by Alexandra on her father's behalf. Even though he is offered a promotion, Juni resigns due to the impersonal treatment he had received by the OSS after being framed. As the Cortez family leaves the island, Romero gives Juni a miniature spider-monkey as a gift, and all the island's inhabitants bid farewell to the Cortez family.  During the credits, Machete has Carmen sing as an undercover pop star in a concert. Carmen says she cannot sing so Machete gives her a microphone which [[auto-tune]]s her voice, and a belt that helps her dance. He also gives Juni a guitar that plays itself. After a successful performance, Carmen and Juni return to a shocked Machete, who discovered that he never put batteries on the device. Carmen is shocked to find out she can, in fact, sing without auto-tune. As the credits come to a close, Dinky Winks paddles to Romero's island to strike up a business deal.

He grows more discouraged after accidentally crashing  George's [[model airplane]]. Stuart's father, Frederick, tries to encourage him, telling him that "every cloud has a [[silver lining (idiom)|silver lining]]".  Later, an apparently injured [[serinus|canary]] named Margalo falls into Stuart's roadster on his way home from school. Stuart takes her home and introduces her to the Little family, where he invites Margalo to stay with them for a while, to which she accepts. However, Margalo is secretly assisting a [[peregrine falcon]] aptly named Falcon to steal valuables from households upon earning the homeowners' trust. Orphaned as a [[Fledge|fledging]], Margalo assists Falcon in exchange for a home, but Margalo grows reluctant to steal from the Littles. Unable to concentrate on her assignment for Falcon, Margalo becomes close friends with Stuart. Falcon eventually loses patience and threatens to eat Stuart unless Margalo steals Eleanor's wedding ring. Concerned for Stuart's safety, she reluctantly complies.  When the Littles discover that the ring is missing, they think it has fallen down their kitchen sink drain. Stuart offers to be lowered down the drain on a string to get it, but the string breaks while he is down the drain. A guilt-stricken Margalo saves him, then leaves the Littles' house the following night to protect Stuart. Upon realizing Margalo's disappearance, Stuart assumes she has been kidnapped by Falcon and decides to rescue her with the Littles' cat Snowbell. Running away from home, Stuart asks George to lie about his whereabouts to his parents while he is gone.  With the help of Snowbell's [[wikt:alley cat|alley cat]] friend Monty, Stuart and Snowbell discover that Falcon lives at the top of the Pishkin Building. There, Falcon reveals to Stuart that Margalo works for him, stole his mother's ring, and faked being injured. When Margalo tries to reassure Stuart that she really is his friend, Stuart begs her to come home with him. Unwilling to lose his asset in Margalo, Falcon then attempts to kill Stuart by dropping him from the top of the building. However, Stuart lands in a passing garbage truck (but is knocked unconscious upon impact). Falcon traps Margalo in a paint can as punishment for befriending Stuart, but Snowbell manages to reach the top of the building while Falcon is absent and releases her.  Regaining consciousness on a garbage [[barge]] and seemingly out of options, Stuart sadly considers giving up until he finds George's broken yet still-functioning model airplane on the barge, repairs it with various pieces of junk, and uses it to return to Margalo. Meanwhile, the Littles discover that George has been lying about Stuart's whereabouts and demand to know where he is. George tries not to break his promise, but when Frederick tells him that Stuart's safety matters more, George tells them that he is at the Pishkin Building but is still in big trouble for lying. Falcon attacks Snowbell, but Margalo declares her independence from him and attempts to flee with Eleanor's ring. Just as Falcon catches up, Stuart catches Margalo in his plane.  The Littles follow them by [[taxi]] as Stuart and Margalo fly through [[Central Park]], with Falcon in hot pursuit. Eventually, knowing they cannot outrun Falcon, Stuart decides to attack him directly. Using the glare of the Sun reflected in Eleanor's ring to temporarily blind Falcon, Stuart jumps out of the plane just before it crashes into Falcon. Margalo catches Stuart, and they reunite with the Littles to return home. Falcon, crippled and no longer able to fly, falls out of the sky and lands in a trash can where Monty is searching for food. Sometime later, Margalo says goodbye to the Littles and leaves to migrate south for the winter. After this, Martha, George and Stuart's new sister, says her first words, "Bye-bye Birdie", much to the delight of the family, who celebrate before heading into the comfort of their home.  
The Sum of All Fears (film)
 In 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], an Israeli [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]] jet carrying a nuclear weapon is shot down; 29 years later, a Syrian scrap collector uncovers a large unexploded bomb buried in a field in the Golan Heights. He sells it to a South African [[black market]] arms trafficker named Olson, who recognizes it as the nuclear bomb that was lost during the war. He then sells it to a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] group led by Austrian billionaire and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] Richard Dressler, whose aim is to start a nuclear war between the United States and Russia that will devastate them both, and leave a united [[Fascism|Fascist]] Europe to rule the world.  [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] is summoned by CIA Director William Cabot to accompany him to Russia to meet President Nemerov. In Moscow, Cabot and Ryan are allowed to examine a Russian nuclear weapons facility as prescribed by the [[START I|START treaty]], where Ryan notices the absence of three scientists listed on the facility's roster. Cabot sends operative [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]] to Russia to investigate. Clark tracks the missing scientists to a former [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet military]] facility in Ukraine, where Cabot suspects they are building a secret nuclear weapon that Russia could use without any way to trace it back to them.  Ryan and his colleagues discern that a crate from the facility in Ukraine was flown to the [[Canary Islands]], then sent to Baltimore on a cargo ship. Ryan warns Cabot, who is attending a football game in Baltimore with the President, about a bomb threat. The President is evacuated before the bomb detonates, but the city is destroyed and Cabot is killed. To escalate the situation, a corrupt [[Russian Air Force]] general who has been paid by Dressler sends [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Tu-22M Backfires]] to attack the [[USS John C. Stennis]] in the [[North Sea]].  Ryan learns from the radiation assessment team that the [[isotopic signature]] from the nuclear blast pinpoints it as having been manufactured at the [[Savannah River Site]] in South Carolina in 1968; evidence which seems to exonerate the Russians. In Syria, Clark tracks down Ghazi, one of the men who found the bomb, now dying of radiation exposure. He tells Clark that he sold the bomb to Olson, who lives in Damascus. Ryan's colleagues at Langley infiltrate Olson's computer and download files that implicate Dressler as the person who bought the plutonium and who is behind the Baltimore attack.  Ryan is able to reach the [[National Military Command Center]] in [[The Pentagon]] and get a message to Nemerov, saying that he knows that Russia was not behind the attack, while also asking Nemerov to stand down his forces as a show of good faith. Nemerov agrees to do so as President Fowler follows suit. The participants in the conspiracy, including Dressler, are assassinated. Presidents Fowler and Nemerov announce new measures to counter [[nuclear proliferation]] in joint speeches at the [[White House]], as Ryan and his fiancÃ©e Dr. Catherine Muller listen in.

The Sweetest Thing
 In an opening scene, a group of men are interviewed regarding Christina Walters ([[Cameron Diaz]]) who introduce her as a [[player (dating)|player]] and a user of men in the swinging singles market. The men include: *A neurotic loser who gets a nose bleed when she fails to call him after promising to do so. *A man who saw the movie ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'' and is calling her after 3 days, only to find that she gave him a number for [[Moviefone]]. *A man whose masculinity comes into question when he attempted to court Christina and was denied claiming her to be a [[lesbian]] *A very talkative man who ends up propelling himself off an [[exercise bike]] when he starts talking about Christina.  The scene shifts back to the sexist man whose claims of Christina's lesbianism causes an entire crowd of women to attack him with baseball bats and the movie moves along, introducing Christina Walters, a successful [[interior designer]] and Courtney Rockcliffe ([[Christina Applegate]]) who is a [[divorce]] [[lawyer]] as they console their friend and roommate Jane ([[Selma Blair]]), who had recently broken up with her boyfriend Kevin, by taking her out to a dance club and cancel their plans to stay in for pizza. At the club, Jane feels out of place and Christina grabs a man passing by to set Jane up with. She meets Peter Donahue ([[Thomas Jane]]) who confronts Christina for her methods before disappearing for the night. While in the bathroom with Courtney, she calls him by name, leading her to suspect that he got under Christina's skin and she is actually attracted to him which she denies. After running into Peter again, Christina buys him a drink and they spend time together, Peter explaining that he will be attending a wedding on Saturday and he is at the club with his obnoxious, [[womanizing]] brother Roger ([[Jason Bateman]]) to celebrate. He invites Christina and Courtney to an after-party at their hotel, but Christina goes home and later regrets not going.  The next day, Christina cannot stop talking about Peter while Jane deals with an embarrassing "cleanup" from her fun with the guy she met the night before. In the unedited version, Jane returns to the lunch and the women talk about always complimenting men for the sizes of their [[Human penis|penises]], eventually breaking out into a restaurant-wide "Penis Song". Courtney arranges for her and Christina to travel to Somerset where Peter's brother's wedding is to take place and they meet Jane's boyfriend as a recurring gag they indicate he is well [[endowed]] causing misery and enjoyment from Jane. After they leave, Christina and Courtney go on a series of misadventures including an exploding toilet, a [[glory hole (sexual slang)|glory hole]] discovery, and a motorcyclist who is led to believe Christina is giving Courtney [[oral sex]]. Meanwhile, Jane encounters her boyfriend at her [[retail]] job and is nearly caught having sex with him in the changing rooms. When Christina and Courtney finally get to Somerset, Christina begins having second thoughts after visiting a store to replace their wet and ruined clothing only to come out in extremely gaudy, indiscreet outfits, but a series of coincidences gives her a change of heart and they go to Peter's brother's wedding. Arriving, they discover that it is Peter, not Roger who is getting married and the pair nearly ruin the ceremonies in their attempts to escape. Peter and his fiance then decide that they do not want to marry each other and they call off the wedding (much to her father's chagrin) while Christina returns home and back to a newly unfulfilled life of being single again. Later, Peter finds Christina's address in the log at the store they bought their clothing in and tracks her down. Christina, determined not to fear the commitment, kisses Peter and then walks away disappointed.  Sometime later, Courtney is dating a doctor and is clearly very attracted to him, and Peter is interviewed like the men at the beginning of the film, retelling his version of the events calling her a bitch and a player, but ultimately revealing that he and Christina are together, having gotten married and are living very happily with Jane and Courtney and Roger as well. Whether they all live together is left ambiguous.

The next day, Ben nearly runs his car into Madison Bell and gives her a ride home as an apology. Later, he realizes that Madison left her notebook in his car. The notebook is filled with music notes, and Ben spots his initials written inside a staff. When he returns the notebook, he meets Madison's cousin, Christopher. Madison appears stressed and explains she has not eaten, so Ben offers to take her to dinner. At dinner, Ben tells Madison about his girlfriend, but Madison does not appear too bothered and explains that she has a boy waiting for her in [[New York City]].  Ben shares some of his past with Madison; he began doing drugs five years ago, which led to crime and six months in [[juvenile hall]], which "saved him" because he ultimately realized his passion and talent for swimming. Although Ben tries to end the date, Madison convinces him to go to the pool. Her aggressive flirtation lures Ben in, and despite his initial hesitancy, the two have sex. Both agree to remain friends and not to discuss their encounter.  The next night, Ben goes to a party at Amy's house. Amy introduces Ben to her new friend, who turns out to be Madison.

Right before their biggest swim competition, Ben is disqualified for having [[steroid]]s in his urine. Ben is outraged and suspects Madison had Josh set him up. Ben confronts Josh about the drug test, revealing his suspicion. Days later, Madison accidentally calls Josh by Ben's name while they are kissing in a car. Josh realizes that Madison's obsession with Ben is real and tells her off.  Ben tries to tell Amy everything, but she doesnât believe him. The next day, Ben goes to the pool, where he finds Josh dead. The police suspect that Ben is to blame for Josh's murder. To prove his innocence, Ben breaks into Madison's room to find evidence. He discovers a bottle of steroids and a creepy shrine of his personal belongings she has been secretly stashing. Christopher warns Ben of a similar case regarding a man named Jake Donnelly. When Ben visits Jake  in the hospital, a nurse tells him that Jake's girlfriend Madison survived the crash.  Madison disguises herself as Ben and steals his car. She follows Amy home from school and runs Amy off the road, and again Ben is framed for the crime. That night at the hospital, Ben and a few friends record as Madison confesses her crime and intentions, resulting in Madison's arrest. She escapes custody by stealing an officer's gun and shooting the two policemen escorting her. She enters Ben's house and forcibly takes Amy to the school's swimming pool. As Ben watches, Madison throws a handcuffed and chairbound Amy into the pool. Madison attacks them with the handle of a pool cleaner, and Ben grabs one end, pulling her into the pool. As Madison does not know how to swim, she drowns while Ben frees Amy from her handcuffs and carries her out of the pool. Ben resuscitates Amy via mouth-to-mouth. Later, at a swim meet, Ben is a spectator. He goes outside to his car, where he and Amy kiss and drive away.

Sweet Sixteen (2002 film)
 In a few weeks, [[Scotland|Scottish]] teenager Liam will turn 16. The film opens with him using his tripod-mounted telescope outdoors on a clear night to show other children the stars and planets. He and his friends exemplify the violent "[[Ned (Scottish)|ned]]" subculture; they no longer attend school, but instead, hang around isolated areas or wander about all day long. They get money by illicitly selling untaxed cigarettes in a pub, and defy the police. Liam's mother is currently in prison, for a crime she did not commit. She will be released in a few weeks, in time for her son's 16th birthday. She has a boyfriend named Stan, who works as a drug dealer with Liam's grandfather, Rab.  Stan and Rab take Liam in Rab's car on a visit to his mother in [[HM Prison Cornton Vale|Cornton Vale Prison]], and try to force him to smuggle drugs to his mother while they create a distraction. In the event, Liam refuses to cooperate by passing the drugs over. When driving home his companions beat him up; he fights back and gets away. Liam arrives back to find that he has been expelled from his grandfather's [[apartment|flat]], and his belongings thrown down into the front garden (including his telescope, which has been broken). Liam then moves to his sister Chantelle's nearby home in [[Port Glasgow]]. Chantelle agrees to let Liam live in her house if he's good to Chantelle's little son, Calum. She has been taking free evening classes to get work in a [[call centre]], and implores Liam to do the same because she wants Liam to do something more 'constructive' with his own life.  When Liam takes Calum for a walk along Greenock Esplanade, his friend Pinball arrives in a stolen car and insists on taking them [[Joyride (crime)|joyriding]] along the coast. They drive up through the [[Cloch]] [[Travel trailer|caravan]] (trailer) park where Liam sees a caravan for sale in a spot overlooking the scenic [[Firth of Clyde]]. Liam, who loves his mother very much, fantasizes that he, his sister, and his mother can escape to the seaside and live in the caravan, away from Stan and Rab's wrath. To purchase it he and Pinball steal a delivery of drugs from Stan's house and sell them, doing the very things Liam once hated â claiming that they will never get anywhere by selling cheap cigarettes. They soon develop 'entrepreneur skills' and raise several thousand pounds, which they pay as a deposit towards the caravan in Liam's mother's name.  Liam's efforts attract the attention of the local drug 'godfather', Tony Douglas. Liam, who only wanted a peaceful life with his mother, agrees to work with them after the local godfather tells him to 'stay away from our shops'. Pinball, meanwhile, is thrown into the health club showers due to his disrespectful manner towards the dealer, and vows revenge. Liam and Pinball carry on selling drugs to the local area, with the help of Liam's other friends who deliver pizzas. Liam and Pinball meet again with members of the drug godfather's gang, and Liam joins them in their car. Pinball is kicked out, angering him further; the gang members advise Liam to 'dump' Pinball for good. They take Liam to a [[Glasgow]] nightclub and instruct him that he has to kill someone to join the gang. Liam attempts to do so, but is stopped by the gang, who inform him it was a test (which he has passed).  Liam, Chantelle, Calum and Suzanne (Chantelle's friend) drive to the caravan to have a picnic, only to discover that it has been burned down. Liam believes it was Stan who did it, and throws a rock through his window. That evening, Pinball turns up in Douglas's (stolen) car, telling Liam that he wants revenge. He proceeds to crash the car into the health club. Liam speaks to the godfather in the morning and, to his chagrin, is ordered to "take care of" the Pinball problem (i.e. to kill his friend). The next morning, Pinball - aware of Liam's intentions - first tries to stab Liam, then proudly tells him that he's the one who burnt down the caravan, not Stan. He then cuts his own face in rage. Liam is seen reassuring his injured friend after phoning for an ambulance, but in the next scene he notifies the godfather that the deed has "been done", leaving a viewer to infer that he has indeed murdered his friend.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  Douglas promises to buy Liam an upscale apartment, and on the day before his birthday Liam's mother is released from the prison and taken to this new house on the coast of [[Gourock]] where she is welcomed with a party. She appears uneasy, and the next morning is found to have escaped to Stan's house. Liam blames this on Chantelle. Chantelle, now fully aware that Liam is dealing drugs, attempts to warn her little brother about their mother probably not being so thankful for Liam's efforts because she is too devoted to Stan, but this only provokes Liam even further. An enraged Liam goes to Stan's house, trying to convince his mother to go back to their new home, only to receive insults from Stan. In a struggle, Liam stabs Stan.  Liam is then seen walking alone on the stony beach. He is phoned by Chantelle, who reminds him that the day is his 16th birthday. She also tells him that the police have been looking for him, but that after everything that he has done, Chantelle still loves him. He walks towards the sea.

Tadpole (film)
 Oscar Grubman ([[Aaron Stanford]]) is a 15-year-old boy, portrayed as mature beyond his years, traveling home from school for [[Thanksgiving]]. He speaks fluent French, quotes [[Voltaire]] and finds girls of his own age to be inexperienced in life. When an attractive girl from his school, Miranda Spear ([[Kate Mara]]), who is obviously interested in him, approaches Oscar, he politely brushes her off. Oscar confides in his friend Charlie ([[Robert Iler]]) that he is in love with a mature woman and plans to win her heart during Thanksgiving break.  Oscar arrives at the apartment of his father, [[Columbia University]] history professor and author, Stanley Grubman ([[John Ritter]]), and stepmother, the passionate [[cardiologist]], Eve ([[Sigourney Weaver]]). That evening, the Grubmans hold a party where Stanley introduces him to a girl of his age, but Oscar rebuffs her as well while staring at the object of his affection: his stepmother.  Oscar tries to open up to her, but the unsuspecting Eve doesn't pick up on any of his advances. Stanley tells him to walk the girl home, but he hails her a cab. Depressed from his failure with the older woman, Oscar goes to a bar and gets drunk. He bumps into Eve's best friend, [[chiropractor]] Diane Lodder ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]), who offers to take him to her own apartment seeing his current condition. Once there, Diane begins to massage him and they end up having sex. Oscar wakes the next morning and has an awkward encounter with Diane's boyfriend, Phil.  Back at home, Oscar plans a surprise lunch for Eve but first Stanley inquires about where Oscar spent the night. Oscar makes up a story about meeting Miranda Spear from school. He brings lunch to Eve at her lab, where he opens up to her once more, pondering the use of the heart as a symbol for affection. Together they decide that the liver should be the new symbol for love.  Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Stanley, who mentions that Diane will be joining them for dinner. Worried that Diane will tell Eve about their tryst, Oscar finds Diane at a tea room with several of her friends. All act as though they know about the previous evening, and most of the women twice his age flirt with him. Oscar makes Diane promise to keep last night a secret from Stanley and especially Eve.  At dinner, Diane drinks and behaves coyly. She plays footsie with Oscar and flirts with him in French. After she excuses herself from the table, Oscar follows to confront her. She kisses him while not being totally out of Stanley's view, after which Diane admits to Stanley and Eve that she and Oscar are lovers.  The next day, Diane explains to Eve that she found Oscar a charming young man. Eve condemns her for seducing a mere 15-year-old, but Diane says many women would have done the same, including perhaps Eve. Later that day, Eve and Oscar play a tense round of tennis, lobbing insults at each other, ending up with Oscar getting hit in the head with a ball. Oscar explains to Eve that he only did what he did with Diane because he was drunk and she was wearing Eve's scarf. Eve immediately understands that he is in love with her. They share a passionate kiss but Eve eventually breaks away.  At the end of Thanksgiving break, Eve and Stanley take Oscar to the train. Eve asks Oscar how his liver feels and he replies that it hurts, but is not broken. She also tells him how much she loves his father. On the train, Oscar meets up with Charlie, and runs into Miranda. Miranda quotes Voltaire, "If we do not find something pleasant at least we will find something new," and looks longingly at Oscar. Charlie notices this and Oscar tells Charlie that Miranda smells nice. Charlie asks about Eve and Oscar states that his obsession with Eve was not as important as it seemed. Charlie doesn't understand his friend, but Oscar smiles as the train rolls on.  
Talk to Her
 The story unfolds in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, giving details of two separate relationships that become intertwined with each other.  During a performance of ''CafÃ© MÃ¼ller'', a [[Tanztheater|dance-theatre]] piece by [[Pina Bausch]], Benigno MartÃ­n and Marco Zuluaga cross paths, but the two men are no more than strangers. Still, Benigno notices that Marco cries.  Marco is a journalist and travel writer who happens to see a TV interview with Lydia GonzÃ¡lez, a famous female [[matador]]. He thinks that an article on her would be interesting and, on the instructions of his editor, he contacts her in a bar, where she asks him to take her to her house. As they talk, she elaborates on the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend âel NiÃ±o de Valenciaâ, another matador, something that has been all over the tabloids. As Marco confesses that he knows nothing of bullfighting and that he is a journalist, she becomes angry and leaves his car without saying a word. As he drives off, he hears a scream inside her house and stops; Lydia rushes off and climbs back into his car: she asks him to kill a snake that she found in her house. He does so and comes out of the house crying. With that new confidence established between them, they become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and is surprised to find Lydia there too, since she had said that she did not want to go. The wedding turns out to be that of Marcoâs former fiancÃ©e, Angela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia; Marco was very much in love with Angela and had a very hard time getting over her (which was the reason for his constant crying over things he could not share with her). Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon; but she is gored and becomes [[coma]]tose. Marco does not leave her side at the hospital and finally befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the dance-theatre performance. Marco is told by the doctors that people in a coma never wake up and that, while there are miracle-stories of people who have come back, he should not keep his hopes high.  Benigno is a personal nurse and caregiver for Alicia Roncero, a beautiful dance student, who lies in a coma, but Benigno sees her as alive; he talks his heart out to her, and brings her all kinds of dancing and silent black and white film mementos. As it turns out, Benigno had been obsessed with Alicia for a while, before she was in a coma, since his apartment is in front of the dance studio where she practiced every day. At first his obsession was only from a distance, since Benigno was taking care of his possessive mother, who seemed to be immobile. For that reason, he became a nurse and also a beautician. Free to move about after his mother dies, he finally picks up the courage to talk to Alicia, after she dropped her wallet on the street. As they walk together to her house, they talk about her discovery of silent black and white films and about dancing. When she walks into her building, Benigno notices that she lives in the house of Dr Roncero, who is a psychiatrist. Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor and talks about his unresolved bereavement grief over his mother. But it is all a ruse to gain access to the apartment, where he steals a hair-clip from Aliciaâs room. That night, Alicia is run over by a car and becomes comatose. By mere chance, Benigno is assigned to Alicia, much to the surprise of her father. But since Benignoâs services are the best, he hires him and a colleague permanently to tend for Alicia. Benigno also tells Dr. Roncero that he is [[gay]], possibly so that Alicia's father will not suspect his love for her, or possibly so that he will not question Benigno's particular attachment to her.  Benigno keeps telling Marco that he should talk to Lydia because, despite the fact that they are in a coma, women understand and react to menâs problems. Eventually, Marco learns from el NiÃ±o de Valencia that Lydia and el NiÃ±o had decided to be together again, and that she intended to tell Marco.  So Marco finds himself alone again. As he is about to leave, he comes into Aliciaâs room, looking for Benigno, but he instead finds himself opening his heart out to her, despite his scepticism over Benignoâs theories. Benigno and Marco leave the hospital and, in the parking lot, Benigno tells Marco of his plans to marry Alicia: Marco is taken aback, telling his friend that Alicia is basically dead and cannot express her will in any manner. But Benigno does not hear any reason. During a routine review at the hospital, the supervisors notice that Alicia has missed several periods; since this is a common occurrence with people in a coma, they do not think twice over it. In reality, Alicia was raped months before and is pregnant, Benigno is the main suspect and is later sent to prison.  Marco has left Spain to write a book about travelling. Months later, in Jordan, he reads in a newspaper that Lydia has finally died, having never awakened from her coma. He phones the hospital, looking for Benigno, only to hear that Benigno does not work there any more. Marco manages to talk to another nurse whom he had befriended; she tells him that Benigno is now in prison for the alleged rape of Alicia. Marco returns to Spain and visits Benigno, who asks him to hire a new lawyer and find out what happened to Alicia. Marco stays in Benignoâs apartment and sees that Alicia has awakened during or after delivering a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] baby. Following the urging of Benigno's lawyer, Marco does not tell Benigno about Alicia's unexpected recovery. Desperate, Benigno writes a farewell letter to Marco and takes a large quantity of pills, to try to "escape" into a coma, thus reuniting with Alicia. He dies of an overdose.  Meanwhile, Alicia has begun rehabilitation to recover her ability to walk and dance. The film ends in the same theatre where it began, where Marco and Alicia meet by chance.

T.T. Syndrome
  In 1958 a disheveled young woman named Margita stumbles into a [[Turkish bath]], gives birth in one of the restrooms, and flushes the baby (the result of a rape) down a toilet. Twenty-two years later, a [[Punk subculture|punk]] couple having sex in the same bathhouse are killed and dismembered by someone, who flushes the victims' remains down a toilet before meticulously cleaning the crime scene.  Nineteen years later, Teodora, her boyfriend Vaki, and their friends Tina and Sale visit the bathhouse (where what sounds like an infant's cries and laughter frequently emanate from the plumbing) to buy drugs from a pair of dealers named Cane and SleÅ¡. Aside from those two, the only other people in the building are an attendant, a wino, and a gay [[Magister degree|magistar]] named Djordjevic. While Vaki and Sale are purchasing the narcotics from Cane, someone murders both SleÅ¡ and Tina, the latter in front of a hiding Teodora. After finding Tina's body and the traumatized Teodora, everyone attempts to flee the bathhouse, the exits to which have all been sealed. Convinced that the drunk is the murderer, Cane impulsively shoots him to death; the man is afterward revealed to have been innocent when Sale discovers that his dropped [[camcorder]] had briefly recorded the real killer, who is wearing boots similar to Djordjevic's.  The men lock Djordjevic in a washroom stall and explore the bathhouse with Teodora, uncovering the attendant's body (which later vanishes) and a tunnel to the sewers in her living quarters. Vaki and Djordjevic are both murdered by the killer, who is revealed to be the attendant, who is also Margita. Convinced that the baby (called "Cloaca") that she had flushed down a toilet decades ago is somehow still alive and living in the sewers, Margita has spent years murdering visitors to the bathhouse so that she can feed her offspring their body parts by flushing them down the building's toilets. Assisting Margita are a deranged former professor named Dragi HadÅ¾iToÅ¡iÄ (who has filled the sewers with traps for catching both people and crocodiles) and Cane, who she had abducted as a toddler and raised as her son.  As the psychotic family prepares to butcher their captives, they begin succumbing to infighting; Margita slits HadÅ¾iToÅ¡iÄ's throat because Cane had been accidentally injured by one of his traps, and because he appeared to be attracted to Teodora, who manages to break free of her restraints and stab Margita. Teodora then releases Sale and together the two enter the sewers, pursued by Cane, who Teodora shoves into a pit where he is seemingly eaten by an entity implied to be Cloaca. Upon reaching the surface, Teodora and Sale are confronted by the wounded Margita, but are saved by a passing vagrant, who dies killing Margita (who, with her dying breath, reveals that Teodora is pregnant). The film ends with a scene of Teodora giving birth to a child who is implied to have the same disorder ("T.T. Syndrome") as Cloaca.  
Tarzan & Jane
 The film makes use of a [[Frame story|frame tale]] to present three self-contained "episodes" via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]] and [[Tarzan]]'s first wedding anniversary has arrived, and Jane is trying to find a suitable present for her husband, with the help of the elephant [[Tantor]] and the gorilla [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]].  When a party is suggested, the trio remember the disaster that occurred when three of Jane's friends arrived for a visit. Jane had organized an English-style picnic for her friends, but Tarzan had refused to join them after believing Jane was embarrassed by him. The picnic was interrupted when two panthers, Nuru and Sheeta attacked Jane and her friends, forcing them to flee into the deeper regions of the jungle. As Jane taught her friends a few survival techniques, they were once again ambushed by the panthers, only to be saved when Tarzan rushed in.  Back to the present day, Jane ponders over the idea of expensive gifts, particularly jewelry, prompting Terk to remind her of the time Tarzan tried to get her a diamond. Tarzan had led two men, Johannes Niels and Merkus to a nearby volcano containing a diamond mine, only for them to turn on him once inside. The volcano then erupted with Tarzan, Jane and Professor Porter trapped inside, though they managed to escape before the lava flows reached them. Tarzan then rescued Johannes and Merkus, only for them to lose their diamonds in the process. They are arrested after this.  Professor Porter then joins the conversation, suggesting to Jane that she and Tarzan should celebrate their anniversary with a dance. This causes Terk to bring up the time Jane's old friend Robert Canler visited. Things had gone well, despite Tarzan feeling jealous and mistrusting towards Canler (claiming that he is a bad man that Jane dismisses), until Canler had revealed he was working as a double agent and had come for a code machine disguised as a music box he gave to Jane. He then kidnapped her, but was tracked down and stopped by Tarzan assisted by RAF pilot Nigel Taylor, who had been on Canler's trail.  After running out of ideas and realizing anniversaries would not fit in with Tarzan's uncivilized lifestyle, a disappointed Jane returns to the treehouse, only to find it decorated and everyone, including Tarzan, who is wearing his father's suit, had planned a surprise party. Terk, Tantor and the Professor had known about it all along. Tarzan gives Jane a diamond ring made from the same diamonds in the volcano. The celebrations start as everyone dances, including Tarzan and Jane, as the story concludes with the couple dancing under the moonlight.  
Teddy Bears' Picnic (film)
 ''Teddy Bears' Picnic'' covers an annual encampment of prominent male leaders at the Zambezi Glen, a thinly-veiled reference to the [[Bohemian Grove]].    The film starts out with the first ever women's day at the glen, where wives and girlfriends of Zambezi members are invited to visit the glen ahead of the annual encampment, which also serves to introduce the glen and the characters to the audience. The actual retreat itself begins after the members have returned without any women and kicks off with the "Assassination of Time", based on the real ''[[Cremation of Care]]'' at the Bohemian Grove, with a pelican replacing the latter's owl. After that, the festivities begin, including an all-male chorus line in drag, which is photographed by one of the club employees who smuggles out the pictures to the news media.  This violation of the privacy of the glen causes the leaders of the membership to work on spin control, while the employee who took the pictures is emboldened by his success and the promise of a hefty reward to record footage of the glen with a camera smuggled in with the help of a local newscaster. In this time we also see what members do to enjoy themselves at the retreat, including drinking, urinating on trees while naked, and visiting nearby prostitutes.  After filming some of the activities at the glen, the cameraman is spotted by some members and flees into the woods. From here, the members invoke their privilege and connections, with disastrous results.  The members call in the military to track down the cameraman with dogs, flares, and helicopters, which sets off a forest fire. When the road out of the glen is blocked by an overturned truck filled with drinks for the glen members, one of the characters orders his chauffeur to drive through anyway, making the blockage worse. A helicopter flying without lights at night at the behest of one of the members collides with a news helicopter covering the fire.  
Ted Bundy (film)
 In [[Seattle, Washington]], 1974, law student [[Ted Bundy]] ([[Michael Reilly Burke]]) appears to be the typical friendly guy-next-door; but underneath this gentle facade lies a monster. After watching women from their home window while masturbating, Bundy builds the courage to commit his first murder. From there, he always manages to lure a young woman to his car by faking a broken arm or an illness then asking for help or by disguising himself as a police officer. Then he knocks her unconscious with a tool, ties her up and drives her to an arranged location where he rapes and murders her. Driving his yellow VW Beetle, he leaves a bloody trail through the [[United States]]. The police are left in the dark, as no one suspects the young man for his reputable character in the community; being a model citizen and top-student.  In 1975, one of his victims, Tina Gabler, escapes him when she throws herself from his moving car. Based on her description of his car, Bundy is stopped by a police officer and arrested. In his trunk, the officers find pantyhose masks, a hand saw, a crowbar, knives, ropes and handcuffs. Even though he is identified by Tina Gabler in a lineup, he denies ever having seen the woman. When he is visited by his girlfriend at the Colorado State Prison, he admits to her that charges are being brought against him for multiple murders but stresses the fact that there is no evidence, however, and that he will never be convicted; at this point she distances herself from him. Due to his wish to defend himself, he is granted access to the courthouse law library, and promptly escapes by jumping from an upper story window. He is jailed again after an auto theft, but manages to escape yet again months later. This time he overpowers four women in their home and brutally beats them. After the murder of a little girl he becomes heavily intoxicated and is recognized by a police officer and arrested after a short chase. At trial the judge sentences Ted to be executed by electric chair. After a brief chat on the phone, he makes a final statement before the execution is carried out.  
Ten (2002 film)
 The film is divided into ten scenes, each of which depict a conversation between an unchanging female driver (played by Mania Akbari) and a variety of passengers as she drives around [[Tehran]].<ref>[http://www.yorku.ca/jmarches/visiblecity/ten.pdf Driving Affect: The car and Kiarostami's Ten] â article by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-balaisis-9291b033 Nicholas Balaisis] at [http://www.yorku.ca/index.html York University]</ref><ref>[http://www.moviemail.com/blog/foreign-classics/1550-Abbas-Kiarostami-s-Ten-Reinventing-the-Road-Movie/ Abbas Kiarostami's Ten - Reinventing the Road Movie] â review by [http://www.journalistdirectory.com/journalist/XigzX/David-Parkinson  David Parkinson] at [http://www.moviemail.com Moviemail], June 26, 2013</ref> Her passengers include her young son (played by Akbari's real life son, [[Amin Maher]]), her sister, a bride, a prostitute, and a woman on her way to prayer. One of the major plots during the film is the driver's divorce from her (barely seen) husband, and the conflict that this causes between mother and son.  The first vignette of the film is a conversation between the first passenger, the driverâs son Amin, and his mother, as he is being driven to the local pool. The film maintains a singular shot of the boy for almost 17 minutes, until the driver is finally shown. Over the course of their conversation, the driver raises her voice to her son and tensions escalate. Amin interrupts his mother, yells over her, and calls her a âselfish womanâ. It is revealed that the driver had to lie in order to get a divorce from her husband, Aminâs father, due to the limited rights women are given the court system. Amin is upset that his mother told the court that his father was a drug-addict, when this was in fact untrue. Their conversation quickly erupts into a fight between mother and son and the argument ends with Amin abruptly exiting the car.   The second vignette features the driverâs sister who works as a teacher. They discuss various topics during the course of their drive including the heavy burden and expectations children place on their parents. Both of their children have accused the women of not being good mothers. They eventually go to a bakery to pick up a birthday cake for the driverâs husband, Mortaza.  The driverâs sister offers her advice regarding Amin and his rude behavior as of late. She advises her sister to let Amin live with his father who will be able to âset him straightâ.   During the third vignette, the driver picks up a pious old woman who goes to the Mausoleum three times a day to pray. She reveals that her husband and 12-year-old son have both died. She goes to the Mausoleum to pray for them. She has sold her possessions in order to go on a pilgrimage to Syria and has given away her other possessions to people who are less fortunate than her. Their conversation ends as the driver drops the old woman off at the Mausoleum after she is unable to convince the driver to go in an pray herself.  The fourth vignette starts just as the driver has picked up a female sex worker. The sex worker had mistaken the driver for a male client and gotten into her car. The driver continues to drive around with the unnamed sex worker and is persistent in asking her personal questions. The sex worker feels as though the driver is lecturing her and talking down to her. In turn, the sex worker ends up lecturing the driver. She tells the driver that many of her clients are married men that get calls from their wives while they are with the sex worker. She admits to the driver that she feels bad for women who are idiotic enough to cling onto men and who actually believe that men are truthful. The sex worker was engaged to a man once until she realized she was âfoolishâ. The conversation ends as she is dropped off and immediately picked up by a client.   The fifth vignette features a woman whose relation to the driver is unclear. The woman is picked up just after she has prayed at the Mausoleum. The two women discuss religion and whether or not they are believers. The passenger confesses that she had not been a believer in the past, and now she is not so sure. The passenger tells the driver that she was supposed to get married and she now prays at the Mausoleum with the hope that the man she is dating will propose soon.   In the next vignette, the driver is picking up her son, Amin, from her ex-husband who has been taking care of him. The driver and the ex-husband each stay in their separate cars and Amin crosses a busy traffic-filled street to get into his motherâs car. The driver asks her husbandâs permission to keep Amin overnight and he eventually agrees. Amin disagrees with his mother over a shortcut to his grandmotherâs house, but eventually realizes his mother is going the right way. Amin tells his mom that his father has been watching porn at home alone at night.   The driver next picks up her crying sister who is distraught over her husband leaving after 7 years together. As she cries, the driver tells her, âIt is wrong to cling to himâ. The driver is reciting almost exactly what the sex worker had told her the night before. The driver is very frank and harsh with her sister. She tells her to toughen up and stop being so weak.    During the eighth vignette, the driver is with her son Amin again. Amin asks his mother what âsheâ said. The audience does not know who âsheâ is. However, the driver says the woman told her Amin is a man and therefore needs to live and learn from a man. The driver agrees that Amin should go live with his father and that it will be best for him. The mother and son then have a conversation about the ex-husband finding a new wife. Amin says that his new wife would be better than his mother. Amin proposes that the new wife would obey her husband, cook a new meal every night, and wonât be out all the time. Amin and his mother disagree again over a shortcut and soon their argument escalates to the point where Amin abruptly gets out the car again.   The ninth vignette features the same woman from vignette five. She is telling the driver that her boyfriend does not want to marry her, despite her hopes that he will. She feels jealous over the fact that he is thinking of another woman and that is what hurts her the most. Part way through their conversation, the driver asks her passenger why her veil is so tight. It is revealed that the passenger has shaved her head.   The final vignette is the shortest. The driver picks up her son from the father. The film ends as the driver is taking her son to his grandmaâs house.  
Tattoo (2002 film)
 Marc Schrader, a [[rookie]] cop caught red-handed with drugs in a police raid of an illegal [[rave]], joins a [[homicide]] investigation conducted by Chief Inspector Minks.  The victim is a naked young woman with the skin stripped off her back, killed as she staggered into traffic.  As Schrader and Minks investigate the murder, the case is complicated by a finger found in the stomach of the victim. [[Forensic]] examination proves the finger belongs to Nobert GÃ¼nzel, who was previously convicted of [[rape]] and [[assault]].  The police raid GÃ¼nzelâs residence, and discover a blood-stained table with restraints and bits of human flesh in his basement. They also find video equipment and preserved, tattooed skin from the victimâs back. Soon, they found dead bodies buried in the garden. GÃ¼nzel then goes missing.  As the complex investigation progresses, Schrader discovers Mink has a personal stake in the investigation; he wants to find the missing daughter of an old friend. He realizes later that the missing girl is actually Minkâs runaway daughter. As the body count rises, the duo has to come to terms with their inner demons, and the truth is much darker than it seems.  The plot resembles the [[Roald Dahl]] short story "Skin."<ref>"While the subject of people being murdered for their tattoos is not new (Roald Dahl's short-story "Skin" covers the same ground), the film's plot is gripping and effectively told."

His mother Mary Parks (Desiree Zurowski) comes in to comfort him and assures him the monster he thinks is in the closet is imaginary. As he tries to fall asleep again he sees a dark [[ghost|apparition]] in his closet staring at him and pulls the covers on top of himself and turns on a flashlight. As he peeks outside the covers he is captured and spirited away by the mysterious apparition.  In present day 2002, the plot focuses on the story of a Psychology grad student named Julia Lund ([[Laura Regan]]) and the events that turned her life upside down. As a child she experienced horrifying [[night terrors]] that manifested after witnessing her father commit suicide, but has seemingly overcome the problem. She reunites with a childhood friend, a now grown-up Billy ([[Jon Abrahams]]). In the diner Billy is constantly startled by the flickering lights as he is now deathly afraid of the dark. He tells her that he believes their night terrors are caused by something otherworldly as he was kidnapped by mysterious creatures as a child and went missing for two days. He warns her to stay out of the dark, before suddenly committing suicide.  Julia stays over at her paramedic boyfriend Paul Loomis' ([[Marc Blucas]]) apartment for comfort and to grieve. As Julia is sleeping she is awakened by the ringing of Paul's phone and answers, but with no response. Julia then hears the shower running and investigates but finds no one inside. A mysterious black fluid then erupts from the sink drain and frightens Julia who then opens the bathroom mirror shelf to find an alternate dimension inside with mysterious creatures. Out of curiosity she sticks her hand in only to yank it out coated with the same black matter from the drain which starts to violently break her fingers, she closes the shelf only to encounter a reflection of one of the creatures in the mirror. Paul hears her screams and comes to check on her only for Julia to viciously assault him until she realizes it is him. Puzzled, Paul brings up the possibility that she might have been sleepwalking since she does not appear to remember what happened.  At his funeral, Julia consoles Billy's parents Mary and David Parks (Peter LaCroix) and meets up with two of Billy's friends and roommates; Terry Alba ([[Dagmara Dominczyk]]), and Sam Burnside ([[Ethan Embry]]), who slowly begin to believe his claims as they also experienced night terrors as children and suspect they are returning. Offended by Sam's careless comment Julia walks away and visits Billy's childhood room and discovers his drawer filled with [[Energizer]] and [[Duracell]] batteries. Terry then shows up and apologizes for Sam's insensitivity and informs her that Billy used to talk a lot about Julia to her and Sam, about his experiences with the return of his night terrors, and why he was obsessed with staying out of the dark - hence the drawer filled with batteries.  As Julia is driving in the middle of nowhere her radio starts to malfunction and an unknown creature sprints across the windshield as the car mysteriously stops. As she is attempting to fix the problem she notices a mysterious creature in the nearby lake. Nervous, she manages to fix the car issue and as she is attempting to start the car she is startled by a vision of Billy and stumbles onto the road only to nearly get hit by an oncoming truck. Julia visits Paul's apartment for comfort only to discover him drunk with his friends Troy ([[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]]) and Darren ([[Jonathan Cherry]]). Disgusted, Julia leaves instantly.  At Terry and Sam's apartment the remaining trio study Billy's diary to learn of his experiences. Terry and Sam then ask Julia if she has experienced any return of the night terrors, which Julia denies. Terry then realizes that Julia doesn't seem to remember the sheer terror she felt as a child and explains the origin of her night terrors which started when she was 5 years old, after witnessing her sister drown in a lake where her family would spend their summers. In one instance, she woke up screaming and her parents comforted her and put her back to sleep. Her mother checked on her a few hours later and she was gone. After searching throughout the entire house her father found her in the dog house, and as he reached in to grab her she stabbed him in the eye with a kitchen knife as she was convinced he wasn't her father and that he was some kind of demon.  Julia is at first skeptical but slowly starts to believe in her friends stories after meeting a little girl named Sarah ([[Jodelle Micah Ferland]]), one of Dr. Booth's ([[Jay Brazeau]]) patients who also suffers from night terrors which started after her mother's untimely death. Sarah claims "They" are going to get her and eat her in her horrible nightmares and the only thing that keeps them away is lights. She then starts picking at a strange mark on her arm; a similar mark that also appeared on Billy's hand, Sam's shoulder, and Terry's ankle. Terry and Sam are soon dragged away by the creatures  Julia finally believes in the stories as her night terrors return and she begins to doubt her perception of the world around her. It turns out her mental illness is caused by creatures only she can see who are attempting to consume her. At a bathroom in a Chinese restaurant she discovers the mark left by "They" on her forehead and slowly pulls out a black needle from the mark and she starts to panic. She runs to Paul's apartment out of fear. Paul, now completely convinced that Julia is insane, drugs a drink with a sleeping pill and gives it to her. Paul tells her that everything will be okay and she will soon fall asleep, and he attempts to call Dr. Booth. Realizing he drugged her and knowing she can't risk falling asleep she escapes his apartment and runs to the subway station to vomit the sleeping pill on the tracks, only to get trapped in the station as the closing gates lock her in.  Trapped, she is forced to ride a train home, noticing she is the only passenger on the train, which makes her uneasy. The train's lights start to flicker and the vehicle stops completely. She gets off and sees all the light bulbs burst in the train tunnel, then the train automatically starts and abandons her as the creatures assault her. Julia is continuously attacked by the creatures in the darkness of the tunnel but manages to escape. She is finally discovered by a group of engineers who attempt to help her, only for Julia to violently assault them with shards of glass, being convinced they are not human.  She is hospitalized at a mental institution by Dr. Booth and Paul where she is attacked once more and transported into the separate dimension she previously saw, only this time inside of a closet. Here she screams for help towards Dr. Booth and an orderly, both of whom cannot see her. The closet door is shut by Dr. Booth and the creatures proceed to attack her.

Time Changer
 Bible professor Russell Carlisle ([[D. David Morin]]) confronts and lectures a boy who has stolen marbles from his neighbors, calling his action [[unjust]].  The year is 1890 and Carlisle has written a new manuscript entitled ''The Changing Times'', which promotes good morals without discussing Christ. The book is on track to receive a unanimous endorsement from the board of the Grace Bible Seminary. That is, until colleague Dr. Norris Anderson (Gavin MacLeod) objects. Without unanimous endorsement, his book might not do so well. Carlisle and another professor seek a unanimity rule change, but the dean insists that Carlisle discuss the disagreement with Anderson privately.  Dr. Anderson fears that Carlisle's book could harm coming generations, arguing that teaching good moral values without mentioning Christ is wrong. Using a secret time machine, Anderson sends Carlisle over 100 years into the future, offering him a glimpse of where his beliefs will lead.  Arriving in the early 21st century, Carlisle is shocked to find that half of all marriages end in divorce (instead of 5% in 1890), teenagers talk openly about deceiving their parents, movies contain blasphemous language and people who go to church are so bored by the sermons that they need extra activities. He tries to convince a laundromat worker, Eddie Martinez ([[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]]), to go to church and read the Bible.  Two churchgoing men grow suspicious of Carlisle, who acts as if he's seeing everything for the first time. They confront him as he is about to be transported back to the past. As the sky grows thunderous, Carlisle seems delirious as he talks about how the second coming of Christ is drawing near. Carlisle vanishes. The men look at where he vanished and one of the men says with dread, "I think we just missed the Rapture."  Carlisle rematerializes in 1890 and excitedly tells Anderson he will revise his book. He gives the thieving boy his own set of marbles and explains that it is Jesus Christ who demands honesty. Anderson tries to learn when the world will come to an end, by trying to send a Bible to the future. The machine won't operate with a target date of 2100, so he tries with progressively earlier decades 2090, 2080 and 2070, which fail. As the film ends, he makes at least two more failed attempts, aiming earlier and earlier, suggesting that either humanity cannot know when the End comes, or that the End will come before the mid-21st century.

One night, Sam and Silvy decide to go for an aimless ride, and end up at a river. Sam jumps in the water and removes Silvy's leg braces, and together they "dance" in the water.

  In 1899, Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor teaching at [[Columbia University]] in New York City. Unlike his friend David Philby, Alexander would rather do pure research than work in the world of business. After a mugger kills his [[fiancÃ©e]], Emma, he devotes himself to building a time machine that will allow him to [[time travel|travel back in time]] to save her. When he completes the machine four years later in 1903, he travels back to 1899 and prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a [[horseless carriage]] frightens the horses of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]].  Alexander realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her death through other circumstances. Distraught, Alexander travels to 2030 to discover whether science has been able to solve his question of how to change the past. At the [[New York Public Library]], a holographic sentient librarian called Vox 114 insists that time travel is impossible. Alexander travels to 2037, when the accidental destruction of the [[Moon]] by [[colonization of the Moon|lunar colonists]] has begun rendering the Earth virtually uninhabitable. While restarting the time machine to avoid debris, he is knocked unconscious and travels to the year 802,701 before reawakening.  The human race has reverted to a primitive lifestyle and the Earth has healed. Some survivors, called "Eloi", live on the sides of cliffs of what was once [[Manhattan]]. Alexander is nursed back to health by a woman named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speak English. He observes the broken moon and suggests that maybe his teachings led to this future. One night, Alexander and Mara's young brother, Kalen, dream of a frightening, jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name. Alexander informs Mara of the dream and she tells him they all have that dream, and she notices that his watch is missing. The next day, the Eloi are attacked and Mara is dragged underground by ape-like monsters. The creatures are called "Morlocks" and they hunt the Eloi for food. In order to rescue her, Kalen leads Alexander to Vox 114, which is still functional after 800,000 years.  After learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alexander enters their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits in a cage. Alexander meets an intelligent, humanoid Morlock, who explains that Morlocks are the evolutionary descendants of the humans who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi are evolved from those who remained on the surface. The humanoid Morlocks are a caste of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks.  The Morlock explains that Alexander cannot alter Emma's fate, because her death is what drove him to build the time machine in the first place: saving her would be a virtual impossibility due to [[temporal paradox]]. He then reveals that the Morlocks have brought the time machine underground, and tells Alexander to get into it and return home. Alexander gets into the machine but pulls the Morlock in with him, carrying them into the future as they fight. The Morlock dies by rapidly aging when Alexander pushes him outside of the machine's temporal bubble. Alexander stops in the year 635,427,810, revealing a harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves.  Accepting that he cannot save Emma, Alexander travels back to rescue Mara. After freeing her, he starts the time machine and jams its gears, creating a violent distortion in time. Pursued by the Morlocks, Alexander and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves along with the time machine. Alexander begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi.  In 1903, Philby and Mrs. Watchit, Alexander's housekeeper, are in his laboratory discussing his absence. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad that Alexander has gone to a place where he can find peace, then tells her that he would like to hire her as a housekeeper, which she accepts until Alexander returns. Mrs. Watchit bids Alexander farewell and Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately, then throws his bowler hat away in tribute to Alexander's distaste for conformity.  
Titli (2002 film)

The dense jungles of [[Duars]] in north Bengal, covered in dense morning fog, sunshine playing hide-and-seek, Buddhist monasteries, the famous [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Darjeeling toy train]], interleaved with poetry and music, create the romantic ambiance underpinning this film.  Titli is a 17-year-old girl ([[Konkona Sen Sharma]]), who has a teenage crush on a [[Bollywood]] superstar Rohit Roy ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), who is more than twice her age.  Though her bedroom is filled with his posters and memorabilia, Titli's mother Urmila ([[Aparna Sen]]) is surprised to learn that she could even marry this much older man.  Titli and Urmila are going by jeep to receive Titliâs father ([[Dipankar De]]) from the airport.  Along the scenic road from [[Kurseong]] to [[Siliguri]], Urmila shares a nostalgic moment when she is reminded about her teenage crush on [[Rajesh Khanna]] after hearing Titli play the song "[[Mere sapno ki rani|Meri Sapnon Ki Raani Kab Aayegi Tu]]".  The jeep is to be shared, and as it happens, their co-passenger is none other than Rohit Roy himself, who has a flight to catch from [[Siliguri]].  Titli's adolescent dreams are set on fire after she meets her crush face to face.  Their conversation is interrupted by a halt necessitated by the coolant running out.  Rohit also needs cigarette, and Titli wants to get them, and gets Rohit to agree.  While she is gone, it is revealed that twenty years ago, Urmila and Rohit were lovers, when Rohit was an outsider looking for roles in the [[Tollygunge]] film industry. Today, Urmila is married, but the lingering romance is built up by the hill greenery and they both reminisce longingly.  Urmila recites lines from the well-known [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]] poem ''Abani Bari Aachho''? (Abani, are you home?)  One of the themes of the film is "the first day of the rains".  Urmila wonders if it is the first day of [[Aasharh]] - the month heralding the [[monsoon]]s in the [[Bengali calendar]], a month rendered romantic in [[Kalidasa]]âs epic verse, [[Meghadutam]].  Rohit feels a droplet of rain on his watch.  The foggy romantic mood heightens as Urmila sings a [[Rabindrasangeet]] and recites a [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]] poem.  By now, unbeknownst to the old lovers, Titli has returned, and she overhears the conversation, and learns of their relationship. Her own romance is shattered, and John Lennonâs "Strawberry fields forever" builds up the mood of desolation. Titli is on the verge of tears as she grapples with the fact that her own mother has become her immediate rival.  She has always been very close to her mother, and the tension mounts as she does not know how to deal with this pain. Eventually, Titli cannot suppress her curiosity if her mother still loves Rohit.  In the end, when Rohit writes a letter to Urmila about his engagement to another woman, she gets her answer.  The film is very stylishly made, even this end story coinciding with the announcement on a magazine cover - "Bangali Babur Biye" (Bengali gentleman gets married).

Meanwhile, in the basement, a wizard named Chip is making a magical potion. He uses his magic ring to make his potion, until he realizes that it doesn't work. Chip checks the milk carton that he used on the portion, but there is no substitution for the milk of a cow that lives in Calcutta.  Later, Tom ends up being thrown into the basement, and Chip orders him to guard his magic ring while he goes to Calcutta to milk a cow. If Tom does a good job, he'll be rewarded with a big juicy salmon, but if not, Chip warns that "there will one less kitty to clean up after here", which means that Tom will be kicked out of the house with no return for good. Chip leaves for Calcutta by using his motorcycle, leaving Tom to guard the ring in the basement. Unbeknownst to Tom, an interested Jerry finds the ring, while climbing the table and puts it on his head. Tom spots Jerry, and orders him to give back the ring, but to no avail. Soon, Jerry runs out of the house, and Tom frantically attempts to find and hunt down him.  After losing Tom, Jerry attempts to get the ring removed by going to a jewelry store owned by a diamond cutter. However, the store is closed and the owner has left to get some lunch. Tom sneaks into the store and disguises himself as a worker, using his tail for a mustache and attempting to help Jerry get the ring off, but meets with no success. He fails as well and he blows his cover when his mustacheâand his tailâfall off, revealing his true identity. Tom chases Jerry throughout the store, and soon, the diamond cutter returns. Tom and Jerry exit the store. Tom destroys the store and ends up getting chased away by the owner.  Jerry runs off into a fortune-teller home, where an Irish dog [[Butch Dog (Tex Avery)|Butch]] and [[Droopy]] are residing in. After seeing how lovely Jerry's ring looks, and including the fact that Jerry wants it removed, Butch attempts to pull it off, but fails. Tom comes in, and Jerry runs out, with Butch chasing after him as well. Soon, they end up in an alley, where an alley cat happens to be taking a nap. He wakes up and tries to grab Jerry for his dinner. Tom successfully grabs Jerry in time, and by flicking the ring on his head, makes random objects fall on a horrified alley cat. Butch then comes and is able to get the ring off Jerry's head after Jerry bites Tom's hands, which causes him to be sent flying to the dog. Tom and the alley cat then chase Butch and then wind up spinning and roll toward Jerry, and the ring gets stuck back on Jerry's head. When Tom is running away from Butch and the alley cat, he takes a shortcut to lose sight of them until he accidentally slips on a banana peel, which Jerry's ring then increases the size of; Tom slips on it again and rides on it toward the door of a pet store, leaving Tom unconscious.   A kind old lady comes out and brings the two inside, putting them in two separate cages. However, Tom is paired with Spike and his son Tyke while Jerry is left with two mice named Freddie (Muscles) and Joey (Muscles' dumber partner) who bully a younger mouse, [[cute]] and dimwitted [[Tuffy (Tom and Jerry)|Nibbles]]. At first, Jerry proves to be unsuccessful in trying to stop the mouse bullies from hurting Nibbles until he uses the ring to turn them into hunks of cheese. When the cheese mice escape the cage and Nibbles fails to catch up with them since he intends to eat them, Jerry uses the ring to make Nibbles grow into a giant mouse capable of breaking free from the cage as he grows and catch up with the cheese mice as they escape the store. An unnamed boy (only known as Junior) comes and buys Jerry as his pet. The boy plays with Jerry until the ring produces magic, melting Tom. Escaping the cage, Tom sneaks outside and snatches Jerry from The Boy's hand. The upset boy tells his mother and she tells the police officer, who sends police cars after the cat. Then, the alley cat and Butch, while still looking for Jerry, find Tom and they chase him. Meanwhile, Spike and Tyke get out of the building as well, but right when Tom steps on Tyke. At this point, Spike and Tyke are added in the chase. They run everywhere and Tom and Jerry escape by riding a bus. Suddenly, the bus stops and it reverses, causing Tom and Jerry to panic. The driver is Droopy, and then they are lost until the boy finds Tom and whistles, and the cat and mouse end up cornered in a garbage dump.   Fortunately, Jerry uses the magic ring to freeze the dogs, alley cat, and police cars. Now that they are saved, Tom and Jerry return home, where Tom once again tries to get the ring off, but every time, he fails. Jerry hides in a kitchen cupboard and uses Furniture Ring Remover to get the ring off before throwing the ring in the basement. Tom gets the ring, but panics with fear because he realizes it is stuck firmly on his finger.  Tom hears his master Chip coming and tries to get the ring off, to no avail. Tom quickly tries to trick Chip into thinking Tom has done a good job protecting his ring, but his plan fails when Chip discovers that his ring is on Tom's finger. Chip, believing that Tom attempted to steal his ring, becomes extremely enraged and angrily kicks him out of the house with his fury, where the ring immediately falls off Tom's finger, and as he is pleased to see this, it unfreezes all who chase him to his horror. Nibbles manages to join the chase as he is still chasing the mice who both turned into cheese. Jerry receives the salmon from Chip, which he then turns into a cheese by the ring's power.

His thirteen-year-old son, Liu Xiaochun ([[Tang Yun]]), is a [[violin]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]]. In the hope that Xiaochun might find success as a violinist, Liu Cheng and Xiaochun travel to [[Beijing]] to participate in a competition organized by the [[Children's Palace (China)|Children's Palace]], an arts institution for school children. Even though Xiaochun emerges fifth, he is denied admission into the conservatory as he does not have Beijing residency. Determined to realize his hopes for Xiaochun, Liu Cheng persuades Professor Jiang ([[Wang Zhiwen]]), a stubborn and eccentric teacher from the Children's Palace, to take Xiaochun as a private student.  In the subsequent days, Xiaochun makes friends with Lili ([[Chen Hong (actress)|Chen Hong]]), a young and attractive woman living upstairs. Lili does not have a regular job but lives off the rich men she dates. However, her heart lies with Hui (Cheng Qian), her smooth-talking, cheating boyfriend. After Lili finds out about Hui's affairs in the presence of Xiaochun, Xiaochun sells his violin to a shop, buys a fur coat that Lili fancies, and leaves it at Lili's apartment for her to find. Unfortunately, Hui finds the gift before Lili does, and gives it to Lili, claiming that it was from him. Lili does not discover that Hui lied (and that the coat was from Xiaochun) until later.   Meanwhile, Liu Cheng has learnt about a Professor Yu Shifeng ([[Chen Kaige]]), a high-profile professor from the [[Central Conservatory of Music]]. Believing that Professor Yu is able to bring Xiaochun to fame and success, Liu Cheng decides to switch teachers for Xiaochun. He pays Professor Yu a visit and confides in the latter the truth about Xiaochun's birth. It turns out that Liu Cheng has never been married. He found the infant Xiaochun abandoned in a train station, a violin placed next to the baby. Liu Cheng brought both home and raised the baby as his own. Xiaochun turned out to be a child prodigy, and Liu Cheng resolved to devote his life to cultivate his adopted son's talent. Professor Yu, apparently unmoved, nonetheless agrees to give Xiaochun an audition.  However, Liu Cheng arrives at Professor Yu's home with Xiaochun only to find the violin case empty. Xiaochun, angry at his father for choosing commercial success over music, refuses to play even when offered another violin. Liu Cheng is so enraged that upon returning home, he tears up the award certificates that Xiaochun won in previous competitions. Lili, remorseful over the affair of the fur coat, looks up Professor Yu and persuades him to give Xiaochun a second chance. This time Xiaochun plays, and an impressed Professor Yu accepts him without hesitation.  Professor Yu has another talented young student, Lin Yu (Zhang Jing), a highly jealous and ambitious girl. When a selection trial for an international competition is coming up, Lin Yu and Xiaochun are in a contest for the only spot. Liu Cheng decides to pack up and return home first, both to allow Xiaochun full concentration and to raise some money should Xiaochun be selected to participate in the international competition. In an effort to infuse passion and emotion into Xiaochun's playing, Professor Yu tells the boy the truth about his birth. However, this only strengthens Xiaochun's love for his father. Just before the selection trial, Xiaochun, who has been chosen to participate, relinquishes his spot to Lin Yu after she reveals to him that Professor Yu had secretly bought Xiaochun's original violin from the shop to stop Xiaochun from being distracted by thoughts of it. Xiaochun then takes the violin and runs after his father. The two finally reunite at the train station. In place of fame and success, Xiaochun chooses to be together with his father.

Tokyo 10+01
 In [[Tokyo|Neo Tokyo]] in 2XXX A.D., eleven strangers, each with various criminal backgrounds, awaken in a deserted warehouse where they are confronted by the mysterious Mr. K, the manager of the Black [[wiktionary:papillon#French|Papillon]] Foundation.  They are told that they have been brought together to participate in a game conceived of by The Baron, the leader of the organization, in which they have to reach his mansion within eleven hours.  The reward for this is 300 million yen and the chance to start their lives over by also expunging their criminal records.  Each participant is fitted with a bracelet on their left wrists which has a timer indicating how much time is left in the game, and an alarm system.  The latter is triggered when "hunters", who work for the Black Papillon Foundation and are armed with non-lethal [[Raygun|laser guns]] which will knock the participants out of the game when they are shot, come within 50 meters.  The bracelets also contain [[hypodermic needle]]s which will inject the wearers with a lethal poison if they attempt to take the bracelets off or time runs out, thus forcing them all to play the game or face death.  [[Image:Tokyo 10+01 black butterfly tattoo.JPG|thumb|left|Mr. K's black butterfly tattoo on his left wrist, which all of The Baron's children have.  This is also the logo of the Black Papillon Foundation, and is featured in the film's title sequence.]]  Unarmed and after being divided into three teams, the game starts.  The first indication that things are not what they seem occurs shortly into the game when Big Mac is shot and killed by some hunters, revealing that the players must now try to survive against opponents with real [[firearms]].  The three teams then split up and pursue separate routes.  Fake manages to get hold of a gun that Snake stole from a hunter and thus take control of his team.  The team of Jingi, Oolong and Jasmine encounters hunters after emerging from a tunnel, whom they fight and defeat, but are also killed.  Ace, Micro, and Tall succeed in [[hotwiring]] a car thanks to Micro's technical expertise, but Ace is killed by a hunter.  Fake decides to kill a member of his team, but the arrival of some hunters and Coco's quick thinking result in his apparent demise, while Prince is shot and falls to his death.  Micro meanwhile succeeds in deactivating the dead Ace's bracelet, revealing a black butterfly tattoo on his wrist that both he and Tall also have.  Hunters soon arrive however and kill them during an ensuing [[car chase]].  Coco and Snake manage to evade additional hunters, but Coco is wounded.  With less than an hour left in the game and when the two are alone, she reveals why she hates men, but that she is glad that men like Snake exist.  She gives him her [[Compact (cosmetics)|compact]] as a token of remembrance before taking a bullet meant for him fired by Fake.  Snake then confronts Fake with the revelation that except for him (Snake), all of the participants in the game have a black butterfly tattoo on their wrists, marking them as The Baron's children although they had different mothers.  Fake is soon killed by a hunter and after slipping his bracelet off, Snake reaches The Baron's mansion as the last player left.  Here he is greeted by Mr. K, and it is revealed that the two colluded in order to enable Mr. K to take over the Black Papillon Foundation, while Snake would be delivered the man with a crescent-shaped scar on his forehead who killed his parents years ago.  Believing this man to be The Baron, Snake confronts him only to find him dead and no scar on his forehead.  Mr. K then shoots Snake and reveals that he himself is also one of The Baron's children, making him the eleventh player in the game and explaining the film's title.  Mr. K rigged the game set up by his father by adding actual deaths as a factor to kill off his siblings, and he also turns out to be the very man with the crescent-shaped scar who Snake seeks vengeance against.  Mr. K then apparently shoots and kills Snake.  Snake however, survives his wounds and later that night infiltrates a bizarre [[costume party]] that Mr. K is attending.  He confronts and kills Mr. K, revealing that his life was saved by Coco's compact which he had in his jacket pocket and deflected a potentially fatal bullet just before he himself is shot and killed by Mr. K's bodyguards.

Treasure Planet
 On the planet Montressor, a young [[Jim Hawkins (character)#Disney version|Jim Hawkins]] is enchanted by stories of the legendary [[Space pirate|pirate]] [[Captain Flint|Captain Nathaniel Flint]] and his ability to appear from nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious "Treasure Planet". Twelve years later, having been abandoned by his father when he was still young, Jim has grown into an aloof and isolated troublemaker. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from "Alponian solar cruising", [[skysurfing]] atop a rocket-powered sailboard.  One day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, [[Billy Bones]], gives Jim a [[sphere]] and tells him to "beware the [[cyborg]]". After this, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn. Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim finds that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map that leads to the location of Treasure Planet.  Doppler commissions a ship called the RLS ''Legacy'', on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined [[Chief Mate|first mate]], Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship.  During the voyage, the ship encounters a [[supernova]]. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves into a [[black hole]] and Mr. Arrow is shortly sucked into it. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless [[insectoid]] crew member named Scroop.  As the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a [[mutiny]] erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has left the map behind. Thinking Jim has the map, Silver targets to kill Jim, but hesitates, allowing them to escape. The fugitives are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia.  While exploring Treasure Planet's forests, the fugitives meet [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)#Other media|B.E.N.]], an abandoned robot, who has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place for shelter. The pirates corner the group there; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.  Silver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens on any location in the [[universe]], which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a [[space station]] built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty-handed, Silver attempts to escape on a boat loaded with treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the ship, but it gets damaged and is unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the destruction.  Jim finds Silver has snuck below decks to escape. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him some part of the treasure to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will "rattle the stars". Amelia offers Jim a recommendation to Interstellar Academy before he returns to the spaceport to reunite with his mother. Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim has become a military cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.  
The Transporter
 Frank Martin ([[Jason Statham]]) is a highly skilled driver known as "The Transporter." He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: "Don't change the deal.", Rule Number 2: "No names", and Rule Number 3: "Never open the package."   Frank with his [[BMW 7 Series (E38)]] (735i), has been hired to transport some robbers from a bank heist.  On delivery to their destination, they hoist an extra man in the car; so he refuses to drive until, in desperation, the leader kills one of his men. Later they offer more money for Frank to drive farther from the city. He refuses the deal. The robbers escape in another car, and Frank leaves.  When Frank returns to his villa, local [[French Police|police]] Inspector Tarconi ([[FranÃ§ois BerlÃ©and]]) arrives to question Frank about the robbery. However, Tarconi has no concrete proof about the heist and leaves. Frank is then hired to deliver a package to an American gangster, Darren "Wall Street"  Bettencourt ([[Matt Schulze]]). While changing a flat tire, he notices something moving in the package. Along the way, he opens the package and finds a woman, tied up with her mouth gagged with a piece of duct tape. She manages to escape but Frank recaptures her and incapacitates two policemen who spot them. He ties the policemen up and puts them in his trunk. He then delivers the package to Bettencourt as promised.  Bettencourt then asks Frank to transport a briefcase - Frank accepts the job. The briefcase turns out to be a bomb that destroys his car, and kills the two policemen. Frank survives only due to his having stopped for lunch, then gone back in to buy sodas for the cops. Frank snaps and returns to Bettencourt's residence for vengeance. He kills and wounds several of his henchmen in a fight. He then steals a car to get away, only to find "the package" tied to a chair and gagged with tape in the back seat. He brings her along to his house where she introduces herself as Lai ([[Shu Qi]]).   Bettencourt visits one of his surviving men in hospital in order to determine who attacked his residence, before killing the man after discovering that Frank is alive. The next day, Tarconi arrives and asks about Frank's car. Lai says she is Frank's new cook and, afterwards, girlfriend, supporting Frank's alibi. Tarconi again leaves with no proof. Shortly after he leaves, Bettencourt's henchmen rain missiles down on the house. Frank and Lai barely escape, using scuba gear, to a nearby safe house Frank has prepared for such contingencies.  Frank is very irritated by all the chaos Lai has brought into his life, but she makes it up to him with sex.    After being questioned at the police station, Lai manages to sneak onto Tarconi's computer to access information on Bettencourt. Lai tells Frank that Bettencourt is a [[human trafficking|human trafficker]], that he is shipping two containers full of Chinese people (including her family), and is planning to sell them into slavery. Lai and Frank go to Bettencourt's office, where Frank holds Bettencourt at gunpoint and asks him why he tried to kill him. Bettencourt replies that he didn't have a choice, since Frank "opened the package". He also reveals that Lai's father, Kwai ([[Ric Young]]), is also a human trafficker and that they are partners. Kwai arrives and his henchmen subdue Frank just as Tarconi arrives at the office. When Tarconi enters the office, Lai's father and Bettencourt accuse Frank of kidnapping Lai. Tarconi has Frank arrested and locked up in the station.  At the station, Tarconi agrees to aid Frank's escape as his faux hostage. Frank then tracks the criminals to the docks, where they load the containers onto trucks. However, Frank is spotted and is forced to fight his way through the guards, and fails to stop the trucks. He then steals a small airplane and parachutes onto one of the trucks. After a lengthy fight, Frank manages to kill Bettencourt and some of his henchmen, only to be ambushed by Kwai once he gets out of the truck. However, Frank is saved when Lai reluctantly shoots her father. Afterwards, Tarconi arrives with the police, and they rescue the people trapped inside the two containers.

The Trip (2002 film)
 The time is the socially turbulent 1970s, when radical politics and the emerging gay rights movement clashed with the rigidly conservative establishment. At a swanky L.A. party, lean and lanky Tommy introduces himself to sexually repressed Alan. Tommy has long blond hair, and is openly gay with a glib sense of humor. The comparatively short-haired, muscular Alan is a member of the Young Republicans and an aspiring journalist. Alan is working on his first book, a treatise on homosexuality, and he invites Tommy over for dinner to interview him for the book. Their connection is so intense that Alan's kooky girlfriend Beverly suspects something more than an interview is going on and angrily departs.  Broken up with Beverly, Alan runs into Tommy a month later while jogging in Griffith Park and invites him for a night out; the two have a fantastic time, drinking and doing drugs along the way. At Alan's invitation, Tommy stays over at Alan's apartment. They sleep in separate rooms until Alan, in the middle of the night, joins Tommy in his bed, claiming the couch is too uncomfortable; Tommy leaves to go sleep on the couch. In the morning, Tommy tells Alan he has feelings for him and can't see him again. Tommy also confronts Alan about his own curiosity, prompting Alan to defensively blurt out, "I'm not a fag like you, okay?" Tommy walks out. Feeling horrible about what he said, Alan proceeds to call him nonstop, but Tommy won't come to the phone.  Alan proceeds to write his book, which is highly critical of gays and their lifestyle. However, when the manuscript brings an offer for a two-book deal, he doesn't want to sign the contract, as by then he realizes his own feelings for Tommy and rejects his old ideas about the gay community. Against his better judgment, he signs the contract, persuaded by attorney Peter, that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Moments later, Tommy comes back to Alan's apartment to confront him about the phone calls and tell him he doesn't want to hear from him again. Alan takes a chance, grabbing Tommy and kissing him. It begins what will be a 4-year relationship.  Fast forward to 1977: [[Anita Bryant]] is organizing the "[[Save Our Children]]" campaign in Florida to rid the country of homosexuals and repeal a Florida law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Alan's book publisher, who previously decided the timing wasn't right, publishes Alan's book, ''The Straight Truth'', against Alan's wishes, listing the author as "Anonymous." The book is used to fuel homophobia by the Christian Right, and it threatens to erode Tommy's work with his group Out Loud, whose aim is to change the public's negative views of gays. When word is leaked about who actually wrote the book, Tommy leaves Alan. Alan is also fired from his job at a newspaper. With nowhere to go and no job, he quickly becomes a "kept boy" of Peter, who himself is [[closeted]].  In 1984, when Alan finds out Peter was the one who leaked his name to the media, he leaves to reunite with Tommy. The two finally take the road trip they previously planned, but under tragic circumstances, as Tommy is now ill from an undisclosed illness. In a fitting end to their love story, Alan fulfills his book contract by writing a second book. This time, it is about his [[coming out]] process and his love affair with Tommy. The book is called ''The Trip,'' and is dedicated to Tommy.

His reputation lands him a job as the personal chauffeur of the mysterious but wealthy Clark Devlin ([[Jason Isaacs]]). Jimmy does not really know what his new boss' job is, but Devlin's friendly nature, imperturbable demeanor, and willingness to offer Jimmy advice wins Jimmy over and the two become friends. What Jimmy does not realize is that Devlin is a secret [[Espionage|spy]] and undercover government agent, and when an attempt to kill Devlin with a car bombing sends him into a coma, Jimmy ends up with Devlin's recent case notes and a special watch that controls Devlin's rather unusual tuxedo.  The tuxedo is a gadget capable of granting its wearer special abilities (including [[martial arts]], [[speed]], the ability to dance, and various [[acrobatics]]) which Jimmy must use to stop the criminal organization responsible for Devlin's attempted murder. The group is a terrorist organization disguised as a corporation named Banning Corporation and is headed by the notorious and ruthless Dietrich Banning ([[Ritchie Coster]]). Its goal is to take over the global drinking water supply, starting with the poisoning of major US reservoirs by means of genetically modified [[gerridae|water strider]] insects. These water striders have bacteria that can spread from person to person. By pure chance, Jimmy is joined by a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, Delilah "Del" Blaine ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]).

She confiscates his borrowed tuxedo and attempts to stop the evil Dietrich Banning on her own by feigning a desire to become a turncoat for Banning Corporation. Meanwhile, Jimmy is ready to give up and go back to his life as a taxi driver, but while packing his belongings he discovers that Devlin had ordered a second tuxedo for Jimmy himself, believing that Jimmy could also be a great agent.  Using his own tuxedo, Jimmy defeats the [[villain]], Banning, by throwing a glass containing the queen of the water striders into Banning's mouth. He is then infected with bacteria from the water strider. The other remaining water striders do the same. They attack Banning and he then dies instantaneously.  As compensation for his role in bringing down Banning, the organization uses its resources to orchestrate an operation so that Jimmy can finally meet his dream girl. However, confused by Blaine's and the now-recovered Devlin's conflicting instructions on how to act Jimmy succeeds only in alarming the girl into threatening to mace him so that the operation is aborted as a failure. Consoling Jimmy afterwards, Blaine admits feeling sad that no one had ever tried to do for her what Jimmy had just done, and Jimmy tells Blaine that she has to change and be more accommodating if she ever wants to have a boyfriend. Feeling a tentative attraction for each other, they walk away to buy coffee.  
Two Weeks Notice
 Lucy Kelson ([[Sandra Bullock]]) is a frumpy, nervous, intelligent [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[lawyer]] who specializes in historic preservation, environmental law and pro bono causes in [[New York City]]. George Wade ([[Hugh Grant]]) is an arrogant, billionaire [[real estate]] developer and stylish womanizing playboy, who is also quite naive.  Lucy's hard work and devotion to others contrast sharply with George's world-weary recklessness and greed.  Lucy meets George in an attempt to stop the destruction of the [[Coney Island]] [[community center]] from her childhood. Discovering that she graduated from prestigious [[Harvard]] law school, he attempts to hire her to replace his old Chief Counsel, overlooking their opposing views of real estate development. She is willing overlook it tooâand his playboy tendenciesâwhen he lures her in with the promise to protect the community center and an annual salary of $250,000 and other perks.  She soon finds that what he really requires is advice in all aspects of his life. She becomes his indispensable aide, and he calls her for every little thing at all hours. At a friend's wedding, her cell phone loudly rings and disrupts the proceedings before she runs off answering his urgent page. When she discovers the "emergency" is he needs her advice on what to wear to an important event, she gets fed up and gives him her two weeks' notice of [[resignation]].  Yet, her departure is not so easy.  When Lucy looks for work at other firms, everyone says no because George has called in advance asking them not to hire her, so that he can keep her on.  Eventually he gives in, and she offers to help him find a replacement, but the camera shows us that they are not entirely aware of how close and interdependent they have become: They act like an old married couple at a restaurant, able to simultaneously carry out a conversation while involuntarily exchanging food out of habit from knowing each other's food preferences.  When the stylish and flirtatious June Carver ([[Alicia Witt]]) shows up without an appointment seeking the position, Lucy speaks to her, but is concerned that June lacks real estate experience.  When George sees June he is immediately attracted and is ready to hire her on the spot, with little regard for Lucy's concerns.  Rather than look the other way and let her soon to be former boss deal with the foolishness of his sexist hiring practices, Lucy instead becomes increasingly jealous and competitive with her replacement.  When George invites June to be included to business social eventsâthat formerly would be just between George and LucyâLucy increasingly perceives the business events to be more like dates, and is angry that June is intruding on them.  Lucy finds out that the community center is going to be knocked down and argues with George. She arrives at his hotel and finds June and George in his apartment in lingerie during their game of "strip chess". George sees that Lucy is hurt as she leaves. He confronts her the next day, her last day, saying that she must have feelings from what she saw the other night. Lucy, still upset about the community center, claims that George promised her the community center and that she didn't promise to sleep with him. George says hurtful things to Lucy until she leaves.  After she's gone, George realizes that his time with her has really changed him, as he keeps the promise he made to her in the beginning even if it means it costs his company millions. Meanwhile, in her new job, Lucy  is missing him terribly. He goes in search for her, and they confess their feelings for each other. The movie ends with Lucy ordering take out in her apartment with George making jokes about the size of the apartment. Usually when she orders and is asked how many, Lucy replies, "one", but this time, with a silly smile, Lucy replies, "This is for two."  
The Twilight Samurai
 At the start of the film, the main character, Iguchi Seibei, becomes a widower when his wife succumbs to [[tuberculosis]]. His wife receives a grand funeral, more than Seibei, a low-ranking [[samurai]] can afford. Seibei works in the grain warehouse, accounting for stores inventory for the samurai [[clan]]. His samurai colleagues mock him behind his back with the nickname Tasogare (Twilight): when evening approaches, Seibei rushes home to look after his elderly mother, who has dementia, and two young daughters, Kayano and Ito, instead of bonding with his supervisor and other samurai colleagues over customary nights of dinner, [[geisha]] entertainment, and [[sake]] drinking. Even though he is a samurai, Seibei neglects his appearance, failing to bathe or shave his head, and being shabbily dressed. The well-being of his young daughters and medicine for his mother take priority over new clothes or the monthly bath fee, and his daughters say they are both happy, even without a mother.  Things change when Seibei's childhood friend Tomoe (sister of Iinuma Michinojo, one of his better, kinder samurai friends and much higher ranked in the clan) returns to town. Tomoe is atypical in that she was a tom-boy as a child and as an adult questions points of etiquette, such as obeying her elder brother's wife and not attending peasant festivals, if she believes them wrong. Recently divorced from an abusive alcoholic husband (Koda, a samurai captain), Tomoe finds comfort and solace with Seibei's daughters. Tomoe's ex-husband Koda barges into the household of Michinojo in the middle of night in a drunken demand for Tomoe and challenges Michinojo to a [[duel]] which Seibei accepts on Michinojo's behalf believing Michinojo could not win. This takes place with Seibei knowing his clan forbids duels and the penalty is usually death for the winner as the loser is already dead. Michinojo arrives before Seibei and is facing Koda. Seibei interrupts and decides to use only a wooden stick whilst Koda brandishes a steel [[katana]]. Koda, after being disarmed and asked if that can be the end of it, picks up his sword so Seibei knocks him unconscious, sparing both their lives. A few days later, Captain of the Guard Yogo passes by Seibei while Seibei is working in the stores and quietly announces he is friends with Koda who has asked him for help in seeking vengeance on Seibei. Recognising that Seibei has some skill and learning that Seibei has learnt a particular style of fighting Yogo hopes they can duel someday. Seibei's workmates learn of the duel and wonder if they should stop calling him by his nickname.  When Iinuma Michinojo asks Seibei to marry his sister, saying she has turned down many offers and he will not force her, Seibei feels that Iinuma is teasing him for his strong feelings for Tomoe, like when he, Iinuma, and Tomoe were children. Iinuma knows Tomoe's feeling for Seibei, and Seibei is a kind man who would treat Tomoe better than Koda. With much deep regret, Seibei declines Iinuma's offer of his sister's hand in marriage, citing his inferior social status and how he did not want to see Tomoe share the burden of poverty despite Michinojo's protest that Tomoe is a grown woman who knows what she is up for. Seibei stoically regrets how his departed wife suffered in his care who, like Tomoe, came from a wealthier family. Iinuma talks no more of it. Tomoe stops visiting Kayano and Ito.  In the final act, the ranking official of Seibei's clan, having heard of his prowess with a sword, orders Seibei to kill Yogo, who has been "disowned" and who stubbornly refuses to resign his post by committing [[seppuku]]. The young lord of the clan had died from measles and there was a succession struggle behind the scenes over who will be the new lord. Yogo ended up on the losing side of this conflict, hence his ordered suicide. Yogo has already killed a formidable samurai that was sent to kill him. Seibei is promised a rise in rank and pay if he accepts the dangerous mission.  Seibei is very reluctant to fight Yogo at first, requesting one month to prepare for it. He says that, because of great hardship in his life, he has lost all resolve to fight with ferocity and disregard for his own life, because of the experience of watching his two girls grow. As they continue to insist, he requests two days to get himself up to the task. The new clan leader is furious over this answer and orders him expelled from the clan. Seibei is finally forced to agree to attempt the mission. Upon parting that evening, Seibei's supervisor (who was present during the meeting) promises him that he will make sure the girls will be taken care of if the worst comes to pass.  The following morning, Seibei attempts to get ready, but there is no one to help him with the rituals of samurai before battle. With no one to turn to, he asks Tomoe for her assistance. Before he leaves, he tells Tomoe that he was wrong to decline the offer of marriage. He says that if he lives, he would like to ask for her hand in marriage now that there is promise of a promotion. She regretfully tells Seibei she has accepted another proposal. Seibei, feeling like a fool, tells Tomoe to forget about the silly conversation. Tomoe says that she will not be waiting at his household for him to return but that she hopes from her heart that he will return safely. Seibei says he understands completely. He thanks Tomoe for her generosity for assisting him in this final ritual.  At Yogo's house, Seibei finds his target drinking alcohol in a dark, fly-infested room. Yogo recognizes Seibei and invites him to sit and drink. He then asks Seibei to allow him to run away. He explains he was only faithfully serving his master and describes how his wife and daughter also died of tuberculosis due to hardship and spending seven years as a [[RÅnin|ronin]]. Only thanks to his master's generosity could he afford a proper funeral. Yogo tells Seibei that he expects Seibei was promised a reward for this errand and that he too performed errands for his superior, taking the word of his superior as the word of the clan. Seibei commiserates and reveals further parallels in the two men's stories, such as that his wife's family demanded she have an expensive funeral and so he sold his katana to pay for it. He reveals that his long [[scabbard]] contains a fake bamboo sword. This angers Yogo who believes Seibei is mocking him: the short [[kodachi]] can be carried even by common people who are not samurai. Seibei explains he has been trained with the short sword, which he still carries, but Yogo is not placated.  Seibei's [[kodachi]] fighting style is matched up against Yogo's [[ittÅ-ryÅ«]] (single long sword) swordsmanship in an intense close quarters duel. Despite allowing Yogo to slash him several times and offering him chances to flee, Yogo presses the attack and Seibei kills Yogo when his longer sword gets caught in the rafters. Despite his wounds, Seibei limps home. Kayano and Ito rush to him in the courtyard, happy to see him. Tomoe is still there, waiting in the house. They have an emotional reunion.  In a brief epilogue set many years later, Seibei's younger daughter, Ito, now elderly, visits the grave of Seibei and Tomoe. Narrating, she explains they married but that their happiness was not to last: He died three years later in the [[Boshin War]], Japan's last civil war. Tomoe took care of Seibei's daughters until they were both married. Ito often heard that Tasogare Seibei was a very unfortunate character, a most pathetic samurai with no luck at all. Ito disagrees: Her father never had any ambition to become anything special; he loved his two daughters, and was loved by the beautiful Tomoe.  
Twin Sisters (2002 film)
 The film tells the story of twin German sisters Lotte ([[Thekla Reuten]]) and Anna ([[Nadja Uhl]]), who are separated when they are six. After the deaths of their parents, they are "divided" between quarreling distant relatives, one being raised in the [[Netherlands]] and the other in [[Germany]].  Lotte grows up in a loving middle-class intellectual family in Amsterdam, and Anna is raised in virtual servitude by a poor Catholic peasant family in a backward area.  The two girls seek to keep in contact, but Anna's family lacks Lotte's address, and Lotte's new family fails to mail her letters for fear that the brutal farmers will claim her, as well.  The cataclysmic events of [[World War II]] sweep them even further apart. Lotte falls in love with a young Jewish man who is eventually caught by the Nazis and sent to his death. Anna falls in love and marries a young [[Wehrmacht]] soldier who joins the [[Waffen SS]] and is killed in the last days of the war. Although the girls find each other just before the outbreak of the war, Anna's attempt to reunite with Lotte in its aftermath is thwarted by Lotte's bitter discovery that Anna's husband had been part of the apparatus that murdered her fiancÃ©.  Only in her old age, when they meet again at a spa, does Lotte reconcile herself to their divergent lives and reclaim the tender sibling feeling of her childhood. The two girls/women are each played by three different actors from the Netherlands and Germany.

They blow up what they take to be the main operations room, and then the entire compound unexpectedly erupts with gunfire and explosions. They narrowly evade the Germans and escape in a boat which is later blown up by a mine; the men are picked up by the British and interrogated as possible spies. Once their identities have been established, they are returned to barracks to be court-martialed as deserters. An aide of Winston Churchill had seen their letter, and knew of a commando raid on the radar facility which was facilitated by a diversion due to mysterious explosions in what they discover was actually the cookhouse. The aide intervenes in the court martial, establishes their presence at the enemy radar station and conveys an invitation to tea with the Prime Minister should they ever be in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]]. The court nevertheless demotes [[Sergeant]] King to the rank of [[corporal]] and remands Private Cuthbertson to military prison for 28 days, lenient sentences for desertion in wartime. A note on screen tells the viewer that the men never meet again.

Undercover Brother
 The film begins with a [[back story]] of how [[African-American culture]]'s popularity with the American public began to decline in the 1980s, when style and originality began to lose appeal in the public eye due to the persistent efforts of "The Man" (Robert Trumbull), a powerful [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] man in control of a secret organization that seeks to undermine the African-American community as well as the cultures of other minorities. The Man is infuriated that Gen. Warren Boutwell ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), a [[United States Army]] general based on [[Colin Powell]], is considering running for president, and his lackey Mr. Feather ([[Chris Kattan]]) informs him of a mind-control drug which The Man uses to make Boutwell abort his plans and instead open a fried chicken franchise. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a secret organization that battles The Man's influence, determines The Man is behind Boutwell's change of heart, and recruits a freelance agent named Undercover Brother ([[Eddie Griffin]]) to aid them.  Undercover Brother joins B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. which is made up of the Chief ([[Chi McBride]]), Conspiracy Brother ([[Dave Chappelle]]), Smart Brother ([[Gary Anthony Williams]]), Sistah Girl ([[Aunjanue Ellis]]), and Lance ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), an intern who is the only white man in the organization due to [[affirmative action]]. Undercover Brother goes undercover as a new employee at a cigarette company owned by The Man, where Mr. Feather discovers his identity. He deploys a secret weapon that he calls "Black Man's [[Kryptonite]]", an attractive assassin named White She-Devil ([[Denise Richards]]). Posing as another new employee, she and Undercover Brother start dating, and she begins to make him do stereotypical "white" things, such as buying [[corduroy]] and [[khaki]] clothes, singing [[karaoke]], and adopting a silly set of [[euphemism]]s. Meanwhile, The Man distributes his mind-control drug through Boutwell's fried chicken, infecting other black celebrities and making them act white.  Concerned with Undercover Brother's unusual behavior, Sistah Girl attacks White She-Devil and convinces Undercover Brother to return to the fight. White-She-Devil turns on her own henchmen to save the two, revealing she has fallen in love with Undercover Brother. They return to the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., where Smart Brother questions White She-Devil about The Man and Lance is officially made part of the group when he declares his desire to abolish bigotry after watching ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''. The group heads to an awards gala after they find out that [[James Brown]] is The Man's next target. Mr. Feather kidnaps Brown and takes him to The Man's base. B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. secures an antidote for the mind control drug and follows via a transmitter placed on Brown, infiltrating the base posing as a cleaning crew, to rescue Brown and a mysterious "Candidate" that The Man plans to use to land a crushing blow to African-American culture.  Mr. Feather prepares to administer the drug to Brown and present him as a trophy to The Man, and Brown reveals himself as Undercover Brother in disguise. Mr. Feather sends his henchmen after B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., who discover the Candidate is Boutwell, and is ordered by Mr. Feather to kill Undercover Brother.

The Man's helicopter circles overhead and leaves, The Man abandoning Mr. Feather for failing him. Mr. Feather jumps onto the helicopter's landing gear as it flies away, and Undercover Brother uses his afro picks to impale Mr. Feather in the [[buttocks]], causing him to fall into the ocean, where he is eaten by a shark. However, The Man escapes. Undercover Brother survives the building's self-destruction by leaping off the building and using his wide pants legs as parachutes.

Undisputed (film)
 Undisputed [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion George "Iceman" Chambers (Rhames) is convicted of rape and sentenced to a new prison in the desert, called Sweetwater. The high-security facility is populated by hardened criminals. Unaware of the prison's ways and its unique hierarchy, the pompous and bratty Chambers tries to impress upon the inmates his status as a champion boxer.  The prison camp, within its own walls, has a riveting competition on which a betting syndicate thrives. Criminals fight in boxing matches with very lax rules, thus making it a very addictive and lucrative venture for the syndicate. The most popular boxer behind bars is Sweetwater's undefeated Monroe Hutchens (Snipes), who ends up in solitary confinement after Chambers picks a fight with him in the mess hall.  Sensing the brewing hatred for the heavyweight champion, an incarcerated mob boss named Ripstein (Falk) senses potential in a match  between the modest Hutchens and the egomaniacal Chambers. Ripstein, a lifelong boxing fan, proposes a match and the warden (Arndt) is persuaded to look the other way.  As all the arrangements are finally organized, an eagerly awaited fight night arrives. All hell breaks loose with the haughty professional champ going all out against the unputdownable prison warrior. Chambers knocks down Hutchens twice (and with the 'London Prize' format, each knockdown counts as the end of a round, as the boxer is given only 60 seconds to get up.) In the third round, Hutchens charges back and knocks Chambers down for the first time in his career, sending the crowd of prisoners into a frenzy. Finally, in the fourth round Hutchens officially KO's Chambers to become the undisputed champion.  Ripstein's Mexican assistant reveals in a voice over that Ripstein died three weeks after the fight, but in his will, he left him $2,000,000. Chambers was released on parole, and Hutchens received the money for his sister, who was experiencing hardship on the outside.  It is also revealed that Chambers and his manager denied that the fight with Hutchens ever occurred, and that it was all a rumor. Months later, Chambers wins back the Heavyweight Championship of the World. The whole cell block watches the televised fight, and laugh and cheer Monroe's name after hearing Chambers being crowned the 'undisputed' heavyweight champion of the world.  
Under One Roof (film)
 Daniel Chang (Wong) is a twenty-something second-generation Chinese-American living at home in [[San Francisco]] with his widowed mother, who can speak broken English, and his grandmother (his father's mother), who cannot speak English. Ever since his father died, he has fulfilled his patriarchal duty as first and only son by managing the family business and looking after his mother. Being gay, he avoids the second major responsibility of carrying on the family line through heterosexual marriage and reproduction. Out of respect for his mother's values, he tries to keep, as he puts it, his home life and his "homo life" separate. By not directly telling his mother that he is gay, he has unwittingly found himself in a tense but hilarious situation where his mother continually pressures him to marry women of her choosing. Luckily, Daniel's female friend, Michelle, graciously rescues him from the constant onslaught of potential dates by pretending to be his steady girlfriend (for a price), which deflects his need to come out to his mother.  Besides the extra money Mrs. Chang makes playing [[Mahjong]], she also rents out the basement illegally. Daniel relates how he was quite happy to leave the previous female tenant alone. Daniel expects his mother to replace the previous tenant with another woman and is astounded when the new tenant turns out to be Robert, a young attractive white man from [[Indiana]]. Daniel immediately has a crush on him. Following a plumbing mishap that floods the basement with raw sewage, Mrs. Chang apologetically moves Robert into the only other bedroom that is not hersâDaniel's room. Even though reality has merged with Daniel's deepest fantasies, he bows to the paranoia that his mother will find out he is gay and decides to sleep on the living room sofa. Mrs. Chang eventually kicks Daniel off the couch so she can watch her late-night TV programs, and he is forced to share his bed with Robert. Daniel manages to be prudish for a few nights but eventually the two become lovers.  Daniel's fear of being caught making out with a man constantly gets in between his relationship with Robert, and Daniel begins to wish that the basement repairs would finish soon so they could move their lovemaking to a safer area. However, one day Mrs. Chang and Grandma return home earlier than expected right in the middle of one of Daniel and Robert's trysts. Grandma walks in on them during copulation to offer them mooncakes, one of the few English words she knows. She sheepishly leaves the mooncakes on the nightstand and exits, giving them enough time to roll apart to opposite sides of the bed just as Mrs. Chang walks in. Daniel quickly chastizes her for not knocking and makes up the excuse that he was napping. Mrs. Chang does not seem to notice that both he and Robert are naked, but she bluntly tells Robert to move his belongings back into the basement that night.  With the basement repaired, Daniel imagines he can finally spend time with Robert away from his mother's prying eyes, but the very next day a San Francisco building inspector stops by. Daniel suspects his own mother called the inspector, who gives the Chang's a list of expensive home improvements that would be needed to legally rent the room. Mrs. Chang jumps at the chance, arguing with Daniel that she has no choice but to make Robert move out. Their argument echoes in the basement and Robert hears Daniel give in without too much of a fight. Heartbroken, Robert moves away to a friend's place in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].  Daniel reaches his breaking point. Miserable and determined not to be alone forever, he [[coming out|comes out]] to his mother the very next time she starts talking about available young women. This time he is direct and asserts that he wants to be with Robert. Mrs. Chang reacts angrily, lecturing Daniel in her native tongue and storming away from him. In her confusion, disappointment and fear of losing Daniel (who threatened to move out), she turns to the only other woman she knows with a gay son, Robert's mother. Robert's mother asks Mrs. Chang if it wouldn't be so bad to have another son, a clever way of getting around the cultural taboo of same-sex love. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Chang calls Daniel back home to meet another potential date. Daniel flips out and races back home to stand up to his mother for the last time. He opens the door bellowing out, "Mother!" but almost chokes from surprise when Robert walks toward him instead. Mrs. Chang had invited Robert to be part of their family.

Their relationship is loving, but familiar and lacking excitement. One afternoon, Connie goes shopping for Charlie's upcoming birthday party. She is caught in a heavy windstorm, and runs into a handsome stranger ([[Olivier Martinez]]). They both fall, and Connie scrapes her knees. He offers to treat her injuries in his Soho apartment, and she accepts. He introduces himself as Paul Martel, a 27-year-old book dealer. Paul makes small advances toward Connie, which makes her uncomfortable, and she decides to leave. Before doing so, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry as a gift. After returning home, Connie tells Edward what happened, and he suggests they buy Paul a thank-you gift.  While reading the book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Terminal for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in [[Braille]] amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her feelings of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him with a bag of muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the [[Metro-North Railroad]], Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.  Edward hires a private investigator, Frank Wilson ([[Dominic Chianese]]), to follow her. Frank returns with pictures of Connie and Paul together, which devastates Edward. Connie's visits with Paul become more frequent, to the point that she is late to pick up Charlie from school. Following this incident, she realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. Unsuccessfully trying to end the affair over the phone, Connie decides it would be best to do so in person. She spots Paul with another woman walking down the street as she approaches his neighborhood in her SUV. After following and then confronting Paul, their argument ends in a tryst in the stairwell of his apartment building. At the same time, Edward is standing outside Paul's apartment building, where Edward and Connie narrowly miss each other as she leaves out the backdoor. Edward goes to Paul's apartment and confronts him, revealing that he is Connie's husband. Edward asks to come into Paul's apartment, and after Paul lets him in, he gives Edward some vodka and they talk about Connie. Edward asks how Paul and Connie met, and while walking around the apartment, Edward is stunned to see a snow globe by the bed, which he recognizes as a gift he gave to Connie. Paul reveals that Connie gave it to him as a gift. Feeling sick and disoriented, Edward sits down on the bed and Paul asks if he would like some water. Edward suddenly has a mental breakdown and hits Paul with the snow globe, [[head injury|severely fracturing his skull]] and killing him instantly.  After wrapping Paul's body in a rug and cleaning up evidence of the murder and of his own presence in the apartment, Edward hears Connie leaving a message on Paul's answering machine, saying she must end the affair. Edward erases all the messages and leaves, putting Paul's body in the trunk of his car. Edward joins his wife at Charlie's school play, and late that night while Connie is sleeping, drives to a landfill and dumps Paul's body. In the ensuing days, Paul's murder plagues Edward, who is unable to stop thinking about what he has done. When two NYPD detectives arrive at the Sumner home while Edward is at work, they explain to Connie that Paul's estranged wife had reported him missing, and that they found Connie's name and phone number on his desk. Connie claims she barely knows him and that she was interested in buying books from him. A week later, the detectives return and tell Connie and Edward that Paul's body has been discovered. When police ask Connie how she met Paul, she replies that they met at a [[Juilliard]] fundraiser. To Connie's surprise, Edward corroborates her story. The detectives ask if Connie has ever been to Paul's apartment, and Connie denies even being in the Soho neighborhood any time recently. However, the police tell her that she had in fact received a parking ticket in front of Paul's apartment just a month earlier. Connie replies that she forgot about a day that she met friends for coffee at a Soho cafÃ©. Several days later, Connie finds the investigator's photos of her and Paul when she takes Edward's clothes to the drycleaner, and realizes that Edward knows about the affair. That night, during a party at their home, Connie notices that the snow globe has been returned to their collection. Connie looks over at Edward, he meets her gaze knowingly, and she realizes that Edward murdered Paul.  Connie and Edward argue and, out of anger and frustration, Edward says that he wanted to kill her instead of Paul. In the days that follow, while looking at the underside of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they will find a way to move on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping in the backseat, Edward stops the car at an intersection due to red light. Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station.

Unknown Pleasures (film)
 ''Unknown Pleasures'' follows three disaffected, aimless young people in the industrial city of [[Datong]] in China's [[Shanxi]] province throughout 2001. Nineteen-year-old '''Bin Bin''' ([[Zhao Weiwei]]) lives with his mother, an adherent of the [[Falun Gong]], in a small apartment near Datong's textile mill. Bin Bin's best friend, the reckless '''Xiao Ji''' ([[Wu Qiong]]), lives in an even smaller apartment with his father, and spends his time riding his motorbike around the city. The two friends eventually meet '''Qiao Qiao''', a young singer and dancer working for the Mongolian King Liquor company as a spokesmodel. Xiao Ji immediately becomes enamored with Qiao Qiao, which gets him in trouble with Qiao Qiao's boyfriend, the loan shark and local thug, '''Qiao San''' ([[Li Zhubin]]).  For much of the early parts of the film, the three characters seem to follow an aimless lifestyle. Unemployed, Bin Bin meets with his girlfriend to watch television on most days, while Xiao Ji seems to do nothing at all aside from flirt with Qiao Qiao. When an explosion rocks part of the city's textile mill, the characters are briefly pushed into action. Qiao Qiao, desperate to get her injured father into the hospital, has Xiao Ji rush to the bank in order to withdraw Â¥2000 for the entry fee. As thanks, she takes Xiao Ji and Bin Bin first to lunch, where Xiao Ji references watching [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', and then to a [[discotheque]]. While dancing, Xiao Ji is led away by Qiao San's men, who humiliate and beat him. Enraged, Xiao Ji tries to avenge himself but is stopped by Bin Bin, who tells him that Qiao San keeps a gun on his person. Undeterred, Xiao Ji continues to pursue Qiao Qiao, who is eventually abandoned by her boyfriend. When the two young people end up in a hotel room, Qiao Qiao tries to explain to Xiao Ji the philosophy of [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] who, in his poem ''Ren Xiao Yao'', "philosophized that we should do what feels good." Soon afterward, it is learned that Qiao San has died in a car accident. The film implies that Qiao Qiao nevertheless leaves Xiao Ji and is last seen wearing a blue wig as a prostitute in a run-down club.  Bin Bin, meanwhile, following the advice of his mother, tries to join the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]], but is rejected when it is discovered that he suffers from [[hepatitis]]. Shattered, he borrows Â¥1500 from a small-time crook '''Xiao Wu''' ([[Wang Hongwei]]). Bin Bin uses the money to purchase a cell phone for his girlfriend, but when she tries to get close to him, he refuses, and notes only that there is no future for him anymore.  Bin Bin and Xiao Ji decide to rob a bank, as they have seen so often in American films. Attaching a fake bomb to Bin Bin's chest, Xiao Ji drives Bin Bin to a [[China Construction Bank]], where the latter is immediately arrested. Fleeing, Xiao Ji drives his motorbike down the highway until it breaks down and he hitches a ride to locations unknown. Bin Bin is left at the police station, where an officer informs him that robbery is a capital crime. The film ends as the police officer forces Bin Bin to stand and sing. Bin Bin chooses to sing ''Ren Xiao Yao'', a pop song about being spiritually free through love.  
University (film)
 This movie is about a socially awkward college student named Gandhi (Jeevan), who cannot seem to have joyful social interactions with people. He greatly differs from his peers-he doesn't smoke, drink or participate in any vices, which immediately sets him apart when it comes to friendships. One fine day in college, his Romeo friend gets hit by an oncoming scooter, of which a happy and extroverted girl called Shanmathi (Gajala) was riding. In a fit of anger, Gandhi reprimands her, which instantly earns him her distaste. His friend, however, put up a show of nicety, later on plotting to sabotage her by puncturing the wheel of her scooter. Despite Gandhi's pleas to stop him, he continues to do so. When the former tried to rectify the punctured wheel, Shanmathi comes by and is revolted by Gandhi's actions, mistaking his intentions and thinking that he instead, was trying to puncture the tire for revenge. The real saboteur comes by, once more acting as if Gandhi was at fault. Much to Aalthotta Boopathy's (Vivek) surprise, Gandhi never utters a word in defense. It is then revealed that due to his difficult upbringing that resulted in his introverted and low self esteem nature, he never speaks up for himself. On another occasion, there was a molest case in college whereby Shanmathi and Gandhi were witnesses. Shanmathi had made an agreement with Gandhi not to reveal the ugly truth to anyone in attempts of protecting the affected girl's future, to which Gandhi complies. However, through a professor's prodding, Shanmathi reveals the truth, once more mistaking Gandhi and thinking that he was the one who had revealed to the professor about the molestation. Due to his bad luck with people, Gandhi resorts to using a phone book to call people and say, "Wrong number", in which he uses the opportunity to speak with unknown people. Through this eccentric method, he calls Shanmathi one night. She was on the verge of committing suicide as her father had forced her into flying off to Malaysia since he disliked her love for singing, traveling and enjoying without a care in the world. It was then that Gandhi called, successfully preventing her from committing suicide. He then advises her on how she ought to face her problems and not run away from them like a coward, thereby changing her decision. The both of them have therefore never seen each other before. However, the gratitude that Shanmathi had for Gandhi slowly started blossoming into love as the both of them continued to speak on the phone with each other.  Shanmathi wants to meet Gandhi at a restaurant, to which he reluctantly agreed. Despite his low self esteem, he gets excited as this is the first time someone has expressed liking for him. He dresses up fashionably for the first time and enters the restaurant with flowers, positive that his phone-lover would approve of him. However, upon entering the restaurant, he realizes that she is Shanmathi, the girl who has great distaste for him. Unfortunately, he spills over her drink while walking by, thereby increasing her distaste for him. He left the restaurant, dejected. When questioned by Shanmathi over the phone about his absence, he informed her that he will approach her on Valentines' Day. However, when he was just about to approach her, he accidentally steps on her scarf, which led to Shanmathi mistaking him for being a pervert. Once again feeling dejected, Gandhi decides never to approach her as she will never like him should she see him. With her friend's help, Shanmathi manages to trace the address of the mystery caller, eventually realizing that he is from her college. Gandhi writes beautiful poems during his past time, of which the college's Psychology professor discovers and appreciates. Since the college's culturals was approaching, Shanmathi was appointed to sing a song, of which Gandhi is the lyricist, as appointed by the professor. Despite Gandhi's denial, the professor insists, to which Gandhi reluctantly agreed. When Gandhi asks Shanmathi about the mood of the song to which he can write appropriate lyrics, she neglects him completely, showcasing utter dislike for him. Gandhi overhears her conversation with her friend, in which she reveals how her song should bring forth her mystery lover. Gandhi writes the lyrics accordingly, which Shanmathi never takes notice of. When the professor discovers that Shanmathi was disturbed by her mystery lover, he instructs Boopathy to find out who that mystery lover is. Aal Thotta Bhoopathy appoints an actor, Bala, to act like Shanmathi's mystery lover so that her real lover will stop Bala and reveal his identity. Shanmathi immediately believes that actor despite vast difference in the voice. To his dismay, Gandhi discovers that Shanmathi is in love with a man who was acting like him. Even when Boopathy scribbles love notes on the walls of the college, Shanmathi's real lover never appeared. Like many of the previous incidents, Gandhi never reveals the truth. Unfortunately, Bala takes advantage of the situation and tries to marry Shanmathi without anyone's knowledge. Gandhi finally opens up to his professor and receives an eye-opening lecture from him. He is then persuaded into revealing his identity and expressing his love for Shanmathi. Meanwhile, Boopathy reveals his ill-fated plot to Shanmathi, who cannot bear it any longer and resorts to suicide once more. Gandhi then uses a speaker to say the very same words of advice against suicide as he first did to her, which reaches Shanmathi's ears. She tries to run into the room where her mystery lover is, only to be stopped by Bala. In a short duel, Boopathy manages to stab Bala's leg and free Shanmathi, who jostles in the crowd and reaches the room her lover was in. Upon discovering that her lover was Gandhi, she regrets dismissing him rudely several times. The movie ends as she runs and hugs Gandhi, delighted that she has found the man she had been dreaming about.

Van Wilder
 Vance âVanâ Wilder ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) is a confident and sardonic seventh year senior at Coolidge College. With no ambition to graduate, Van spends his days driving around campus in his customized golf cart, posing nude for [[figure drawing]] classes, organizing soirees for his peers and interviewing for a new assistant, whom he eventually finds in the sexually repressed Taj Badalandabad ([[Kal Penn]]).  Upon learning that his son is still in school, Vanâs father ([[Tim Matheson]]) decides to sever Vanâs financial support. Faced with disenrollment due to unpaid tuition, Van seeks a payment extension from the registrar, Deloris. After Van has sex with her, Deloris hands him the paperwork for an extension, which Van realizes he only needed to ask for in the first place.  Gwen Pearson works for the school paper, and despite her talents for journalism, her articles do not generate interest from the student body. Her editor assigns her to get an âunattainableâ human interest story on Van Wilder. After a couple of attempts to get money fast, Van is approached by the Lambda Omega Omega fraternity, offering to pay him a thousand dollars to throw them a blowout party and boost their popularity.  Overhearing two of the Lambdas expressing their excitement over the partyâs success and their satisfaction with Vanâs work, Gwen writes a story crediting Van as the host of the party. Though Van hates the article at first, he realizes it can be the "cash cow" he needs to stay in school. Van eventually agrees to sit down with Gwen for the follow-up piece.  Gwenâs boyfriend, Richard âDickâ Bagg ([[Daniel Cosgrove]]), is a pre-medical student and the president of his fraternity Delta Iota Kappa. As he learns of Gwenâs work with Van and suspects a growing bond between them, he moves to sabotage their prospective romance. Van and Richard exchange escalating pranks until it culminates in Van, Taj and Vanâs roommate Hutch ([[Teck Holmes]]) replacing the cream filling of a batch of pastries with canine [[semen]] taken from Vanâs [[English Bulldog]] Colossus.  Gwen accesses Vanâs records from the Admissions & Records office while doing background work on her piece, learning that Van has actively avoided graduating for the past seven semesters. Angry that Gwen dug into such personal details, Van dissociates himself from Gwen and takes a contemplative look at his life.  Richard arranges to sabotage Van's latest party with Jeannie ([[Emily Rutherfurd]]), a member of a sister sorority by smuggling underaged children into the party and getting them [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], then calling a campus police officer to the scene. As a result, Van is arrested for selling alcohol to minors and faces expulsion from Coolidge. The student body pools its resources to defend Van against the charges before a university panel featuring, among others, Vanâs collegiate adversary Professor McDougal ([[Paul Gleason]]), Deloris and Richard.  While the law club invests time coaching Van to plead innocent to the charges, the rest of the student body works to generate support for Van. Having learned from his past mistakes and what Gwen has shown him, Van goes off book during the hearing and takes responsibility for the kids at the party. He throws himself at the mercy of the court and asks that rather than expelling him they force him to graduate since he is only 18 units shy of his [[Academic degree|degree]]. Professor McDougal surprises everyone with his swing vote, casting the 3-2 vote in favor of Vanâs reinstatement, and Van studies for the quickly-approaching finals.  In retaliation for Richard's underhandedness (and his later-revealed infidelity with Jeannie), Gwen spikes Richardâs ritual protein shake with a powerful [[laxative]] just prior to his taking the [[Medical College Admission Test]]. Unable to hold out (since bathroom breaks are forbidden during the test), Richard âdials down the middleâ of most his multiple-choice exam sheet, and hurriedly exits the exam room. As he rushes to find a bathroom, he is intercepted by one of the doctors from the group meant to interview him for admission to [[Feinberg School of Medicine|Northwestern Medical School]], who pulls him into an office to meet with the others. Unable to hold himself any longer, Richard strips off his pants and has violent diarrhea in the waste basket in the room, to the revulsion and horror of the doctors present.  Van utilizes the entire exam period for his last final with Professor McDougal, finishing with a negative attitude. McDougal himself delivers the news to Van that he passed. McDougal notes that he had been so hard on him all those years because he believed Van wasn't living up to his potential.  The university celebrates Vanâs graduation with a wild party held in Vanâs honor. Vanâs father appears, admitting he was wrong and expressing his pride in Vanâs success. Gwen then arrives, lovingly reuniting with Van.

Vampires: Los Muertos

Derek drags her to an abandoned car lot and watches her catch fire in the sunlight while filming it on camera.  When he gets back to his hotel room, the Van Helsing Group leader calls him and informs him that he has a new job. He goes down to Mexico to a convent where a group of vampire-hunting priests are staying. He has a strange vision, and one of the priests conclude that the vampires may be linking up with him.  That night, Una ([[Arly Jover]]), a vampire princess, and her fledglings attack and feed upon a human man. The next day, Derek goes looking for people on a list he has been given. Unfortunately, most of them are dead or crazy, and the last living ones are killed. Derek goes to a coffee shop and asks for a man named Jesse. He tells Derek to wait while he finishes up something. Derek then meets a young woman named Zoey ([[Natasha Gregson Wagner]]), and he grows suspicious when she asks him if he works in the "undead" business. He leaves to go to the bathroom, and finds out that Zoey is a vampire by using a special lens, lamenting the fact as he thinks she's cute. In the split second it takes him to throw a paper towel in the trash, Una comes in, slashes the throat of every customer, and kidnaps Jesse.  When Derek comes out and sees that Zoey has also fled, he concludes that she must have done it. The next day, he pulls over when sees her on the side of the road in daylight. They argue; Zoey tells him about special pills she takes to fight off her vampire side. She got bit accidentally by a vampire during a one night stand. She has a vision of a monastery, and Derek realizes that it is the one where he just left. They drive back and find all but one priest slaughtered. Father Rodrigo ([[CristiÃ¡n de la Fuente]]) tells them of the Berziers Cross which is being sought by Una as it can be used to perform a ritual that will enabled vampires to walk in daylight and be invulnerable, and shows them something a fellow priest was working on in his spare time: a huge van complete with all the necessary vampire-slaying tools. Derek hears a noise in the trees, and finds a teenager that he had met before. His name is Sancho ([[Diego Luna]]), and he has a [[permission slip]] from his mother, stating he can go on the vampire hunt with Derek.  The group meet up with another hunter, Ray Collins ([[Darius McCrary]]) from Memphis, and go after Una. Una seduces Ray and convinces him to leave Zoey's pills where she can get them. When they reach the village where the vampires are hiding out, they are welcomed because they want the vampires killed. Una, now able to walk in daylight, goes out and kidnaps Zoey. Derek aims the gun at Sancho and says he must have given the pills to Una. However, a villager realizes that Ray did it, and shoots him before Derek shoots Sancho. Derek and the gang go after Zoey to rescue her, at the cost of leaving Rodrigo to properly perform the ritual. They go back to a clinic, where Zoey's vampire blood is exchanged for human blood; as her pills were all used, this method is the only way to suppress her vampire side for a time. Derek knows how to save Rodrigo; the vampire blood is pumped into his body.  The team goes after Rodrigo and find out that he was not a real priest. Una is not daunted, and she responds by lighting a fire beneath his feet. Derek saves Rodrigo, and goes after Una. They almost kill her, but she escapes when the cord which was dragging her into the sunlight snaps. She catches Derek, but Derek then grabs what is left of the cord. Before they reach the sunlight, Derek shoots her head off with a shotgun and sends it flying into the sun, where it catches fire. Her body turns into stone with a black beating heart in the chest. Derek drives a stake into the heart. Sancho and Rodrigo decide to stay in the village, and Derek and Zoey drive away in the sunset to resupply on pills.

Ford has sold their horse, Twister, to a neighbor and forbidden his daughters from riding in an effort to keep them safe. Ford and Caroline both blame Twister for Deborah's death. Twister dies in childbirth while she delivers a foal and Virginia names the foal Stormy.  Virginia sneaks out to care for Stormy and ride him at night. The owner, Blake, tries to train Stormy to race for his son Darrow, who is also Caroline's boyfriend, but the horse doesn't get along well with him. Blake decides to sell Stormy and Virginia is heartbroken. Ford is able to track down the person who bought Stormy and he buys him back to give to Virginia as a birthday present.  Virginia has started working with one of Blake's trainers, Jessie. Virginia tells her how much she loves horses and how riding them is a way to remember her mom. After trying to reason with him Ford explains to Jessie that he's trying to protect Virginia. Jessie tries to get Ford to understand that by not letting Virginia ride, he is only crushing her spirit. Ford realizes that Deborah wouldn't have wanted him to stop riding or to keep Virginia away from horses. He starts riding with Virginia and giving her lessons. There is a race on [[Memorial Day]] and he thinks that she and Stormy are ready.  Virginia is riding by herself and she comes across Darrow riding with his buddies. He challenges her to a race to the train tracks and Virginia barely makes it, missing the train by a few feet. Darrow realizes that she is a better rider and that he needs to do something to prevent her from beating him in the race. He and his buddies kidnap Stormy. When Virginia finds out that Stormy is missing, she is distraught. Her father believes that Stormy has just escaped, but she tells her sister that she believes Darrow stole him. Caroline thinks that she can find out what happened by coming on to one of his friends, who tells her where to find Stormy. Virginia finds Stormy and gets to the town square where the race is about to begin. The race officials refuse to let her race because she is late, but after the crowd starts chanting, "Let Virginia Ride! Let Virginia Ride!" she is allowed to participate.  She starts out behind but catches up to the pack. Darrow was in the lead since the beginning, but when he sees Virginia he resorts to cheating. He knocks her off her horse and then hides a trail marker flag, so she will get lost. When she can't figure out which way to go by looking at her map, Stormy knows she is lost and he tells her which way to go. She catches up to Darrow again and wins the race.  Darrow's father convinces the [[MC]] to disqualify Virginia for some vague and unspecified violation and Darrow tries to accept the trophy. Virginia notices something in his pocket and tells Caroline to check it out. She sneaks up to him and pulls out the flag. He is disqualified for cheating and Virginia accepts the trophy while two men from the audience toss the MC into a water [[Watering trough|trough]].  At home, the family is eating dinner with Jessie. Blake has fired Jessie and Caroline has broken up with Darrow. Virginia comments that they are happier than they have been in a long time. She walks outside to feed Stormy and knows she would not won the race if not for memories of her mother.

  In Beaufort, North Carolina, popular and rebellious teenager Landon Carter and his friends have been fond of underage drinking on school grounds. They seriously injure another student during a prank gone wrong. The principal gives Landon the choice of being expelled or atoning for his actions by tutoring fellow students, helping the janitor, and participating in the school play. Choosing and doing the latter, Landon notices Jamie Sullivan, who he has known since kindergarten and is the local minister's daughter. He has seldom paid any attention to her, as she is labeled as an outsider and a geek because of her interest in astronomy.  Landon has trouble learning his lines for the play, so Jamie, who is also in the play, agrees to help him on one condition: for him to not fall in love with her, and he laughs it off and dismisses it as a foolish idea. They begin practicing together at her house after school, but Landon remains wary of ruining his image by being friendly with an outsider like her. At one point he makes the insulting suggestion that they be "secret friends", and Jamie's hurt but mature response embarrasses Landon.

The Way Home (2002 film)

It is soon clear that the unsophisticated rural passengers annoy the seven-year-old urban boy. His mother is taking him to live with his 78-year-old mute, but not deaf, grandmother (Kim Eul-boon) while she looks for a new job after a business venture failed in [[Seoul]]. Eventually they reach their destination, a dusty bus stop in the Korean countryside near an unsophisticated village.    By now Sang-woo, who has arrived with junk food and toys, has no intention of respecting his mute grandmother especially as her house has neither electricity nor running water. His mother apologises for leaving the boy, telling her own mother it will not be for too long before leaving on the next bus. Alone Sang-woo ignores his grandmother, not even wanting to look at her even calling her a ''byungshin'', or "retard". Next morning, his grandmother starts another day. She goes down the hill to get clean water and washes her clothes at the river. She also tends the melons that she will sell at the market.  One of the Grandmother's neighbours is a hard-working country boy who attempts to become friends with Sang-woo, who declines until the end when he apologizes for making fun of him. The other is a young girl who Sang-Woo falls in love with, but she is more interested in the country boy.  The grandmother, who also cares for her old friends very much, lives a simple and [[Humility|humble]] life. Eventually, from constant play, Sang-woo's [[Game Boy]] runs-out of batteries so he asks his grandmother for money for new ones. But she is poor and has none. Selfishly he teases her, and in an intolerant manner throws away her shoes, breaks one of her vases and draws graffiti on her house walls.   When this fails to get money from his grandmother, Sang-woo steals her ornamental hairpin to trade for batteries. He then goes off to find the shops. When he finally finds the right place he attempts to trade the silver hairpin but instead of getting batteries the shop keeper, who happens to be his grandmother's friend, hits him on the head and sends him home.   One day Sang-woo demands [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. But as the grandmother only understand "chicken", she takes some of her melons and trudges off to the market to buy a chicken. Bringing back a live one in the rain, she prepares a home-made [[Samgyetang|boiled chicken]] instead of fried chicken. When Sang-woo wakes up he sees the boiled chicken he gets angry, throwing the food away. Later in the night he finishes the food because he is hungry. The next morning, his grandmother becomes ill and Sang-woo serves her the remaining chicken while caring for her.  Despite the hardships faced by the old grandmother who has [[osteoporosis]], the only thing she needs Sang-woo for is to run thread through her needles. She stitches the shoes and shares her earnings with a friend who ends their meeting with the touching words "Come by again before one of us dies."  Sang-woo who remains angry and confused by the unfamiliar environment repeatedly rejects her attempts to please him. But her unconditional love slowly touches his heart. One day, Sang-woo gets up early and goes with his grandmother to the market where he sees how hard his grandmother persuades passers-by to buy her vegetables. After a long day at the market she takes Sang-woo to a shop and buys him noodles and new shoes. When they are about to board the bus home, Sang-woo asks his grandma to buy him a [[Choco Pie]].   The grandmother goes to a shop that is run by an elderly friend. The shopkeeper, who now has a bad knee, gives her five or six pies but refuses to take any money, so the grandmother gives the shopkeeper a melon. But when the grandmother returns to the bus with the sweets, Sang-Woo says he wants to ride alone as the girl he likes is also on board. The grandmother tries to get Sang-Woo to take the rest of the produce with him but he refuses. The bus then leaves. Sang-Woo then has to wait for his grandmother to return wondering why it is taking her so long. He then realises that his grandmother has walked back from town carrying all her produce.    Eventually Sang-woo begins to love his grandmother, but because she is unable to read or write he makes some simple greeting cards, so she has some letters from him.

War (2002 film)
 The film begins with the protagonist, former conscript Ivan Yermakov ([[Alexei Chadov]]), being interviewed by a journalist in a detention centre. As he begins his story the film cuts to [[Chechnya]] in the summer of 2001, during the [[Second Chechen War]]. Held captive by Chechen warlord Aslan Gugayev ([[Georgy Gurguliya]]), Ivan and another conscript, Fedya, serve as domestic slaves. Ivan is also used as a communications specialist. Eventually, Aslan's militants also capture English actor John Boyle ([[Ian Kelly (actor)|Ian Kelly]]) and his fiancÃ©e Margaret Michaelsen ([[Ingeborga DapkÅ«naitÄ]]). After a while, Ivan, Fedya, and the two English prisoners are taken to another [[aul]] and put into a [[zindan]] where they find Captain Medvedev ([[Sergei Bodrov, Jr.]]), who is already paralyzed due to injury.  Aslan releases John to collect Â£2 million for Margaret's ransom. Along with John, he releases Ivan and Fedya, as no-one was willing to pay their ransom.  John's efforts to raise money are unsuccessful, but one British television company offered to provide him with financial assistance in exchange for a detailed video of the operation. In [[Moscow]], John again runs into the complete indifference of military officials and instead decides to ask Ivan to help him rescue Margaret.  Ivan's life in Tobolsk is not working out. He cannot adapt to a peaceful civilian life, and he cannot find work due to fears over his potentially unbalanced psyche after Chechen captivity. Before that, he comes to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], to the family of Captain Medvedev, whom no one is willing to rescue. When John comes to Tobolsk, Ivan agrees to go back to Chechnya in exchange for money. After passing through Moscow and Vladikavkaz, Ivan and John covertly enter Chechnya, seizing an SUV with a large number of weapons in the trunk en route. After capturing a local resident, Ruslan Shamayev ([[Euclid Kyurdzidis]]), Ivan finds his way to Gugayev's aul. After waiting for a large group of militants to depart, Ivan, John, and Ruslan attack the aul. Having killed the guards with the weapons they had seized earlier, they find Margaret with Captain Medvedev and discover that she had been raped by the militants. Enraged, John kills Gugayev, further complicating the situation: Ivan needed Gugayev alive as a hostage to leave Chechnya safely.  Gugayev's militants assault the aul and give chase, but the group escapes on a makeshift raft and takes up defensive positions in an old fortress tower. With the help of a satellite phone taken from Aslan, Medvedev requests support from the [[Russian Air Force|Air Force]]. Russian helicopters arrive, routing the militants, and deliver Medvedev and the group to a military base.  John gives Ivan the money he promised, of which he gives Ruslan a thousand pounds. The remaining money Ivan later gave to Captain Medvedev for treatment.  The film ends with Ivan's brief comments. Margaret did not marry John. John, having constantly filmed the trip, released a film and a book, titled "My Life in Russia". After the release of his film, Ivan was brought to trial for the murder of "peaceful civilians of the Russian Federation". Ruslan, who moved to Moscow, testified against Ivan. The only one who stood up for Ivan was Captain Medvedev.

Watchtower (2001 film)
 A brother and sister move to a sleepy Oregon town and are befriended by a stranger with a magnetic personality on a summer sabbatical.  
Whale Rider
 The film's plot follows the story of Paikea Apirana ("Pai"). The leader should be the first-born grandson â a direct [[patrilineal]] descendant of [[Paikea]], the Whale Rider â he who rode on top of a whale (Tohora) from [[Hawaiki]]. Pai is originally born a twin, but her twin brother, as well as her mother, dies in childbirth. However, Pai is female and technically cannot inherit the leadership. While her grandfather, Koro, later forms an affectionate bond with his granddaughter, carrying her to school every day on his bicycle, he also condemns her and blames her for conflicts happening within the tribe.  At one point Paikea decides to live with her father because her grandfather is mistreating her. She finds that she cannot bear to leave the sea as the whale seems to be calling her back. Pai tells her father to turn the car back and returns home. After the death of his wife and overwhelming pressure from Koro, Pai's father refuses to assume traditional leadership; instead he moves to Germany to pursue a career as an artist. Pai herself is interested in the leadership, learning traditional songs and dances, but is given little encouragement by her grandfather. Pai feels that she can become the leader (although there's no precedent for a woman to do so), and is determined to succeed.  Koro leads a cultural school for the village boys, hoping to find a new leader. He teaches the boys to use a [[taiaha]] ([[fighting stick]]).  This is traditionally reserved for males. However, Nanny tells Pai that her second son, Pai's uncle, had won a taiaha tournament in his youth while he was still slim, so Pai secretly learns from him. She also secretly follows Koro's lessons. One of the students, Hemi, is also sympathetic towards her.  Koro is enraged when he finds out, particularly when she wins her taiaha fight against Hemi. Koro's relationship with Pai erodes further when none of the boys succeed at the traditional task of recovering the rei puta (whale tooth) that he threw into the ocean â this mission would prove one of them worthy of becoming leader. With the loss of the rei puta, Koro in despair calls out the Ancient ones, the whales. In an attempt to help, Pai also calls out to them and they hear her call.  One day Pai finds the rei puta while swimming, signifying that she is the rightful leader. Pai, in an attempt to bridge the rift that has formed, invites Koro to be her guest of honour at a concert of MÄori chants that her school is putting on. Unknown to all, she had won an inter-school speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village. However, Koro was late, and as he was walking to the school, he notices that numerous [[southern right whale]]s are beached near Pai's home. The entire village attempts to coax and drag them back into the water, but all efforts prove unsuccessful; even a tractor does not help. Koro sees it as a sign of his failure and despairs further. He admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because "she has done enough damage" with her presumption. Also, the largest whale traditionally belongs to the legendary Paikea.  When Koro walks away, Pai climbs onto the back of the largest whale at the location and coaxes it to re-enter the ocean. The whale leads the entire pod back into the sea; Pai submerges completely underwater, and the spectators wonder if she has drowned, but are relieved when she comes back above sea level. When she goes out to sea, Nanny shows Koro the whale tooth which Pai had previously recovered. When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro declares her the leader and asks her forgiveness.  The film ends with Pai's father, grandparents, and uncle coming together to celebrate her status as the new leader, as the finished [[waka (canoe)|waka]] is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage. In voiceover, Pai declares, "My name is Paikea Apirana, and I come from a long line of chiefs stretching all the way back to the Whale Rider. I'm not a prophet, but I know that our people will keep going forward, all together, with all of our strength."  
We Were Soldiers
 A French unit on patrol in Vietnam in 1954, during the final year of the [[First Indochina War]], is ambushed by [[Viet Minh]] forces, probably the [[Battle of Mang Yang Pass]]. Viet Minh commander [[Nguyen Huu An]] orders his soldiers to "kill all they send, and they will stop coming".  Eleven years later, the United States is fighting the [[Vietnam War]]. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Hal Moore]] ([[Mel Gibson]]) is chosen to train and lead a battalion. After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been [[Siege of Plei Me|attacked]], and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy and eliminate the North Vietnamese attackers, despite the fact that intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. Moore leads a newly created air cavalry unit into the [[Ia Drang Valley]]. After landing in the "Valley of Death", the soldiers capture a North Vietnamese soldier and learn from him that the location they were sent to is actually the base camp for a veteran North Vietnamese army division of 4,000 men.  Upon arrival in the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots an enemy scout, runs after him, and orders reluctant soldiers to follow. The North Vietnamese scout lures them into an ambush, resulting in several men being killed, including Herrick and his subordinates. The surviving platoon members are surrounded with no chance of retreat and are cut off from the rest of the battalion. Sgt. Savage assumes command, calls in artillery, and uses the cover of night to keep the Vietnamese from overrunning their small defensive position. Meanwhile, with helicopters constantly dropping off units, Moore manages to secure weak points before the North Vietnamese can take advantage of them.  On the second day, despite being trapped and desperately outnumbered, the main U.S. force manages to hold off the North Vietnamese with artillery, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and helicopter airlifts of supplies and reinforcements. Eventually, Nguyen Huu An, the commander of the North Vietnamese division, orders a large-scale attack on the American position.  At the point of being overrun by the enemy and with no options left, Moore orders 1st Lt. Charlie Hastings, his [[Forward air controllers in the Vietnam War|Forward Air Controller]], to call in "Broken Arrow" (a call for all available combat aircraft to assist and attack enemy positions, even those close to the U.S. troops' position, because a position is being overrun and can no longer be defended).<ref></ref> The aircraft attack with bombs, [[napalm]], and machine guns, killing many [[People's Army of Vietnam|PAVN]] and [[Viet Cong]] troops; but a [[friendly fire]] incident also results in American deaths. The second North Vietnamese attack is repelled, and the surviving soldiers of Herrick's cut off platoon, including Savage, are rescued.  Meanwhile, back in the United States, Julia Moore ([[Madeleine Stowe]]) has become the leader of the American wives living on the base. When the Army begins to use [[yellow cab]] drivers to deliver telegrams notifying the next of kin of soldiers' deaths in combat, Julia personally assumes that emotional responsibility instead.  Moore's troops regroup, secure the area, and stop at the base of a hill. Nguyen Huu An plans a final assault on the Americans and sends most of his troops to carry out the attack. The North Vietnamese have set up strong emplacements near the hidden entrance of the underground passage to the command post. Hal and his men charge at them, but before the North Vietnamese can fire, Major [[Bruce Crandall|Bruce "Snake" Crandall]] and others in helicopter gunships attack the North Vietnamese, destroying the bulk of the enemy force.  Nguyen Huu An is alerted that the Americans have broken through their lines and that there are no soldiers between the Americans and their command post. Since he had deployed his reserve forces to the final offensive, and the base camp has no troops to call upon for defense, Huu An quickly orders the headquarters evacuated.  Moore, having achieved his objective, returns to the helicopter landing zone to be picked up. Only after everyone (including the dead and wounded) is removed from the battlefield does he fly out of the valley. Some time later, Nguyen Huu An and his men arrive on the battlefield to collect their dead. He claims that the Americans will "think this was their victory. So this will become an American war."

Welcome to Collinwood
 Cosimo is arrested when he and Toto try to steal a car. In prison, he meets an old man who tells him of a âBelliniâ - a perfect heist - that he could not carry out because of a life sentence. Cosimo asks his girlfriend Rosalind to find a "Mullinski" (slang for someone willing to do prison time in exchange for money) so that he can walk free and pull off the heist. Rosalind and Toto ask misfits Basil, Leon, Riley, who babysits his infant son while needing Â£1,000 to pay his own wifeâs jail fine, and Pero "Pepe" Mahalovic, a [[Serbian American]] boxer who agrees to confess to Cosimo's crime for $16,000 but ends up being jailed alongside him. While inside, Pero gets Cosimo to tell him what the Bellini is before revealing that his own sentence was suspended, leaving Cosimo still in jail. Returning home, Pero is met by Rosalind and the other four demanding a refund. He tells them he used the $16,000 to pay off debts but will share the Bellini details. The six then decide to carry out the heist themselves.  The Bellini concerns a brick building on Chester converted from a flour factory into apartments and a jewelry store. The old man in jail worked on the conversion and created a false wall between one apartment and the room with the jewelry store safe. Riley steals a video camera from a street market so that the group can get the combination by filming the jeweller opening the safe. After filming fails they hire Jerzy, a safecracker who uses a wheelchair, to teach them how to drill into the safe, whereupon Detective Babitch starts to keep a close eye on them. Then two maiden aunts with a maid named Carmela move into the long-vacant apartment, and so Leon and Basil pretend to accost Carmela while Pero comes to her "rescue" to secure a date in the hope of stealing her keys. Meanwhile in prison a guard suddenly drops dead and Cosimo uses his uniform to escape. When he confronts Pero and the others, they try to convince Cosimo that they can split the take equally, but he hits Rosalind for betraying him and threatens to kill anyone who tries to pull off âhisâ Bellini.  Rosalind becomes disheartened and leaves the group but Pero finds that he is falling for Carmela, who reveals that the aunts will be out of town for several days. That same night Cosimo dies in a bus accident. Basil meets Leon's sister, Michelle, and they begin dating although she tells him that she wants âan honest man". After Babitch watches the group attend Cosimoâs funeral Pero decides to bribe him in exchange for turning a blind eye while they do the heist, and gives Babitch the $16,000 which he has lied about spending.  On the night of the heist, Riley leaves his baby with Rosalind but while on his way to meet up at Pero's apartment he gets his arm broken by the men he stole the video camera from. He arrives with one arm in a cast and âhighâ from a bottleful of Vicodin. Leon, having found out about his sisterâs affair, arrives to confront Basil. Basil then reveals that he can't go on the heist because heâs now taken an honest job in order to be worthy of Michelle, and leaves. During the heist itself, everything that can go wrong, does. Toto loses his pants, Pero bites off the tip of his tongue, and they find that their floor plans are out of date when they break through the wrong wall (into the kitchen) at 3 am. They realize there is not enough time left to reach and crack open the safe, but Toto finds $1,000 in a cookie jar and so they decide to heat some soup on the apartment stove so as to eat before leaving â whereupon the stove blows up. After the explosion, the group is standing at the bus stop. Riley suggests that they shouldn't see one another again, but just as he gets on the bus the other three decide to give Riley all of the $1,000 for his wifeâs jail fine. Leon heads home to apologize to his sister and tells Pero to let him know when he gets another Bellini, and before Pero also leaves Toto asks him about Carmela, and tells him that it's important to have someone to walk with, more so than money.

White Oleander (film)
 15 year-old Astrid Magnussen ([[Alison Lohman]]) is living in [[Los Angeles]] with her mother, the free-spirited artist Ingrid ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]). Since her father left before she was old enough to remember him, Astrid depends heavily upon the care of her passionate but largely self-centered mother.  Ingrid's current relationship with a writer named Barry ([[Billy Connolly]]) ends when she discovers he is cheating on her with younger women. Ingrid murders him with a poison made from white [[oleander]]. Ingrid is arrested and sentenced to life in prison, leaving Astrid under the care of the state of [[California]].  Astrid is sent to live with foster mother Starr Thomas ([[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]]), a former [[stripper]] who is a recovering alcoholic and [[born-again Christian]].

Astrid begins an affair with Starr's live in boyfriend Ray ([[Cole Hauser]]), which drives Starr into drinking again. After a loud argument with him, she runs into Astrid's room in a drunken rage and shoots her in the shoulder. The other children beg her not to tell who shot her, so Astrid pretends she has no clue.  Astrid spends some time recovering in a hospital before being moved to MacLaren Children's Center (known as "Mac". After fighting with some girls, she strikes up a friendship with fellow artist Paul Trout ([[Patrick Fugit]]).  Eventually, Astrid is placed in the care of Claire Richards ([[RenÃ©e Zellweger]]), a former actress, and her producer husband Mark ([[Noah Wyle]]). Claire is a sweet, affectionate woman who forms a close bond with Astrid. One day, Astrid comes home to find a letter from her mother to Claire. She confronts Claire only to find out that it has been going on for a while and that they plan on meeting. Claire accompanies Astrid on a visit to Ingrid in prison. The jealous Ingrid exploits Claire's low self-esteem and suspicions over Mark's fidelity, much to Astrid's outrage. During a bad argument with Mark, she agrees to send Astrid back to try and save her marriage. After a tender conversation where they cuddled in bed together, Claire unexpectedly commits suicide, devastating Astrid.  Astrid visits her mother to inform her of Claire's death, that she was returned to MAC and that she will never visit her again.

Astrid passes up better foster parent candidates and chooses to live with a [[Russians|Russian]] [[immigrant]], Rena (Svetlana Efremova), who treats her foster children as cheap laborers for her swap meet business. During her time with Rena, she becomes colder and colder with her appearance matching her insides. She is approached by her mother's attorney ([[Kali Rocha]]), a woman taken in by her mother's charm. She offers Astrid anything she wants in exchange for lying for her mother in court since her mother has benefactors. After refusing, Rena tells her that she's stupid to do so. She then offers her to be her partner in their business since she has nowhere better to go. When Astrid refuses, Rena tells her to use her mother like her mother wants to use her.  Astrid visits her mother, astonishing her with her appearance. She is no longer blond, but has black hair, harsh makeup and dark clothes. Astrid realizes Rena was right and demands answers about her past in exchange for testifying that she killed Barry in self-defense. Astrid hammers her with questions about Barry, her father, Claire and who Annie was. Ingrid admits to leaving her with Annie for around a year and that her father came looking for her when she was 8, but Ingrid turned him away for leaving them 7 years before.

Her mother spots her in the courtroom and they stare at one another as she is led away. Gutted, Astrid stares out the window as her mother is taken back to the bus to return to prison.

It primarily centers on the family's younger daughter Eliza, and her secret gift of being able to communicate with animals,<ref name=Spotlight></ref> which was bestowed upon her after having rescued a shaman masquerading as a trapped warthog.  The gift enabled her to talk to the Thornberrys' pet chimpanzee Darwin. Together, the pair frequently venture through the wilderness, befriending many species of wild animals along the way or realizing moral truths and lessons through either their experiences or a particular animal species's lifestyle, or simply assisting the creatures, by which they become acquainted, in their difficulties.  
Windtalkers
 During [[World War II]], USMC Cpl Joseph F. "Joe" Enders rallies himself to return to active duty with the aid of his pharmacist, Rita. He previously survived a gruesome [[Solomon Islands campaign|battle on the Solomon Islands against the Imperial Japanese Army]] that killed his entire squad and left him with a scar on his neck and almost deaf in his left ear. Enders' new assignment is to protect [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[code talker]] Pvt. Ben Yahzee, and carries a promotion for Enders to Sergeant. Sgt. Pete "Ox" Henderson also receives a parallel assignment protecting Navajo code talker Pvt. Charlie Whitehorse. The [[Navajo code]], as it was known, was a code based on two parts: 1) the [[Navajo language]] and 2) a code embedded in the language, meaning that even native speakers would be confused by it, referring to a tank as a turtle, for example. The code was close to unbreakable but also so difficult only a few people could learn it.  Yahzee and Whitehorse, lifelong friends from the same Navajo tribe, are trained to send and receive coded messages that direct [[Fire support|artillery fire]]. Enders and Henderson are shown evidence that captured Navajos are tortured to death to get the code and instructed that it cannot fall into enemy hands. This implies that they are to kill their code talkers if capture is imminent.  As Enders and Henderson meet Yahzee and Whitehorse, it becomes apparent that the two experienced Marines are less than happy to be babysitting their Navajo codetalkers, and the Navajos must also endure racial harassment by some of the white Marines, notably Private Chick.  During their missions, however, Henderson and Whitehorse discover a mutual love of music, Whitehorse with his flute and Henderson with his harmonica, and as their practicing becomes more and more melodic, Henderson intones that their music is turning into something.  They become not just Marines, but friends. Enders and Yahzee also discover that they have much in common, notably their Catholic upbringings.  The [[battle of Saipan|invasion of Saipan]] is Yahzee's and Whitehorse's first combat experience. After the [[beachhead]] is secured in vicious fighting, the Marines come under [[friendly fire]] from U.S. artillery (during which Pvt. Nellie is killed saving a badly wounded marine). Yahzee's radio is destroyed and the convoy is unable to call off the bombardment. Yahzee suggests that he disguise himself as an Imperial Japanese soldier and slip behind enemy lines to commandeer a radio. Enders goes with him as a prisoner and eliminates several Japanese soldiers. Yahzee is forced to kill for the first time before he can redirect U.S. artillery fire onto the Japanese position.  For their bravery, Enders is awarded a Silver Star by the commanding officer, with Yahzee's role almost ignored until Enders points him out but still credits Enders.  Enders sees Cpl. Pappas praying by Nellie's hastily dug grave and, knowing he was alive because of Nellie's actions, gives the medal to Pappas with instructions to send it to Nellie's wife.  Later, after a night of sake drinking, Yahzee performs Navajo rituals over the unconscious Enders to protect him with the spirits.  That night the Marines camp in a village, Tanapag, thought to be secured. While Yahzee is temporarily assigned back to the command post to translate a code, Enders becomes increasingly torn because, despite his orders, he cannot imagine killing Yahzee. As a result, he demands to be relieved from his unit but this request is denied. The next morning, Japanese soldiers ambush the village, and in the fierce fighting, Pvt. Harrigan (the squad's flamethrower man) is shot in the flame tanks and burns, forcing Enders to [[Mercy killing|kill him]]. Later in the battle, Whitehorse saves the life of Chick, then he and Henderson take cover and hold off numerous Japanese. Running low on ammunition, Henderson realizes Whitehorse is in danger of being captured, but Henderson cannot bring himself to kill the man he has grown close to. Turning to meet the enemy, Henderson is beheaded by a Samurai sword and Whitehorse is about to be captured by the Japanese. Enders sees Whitehorse being beaten and dragged away by the Japanese and tries to shoot the captors with his pistol, but it has run out of ammunition. Enders pulls out a grenade but hesitates as he makes eye contact with Whitehorse. Whitehorse, realizing the Japanese will torture him for the code, vehemently nods to Enders, who grimly primes the grenade and throws it at Whitehorse's feet. The ensuing explosion kills both Whitehorse and the Japanese captors.  Yahzee returns to Tanapag and, seeing Whitehorse's body, screams at Enders to explain what happened as the village was thought to be secured. Enders, exhausted, mutters that he killed Whitehorse, but does not reveal that Whitehorse was willing to die to protect the code. Outraged, Yahzee aims his weapon at Enders but cannot bring himself to kill him in cold blood.  Enders confesses that he hated having to kill Whitehorse and that, like Henderson, his mission was to protect the code above all else.  The Marines are mobilized on another mission and are again ambushed, this time near a deadly minefield on [[Mt. Tapochau]]. After fighting out of the [[kill zone]] they are ambushed again and Gy/Sgt Hjelmsted is wounded in the chest and later dies of his wounds. Enders, Yahzee, Chick and Pappas (the last of the Marines) take cover on an old battle-torn ridge, and amidst the fierce battle, the Marines see Japanese artillery fire from the top of the ridge attacking U.S. Marines below their position. Still enraged over the death of Whitehorse, Yahzee charges the Japanese line fearlessly, and in so doing, fumbles the radio needed to call in the coordinates for an effective bombardment. Yahzee and Enders are both shot as they retrieve the radio and call in an airstrike on the Japanese artillery. However, surrounded and knowing the Japanese will capture and torture him for the code as they almost did with Whitehorse, Yahzee entreats Enders to kill him. Enders, grimly determined that no one else will die that day, manages to carry Yahzee to safety after taking a shot in the chest. Friendly planes arrive and the Japanese position is successfully destroyed. Yahzee rejoices in their success but finds Enders mortally wounded.  With his last breaths, Enders reverts to the religious upbringing he earlier claimed he had abandoned, and recites a Hail Mary.  Returning to the U.S., Yahzee, his wife, and his young son George Washington Yahzee, sit atop Point Mesa in [[Monument Valley]], Arizona, and, wearing the sacred necklaces and other Navajo ceremonial dress, performs the Navajo ritual of paying respects to the man who saved his life. He tells his son that Enders was a fierce warrior and Marine and, that if his son ever tells a story about Enders, to simply say that he was Yahzee's friend.  He then cleans Enders' dog tags in holy water, reaffirming his own religious doctrine. He lifts them to the sky while chanting in ritual, sending Enders' spirit reverting to the Earth as the vast palisades surround and watch over them.  An epilogue explains that the Navajo code was crucial to America's success against Japan across the Pacific theater and that, during the war, the code was never broken.  
The Wild Thornberrys Movie
  12-year-old Eliza Thornberry plays with a family of [[cheetah]]s in East Africa after being left in charge of the cubs by their mother, Akela. When Eliza strays far from the cheetahs' home, one of the cheetah cubs, Tally, is kidnapped by poachers. Eliza is determined to save the cub, which prompts her grandmother Cordelia to bring her to a [[boarding school]] in [[London]] for her safety. Upon arriving, Eliza discovers that her pet [[chimpanzee]], Darwin, stowed away in her suitcase. He attempts to blend in but gets both him and Eliza in trouble.  After having a dream in which Shaman Mnyambo tells her to save Tally, Eliza and Darwin return to Africa. While taking a train from Nairobi, they encounter an injured rhino, who was shot at the river by the same poachers who kidnapped Tally. They save the rhino with the help of veterinarians Bree and Sloan Blackburn. Meanwhile, Eliza's older sister Debbie is left alone with her feral adoptive younger brother Donnie at their RV, the Comvee, while their parents, Nigel and Marianne, go to film a solar eclipse at Tempo Valley. Eliza returns to the Comvee for supplies; after a small confrontation, Debbie pursues her, Darwin, and Donnie. Cordelia and her husband, Colonel Radcliffe, meet up with Nigel and Marianne to inform them of Eliza's escape, and they also begin searching for Eliza.  Darwin, Eliza, and Donnie meet a gorilla who mentions seeing people setting up a fence across Tempo Valley. Then, they run into the Blackburns again. Eliza concludes that the poachers are targeting the elephant herd traveling through the valley. Later, the trio finds Tally in the Blackburns' RV, exposing their true nature as the poachers. The Blackburns capture them and reveal the fence is electrified. Meanwhile, Debbie meets a local boy named Boko, who is sent by his village elders to assist her. The two reach the Blackburns' RV, but Debbie is held hostage by Sloan after she reveals she is Eliza's sister. When Sloan threatens to kill Debbie if Eliza doesn't tell him how she found out their plan, Eliza admits it was because of her ability to talk to animals. A storm comes and takes away Eliza's powers while the Blackburns flee.   They reach Tempo Valley in time to see the elephant herd heading for the electric fence. When Eliza becomes doubtful of herself, Debbie reminds her that she has been helping animals long before gaining her powers, restoring her confidence. The Blackburns, riding a helicopter, order their men to set off explosives, scaring the elephants and making them charge toward the fence. Eliza triggers the fence's electricity prematurely, causing the herd to stop temporarily, and then convinces the lead elephant to turn around. Infuriated, Sloan grabs Eliza and throws her into a river. He then attempts to shoot the elephants, but they pull the Blackburns' helicopter out of the air by its rope ladder and destroy it, causing him and Bree to fall. They survive the fall but are arrested by rangers soon after as the eclipse ended. Eliza is saved by Shaman Mnyambo, who tells her she saved the elephants using her heart. As a reward, he gives her back her powers.   Eliza reunites with her family, who decide not to send her back to boarding school, while Boko returns to his village, keeping Debbie's watch as a memento. The Thornberrys return to the Savannah, where Eliza reunites Tally with his family. Debbie is angered when Eliza tells her that she will turn into a baboon if she reveals her secret, and in the process frightens a group of baboons Nigel and Marianne are filming. One of them activates the radio, which plays music that the Thornberrys and the baboons dance to.

Wishmaster: The Prophecy Fulfilled
  As in the previous films, an evil [[genie]] is released from his prison - an ancient jewel - and must grant three wishes to the person who awakens him, in order to release the race of Djinn from hell and allow them to take over the earth.  Painter Sam ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]) and his girlfriend Lisa ([[Tara Spencer-Nairn]]) have just moved in together when he has a terrible accident that leaves him paraplegic; specifically, the bones in his lower legs are fractured. Determined to help him, Lisa retains a lawyer, Steven ([[Michael Trucco]]), who has a crush on her. Due to his condition, Sam grows ever more distant from Lisa, ruminating on his and Lisa's inability to have sex and believing that she and Steven are having an affair.  Sensing Sam's growing distance from Lisa, Steven moves in, awkwardly offering as a gift a jewel he found hidden away in an antique desk. The jewel, unknown to Steven, is the Djinn's cell. Lisa inadvertently awakens the Djinn, which secretly kills Steven and takes his form. The Djinn/Steven begins making advances on Lisa to trick her into making wishes.  She first wishes for the case for Sam's condition to be won. The Djinn calls the opposing attorney and forces him to torture himself until he signs a settlement for 10 million dollars. The Djinn next takes Lisa out to a restaurant called The Palace to celebrate the winning of the case, asking her what she wishes for the most. When she says she wishes Sam could walk again, the Djinn grants this wish, enabling Sam to walk, but not repairing the injuries that left him paralyzed. They next go to Steven's place where they share champagne. While getting more for them to drink, the Djinn hears Lisa wish she could love "Steven" for who he really is.   Aware that his true form will lose her forever, he is unable to grant the third wish right away. The Djinn spends much time trying to decipher human love in order to "make" Lisa truly love him, and in the process he develops feelings for her.   One of these attempts is talking with one of her coworkers, who explains he has to grant Lisa's deepest desires, amongst which is ending her three-year-long sex-less life, and accidentally wishes for killer sex, that is extremely pleasurable to her at first, but does kill her. Meanwhile, his fellow Djinn constantly beg him to grant the third wish and let their race inherit the earth. He ignores them to keep learning about love, even visiting a Strip Club, where he meets Sam. Though he tries tricking Sam into making a wish, Steven ends up granting the wishes of a bartender to be a pimple on the rear of one of the strippers, and that of the bouncer, who wished he'd put up more of a fight after being thrown out.  An angel attempts to kill Lisa to prevent the third wish from being granted to her, which would cause the release of all Djinn and an ensuing armageddon. However, Steven arrives and sends her away to safety. The angel and the Djinn fight, with the Djinn eventually winning the battle and killing the angel. Due to his previous planning, Steven has tricked Sam into believing Lisa has now fallen in love with Steven and this forces him to leave. Steven later arrives at Lisa's house with some flowers in an attempt to calm her down from the angel's attack and console her. He gives her a kiss, which leads to them making out and then having sex in the living room.  Once Lisa calms down afterward, she realizes she has missed having sex but does not love Steven. Steven asks Lisa very emphatically if she "truly [loves him] for who [he is]" in an attempt to make her grant the third wish; however she is taken aback and somewhat repulsed by his pushiness. Lisa runs upstairs for new clothes, leaving Steven with his thoughts.  At his wit's end, Steven redresses himself and heads upstairs to her bedroom, where she has finished putting on new clothes. Steven explains he gave Lisa what she wanted, but is angrily rebuffed with "thanks for the charity". The Djinn brethren make their presence known, forcing Lisa to flee. Steven voices rage at his fellow Djinn for jeopardizing the wish, telling them he will take care of it. Using his magic to make the upstairs a looping maze, Steven brings Lisa back to the bedroom and reveals his true form to her, offering Lisa a choice: take his hand as the second in command when the Djinn race takes over the world, or to be cast down to another dimension of hell. At the climax, Sam returns and tries to save the day with an angel's sword (wished for by him), but gets stabbed by the Djinn. While the Djinn is still attempting to convince Lisa to take his hand, Sam signals Lisa to push the Djinn through the blade, which is sticking out of Sam. Lisa does that, and both the Djinn and Sam perish. Lisa makes it out of the house and looks back at it, remembering the happier times that she and Sam shared.

The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] send an undercover agent to recover the weapon, but Anarchy 99's skills easily see through the deception and assassinate him  NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests that they need to send someone who lacks ties to the US government. Gibbons identifies Xander Cage, an extreme sports professional known as "X" but also wanted by the FBI for his acts of protest against a leading senator. Gibbons's team abducts Cage, and puts him through two field tests, stopping a staged diner robbery, and escaping from a Colombian cartel's plantation in the midst of an army raid. Cage passes, and Gibbons offers him the job, promising to wipe his criminal records clean or otherwise sending him to prison. Cage accepts.  Cage is sent to [[Prague]] to meet with the NSA support team, which includes Czech agent Milan Sova. Sova has been tasked to watch Cage and deport him back to America should he fall out of line, quickly riling Cage. During their first task, scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage purposely identifies Sova as a US agent to Anarachy 99's leader, Yorgi, earning him favor with the group. Later, Cage attends a car deal with Yorgi, which Sova attempts to intercede. Cage appears to shoot Sova and kill him, and Yorgi makes Cage a member of Anarchy 99; in reality, Cage was able to use fake blood splatters to fake Sova's death.  Yorgi brings Cage back to a castle that serves as Anarchy 99's headquarters and introduces him to Yelena, his girlfriend. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon that night, catches Yelena also searching for it, and takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter, and explains his true identity. A sniper for Yorgi, watching the pair, contacts Yelena to tell her they already knew of Cage's identity, making her a liability to their group. Cage and Yelena stage a fight to escape, but the NSA suddenly appears to capture Cage, while Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99.  Cage meets with Gibbons who demands he return to America now that his cover is blown, and that special forces are planning to siege the castle to recover the weapon. Cage refuses, fearing for Yelena's life, as well as being bitter that Sova purposely blew his cover. He evades the NSA to sneak into Yorgi's castle to rescue Yelena, but overhears Yorgi's plan to launch "Silent Night" from a water-borne drone named Ahab into several major cities. Cage frees Yelena and they escape to a safehouse, where Yelena explains that she is an [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] agent that started to get close to Yorgi two years before, but her handlers abandoned her. Cage relays Yorgi's plans to the NSA, who prepare a coordinated attack on the castle. Cage snowboards from a helicopter to start an avalanche over a communications outpost used by Anarachy 99 to help the NSA. However, he is recaptured by Yorgi, who already knew of Yelena's true identity. Just as Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces launch their attack. Cage and Yelena free their restraints and Cage kills Yorgi, but not before he launches Ahab, armed with "Silent Night", towards the center of Prague.  Cage contacts Gibbons, who notifies the Czech military to prepare to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, even though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take a [[Pontiac GTO]], heavily modified by Shavers earlier, to race alongside the river to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons the drone and crosses over to it, and is able to disable the weapon moments before it goes off. Cage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises to Cage as well as providing Yelena with American citizenship. Later, Cage and Yelena are relaxing in [[Bora Bora]] when Gibbons contacts Cage to offer him another mission. Cage ignores him.

You Stupid Man
 Reviewer Michael Rankins noted the plot was "while not stupid, the movie does manage to be agonizingly predictable"<ref></ref> and had many similarities to ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', as one reviewer explained, the two characters "decided to follow [the ''When Harry Met Sally''] story line instead of coming up with their own"<ref></ref>   Cast 
YMCA Baseball Team
 The film plays out as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], experienced by a young Korean boy, as he, like his great-great grandfather prepares to play baseball.  The flashback opens with the protagonist of the film, Yi Ho-chang, and his friend in a field. The two are supposed to be studying; however Yi Ho-chang is preoccupied with his soccer ball, which he accidentally kicks into a nearby property. Ho-chang climbs the gate to retrieve his ball, and finds himself within the walls of the American Christian [[missionary]] school. There he discovers a much smaller and harder ball, which he comically mistakes for his shrunken soccer ball. At this point a Christian missionary appears and explains to the confused Ho-chang that he is in fact holding a baseball. Ho-chang quickly flees the premise; however his fascination with the new sport ensures his return for further investigation. Ho-chang, accompanied by several interested Koreans return to the school to join the [[YMCA]] baseball league.  The unlikely group, and their female coach, Min Jung-rim prove to be successful, and quickly become the pride of their town.  Throughout the film Ho-chang falls madly in love with his un-interested female coach, adding to the comic relief. One day while headed to practice the team is confronted by a group of Japanese soldiers, who claim that their practice ground is a new Japanese [[training camp]]. To settle the dispute one of the team members, Oh Dae-hyeon, who went to school in Tokyo with the Japanese Officer, suggests a competitive game of baseball. The game would not only settle the dispute, but it would also be a way for the Koreans to establish themselves against Japan, and for the players to further prove themselves to the skeptics of their town. Meanwhile, a more serious dispute is going on between the Korean diplomats and the revolutionary thinkers, over the signing of the [[Eulsa Treaty]] that officially made Korea a protectorate of Japan. Coincidentally, Oh Dae-hyeon and Min Jong-rim are members of the Anti-Eulsa League, an organization formed in protest of the [[Five Eulsa Traitors]], which one of their teammateâs, Kwang-tae, father belongs to. Due to all of the suppressed tension, the YMCA team loses to the Japanese, also losing their chance to dignify themselves in the face of their suppressors.  Devastated over the loss, the team members decide to abandon baseball and return to more practical roles in society. Ho-chang fulfills his fathers wish and takes over the family school, despite his desires to become a great baseball player. In the end, the team reunites for one final and quite dramatic rematch against the Japanese. The Koreans victory in this rematch symbolizes their unity in baseball, and their ability to come together despite the social and cultural issues facing the changing country.  
Zig Zag (2002 film)

Dean got Louis a dishwasher job in shamelessly abusive, exploitative Mr. Walters' ([[Oliver Platt]]) restaurant. Louis' dead-beat, neglecting yet abusive dad pushes him for "rent" (actually to repay violent loan-shark Cadillac Tom), which Zig Zag gets by &ndash; stealing from Walters' safe, remembering numbers being his only talent. Singer is determined to return the money, despite excessive risks, with surprising allies.  
Yomigaeri
 Set in the city of [[Aso, Kumamoto|Aso]] in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], the film begins with scenes of individuals immediately after they have experienced unexplained and mysterious [[resurrection]]. One man and woman are uncovering long untouched musical instruments in a daze, and in one case a young boy finds himself alone in the forest, having suddenly reappeared after vanishing years earlier.   Eventually a representative from the Japanese Ministry of Welfare named Heita Kawada (Kusanagi) appears. It is his job to investigate this phenomenon, which begins to be seen not in just the two isolated cases, but in various locations around the city. He discovers on his way to his first meeting with the boy that  the child's DNA has been found to match that of a boy who disappeared years earlier (through a match with the umbilical cord saved by the mother), though the child should biologically be now in middle age. This evidence suggests the cases of resurrection occur in such a way that the resurrected person reappears at the same age that he or she supposedly died.  Kawada, with his team of investigators, meets and interviews those who are purported to have reappeared after death, some of whom have been dead many years. The investigators also interview the families of the resurrected, who have aged (some significantly) since the death of the person who has now reappeared.  In the case of the young boy, his mother has grown into an old woman, in other circumstances a youthful wife has reappeared to rejoin a husband now well into middle age.    The movie follows Kawada as he wrestles with the impossibility of the claims, which nevertheless seem to be based on empirically sound evidence. Kawada himself, a native of Aso, also reconnects with his old friend Aoi (Takeuchi), who shares with him a bitter memory of the death of Kawada's friend (and Aoi's lover) Shunsuke ([[Yusuke Iseya]]).
