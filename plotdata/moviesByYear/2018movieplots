As her mother Gayle ([[Jane Kaczmarek]]) and her friends continue to set-up, Katie goes to pick up the cake and stops to pick up her brother Seth ([[Dave Franco]]) and his young daughter Ella along the way. After observing his unopened mail, Katie suspects that Seth has relapsed in his heroin addiction.  Katie drives around town trying to find a detox center after Seth's previous one denies his insurance. Soon after sending Seth to a downtown detox center in a taxi and returning to the party with Ella, Katie receives a call that Seth is unable to be admitted. Katie finds Seth in a sickly state and continues to search for a center throughout the Los Angeles area, missing Jack's arrival to the surprise party. Seth pleads with Katie to buy heroin for him for pain relief. In a homeless area, Katie finds heroin for Seth, which is packaged in six balloons. Katie returns to the car and Seth asks her to go back and buy a needle from a man living under a tarp. Katie says no. So he begs her to go to a pharmacy.   At the drug store, the pharmacist realizes that Seth is a heroin user and gives Katie the key to the bathroom where she changes Ella, asking Seth not to use very much before Seth shoots up. Seth becomes revitalized and the three depart. Before leaving Seth hands Katie the key to the bathroom and laughs about her having to bring it back to the now closed Pharmacy. After Katie gets into an argument with the pharmacist and throws the bathroom key at the pharmacy door setting off the alarm, she runs back to the vehicle and before leaving the pharmacy backs into a light pole.

Back at the party, Katie's parents and Jack realize Seth is under the influence given his giddy behavior. They confront Katie over the night's events and she assumes guilt. Seth leaves Ella in the back yard while he leaves to use, leaving Ella to look for him. After family confronts Katie about Seth using, she finds Seth, who is injecting again in her car, and tells him that she will no longer take care of him, insisting that the only way for him to kick his addiction is for himself to check-in to rehabilitation without her help.  Katie, no longer burdened, steps out of the car into a night sky filled with fireworks.  
12 Strong
 Mitch Nelson ([[Chris Hemsworth|Hemsworth]]), a  [[United States Army|US Army]] Captain with [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595]], is moving into a new home with his wife and daughter on September 11, 2001, after receiving an assignment to staff duty under LTC Bowers ([[Rob Riggle|Riggle]]). As news of the [[September 11 attacks|devastating terrorist attacks that day]] break, Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses, but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer ([[Michael Shannon|Shannon]]), previously scheduled to retire, persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again, as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families, 595 travels to [[Uzbekistan]] on October 7, 2001. After briefing and interviewing Nelson, 5th Special Forces Group Commander, COL Mulholland ([[William Fichtner|Fichtner]]) selects 595 to fight alongside the [[Northern Alliance]] leader, [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] ([[Navid Negahban|Negahban]])  Arriving covertly in Afghanistan aboard an [[MH-47 Chinook]], 595 arrives 30 miles south of [[Mazar-i Sharif]] and meets Dostum.  Six of the 12 members, led by Nelson, leave with Dostum to the mountains, while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed "The Alamo" under Spencer's command. Dostum is attempting to capture Mazar-i Sharif, a critical city in northern Afghanistan, from the Taliban. He also holds a personal vendetta against Taliban leader Mullah Razzan ([[Numan Acar|Acar]]), who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law, and has murdered several people, including Dostum's family. Although the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson's abilities, Nelson gradually earns Dostum's respect. In one battle, however, Dostum makes a tactical error, costing several casualties. Nelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information, while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson, and the U.S., is not willing to pay the potential price of the conflict, and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to "be a warrior" instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile, and, after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller ([[Michael Peña|Peña]]) to strike a Taliban supply route, and being joined by Spencer's half of ODA 595, continue to work together. They win several victories with Dostum's leadership and manpower and American airpower, making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. Suddenly, however, Spencer informs Nelson that another ODA, 555, has been dispatched to support [[Atta Muhammad Nur|Atta Muhammad]], another Northern Alliance leader, who is Dostum's political rival. When Nelson is forced to tell Dostum, the furious warlord and his men promptly abandon 595.  Following Dostum's departure, Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles, ODA 595, rejoined by Diller and his element, uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor, but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber, and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces. Together, the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is [[Medical evacuation|medevaced]], Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations, Dostum and Muhammad meet peacefully and put aside their differences. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans' efforts, Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter. Spencer ultimately survives, and ODA 595 returns home after spending 23 days in Afghanistan.

Once, while sent to the principal's office, they meet another student, who often misbehaves in school, [[Anthony Sadler]], and the three become friends. Spencer and Alek are from single mother homes, and their mothers often stick up for them when called to the principal's office regarding their misconduct.  While working part time at a smoothie shop, Spencer waits on a recruiter for the United States Marine Corps. He asks the recruiter what military branch he would select if he could go back. The recruiter replies that the [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force pararescue]] save lives and "seem to being doing fine work in the field." Spencer is intrigued and decides  that he wants to join up. So he begins working out to lose some extra weight. After several months of rigorous training and exercise, he gets into much better shape and enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.  Upon completing basic training, Spencer takes his exams to qualify for pararescue school. But having poor depth perception, he is turned down. Upset, he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him, and is soon stationed abroad. His friend, Alek, enlisted in the Army, and has been deployed to Afghanistan. On Skype, Alek tells him that he is planning to visit his girlfriend in Germany, and the two decide to rendezvous there for their next leave. Spencer skypes Anthony, now a college student, and talks him into coming to Europe for a vacation. After meeting in Germany, the three decide to go to Amsterdam. After a few days, they finally decide that it's time to visit France. They depart from [[Amsterdam Centraal station]] on the 15:17 train to Paris.  On the train, all seems well, until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When Moogalian goes to investigate, a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger, Damien A., grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the assault rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol.  Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train, trying to escape. Using a pistol, the terrorist shoots the passenger who took his rifle. Eventually, the terrorist approaches the next car, where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him, he springs into action. He decides that his only hope, and the only hope of the remaining passengers, is for him to try to defeat the terrorist. Spencer makes a desperate all-out sprint toward the terrorist in the hope of subduing him before being shot. By remarkable luck, the terrorist's weapon jams just as he is about to fire, and he is tackled by Spencer, who successfully disarms the terrorist of his weapon. Seeing Spencer's progress in subduing the terrorist, Alek, Anthony, and other passengers join the effort to try to further overwhelm the terrorist, finally knocking him out. Spencer Stone then stanches the bleeding by plugging the exit wound in Moogalian's neck with his fingers. The police at the next station enter the train fully armed, discovering that Spencer has subdued the terrorist, and they begin to treat his wounds, and the more serious ones of the shot passenger.  Paramedics take Moogalian to the emergency room at a local hospital and he survives.  In a formal ceremony, Spencer, Alek and Anthony are recognized as heroes of the French Republic for their gallantry and bravery. The terrorist was later discovered to have been armed with over 300 rounds of ammunition with the apparent aim of using all of it to wreak havoc on all those who boarded the train. The odds of the particular misfire and jam of the cartridge in the terrorist's weapon was estimated on the scene as being over a thousand-to-one, and highly unlikely to have been in Spencer's favor. French officials at the ceremony to honor Spencer's selfless act acknowledge his bravery and he is awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]] in recognition of his act of courage. On September 22, 2015, Mark Moogalian was awarded the Legion of Honor by President [[François Hollande]] for his actions on the train.

He is not too much supported by his dad Mohan Varma ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) and his boss, both of whom, wants him to follow his dad's footsteps and start working for livelihood. His mother, Rosy ([[Lena (actress)|Lena]]) though, is the exact opposite and is clearly supportive of his tenure as a music-director aspirant. He is seen trying hard to get a breakthrough.   In the shade of pursuing him to follow his dad's footsteps, his dad's boss urges Aadhi to take his car to Bangalore where he plans on attending a meeting and has a week's commute. Aadhi, having heard of a cine-workers pub, through his friend Nadhir ([[Krishna Shankar]]), and his potential opportunity of getting the people there to catch an attention on him, decides to take the car there. So he has an opportunity to stay there and perform and can help his dad's boss get his car.   Aadhi gets a shot at performing in the bar and meets a colleague of his, Anjana ([[Aditi Ravi]]) at the pub. She is accompanied by her boss's son and nephew, both of whom does not take her acquaintance with Aadhi lightly. Aadhi performs and is instantly seen as a superhit and moves all the gathering to his tones. When Anjana extensively involves with the song, her colleagues start making a fuss and Aadhi is forced to leave. He goes to the roof and hangs out himself. Anjana on the behest of apology,  goes to him, only for others to intervene and create a commotion, in which Jayakrishnan ([[Siju Wilson]]) accidentally kicks his colleague of the roof to his death. Jayakrishnan frames Aadhi for the death, and Narayan Reddy ([[Jagapati Babu]]), the owner of Pinnacle Group and a greatly influential person in the whole of Bangalore city,  seeks to take revenge on Aadhi. He uses his influence to make this an accidental death and starts an underground hunt for Aadhi, using a pic of him taken through the security cam in the pub.   Reddy gets hold of the car that Aadhi brought to the pub, his dad's boss's one, and through the security cam footages that he stays somewhere in the Bangalore-Mysore road. He sends his goons to catch Aadhi, while unbeknownst to all of it, is in the streets. But using his free running skills, he evades the goons only to end up with Sharath ([[Sharafudheen]]). Sharath takes him home and tells him about the bounty Reddy has placed on him. Sharath also tells him that he will help him as Reddy has caused ill fates to his family, and is the sole reason why his family is this way. Sharath agrees to help him and his sister Jaya ([[Anusree]]) to approves of that. Sharath takes help from his friend Mani Annan ([[Meghanathan]]) and decides to plot an escape plan, all to go waste. Aadhi meets up with his dad at Sharath's home and decides to go abroad. He takes refuge in an abandoned factory until his escape plan is done.   In the meantime, Reddy urges the cops to have a lookout for Aadhi and all the transport routes are inspected for Aadhi's suspected departure. Aadhi having lost his phone, keeps on his communication with his parents through Sharath and this intrigues Reddy, who decides to go for call tracing on that. Suspecting of his activities being disclosed, Jayakrishnan readily takes over the responsibility of monitoring the calls. He overhears the call and confirms Aadhi's location and goes with some goons to get done with Aadhi. Aadhi somehow escapes from them and interprets that Jayakrishnan has been tapping his phone calls. Jayakrishnan, having learned of Sharath's role in Aadhi's hideout, captures him and murders him before Sharath discloses Jayakrishnan's role in the death of Reddy's son. This creates a stir and Aadhi is forced to leave the hideout.  Aadhi plots a new plan to disclose things to Reddy, as the situation brings him to the conclusion that Jayakrishnan devised the whole plan to save face, owing to the fact that Reddy might kill him if he is found guilty. Aadhi takes help from Mani Annan and a former employee of the Pinnacle Group, Ebin ([[Tony Luke]]) to disclose Reddy on all the happenings at his office in Bangalore. As per Ebin's request, he gets hold of gadgets to gain access to the security cam footage of the building and thereby get to Reddy's office. He also uses Anjana to device a plan so that Jayakrishnan stays out of the office and passes information that he is going to meet Reddy at an event outside his office late one day. Jayakrishnan leaves the office soon. Aadhi gets inside the office through the service exit, and Anjana through the front door, which alerts Jayakrishnan who returns soon after.  Meanwhile, both reach Reddy's office, only for Reddy to attack Aadhi, who later convinces Reddy of Jayakrishnan's part in the ploy. Jayakrishnan soon comes and shoots Reddy, and leaves him for dead, and along with Siddharth aka Siddhu ([[Sijoy Varghese]]) discloses them as partners intending on killing Reddy and take his wealth. Siddhu never intended on sharing and turns on Jayakrishnan and kills him and moves to kill Aadhi and Anjana as well. Aadhi makes a quick run for it and reaches the 10th floor of the building. He is taken out by the guards before he could rappel out. He is taken down by the guards and Siddhu gets down to kill him. Before Siddhu could shoot him, it is revealed that the 10th-floor exit was an escape plan and Aadhi performs a [[Dülfersitz]] just before Ebin turns the fire alarm on, to shower gasoline on them. Aadhi throws a lighter and escapes out in the ensuing explosion. Reddy recovers and it is revealed that Aadhi is set free and Jayakrishnan and Siddhu was killed because of the explosion on the 10th floor.

The music of [[Nina Simone]] is played throughout key moments experienced by the couple. The film is divided into categories based in the emotional spectrum that Melinda experiences, as her character becomes a [[Stage 5 Clinger]]. The categories are as follows: ===Acrimony=== Melinda meets her dream guy, Robert Gayle, a mechanical engineering student, on their college campus, when they collide on a rainy day. Later, Robert finds her dorm to return some pages of her paper, in exchange for some missing pages of his. Initially, Melinda is annoyed, but he offers to help her with a class he succeeded in. Melinda finds out that her mother died, and Robert comforts her as she is grieving.  At Robert's house, an RV, he introduces her to the music of [[Nina Simone]] and takes her virginity. As Melinda recalls the details of their relationship to her therapist in court mandated counseling, her view of their life together is tarnished, in her belief that he took advantage of her. Melinda’s sisters, June and Brenda, are leery of Robert, and his intention toward her inheritance. Robert is trying to get Prescott, a [[venture capitalist]], to finance his invention, and he talks her into buying him a car. Melinda catches Robert cheating on her with Diana Wells. Enraged, she rams the RV with her car several times.  With her adrenaline rush, she felt no pain from the impact, but she collapses, and is taken to the hospital for an emergency full hysterectomy. While Melinda is recovering, Robert comes to see her, and they reconcile despite her sisters' objections. They get married without her sisters in attendance, because they think it is a huge mistake.  Years later, Melinda works to support them, as Robert is unable to find work because he is a felon and spent two years in prison. Robert talks Melinda into mortgaging the house so he can build a new prototype of the battery. Twenty years go by and Diana reappears, now working as an Assistant to Prescott and arranges for Robert to have a meeting with him. Elsewhere, June and Brenda tell Melinda that Robert is cheating on her after finding Diana’s wallet in his truck. Prescott offers Robert $800,000 to sell his work, but he wants to license the technology to them instead. Prescott is not willing to budge, and Robert declines the offer. Back at the house, Melinda is seething with anger at the whole situation and wants a divorce.  Melinda loses the house and moves in with Brenda, and begins to date her ex-boyfriend, Devon. After their divorce, Robert tells Diana he is living in a shelter, and she insists on bringing him to stay with her.  ===Sunder=== Prescott reconsiders and offers Robert a multimillion-dollar deal, while allowing him to keep [[intellectual property|intellectual ownership]] of the battery technology, which he accepts. Melinda is annoyed when Robert shows up to her job, wearing a suit and bringing her flowers, saying they will never get back together. He thanks her for her love and support and, to show his gratitude, Robert gives Melinda $10 million dollars and buys her home back.  ===Bewail=== Melinda is sorry that she listened to her family and tells them all off. She goes to Robert’s new penthouse apartment and attempts to seduce him, but Diana comes in and introduces herself as Robert’s fiancé.  ===Deranged=== Angry and hurt, Melinda becomes obsessed with the couple and continues a campaign of revenge, and mutilates photos she has of them. A lack of eating or sleeping further pushes her closer to the edge. Melinda sues Robert and Diana, claiming that the deal with Prescott happened before their divorce, and the case is dismissed.

On Robert's wedding day, her family and friend guard the exits of her house and use their cars to block Melinda’s in so she cannot go after them.  ===Inexorable=== On their honeymoon cruise, Melinda appears; disguised as his bride and shoots Robert in his belly whilst in dialogue with him. She makes the crew of the boat jump [[man overboard |overboard]]. Diana shows up after hearing gunshots, Melinda is about to shoot Diana, but Robert knocks her overboard.

Pratap flatly refuses and rebuffs the offer. This angers Gurinder, who in turn threatens to expose the DSD's existence to the general public. This makes Jai suspect a major scam involving the Indian Army. After 2 months of continuous surveillance, he goes rogue along with his girlfriend Sonia, a cyber-expert ([[Rakul Preet Singh]]), and escapes to [[London]]. Capt. Maya ([[Pooja Chopra]]) informs Colonel Abhay Singh ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]), their team leader and Jai's mentor, about Jai's going rogue and his stealing of highly sensitive data from the DSD Office. Abhay activates his intelligence network and launches a manhunt for Jai, eventually learning about Jai's escape along with Sonia. He raids Jai's house but  finds nothing. All this while, a special investigating Army Officer Brig. K Srinivas, spies on Abhay's movements and keeps reporting them to Gurinder. Abhay however outsmarts Srinivas and successfully manages to escape, and the DSD shift their office to an undisclosed location. Seeing his plan of capturing Abhay fail, Gurinder contacts an influential journalist and provides her with sensitive information, exposing Army's secrets.  While all this is going on, Gen. Malik personally meets Abhay and informs about the termination of DSD, Foreign involvement in Indian Defence Deals and Lt.Gen Gurinder Singh's involvement with a powerful London based Arms dealer Mukesh Kapoor ([[Adil Hussain]]), who's the major culprit behind all this fiasco. Abhay promises to expose the perpetrators to protect the integrity of Indian Army. After the meeting, with Srinivas still tracking him, Abhay heads to the DSD office, where he informs his team that they have been disavowed, with Government denying their existence. Abhay and Maya alert all their sources and order them to keep a low profile, so as to avoid detection. Abhay flies off to London, in pursuit of Jai, while DSD members stay back in India.  In London, Jai calls and threatens Gurinder in renegotiating a deal, revealing that he has bugged Gurinder's house. A frightened Gurinder reluctantly agrees and transfers the money to Jai's account.

A desperate Abhay meets Mukesh Kapoor and informs him about Jai possessing sensitive incriminating data harmful for his business and thus asks him to eliminate Jai, apart from revealing the capture of Gurinder by DSD. However, Abhay informs Sonia about the threat to Jai's life and orders her to lure him to an undisclosed location. Jai's fixed meeting with a few MI-6 officers ends up in a shootout killing two agents. A wounded Jai makes it to the place where Abhay and Sonia are waiting for him. Abhay severely beats Jai and derides him as a traitor. Jai however justifies his actions and calls the older generation responsible for the massive corruption in India. He further questions the legacy that the older generation plans to leave for the youth, thus forcing Abhay to agree with him.  Feeling cheated, Mukesh takes Tariq Bhai hostage and plans to execute him, but stops when Jai informs him that he will surrender all the sensitive information regarding Mukesh Kapoor's deals and requests for a personal meeting. Mukesh, realizing that Abhay still has Gurinder Singh, reluctantly agrees.

He further tells that the only eyewitness to the entire scam, a watchman named Baburao Shastri ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) is being hidden by Jai in a small hotel in Paharganj, Delhi. Abhay meets Baburao, records his confessions and gives them to the same influential journalist who earlier had met Gurinder Singh. She decides to run Abhay's story, thus deciding to expose the Army's housing scam.  Meanwhile, Brig. Srinivas finally captures all the DSD members and frees Gurinder, but in turn the DSD is absolved of all the crimes and Army's Housing scam gets exposed. Gurinder Singh, overcome with shame and guilt, shoots himself dead.

With Abhi's consent, he marries Indrani, who is now a mother to Mohan Bhargav.  Abhi takes over the company, proclaiming he is Vindha's son. He tortures Sharma, Varma, and Koteswara Rao ([[Raghu Babu]]), who had a habit of harassing women in the workplace. When this news reaches Seetharam, he comes back to India and asks for evidence to prove that Abhi is Vindha's son. Abhi goes to Bulgaria with Suryakantham and Sukumari to recover Vindha's will which stated that his wealth must go to Abhi. However, that will is stolen by Seetharam with Appaji's help, and by threatening Sukumari and Suryakantham that he would kill Varma and Sharma. Seetharam destroys the will by burning, thus eradicating the evidence that Abhi is Vindha's son. However, when electing the future CEO for the company, Abhi fights Seetharam's goons on the roof of the building, after revealing that the will given to Seetharam was a fake one and that Appaji was part of Abhi's plan. After killing most of Seetharam's goons, one of the board members ([[Jayaprakash]]) of the company reveals to Abhi that he is Aditya's brother, and that he was part of Vindha's murder since he wanted to avenge his brother's death. After confronting Abhi, the board member is attacked by Seetharam's henchman Parag ([[Parag Tyagi]]), and they both slip off the rooftop. While Parag falls, Aditya's brother hangs by the logo of the company. After fighting Seetharam and telling him why he does not deserve the position of CEO, Abhi tells Aditya's brother that this company was a tribute to his friend, and the name of the company "AB group" was not named after him, but after Aditya. After that, the board member falls to his death. Abhi goes back into the company, takes the position of CEO, and promises Indrani that he will fulfill his father's duties.

American Animals
 The storytelling frequently jumps between interviews with the real people portrayed in the movie and the events themselves performed by actors.  In 2003 in Lexington, Kentucky, Spencer Reinhard (Barry Keoghan) is an art student who feels his life has no meaning, that he needs something exciting, even if tragic, to happen in his life to inspire greater artistry. Warren Lipka (Evan Peters) is a rebellious student on an athletic scholarship, though he does not care much for sports and is only pursuing the education to please his family.  After Spencer is given a tour of Transylvania University's library's rare book collection, the two friends begin to plan to steal an extremely valuable edition of John James Audubon's ''[[The Birds of America]]'' and other rare books. Warren travels to Amsterdam to meet some black market buyers who express interest in buying the books. Upon returning to the US, he informs Spencer that they could make tens of millions of dollars, much to their excitement.  Realizing that pulling off the heist will require more people, they enlist the help of childhood friends Erik Borsuk (Jared Abrahamson), who helps provide the logistics of the operation, and Chas Allen (Blake Jenner), who will be the getaway driver. They all take time to prepare, learning that the only person guarding the books is the special collections librarian, Betty Jean Gooch (Ann Dowd).  On the day of the robbery, they disguise themselves as elderly businessmen, and enter the library. After noticing that there are too many people in the special collections library, they quickly abort the heist and retreat. Three of the conspirators want to end the attempt altogether, but Warren calls the library asking for a private appointment the next day.  They decide to drop the elaborate old-age disguises. While Spencer acts as a lookout outside the building, Warren and Eric enter the library dressed as young businessmen. Warren clumsily tases the special collections librarian and makes Eric help tie her up and gag her. They take the rare books and blunder to an exit. In a panic, they drop and have to leave behind the biggest prizes, two enormous Audubon books comprising "The Birds of America." All four manage to escape with the rest of the rare books.  They take the books to Christie's auction house in New York to get the authentication of value that Warren had said the Dutch buyers required. Spencer is told he has to come back sometime the next day and leaves his cell phone number with an auction assistant. In the van outside, Chas berates everyone for their stupidity and they return to Lexington with the books. Shortly after, Spencer realizes that the police will be able to trace them from emails they used in setting up the heist as well as his cell phone number.  The thieves show signs of great stress as they try to lie low: Warren attempts to shoplift from a convenience store; Spencer gets into a car accident; and Eric starts a bar fight. Inevitably, the FBI raid all four of their homes and arrest them. Movie titles show they each serve over 7 years in federal prison.  After prison, the real-life robbers express their regret for attempting the heist, noting how much pain they have put their families through. It is also revealed that Warren may have lied about going to Amsterdam, fabricating the story to get the others to agree to the heist. However, this is not confirmed.  An epilogue describes their lives after prison. Eric lives in Los Angeles as a writer, and Chas has become a fitness coach in Southern California. Warren has re-enrolled in college and studies filmmaking in Philadelphia. Spencer still lives in Lexington making a living as an artist, specializing in birds. Betty Jean Gooch, the librarian, still works at Transylvania University as a special collections librarian.

Annihilation (film)
  At "Area X", a government facility on the southern coast of the US, Lena, a [[Cellular Biology|cellular-biology]] professor and former soldier, is in quarantine. She undergoes a debriefing about an expedition into an anomalous shimmering electromagnetic field called "The Shimmer" from which she and her husband Kane are the only survivors.   In flashback, Lena's husband, an [[Army Special Forces]] soldier, appears in their home after having gone missing on a mission nearly a year ago. He remembers nothing of that time and suddenly becomes very ill. A government security force intercepts Kane's ambulance and transports him and Lena to Area X, near where the Shimmer had begun to spread three years earlier. A psychologist, Dr. Ventress, explains that military teams, including Kane's, have ventured into the Shimmer to attempt to reach the lighthouse where the phenomenon first appeared. Kane is the only person to have ever returned from an expedition. Lena volunteers to join Ventress on a research expedition consisting of two scientists, Josie and Cassie, and a paramedic, Anya.  Guidance technology fails, the expedition members realize they are unable to remember extended stretches of time, and a [[mutation|mutated]] alligator attacks Josie. The team rescues her and learns that the alligator shows signs of being [[hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] with a shark. At an abandoned military base, the team discovers evidence of Kane's expedition along with a [[memory card]] left for them. A video on it shows Kane cutting open the stomach of a fellow expedition member while he was still alive, revealing that his intestines have begun to wriggle in a worm-like manner. That night, the base's perimeter fence is torn open, prompting everyone to investigate. Suddenly, a mutated bear drags Cassie away; the following morning, the team finds one of her boots. Lena searches further, alone, and she discovers Cassie's mutilated corpse. Lena returns to the team and reports that Cassie has died.  As the team continues toward the lighthouse at the center of the Shimmer, they find a decayed settlement with human-shaped plants outside it. Josie says she thinks the Shimmer is acting on organisms in the manner of a [[prism]], distorting and [[Refraction|refracting]] DNA in the same way that a prism refracts light. The expedition members realize they are slowly changing as well. That night, Anya descends into a psychotic state, attacking and restraining the other team members. As she is threatening them, Anya hears what sounds like Cassie crying for help outside and investigates. The bear that killed Cassie enters the house, its roar partially sounding like Cassie's dying screams. It kills Anya and attacks Lena before Josie can shoot it dead.  Ventress leaves Lena and Josie to complete the journey while she still can. Josie, now growing flowers on her body, walks away from Lena and disappears among the human-shaped plants. Lena reaches the lighthouse and goes inside, finding an incinerated corpse, a video-camera and a hole in the floor. Footage on the camera shows Kane ranting about the Shimmer's effects on him. He urges the cameraman to find Lena, then commits suicide with a [[white phosphorus|white-phosphorus]] [[grenade]], after which a [[doppelgänger]] of his walks into view.  Lena descends into the hole in the floor and finds Ventress, who has also begun to mutate. Ventress tells Lena the forces at work will eventually encompass "everything", before disintegrating into a fiery [[Mandelbulb|nebulous structure]] that absorbs a drop of blood from Lena's face and creates a [[humanoid]] being. Lena attacks it, and attempts to escape the lighthouse but the being stops her, mirroring her movements as it gradually transforms into an identical copy of her. Lena exploits its behavior to place a phosphorus grenade in its hands, and activates it before fleeing. The creature is set ablaze, flames engulf the lighthouse, the various constructs in the area collapse, and the Shimmer dissipates to nothing.  Lena's debriefing concludes, and she reunites with Kane, who has recovered rapidly with the Shimmer having ceased to exist. She asks him if he is the "real" Kane, to which he replies, "I don't think so." He asks her if she is Lena, but she does not answer him. The two embrace, and their [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] shimmer and change color.

Hope kidnaps Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]]. Seeing the message as confirmation that Janet is alive, Pym and Hope work to create a stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve Janet. Hope arranges to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer [[Sonny Burch]], but Burch has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym and Hope's research and double-crosses them. Hope fights Burch and his men off, until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this "[[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|ghost]]", but she escapes with Pym's portable lab.  Pym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] who helps them locate the lab. The ghost restrains Lang, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Elihas]], another former partner of Pym's, accidentally killed himself and his wife during a quantum experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that he has been helping Ava, who they plan to cure using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and the trio manage to escape.  Opening a stable version of the tunnel this time, Pym and Hope are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her, but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Burch learns their location from Lang's business partners [[Luis (Marvel Comics)|Luis]], Dave, and Kurt, and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see him breaking his house arrest. This leaves Pym and Hope to be arrested, and for their lab to be taken by Ava.  Lang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but the pair end up fighting Burch and his men, which allows Ava to begin taking Janet's energy. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help apprehend Burch, so Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet arrive safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.  Lang returns home once again, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to continue helping Ava. While Lang is doing this in the quantum realm, Pym, Hope, and Janet all disintegrate.

Helpless, she calls Ronny, her former college boyfriend, now an [[Indian Army]] special forces soldier. The film flashes back four years, where Ronny and Neha meet in college and fell in love. After proposing to Neha, Ronny promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble.  Back to the present, Ronny finds Neha frightened and lost. On asking her about her family, she reveals that her 3-year-old daughter Rhea has been missing since dropping her at school, where she was assaulted outside the gates and her daughter was taken. When Ronny asks her about Shekhar, her husband, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronny to help her find Rhea.

On one night, however, Sean finds more than he bargained when he breaks into the house of wealthy patron Cale Erendreich and discovers a woman named Katie being held captive. Unable to free Katie, Sean abandons her, but notifies the police of his discovery. When the police, however, are unable to find any evidence of Katie's abduction, Sean contacts the FBI and files a missing persons report for her.  Cale, meanwhile, brings Katie to a secluded cabin and becomes aware of Sean's knowledge of her abduction. Motivated by a desire to break people down, Cale begins working to destroy Sean's life, including having Sean, Derek, and Sean's parents fired from their jobs. He also savagely beats Riley Seabrook, Sean's girlfriend, after hacking into his Facebook and camera to ruin their relationship by leaking a topless photo of her. Cale then murders Derek and his family in their home and stages their deaths as a murder-suicide, although Sean is able to get a picture of Cale, which he sends to the FBI.  Using the GPS in Cale's car, Sean is able to find the cabin where Katie is being held captive and heads off to save her after surviving Cale's attempt to kill him with a bomb. A team of FBI agents, deducing that Cale is responsible for a series of disappearances, and that the cabin property is in the name of a wealthy family and adjacent to federal land, decide to travel to the cabin with their new-found knowledge, but are unable to enter the private property without a warrant. Sean finds Katie, only to be knocked out by Cale, who monologues that he intends to kill Katie and dissolve her body in lye, frame Sean for her murder and the deaths of his previous victims, as well as revealing the name Cale Erendreich is merely an alias and that he plans to use his trust-fund money to accomplish his scheme. While Katie is in the lye pit, she knocks down some dirt on the walls revealing that there are dozens of bodies buried in the same pit. He fires his gun at Katie, but Katie survives, climbs out of the pit, and frees Sean, with Cale in pursuit.  Chasing Sean and Katie through the woods, Cale encounters Sean and they fight, with Sean gaining the upper hand and beating Cale until he's knocked unconscious. The sound of Cale's gun is also heard by the FBI team, who are able to use the gunshot's noise as probable cause to enter the property. After finding Sean and Katie, the team enters the cabin, where they discover Cale chained up like his victims, implying that Cale will be arrested and taken to jail.

Batman Ninja
 While battling [[Gorilla Grodd]] at [[Arkham Asylum]], Batman is caught in Grodd's Quake Engine time displacement machine and sent to [[Edo period|Feudal Japan]]. There, he is chased by samurai working for the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. During his escape, Batman meets up with [[Catwoman]], who reveals everyone else arrived two years earlier (due to Batman being in the outermost area affected by the Quake Engine). He learns from her that all of [[Gotham City]]'s top criminals have become feudal lords after deceiving the [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] [[daimyō]], battling each other until only one state remains. In order to stop the villains from changing history, Batman and Catwoman must get to the Quake Engine in Arkham Castle (formerly the asylum). Batman discovers that [[Alfred Pennyworth]] is also in the past and has built a [[Batcave]] outside Edo.  When the Joker's troops ambush the hideout, Batman storms his way in his [[Batmobile]] towards Arkham Castle, which transforms into a giant robot fortress. Just as Batman confronts the Joker, he is forced to leave and save a mother and child below from being crushed by the robot's hand. He transforms his [[Batcycle]] into an armored suit to defeat a [[sumo]] [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] and stop the robot hand, only for the mother to reveal herself as [[Harley Quinn]] and knock him down. As Batman is surrounded by the Joker's minions, he is suddenly whisked away by ninjas led by Eian of the Bat Clan of Hida. He learns that the Bat Clan helped [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]], [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] upon their arrival, and that the clan had followed a prophecy of a foreign bat ninja restoring order to the land. Robin gives Batman an invitation from Grodd to a nearby hot spring. There, Grodd explains that he intended to send the villains far away so he could take Gotham for himself, but Batman's interference sent them all to Feudal Japan instead. Batman and Grodd agree to work together to return to Gotham.  Batman, Grodd, Catwoman, the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Bat Family]], and the Bat Clan battle the Joker and his forces by the river. They defeat the Joker and Harley, but Grodd turns on Batman, revealing his alliance with [[Two-Face]] before the Joker and Harley escape and blow up their own ship, taking Batman down with it. Having captured a power converter from Harley, Catwoman attempts to bargain with Grodd in bringing her back to Gotham; however, they need to obtain other power converters from [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Deathstroke]] to complete the Quake Engine.  Two days later, Batman recovers from his wounds and encourages the Bat Family to learn the ways of the ninja in order to defeat Grodd. Red Hood locates the Joker and Harley, but Batman discovers that they lost their memories from the explosion and are living their lives as farmers. A month later, the Gotham villains mobilize their castle robots for battle at Jigokukohara, the field of Hell. Batman leads the Bat Family and the Bat Clan into the battlefield. After defeating the other villains, Grodd puts them under his mind control, with the intent of ruling the country himself. The Joker and Harley, however, crash his party from above, reclaiming their castle from Grodd. The Bat Family saves Catwoman and Grodd before the Joker merges all of the castles into the super robot Lord Joker. An injured Grodd gives Batman control of his army of monkeys; Robin enables them to merge into one giant samurai monkey to battle the Joker's robot. The samurai monkey then combines with a swarm of bats to form the Batgod to defeat Lord Joker before the Bat Family storm into the castle to battle the villains. The Joker reveals to Batman that as farmers, he and Harley planted special flowers that triggered their memories back once they bloomed. As the castle falls, Batman and the Joker engage in a sword fight. Using his [[ninjutsu]] skills, Batman defeats the Joker.  With the Joker and the Gotham villains defeated, Feudal Japan is restored to its original state and the Bat Family take the villains back to the present day. In a mid-credits sequence, Catwoman sells weapons and furniture from the castle robots to an antique shop while Bruce rides a horse-driven Batmobile to a party hosted by the mayor.

Beirut (film)
 In 1972, Mason Skiles is a U.S. diplomat in [[Lebanon]] and lives in [[Beirut]] with his Lebanese wife, Nadia, and has recently begun caring for Karim, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who claims he is without a family. While hosting a party, Skiles is confronted by his friend, CIA officer Cal Riley, who wishes to question Karim, whose brother has been linked to the 1972 [[Munich massacre]]. The party is attacked by Karim's brother, Rami, who abducts Karim; in the ensuing gunfight, Nadia is killed.  Ten years later, Skiles has become an alcoholic and is working as a self-employed labor arbitrator in New England. While arbitrating a labor issue between particularly intransigent parties and struggling to keep his small firm afloat, he is approached by Sully, an old client, on behalf of the U.S. government.  Sully tells Skiles that he has been requested for an academic lecture in Lebanon, and hands him money, a plane ticket, and a passport. Skiles is initially resistant, but decides to travel to Beirut. He meets several State Department officials, Donald Gaines, Gary Ruzak, and Frank Shalen, along with CIA officer Sandy Crowder and learns that Cal Riley was recently abducted in Lebanon, and his kidnappers requested Skiles to negotiate his release.  The group meets with the kidnappers, where they learn that Karim is leading the organization.  Karim demands the release of his brother in exchange for Riley, despite the Americans' protest that they do not have Rami in captivity.  Skiles suspects that Israel is holding Rami, and travels with Ruzak to secure his release for the exchange. The Israelis reveal that they do not have Rami, and Skiles returns to Beirut to meet with Alice, Riley's wife. Alice holds Skiles responsible for Riley's abduction, as she believes that he has remained in Lebanon over the guilt he feels for Nadia's death.  The next day, Skiles is giving the lecture that was his official reason to travel to Beirut when a car bomb is set off outside the building. In the ensuing chaos, Skiles is instructed to leave to meet Karim. Karim brings him to Riley, who covertly tells Skiles that the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) is holding Rami, and that Gaines is not to be trusted. Before releasing Skiles, Karim gives him an ultimatum for later the same night to return Rami, or he will sell Riley to Iran.  Skiles returns to Riley's apartment to search for clues, where he encounters Crowder. She reveals that Gaines had been stealing money from the embassy, and that Riley had been preparing to make a report shortly before his disappearance. Skiles convinces Crowder that the PLO is holding Rami, and she steals $4 million from the CIA office to trade for Rami.    After Skiles attacks a PLO officer, he sets up a trade for Rami and brings him to the exchange with Karim. After trading Riley for Rami, Rami is shot and killed by a [[Mossad]] sniper in a nearby building; the Americans successfully escape. Before departing Beirut, he learns that Gaines has unexpectedly retired, and Ruzak has left Beirut. Crowder announces her intention to apply for the newly-vacant jobs, and Skiles offers his services as a negotiator.

Bruce rushes out to save Leslie from Jack but is too late as Jack has already murdered her. At the crime scene, Bruce finds a bloody Dionysus Club pin, meaning Jack has to be one of Gotham's wealthy. At Sister Leslie's funeral, Bruce is met by [[Hugo Strange]], claiming he knows the killer and wants to meet with Batman.

Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.  While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him.

This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.  Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.  T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps [[Bucky Barnes]] with his recuperation.

The parents arrive, with Mitch storming into many rooms searching for Kayla. He eventually finds her making out with Connor, who he proceeds to throw through a table. Kayla is initially furious, but ultimately appeased by her father's good intentions, and reveals that she does not need protecting, as he already taught her everything about protecting herself. Sam and Hunter share a tender moment, where he reveals that a good night was the best he could give her in return for his neglect. After, Sam officially comes out to her father, who is deeply moved at being the first person she told. Sam indulges Hunter in his much-sought prom night photo, but he declares that he will remember the moment without one. Lisa sneaks into Julie and Austin's room and is moved by how much the two clearly love each other. She sneaks out of the hotel room unnoticed, and leaves the two of them alone while they have sex.   Lisa promises to keep in touch with Mitchell more, whose friendship she had been spurning, because he represents her daughter's youth. The two of them also make Hunter welcome, acknowledging his emotional pain of being ostracized.

 After her father Isaac's murder, Shaun Russell travels to the house she grew up in with her two children, daughter Jasmine and son Glover. Shaun intends to settle her father's estate and sell the remotely-located house, which has multiple security features, including a hand-held remote monitor. The security system is off-line at their arrival, but is soon reactivated by Glover.  Unknown to the family, four criminals – Peter, Sam, Duncan, and their leader Eddie – are already in the house. Jasmine and Glover are taken hostage while Shaun is outside. Peter chases Shaun into the woods, where she manages to knock him unconscious. She leaves him bound and gagged, and uses the intercom to call the house. Eddie tells her they only came for the safe and the $4 million they believe is inside; Isaac was under investigation and Sam had learned that he liquidated his assets. The crew has only 90 minutes from when they cut the phone line before the security company will contact police, so they want to find it and leave quickly.  Concealed in the trees, Shaun sees Maggie, the realtor, arrive with paperwork for the house sale. Eddie greets her at the door, explaining Shaun had gone into town briefly, and invites her in. Maggie notices Shaun's purse on the table behind Eddie and declines. As Maggie is leaving, Duncan attacks and slits her throat, which upsets Eddie, as it means Shaun won't be as controllable.   Shaun eventually finds her way into the house, and gives instructions to Jasmine. When Eddie and Duncan next threaten the children, Jasmine leads them to the safe, which Shaun believes only Peter knows how to open. Shaun returns with Peter, a knife at his throat, demanding her family's release. Eddie shoots Peter dead, and Shaun flees back to the woods. Peter had a flash drive containing computer code on a necklace, which is all they needed to unlock the safe. With the money in a bag, Eddie now intends to burn the house with the children in it to cover their escape, which Sam is uncomfortable with.  Duncan and Sam find Shaun on the roof during another rescue attempt. She jumps, pushing Sam off to his death, saving herself with the rope she had tied to the roof. Meanwhile Jasmine frees herself and Glover, having cut through their bonds with a shard of glass from a broken lamp. The children escape the house and join their mother with Eddie in pursuit, but they have Sam's truck keys. Shaun runs over Duncan as they try to drive away, but Eddie shoots at the truck and causes it to crash.  Shaun and the kids lock themselves in the house, thinking it's all over, until they discover the bag of money is also inside. Shaun's husband Justin arrives unexpectedly; Eddie attacks him and convinces Shaun to unlock the door. He finds Shaun with the money bag, doused in gasoline, and holding a lighter; if he kills her, the lighter will ignite the bag and he loses. He unloads his gun and Shaun lets him take the bag. However, Duncan appears and stabs Eddie to death. He goes after Shaun and threatens to rape her and Jasmine. Jasmine arrives to help her mom, but Duncan overpowers her.

Brothers' Nest
 One cold morning in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], brothers Terry and Jeff arrive at the family home with plans to kill their stepfather, Rodger, who married into the family after the suicide of their biological father. Their motive is to get their dying mother to change her will and testament, as well as to take revenge on Rodger for being an irresponsible parent. Rodger is expected to return home at night to sell the family's horse. Jeff has carefully planned out the murder, intending to electrocute Rodger by throwing him with a live radio into a bathtub filled with water. In anticipation of their stepfather Rodger's arrival, Jeff prepares a to-do list, including cleaning the house of evidence, setting up an alibi of the brothers spending the weekend in Sydney, and rehearsing the murder. Terry reluctantly follows instructions, despite expressing fear and doubt towards his brother's intricate planning.   During the preparations, Terry has second thoughts about the crime, but Jeff is determined to carry through, leading to constant bickering. This ultimately results in Terry discovering that Jeff is in fact unemployed, and may be simply planning the murder as a means to obtain the family home to escape bankruptcy. Their argument is cut short by the unexpected early arrival of Rodger, and Terry is forced to make conversation in order to stall for time. Rodger reveals that the reason he was so distant in the boys' childhoods was because Jeff was deeply traumatised by their father's suicide, and thought it would be best to give them some space. However, he eventually remembers the brothers' Sydney alibi, and Jeff is forced to reveal himself and ties Rodger up before throwing him into the bathtub. Terry, now regretting the plan, attempts to untie Rodger as Jeff leaves to fetch the radio, but he's unable to free him in time before Jeff throws the radio into the bath, killing Rodger.  The brothers start to clean up the scene, but their mother, whom they thought was in hospital, had returned home with Rodger. She becomes impatient of waiting in the car, and enters the house to search for Rodger. Instead, she finds him dead in the bathtub, and grieves over his body while Terry and Jeff discuss their next move. Jeff suggests killing their mother too, which Terry vehemently rejects. As they argue, their mother approaches them and, seeing a pistol in Jeff's hands, taunts Jeff by insulting him and his biological father. Jeff shoots her to the horror of Terry. Terry runs out of the house, while Jeff remained inside and sets up the crime scene to frame Terry. Then, he follows Terry outside, and attempts to shoot Terry with the pistol. However, the gun clicks empty, and Terry reveals that he had removed the remaining bullets from the magazine, and was holding them in his hand. He scatters the ammunition on the floor and punches Jeff. Jeff starts to pick up the bullets to reload the gun, but Terry breaks his arm before he can do so. Jeff then runs away while continuing to reload, but Terry catches up and wrestles the pistol off him just as he finishes, causing the shots to go wide. Terry enters the house to retrieve a knife, and Jeff uses this opportunity to lock himself in Rodger's car, but is forced to come out after Terry lights the petrol tank on fire. Defeated, Jeff is forced to kill himself with the knife Terry hands him.   Another car, the buyer for the horse, pulls up to the house. Terry calmly makes conversation about the horse, seemingly oblivious of the carnage behind him as she surveys the scene in horror. As Terry leaves to fetch the horse, she calls the police, but is informed that there has already been a call. Terry returns with the horse just as police sirens can be heard in the distance. She asks him what happened here, to which Terry replies 'just some family stuff'.

In the restaurant, Hae-mi confesses that she liked Jong-su while she was younger, but that he always ignored her. She tells him about her plan to travel to Africa and asks him to feed her cat while she's away.  She asks him to come to her place the next day to show him how to feed the cat. At her place, Hae-mi mentions that the sun comes into her room only once a day. They have sex. While having sex, Jong-su stares at the sunray Hae-mi mentioned.  Jong-su goes to the courthouse where his father is being judged for violent behavior. We learn that he has [[Intermittent explosive disorder|anger disorder]]. Once the session over, Jong-su meets with his dad's lawyer ([[Moon Sung-keun]]) who asks him what he does for a living. He says that he's a literature graduate who wants to write novels. The lawyer condescendingly suggests him to write about his father, who had a stormy life.  Jong-su arrives at his father place, that he has to care for during his absence. The place is shabby, adjacent to a barn where Jong-su has to feed a unique cow.  The following days, Jong-su goes to Hae-mi's place to feed the cat, who still doesn't show up but whose presence is attested by feces in its litter. Looking at the sunray and remembering his moment with Hae-mi, Jong-su pleasures himself.  A few weeks later, Jong-su gets a call from Hae-mi, who was stuck for three days in the Nairobi airport, Kenya, following a terror warning. She asks him to come get her at the airport the next day.  At the airport, Hae-mi shows up with Ben ([[Steven Yeun]]), whom she met in Kenya during the crisis and bound with. In Jong-su father's dirty and old truck, they go to have dinner. Hae-mi remembers a sunset she witnessed while traveling in Africa. Very moved by her memory, she cries and confesses she wanted to disappear when she witnessed it. Ben mentions that he doesn't really understand people who cry and that he never really cried himself. He also tells Jong-su that he doesn't have a job, that his job is just having fun. Ben's friend comes to the restaurant to give him the keys to his Porsche. Outside, Hae-mi chooses to go in Ben's Porsche rather than Jong-su dirty truck.  Ben invites Jong-su and Hae-mi to his place for some pasta. While using the bathroom, Jong-su finds a vanity case full of make-up, casting doubt on the nature of Hae-mi and Ben's relationship. While smoking outside, Jong-su expresses to Hae-mi his doubt about Ben's activities, being rich as such a young age.   Jong-su and Hae-mi join Ben and his friend in a social meeting in a posh area of Seoul. While Jong-su is obviously ill at ease with people from a different social background, Hae-mi doesn't seem to care and tells the group about a dance she learned in Africa. The group seems amused, somewhat at her expense. While Hae-mi re-enacts the dance, Jong-su looks at Ben, who yawns.  Some time after, while cleaning the barn, Jong-su gets a call from Hae-mi, who is on his way to his place with Ben. Upon arrival, Hae-mi remembers a childhood memory where Jong-su rescued her after she fell into a well near her place. The three of them then engage in a pot-smoking session where Hae-mi starts a dance on Miles Davis' "[[Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (soundtrack)|Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud]]". While dancing in front of the sunset, Hae-mi starts to cry. She passes out on Jong-su's couch. Ben and Jong-su pursue the discussion outside. Ben confesses a strange hobby to Jong-su. Every two months, he burns a greenhouse. Jong-su's rural neighborhood is full of greenhouses. When asked when will be his next burning, Ben mentions that the next one will be very soon and very close to Jong-su's place. When Jong-su confesses his love for Hae-mi, Ben laughs. Hae-mi wakes up, likely to have heard Jong-su's confession. Ben and Hae-mi leaves Jong-su's farm.  The following days, Jong-su wakes up early every morning and runs methodically around his neighborhood to see if Ben burned a greenhouse. However, and despite what Ben said, nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. Jong-su also asks around about Hae-mi's well story, but nobody seems to remember any well.  Jong-su gets a call from Hae-mi's phone. Some struggling and running can be heard over the phone. Jong-su becomes worried as Hae-mi doesn't answer any of his subsequent calls.  Jong-su starts to follow Ben in and around Seoul. He confronts him in a cafe. He asks Ben if he really burned a greenhouse like he said he will. Ben tells Jong-su that he burned one a day or two after his visit to Jong-su's farm. Ben new girlfriend joins the two men. As they exit the cafe, Ben mentions that Hae-mi once confessed that she really liked Jong-su. When asked about her whereabouts, Ben answers that she does not answer his call either and that she disappeared like smoke and that giving that she has no contact with her relatives nor friends, it will be hard to find her.  Jong-su meets his mom after she called him for the first time in 16 years, having left the family after one of the rage outbursts of her husband. In debt, she tries to sound him out for money. Jong-su asks her about the well. She remembers that there was indeed a well near Hae-mi's place.  As Jong-su camps in front of Ben's place during a following session, Ben catches him and invites him in for a home party with his friends. Once inside, Ben searches the bathroom and find Hae-mi's watch. In the house, Jong-su also notices a cat that was not here during his first visit. When Ben's new girlfriend enters the house, the cat runs out. The three looks for the cat in the parking lot. When Jong-su calls him by the name of Hae-mi's cat, the cat runs right away in his arms.  At the party, Ben's new girlfriend tells anecdotes about her low profile job at a duty-free shop in Incheon Airport. Like earlier with Hae-mi, Ben yawns, which Jong-su notices. Jong-su leaves the place, now convinced that Ben killed Hae-mi.  The next morning, Ben waits for Jong-su in the countryside. Jong-su seems to have told him that he will bring Hae-mi. Jong-su arrives on the site and stabs Ben several times, killing him. He puts him back in his car, strips naked, throws his clothes in the car and sets it on fire before leaving in his truck.

The Cloverfield Paradox
 In 2028,<ref></ref> Earth is suffering from a global energy crisis. The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard [[particle accelerator]] aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the "Cloverfield Paradox", opening portals to allow horrors from [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]] to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor Monk Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam.  After about two years of unsuccessful testing of the Shepard, they eventually achieve a seemingly stable beam, but it then overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find Earth has vanished from view, and the [[gyroscope]] that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew work on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including finding an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall. Volkov fears something crawling beneath his skin and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so he convulses and dies, and the station's colony of worms bursts out of him. Jensen tells Ava not to trust Schmidt, who is soon discovered to be a spy sent by the German government to keep the Shepard shut down. Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. They find the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize that it is trying to write something, it instructs them to "cut Volkov open". Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They quickly locate Earth and restore their communications, but transmissions state that Cloverfield Station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior.  The crew determine they have moved to a different universe; Jensen is found to be a crew member of the space station from this universe. Here, Hamilton's children did not die, she stayed on Earth as a civilian engineer, and Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer. They plan to reactivate the Shepard device to return to their own universe. While the crew repair the station, Tam works out a means to make Shepard work properly, but she is killed in a freak accident. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return with Jensen to Earth to be with her children. As they prepare, Mundy is killed in an explosion caused by a strange magnetic field. After the explosion, Kiel sacrifices himself to disengage the wildly-spinning maintenance ring that was jeopardizing the station, leaving Hamilton in charge.  On Earth, Michael wakes up to discover a wave of destruction ravaging the planet, witnessing the silhouette of a giant monster in the distance. On his way to offer his assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After learning that the hospital has been destroyed, he takes her to an underground shelter belonging to a friend and tends to her wounds.  With Shepard ready to activate again, Hamilton prepares to leave with Jensen, but Jensen suddenly knocks her out. Jensen kills Monk with Volkov's gun, wounds Schmidt, and insists that the station must stay in her universe to keep the Shepard device there. Regaining consciousness, Hamilton uses the gun to shoot out a window, ejecting Jensen into space. Hamilton decides to return to their universe with Schmidt and makes a recording for her alternate universe self, giving her the plans for the Shepard device and stressing the importance of her family. Hamilton and Schmidt reverse the universe shift and use Tam's modifications to finally make Shepard work. After reporting in, the two eject themselves in an evacuation capsule towards Earth.  Michael learns from mission control of the station's reappearance and his wife's return to Earth, but he lambasts mission control for not warning Hamilton not to return to Earth in light of the ongoing situation. As the capsule re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, [[Clover (creature)|a giant monster]] comes up, roaring through the mist of a mountain.

 Michael MacCauley, an Irish-American life insurance salesman and former police officer, is a family man with a wife and teenaged son. He goes through the same routine train commute to work and back every day, taking the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] from [[Tarrytown station|Tarrytown]] to [[Grand Central Terminal]], often interacting with the same other commuters. His daily routine is interrupted when he is abruptly laid off from his job after a decade at the same company, leading him to wonder how he will pay his mortgage or afford his son's college tuition.  On the train home, Michael meets a mysterious woman named Joanna, who makes small talk with him. Joanna describes herself as academic who studies human behavior and tells him there are 16 distinct types of personalities. She proposes a hypothetical situation to Michael, asking him to do one little thing that he is uniquely skilled for, the results of which would have consequences that he would know nothing about, but would affect one of the passengers on the train. Joanna's one little thing that she wants Michael to do is locate "Prynne," the alias of an unknown passenger, whom she says doesn't belong and has something stolen. Joanna proceeds to tell him that he will find $25,000 in the bathroom and will be paid another $75,000 when the job is done. Michael starts to question whether this is real or hypothetical, and Joanna, before she gets off the train, alludes to him being a former cop. Out of curiosity, Michael searches the bathroom and finds an envelope with $25,000.  He attempts to leave the train but is stopped by a young woman who hands him another envelope with Michael's wife's wedding ring, and tells him it's a warning. Michael attempts to call his wife but with no response. Michael attempts to warn a fellow passenger of what is going on by writing on his newspaper. Michael leaves a voicemail describing the situation to former partner, Murphy, and then receives a call from Joanna, threatening him and his family. She tells him to look outside, where he sees the passenger he gave the newspaper to deliberately pushed in front of a bus. Joanna then points him to a GPS tracker in his jacket and instructs he plant it on Prynne.   Michael gives a fake report of suspicious behavior to a conductor, who announces he plans to search a woman's bag. A man immediately leaves the car and Michael follows him, at which point he attacks Michael. They fight and Michael plants the GPS tracker on him. Murphy calls back and informs him that Prynne is a key witness in a supposed suicide case of a man at the city planner's office, Enrique Mendez, leading Michael to realize that Prynne will be killed and that Michael is being set up.   In a deserted car, Michael discovers the body of the man he planted the GPS tracker on and a badge revealing he was an FBI agent. Sabotaging the air conditioning in the train except for the last car, Michael forces all of the remaining passengers into the last car. He realizes another passenger, a musician,  killed the FBI agent; he also received the same deal for $100,000, but with instructions to kill Prynne. Michael and the musician fight, at which point the musician is thrown from the train and killed. The real "Prynne" is revealed to be a young girl named Sofia, who is holding incriminating information on powerful people and was to go into [[witness protection]] at the final stop of the train. Michael asks Sofia why she did not go to the police. She reveals that it was the police who killed Enrique, who was Sofia's cousin.  Joanna calls Michael and tries to convince him to kill Sofia for the sake of his family, but Michael refuses. Joanna activates the fail-safe plan and derails the train in order to kill everyone aboard.

Assuming Michael is holding the train hostage, Murphy is sent to talk to him, only to be revealed as the cop who killed Enrique. Michael and Murphy engage in a fight, during which Michael removes Murphy's police tracker, which identifies him as a "friendly" to the snipers outside. The snipers, believing Murphy to be Michael, shoot and kill Murphy.  Outside of the train, Sofia is met by the FBI and proceeds to tell them what she knows. Michael is hailed as a hero and exonerated by the other passengers while his family is rescued by the FBI. His old captain admits that Murphy and a few others had been under investigation for some time and offers Michael his job back. Sometime later, Joanna is on a train back from Chicago.

After Velma web chats Daphne following her latest episode, she reveals to Velma that her parents will be moving to Ridge Valley, where Velma currently goes to high school.  After having a perfect morning at home, Daphne embarks on her first day at Ridge Valley High. She quickly meets Carol, her senior advisor, who shows her the school's expansive collection of advanced technology from Bloom Innovative, a famous technology company. While on her tour, Daphne runs into Velma, who does not speak to her. Later that afternoon, Daphne sees a student named Spencer walk into an open locker as if he were in a trance.  At home, Daphne's father reveals that he has sheltered Daphne all her life, going to extreme lengths to follow her around everywhere in an attempt to make Daphne's life "perfect". Shocked and frustrated at her father, Daphne vows to do everything on her own without her father's assistance. The next day, Daphne gets into a heated argument with Velma the next day over their science project, which Velma intentionally sabotaged. The argument results in the girls getting sent to the principal's office, who puts them on "the best couch for conflict resolution". The couch helps the girls put aside their differences, and Velma reveals she was protecting Daphne because she knew of the strange happenings at the school. Daphne and Velma vow to solve the mystery of the disappearing students.  The girls notice Spencer acting unnaturally robotic, and suspect another student named Griffin Griffiths. Griffin's family have a legacy receiving an internship from Bloom Innovative, which Spencer was currently slated to be offered. Daphne and Velma follow Griffin around, but he also goes into the same locker as Spencer and disappears, ruling him out as the suspect.  The girls realize the only way to figure out who is behind the disappearances is for Velma to be in the running to receive the Bloom internship, by placing herself on top the Bloom Bracket, a competitive ranking system designed to grade students on academics and extracurriculars. Mikayla, a mutual friend of Daphne and Velma's, is currently on top of the Bloom Bracket. Daphne attempts to help Velma win the internship, though in the process, they have to sabotage other students to protect them. The plan works, and Velma rises up to second place. However, they are unable to push Mikayla out of the top spot due to her extensive extracurricular involvement and passion for art. As a back-up plan, the girls cut the power to Mikayla's art exhibit, but the plan backfires when they see a cloaked ghost.

They find out that the ghost is actually Daphne's father in a bathrobe, who is still following Daphne around. After Daphne responds coldly, her father realizes that Daphne is capable of handling her own destiny, and he was simply frightened for her and wanted to shelter her from the world. Daphne web chats her mother, who is captured by Tobias Bloom. The girls realize Bloom is behind the disappearances, and go to his company headquarters with the help of Daphne's father.  The girls confront Tobias Bloom after sneaking into the headquarters, but discover he is simply a hologram. Daphne and Velma find Carol, who reveals that she created Bloom Innovative and posed as a student at Ridge Valley High. She attempted to use the cover of the company to kidnap students and steal their inventive ideas to get rich and famous. Carol is quickly apprehended by police.  The girls return to the newly reformed school, and reunite with Mikayla and Spencer.

They choose the home of K. Kumar/ Krishna Kumar (Jayaram) to stay for the duration of their visit, as he is the only person on earth who has never troubled god by praying for his needs.  God and Mayadathan arrive in Kerala and arrives at K Kumar's house. They are welcomed by the entire village and starts living at Krishna Kumar's house.  Next morning they see how life is for Krishna Kumar and his wife Nirmala  ( Anusree). Kumar is the Panchayath Secretary and spends his time wandering around, while Nirmala spends all her time toiling in the kitchen and doing the household works. Also, Krishna Kumar is a loafer who needs his wife to do everything for him and yet doesn't appreciate it and often finds fault with her. This leads to constant bickering among the couple.  During one such fight, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar challenge each other to exchange their roles to prove whether men or women are stronger.  God tries to dissuade them from this attempt and warns them that there would be dire consequences to this game. But both Nirmala and Krishna Kumar are adamant. So God allows them to do as they want.  From the next day, Nirmala goes to work and Krishna Kumar stays at home to do the household works that Nirmala used to do for him. While life is easy for Nirmala, Kumar struggles to cope with the stress of having to manage the home and Kitchen.   On a parallel track, the life of Nirmala's cousin Karimannur Gopi ( Salim Kumar) is shown. He lives with his wife, who is very lazy and doesn't want to cook, and his son. He is supposedly a friend of Lionel Messi and has opened a jewellery store in partnership with him.  In Kumar's house, after many days into the role swapping, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar decides to end it (as Nirmala is unable to bear how much Krishna Kumar is suffering) and tells the same to God. But God drops the bombshell by saying that it is impossible to switch the roles back now because to experience the life of a woman completely, Krishna Kumar's will have to get pregnant and give birth to a child. This shatters the couple.  The rest of the film deals with the couple's attempts to outsmart god's plans by adopting different methods to try to abort the child Kumar is carrying.  
Deadpool 2
  After successfully working as the mercenary [[Deadpool]] for two years, Wade Wilson fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with his girlfriend [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]. That night, after the pair decides to start a family together, the target tracks Wilson down and kills Vanessa. Wilson kills the man in revenge. He blames himself for her death and attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Wilson is left with only a [[Skee-Ball]] token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.  Recovering at the [[X-Mansion]], Wilson agrees to join the [[X-Men]] as a form of healing. He, Colossus, and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins / Firefist]] at an orphanage, labeled a "Mutant Reeducation Center". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, a cybernetic soldier from the future, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], whose family is murdered by an older Collins, travels back in time to kill the boy before Collins ever becomes a killer.  Cable breaks into the Ice Box and attacks Collins. Wilson, whose collar has broken in the melee, attempts to defend Collins. After Cable takes Vanessa's token, Wilson forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Collins overhears Wilson deny that he cares for the young mutant. Near death again, Wilson has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Collins. Wilson organizes a team called [[X-Force]] to break Collins out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachuting from a plane, but all of the members die during the landing except for Wilson and the lucky [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. While they fight Cable, Collins frees fellow inmate [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who agrees to help Collins kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Collins to escape.  Cable offers to work with Wilson and Domino to stop Collins' first murder, and agrees to give Wilson a chance to talk Collins down. At the orphanage, they are overpowered by Juggernaut while Collins attacks the headmaster, until Colossus—who had at first refused to help Wilson due to Wilson's murderous ways—arrives to distract Juggernaut. When Wilson fails to talk down Collins, Cable shoots at the young mutant. Wilson leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing this sacrifice, Collins does not kill the headmaster; this changes the future so that Cable's family now survives. Cable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token in front of Wilson's heart. Now when Wilson takes the bullet for Collins, it is stopped by the token and both survive. Collins still has his change of heart, and afterwards, the headmaster is run over by Wilson's taxi-driver friend Dopinder.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits sequence]], Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wilson. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and X-Force member Peter, and kills both ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''s version of Deadpool and actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] while he is considering starring in the film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''.

A security guard who drops his coffee and reaches for his gun instigates the shootout. Police officers arrive on the scene and engage in a shootout with the robbers. Eventually, Merrimen and his crew escape with the empty armored truck, but he reprimands Bosco ([[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]]) for killing the first guard. In the morning, Detective Nick "Big Nick" O'Brien ([[Gerard Butler]]) investigates the crime scene. He has been monitoring Merrimen and his crew for a while. Suspecting a local bartender named Donnie ([[O'Shea Jackson Jr.]]) for involvement, Nick finds him at the bar and kidnaps him for interrogation. In a flashback, Merrimen is planning to rob the Federal Reserve on Friday of that week by covertly removing about $30 million in old bills which are scheduled to be shredded after their serial numbers are deleted from computer records.  Merrimen has Donnie gain access into the Federal Reserve by posing as a Chinese food deliveryman. In the ceiling of a Federal Reserve bathroom, he stashes an extra bag of food for the day of the big heist. At home, Nick's wife Debbie ([[Dawn Olivieri]]) discovers that Nick has been going behind her back seeing other women. Incensed, she leaves with their daughters and files for divorce. Nick spots Donnie and says hello at a restaurant with Merrimen, his crew and their stripper girlfriends. At their hideout, Merrimen has one of his crew, Levi ([[50 Cent]]), roughly interrogate Donnie. Donnie convinces him that he hasn't told anything about the robbery. Later on, Levi's daughter has a date arrive to pick her up for a school dance. Levi pulls the boy aside to introduce him to Merrimen and the rest of their crew to intimidate him into being on his best behavior with Levi's daughter.   Meanwhile, Nick drunkenly crashes a small get-together at the home of Debbie's sister. He obnoxiously signs the divorce papers, and gets belligerent with Debbie's new boyfriend, before he is told to leave. Nick then goes to a strip club and finds Merrimen's stripper girlfriend, hires her for the night to find out where the heist is going to happen. He is unaware the stripper was told by Merrimen to give him misleading information about the heist. The next morning, Nick makes a desperate unscheduled effort to see his daughter at her school.  The day of the heist comes. Merrimen and his crew invade a commercial bank and take hostages. Nick’s team is outside as the chaos unfolds. The L.A.P.D. negotiator calls and speaks to the bank's manager on behalf of Merrimen. To discourage further time-wasting communications, Merrimen has one of the crew take a hostage to a back room, where he apparently shoots her. The police negotiator then agrees not to communicate again until the robbers' demands (money and helicopter) are about to arrive in over an hour's time. The thieves then blow the vault open and escape through a hole in the floor before Nick’s team come in. They also find that the shooting of the hostage was staged. The thieves needed commercial bank cash so they could make a cash drop-off at the Federal Reserve, the only way to get inside the Federal Reserve building.   Donnie is hidden inside a cash dolly delivered to the Federal Reserve building by Merrimen, and he slips out during a falsely tripped alarm to collect the targeted old bills that have been earmarked for shredding, and he stashes them in bags and throws them in with the refuse. After escaping the cash count-rooms through the air ducts, Donnie retrieves the bag of food from the bathroom ceiling. Appalled by the cold, old food, the unsuspecting Federal Reserve employee who orders Chinese food daily tries to get security to stop him, but Donnie is gone. The cash is dispatched from the Federal Reserve building in a garbage truck that removes shredded bills. Nick’s team catches up to Donnie and seizes him, beating him until he tells them where Merrimen is going.  Merrimen, Bosco, and Levi try to make their escape with the money bags from the waste truck. They hit a traffic jam and are blocked. Nick’s team spots them and attempt to shoot them as the robbers try to escape. A shootout occurs initiated by Merrimen killing one of Nick's men. Levi and Bosco are eventually shot dead, but Merrimen gets away. Nick chases and shoots Merrimen through a fence, wounding him. Nick hops the fence to catch him, but Merrimen refuses to go out quietly. He raises an empty gun to Nick, forcing Nick to shoot him. As Merrimen lies on the ground dying, Nick kneels by him. He reminds Nick that he kept his word about him not going to jail again and dies peacefully. When Nick inspects Merrimen's SUV, he only finds bags with shredded paper. He also finds that Donnie has escaped custody.  Nick later goes to Donnie's bar and sees pictures of him with some of the crew members from the heist. Through flashbacks, it is revealed Donnie masterminded the heist to keep all of the stolen cash for himself in a second garbage truck. The realization hits Nick. After the passage of some time, Donnie is seen in London working at another bar. His crew is nearby having drinks and enjoying the spoils of their victory. A man ([[Michael Bisping]]) from a shop across the street comes in. Donnie serves him and asks whether he works at the diamond exchange next door. The man says yes, and Donnie gives the man a beer on the house.<ref></ref>

Months later, Paul drops Jordan off at [[NYU]]. As Paul is leaving, he spots a man who steals a bag from a bellhop, calls out to him and points at him with a [[finger gun]].

Durant then explains that he's been genetically altering the brains of five bull sharks to make them smarter, which enrages Misty.  The group later meets in the wet lab, where Durant explains to Misty that the reason he invited her is because the alpha shark, Bella, has been acting strangely, to which Misty concludes is because she is pregnant.

Trent reveals to Misty that Durant has been doing the same experiments on himself using a genetics-altering liquid in order to make himself more intelligent, due to his fear that technology will one day take over the world. Durant reunites with Misty and Trent soon after, and they make their way to an air ventilation shaft that will lead to the surface.  Aaron and Josh arrive in one of the sleeping quarters, although the shark pups find them, and eat Josh while Aaron escapes on a mattress. Misty, Trent, and Durant arrive at the shaft, although Durant locks her out of the room after she attempts to find other survivors, which enrages Trent. The two then manage to reach the surface. Meanwhile, Daniel finds Leslie behind a door, although the shark pups eat her in front of him. He is soon found by Aaron, who was attacked by the pups, and lost the mattress, and they attempt to find a way to the surface. Misty, meanwhile, uses a blow torch to get inside the room with the ventilation shaft, and is met by Aaron and Daniel. The shark pups then find them, and Misty distracts them while Aaron, and Daniel begin climbing to the surface. The water rises as they climb to the surface, which allows the pups to reach Daniel, and tear him in half while Aaron reaches the surface. Meanwhile, Misty, using scuba gear she found in Trent's quarters, manages to swim to the surface, and reunite with the others.  Realizing that the facility is sinking, and they cannot stay any longer, the group makes a break for the motorboat. Aaron is dragged underwater by one of the sharks while Durant is confronted by Bella, and seemingly scares her away. However, moments later, Bella jumps up, and eats him while Misty, and Trent reach the motorboat, and use two flare guns to kill one of the sharks. Aaron then jumps onto the boat, explaining that he escaped one of the sharks. Misty tells Trent that they cannot let the sharks roam in the open ocean, and Trent blows up the facility with a self-destruct button. Misty, Trent, and Aaron then escape on the motorboat, although it is soon revealed that Bella and her pups survived the explosion and are now free in the open ocean.  
The Death of Superman (film)
 [[Superman]] has become an icon of virtue for the citizens of [[Metropolis]], a notion that still infuriates the city's billionaire [[megalomaniac]] [[philanthropist]] [[Lex Luthor]], who considers the alien being as a threat to his city. After foiling a kidnapping attempt of the mayor by a gang of [[mercenaries]] armed with cutting edge technology, such as the [[Mother Box]], Superman and the [[Justice League]] send the pieces to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for analysis. Meanwhile Superman, in an unprecedented move presents the rocket that brought him from the exploded [[Krypton]] to [[Earth]], and birthing matrix, containing Kryptonian DNA technology to the world, through an interview with the [[Daily Planet]] ace reporter [[Lois Lane]].  Lois is in a long-term secret relationship with Superman's alter-ego, [[Clark Kent]]. Despite meeting Clark's parents, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan and Martha]] over the weekend, she is apprehensive of Clark's secrecy about his past. Clark's reluctant to reveal his superhero alter-ego creates a rift between the two, making Lois reconsider her relationship with him.  At S.T.A.R labs, [[Silas Stone]] and his associates analyze the technology recovered from the mayor's assailants, discovering the metal alloy comprises of elements from both [[Apokolips]] and Earth. Realizing that very few labs have the power to fuse Apokolips and human technology, Superman confronts Lex Luthor demanding a confession for his crime. However, Luthor who has remained under [[house arrest]], wearing an [[ankle monitor]] for his previous crimes against Superman, denies any involvement in the kidnapping.  Meanwhile, an [[astronaut]] team under the guidance of [[Hank Henshaw|Capt. Hank Henshaw]], repairing a satellite aboard the Excalibur space shuttle reminisces about Superman and the number of times he has saved Hank's team from dire circumstances. In deep space, a [[boomtube]] opens propelling a meteorite towards the Earth. Henshaw receives a call from [[NASA]] warning of incoming space debris, instructing the team to enter the space shuttle. Henshaw hopes Superman will save him and his team, like he always has. Unfortunately, the debris accompanying the meteorite strikes the unit, annihilating the satellite and the crew. The meteorite crashes 10,000m into the ocean floor near the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The meteorite's entry into the Earth is monitored by Luthor and his team of scientists in an underground research facility. Luthor who has escaped the house arrest by planting a [[decoy]], sends a team of deep sea explorers to the crash site. The explorers encounter [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlanteans]] at the crash site, who together examine the wreckage. Suddenly the wreckage explodes and out emerges a 9-foot giant humanoid beast fully clothed in what resembles a [[hazmat suit]]. It crushes the skulls of the Atlanteans with its bare hands, moving on to destroy Luthor's explorer’s vessel before walking away on the sea floor towards land. Luthor meanwhile has been storing alien bodies in the lab, discusses deploying them as a pre-emptive measure, with his team of scientists.  Clark meanwhile contemplates his decision of hiding his alter-ego from Lois. Next morning the two meet at a [[tavern]] where Clark takes off his spectacles in front of Lois, revealing his identity as Superman. The two resolve their differences before Clark receives a distress call from the [[Justice League]].  The beast reaches the US coastline, moving towards the most populated city in the vicinity, Metropolis, en route murdering two campers and a [[grizzly bear]]. At the outskirts of the city the beast goes on rampage decimating police units, and the entire Justice League single-handedly. While each of the members give some fight, the most they manage to do is tear the beast's suit, exposing the face and body of a scaly blue gray monster, with blazing fiery red eyes. The [[Martian Manhunter]] manages to delve into the beast's mind through [[telepathy]], discovering that the beast is a weapon with zero empathy, designed specifically to annihilate large civilizations. [[Wonder Woman]] fight the beast before falling victim to its powerful assaults. Just as the beast is about to stab her with her own sword, Superman strikes it with his heat vision hurling it city blocks away.  The fight between the titans is reported live from the air by Lois and her cameraman [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Lois dubs the beast, [[Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday]]. The news crew is attacked by the beast prompting Superman to rescue the crew. Superman continue to fight the monster, in the city, over a suspension bridge, in the sky and finally near the [[Hall of Justice]]. Luthor sadistically enjoys the brunt borne by Superman and considers this as an opportunity to gain the upper hand over him, by defeating Doomsday himself and win the hearts of the citizens live on air. He attacks the beast with a custom designed warsuit retro-fitted with Kryptonite lasers to kill it, and almost succeeds. Luthor tries to show the world that he is their true savior, and not Superman, before stabbing Doomsday. But, the beast recovers soon from its injuries, tears through Luthor's exoskeleton suit and hurls him far away. Superman catches Luthor just in time, much to the latter's dismay before flying to a fight to the death.  The two pummel each other with all their might, but Doomsday eventually gets the upper hand, grievously wounding his opponent. Lois realizes Clark will not live through the fight and distracts Doomsday by hitting it with a stone, to buy some time long enough for Superman to recover some of his waning strength. Undeterred and unfazed, the beast extrudes a bony spear through his arms, and with murderous intent walks towards Lois. Superman on the floor watches as Doomsday raises his arm to strike Lois, and with one final burst of [[war cry]], hurls himself straight towards its head. Doomsday turns just in time to view Superman's last assault. Superman's speed is enough to twist Doomsday's neck around, killing it. Unfortunately, the beast also fatally stabs him through the chest. Lois holds a dying Superman in her arms. Having been assured that Doomsday is dead, and that the rest of the citizens are safe, Superman smiles and breathes his last.  Jimmy broadcasts the death live all over the world, creating a global mourning. Superman is provided a [[state funeral]], in attendance are all dignitaries, the Justice League and Lex Luthor. Clark Kent unbeknownst to others is declared [[Killed in action]].  In post credits scenes, Superman's rocket self-starts and flies to the [[North Pole]], burying itself under the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic Ice]] to terraform the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. Doctor [[John Henry Irons]] is seen forging a metallical version of the Superman symbol. Lois and Jimmy arrive at Superman's [[mausoleum]], to discover an empty casket broken from inside and witness a dark figure with a cape in the sky, flying away in an instant. The last scene portrays a [[Cyborg Superman|cybernetic organism resembling Superman]] flying above the Earth's atmosphere.

Early Man (film)
 An asteroid collides with the prehistoric Earth, causing the extinction of the planet’s [[dinosaur]]s, but sparing a tribe of [[cavemen]] living near the impact site. Finding a roughly spherical chunk of the asteroid that is too hot to touch, the cavemen begin to kick it around and invent the game of [[association football|football]].  Many years later during the [[Stone Age]], a young caveman named Dug ([[Eddie Redmayne]]) lives in the village with the chief Bobnar ([[Timothy Spall]]), and many other cavemen such as Asbo, ([[Johnny Vegas]]), Gravelle ([[Gina Yashere]]), Treebor ([[Richard Ayoade]]), Magma ([[Selina Griffiths]]), Barry ([[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]), Grubup (Richard Webber), and Thongo and Eemak ([[Simon Greenall]]). One day, Dug suggests to Bobnar that they should try hunting [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]] instead of rabbits, but he brushes him off.   A [[Bronze Age]] army of [[War Elephants]] led by the Lord Nooth ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) drives the tribe out of the valley and into the surrounding volcanic [[badlands]], proclaiming that the Stone Age has ended and the [[Bronze Age]] has begun. Dug tries to attack the army, but falls into a cart and is unknowingly taken to Nooth’s city. While trying to evade the guards and escape, he is mistaken for a football player and led onto the pitch before a full stadium crowd. He challenges Nooth’s elite local team to a match with the valley at stake and promises that the tribe will work in Nooth’s mines forever if they lose. Nooth dismisses the proposal at first, but changes his mind once he realises that he can profit off the match.  Dug discovers that although his ancestors invented football, the other members of his tribe are too dim to understand it. After their only ball is destroyed, Dug and his pet [[Wild boar|boar]] Hognob ([[Nick Park]]) sneak into the city to steal more but are found by a local resident of Bronze city named Goona ([[Maisie Williams]]). Resentful over the team’s exclusion of women, she helps them steal some balls and agrees to coach the cavemen.  Goona points out that the players on Nooth’s team are talented but too egotistical to work together effectively. The cavemen improve in skill and teamwork under her coaching. Nooth receives a Message Bird ([[Rob Brydon]]) from Queen Oofeefa, warning him to not underestimate Dug's team. To demoralise Dug, Nooth has him brought to the mines and shows him cave paintings made by his tribe’s ancestors, who proved so inept at football that they never won a match and eventually gave up the sport.   On the day of the match, with Oofeefa ([[Miriam Margolyes]]) in attendance, Dug announces his forfeiture as part of a deal to spare the rest of the tribe and agrees to take their place in the mines. However, his reinvigorated teammates persuade him to break the deal and play the match. They are down 3–1 at [[half-time]], but rally in the second half to tie the score. Nooth incapacitates the referee and takes his place, making biased calls in favour of the local team that leads to Bobnar (the cavemen's goalkeeper) being knocked out.   Hognob takes his place and blocks a [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], and Dug scores using a [[bicycle kick]] to win the match for the cavemen, 4–3. The cavemen win their village back with the respect of Oofeefa, the local team, and the crowd. Nooth tries to escape and steal the crowd's admission money, but Goona stops him with help from a giant duck; Nooth is arrested for his crimes and everyone gets their money back.  Goona and Nooth's elite local team joins Dug’s tribe for a hunt, but they are chased away by a rabbit pretending to be a woolly mammoth.

Her [[single father]] struggles to connect with her and break her reliance on social media.  Kayla gets an invite to go to a pool party hosted by a classmate, Kennedy, who invited her only because her mom forced her to. Kayla suffers an [[anxiety attack]] in the bathroom, but eventually goes outside to swim, where she meets Gabe, Kennedy’s cousin. Kayla later has an awkward encounter with her crush, Aiden, who suggests that she rejoin the group. She overcomes her fear and volunteers to sing karaoke.  Kayla overhears that Aiden broke up with his last girlfriend because she refused to send him nude photos. Kayla mentions to him in passing that she has a dirty photos folder on her phone, which piques his interest. He asks if she gives blowjobs, and she says yes, not knowing what it means. She later looks it up online and is disgusted.  Kayla attends a high school shadow program, where she meets Olivia, a nice high school senior who shows her around the school. Olivia gives Kayla her number and later invites her to hang out at the mall with some of Olivia’s friends. They have a good time, though Kayla spots her father spying from afar and, embarrassed, tells him to leave. Olivia’s friend Riley gives Kayla a ride home late at night, and he initiates an awkward game of truth or dare where he asks about her sexual experience, takes off his shirt, and asks her to remove hers. She refuses and he angrily backs off, claiming he was just trying to help her get some experience with boys. Kayla breaks down at home and is comforted by her father. She makes a video announcing that she intends to stop making videos, as she is unable to follow her own advice.  Kayla and her classmates open time capsules they left for themselves at the start of sixth grade. She watches a video she made for herself, where her past self asks questions about Kayla’s friends and love life. She asks her father to help her burn the time capsule, and asks if she makes him sad. He says that she fills him with pride and he could never be sad about her, which relieves her.  At graduation, Kayla rebukes Kennedy for ignoring her thank-you letter and acting indifferent towards her despite Kayla’s attempts to be nice. She later hangs out at Gabe’s house, where they bond over ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and have a fun time together. Kayla leaves a video message for her high-school self and encourages her to persevere through tough times.

However, McCall traces the contact to York's phone, revealing that he was the one who killed Susan. Because of McCall's apparent death, the remaining members of the team had been fired, and were forced to find work as freelance assassins.

The zookeeper informs Shu that his cousin has given up his first patent technology and all its specs and details, now they want his second patent, which Yusheng does not want to give to them. The zookeeper asks Shu to help retrieve this second patent. When Shu asks his cousin about these patents, Yusheng reveals that his first patent is nothing but his second patent is very dangerous if it gets into the wrong hands,  as anyone can control any system through his second patented technology, any defence systems can be shut down, any nuclear weapons can be launched.  Shu meets up with Kimbral and he informs them that they are in H.A.D.E.S. ('''H'''igh '''A'''sset '''DE'''tention '''S'''ervice) Prison, built using technology, '''Galileo''', and that he has been in the prison for couple of months now.

Shu befriends them and questions Count Zero for the layout. The following day, Shu, Luke and Kimbral are in the control chamber tied to chairs and forced to watch through a monitor as Count Zero is taken by the prison guards. Here, Kimbral reveals that he is the one running the Zoo after being approached by the Tomb creators when Breslin dismissed him from the company.  Breslin and DeRosa deduce Kimbral’s identity as the prison’s owner, and learn that Kimbral kidnapped the operatives as revenge. Breslin is also taken to the prison and Kimbral challenges him to break out of the Prison. Using a high-tech communications toothimplanted inside Breslin,  Hush tries to get the layout of the prison from the outside.

While attempting to maintain control of the medical center, the Legions and Akala are killed by Kimbral’s men. Breslin, Shu, Luke and Yusheng get scattered.  Shu and Faust get engaged in a knife fight, ending with Shu killing Faust, while Breslin gets to the control room and enters into a hand-to-hand fight with Kimbral. When Yusheng blows up the Solar panels, DeRosa uses the distraction to find the location of HADES and enters into the prison by force knocking down one of the walls.  DeRosa saves Luke while killing the guards before destroying Galileo. Shu and Yusheng are able to exit HADES safely to meet with Hush waiting for them. Breslin wins the battle and meets with DeRosa and Luke in the control room. Later, Breslin reveals to Luke that HADES is located in Atlanta. As they work, a man contacts HADES calling for Kimbral.

As people flee Staten Island on the night of the experiment, Nya joins her friends Dolores, Luisa and Selina in a church to wait out the Purge. Dmitri has stayed behind because Capital A has sent Anna and Elsa, two hookers, to his office. Skeletor commits the first-ever murder during the Purge, and the video recorded by the NFFA goes viral. The NFFA also observe that more parties than killings are taking place. Isaiah confronts Skeletor during the Purge but cannot shoot him. Skeletor chases Isaiah throughout the streets but Isaiah manages to hide and he calls Nya to help. Anna and Elsa are revealed to be Purgers who attempt to kill Dmitri, but Dmitri fights them off and learns that Capital A had sent them in an attempt to take over Dmitri's business. Skeletor captures Nya in the streets and attempts to rape her, but Isaiah stabs him in the back and they escape.  Nya and Isaiah return to the church to see blood-soaked Purgers leaving it. They discover that Luisa and Selina survived, but Dolores' fate is unknown. They all return to Isaiah's apartment where Dolores has made it safely. At the NFFA headquarters, Updale is reviewing video footage of the Purge when she sees trained mercenary groups killing multiple civilians, including the ones at the church earlier. Sabian explains that he sent the mercenaries to help "balance" the rich and the poor. He then has Updale taken to a neighborhood where she is killed, and he erases all footage of the event.  Capital A goes to Dmitri's office to see the results of Anna and Elsa's efforts, but Dmitri and his gang kill Capital A. Dmitri and his gang escape through the streets, killing multiple Purgers along the way, until NFFA drones shoot and kill Dmitri's gang. Dmitri calls Nya and warns her that the mercenaries are coming toward her apartment. Dmitri makes his way to the apartment, killing more mercenaries along the way. The mercenaries are about to shoot a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] into the apartments when Skeletor arrives and kills some mercenaries before he himself is killed. Dmitri grabs a piece of [[c-4 (explosive)|C-4]], throws it and shoots it repeatedly until it explodes, killing the remaining mercenaries. As sirens sound the end of the Purge, Dmitri is hailed as a hero, and he states that the survivors must somehow fight back.  During the end credits, Sabian reads a statement calling this experimental Purge a success, and that a nationwide Purge may begin as soon as the following year.

A Futile and Stupid Gesture (film)
 The film's timeline stretches from 1968 to 1980. The film opens with [[Doug Kenney]] and his classmate [[Henry Beard]] celebrating a book release with the ''[[The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon]]'' staff. The two men graduate from Harvard and Kenney convinces Beard not to go to law school but instead publish a monthly magazine known as the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'']]. Though Doug Kenney is the magazine's main creative voice, there would be no magazine without the guidance of Beard. Doug Kenney becomes the comedy writer and Henry Beard the business manager, while the magazine also has a thriving art department.  The two men get financing from [[Matty Simmons]]. All of the writers work hard to be funny and meet deadlines. Work is a party atmosphere and drugs add to the creative process. The magazine is not initially a success until lawsuits are threatened by Disney, Volkswagen, Mormons, and many other established names. The comedy world is changed, and the magazine pushes the acceptance of satire and parody with each edition. Burnout is common and Kenney suddenly leaves for nine months with a one line note to Henry. The magazine stays successful under Beard. After five years Simmons agrees to a buyout and the two men each collect $3.5 million.  ''National Lampoon'' expands to an hour radio show attracting more great comedians like [[Gilda Radner]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Bill Murray]]. Special editions of the magazine are published such as [[National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody|one mocking high school yearbooks]]. Doug Kenney then moves to movies and writes ''[[Animal House]]'' starring [[John Belushi]] in 1978. With the success of the film, cocaine takes over Kenney's life. As ongoing disputes with studio executives continue, Kenney writes ''[[Caddyshack]]''. He does not like his work and embarrasses himself drunk and high at a press conference promoting the film.  Chevy Chase takes Kenney to Hawaii to beat cocaine, but cocaine wins instead. At age 33 in 1980, Douglas Kenney's body is found at the bottom of a Hawaiian cliff. As he has narrated his life's story through the movie, Doug is displeased to see everyone sad at his funeral. The movie ends with Beard starting a food fight at his wake.

Future World (film)
 At the film's opening, a voice-over explains that mankind's technological breakthroughs in the development of artificial intelligence and robotics eventually lead to a global war. Afterward, the remnants of humanity struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland while the surviving machines remain hidden.  In the wasteland, a Warlord ([[James Franco]]), raids a settlement that contains a high-tech lab with an android girl named Ash ([[Suki Waterhouse]]). The Warlord activates Ash who opens two different colored eyes, (one blue, one green), that light up when she receives commands through a handheld remote.  Elsewhere, in a fertile zone called the Oasis, a young man called the Prince (Jeffrey Wahlberg), sets out on a mission into the wasteland in search of medicine to help his sick mother the Queen ([[Lucy Liu]]). His only clue to finding it is a faded postcard of a place called "Paradise Beach" where the rumored cure resides.  The Prince and his friends who accompany him, stop at Love Town, a wasteland settlement that deals in sex slaves and is run by the pimp "Big Daddy Love Lord" ([[Snoop Dogg]]). There they try to get directions to Paradise Beach but attract the attention of the Raiders. The Prince's friend Rico (Ben Youcef), drives off the Raiders with a handgun – a rare and valuable item in the wasteland. Big Daddy approaches with an offer to meet with someone who can help them, but it ends up being a trap set up by the Warlord where Ash captures the Prince and kills his friends. The Warlord then forces the Prince into taking them back to the Oasis, during which Ash, (who knows the Warlord will kill everyone), decides to save him.  Ash is damaged during the escape, leaking fluid from a gash in her abdomen, but she and the Prince manage to find shelter where she passes out when her systems shut down. The next day the Prince fashions a stretcher and drags Ash's body through the wasteland until he eventually finds the ocean. There his hopes are shattered when they are taken prisoner again by another group of wastelanders residing in the ruins of the seaside resort.  At the resort the Prince meets the "Drug Lord" ([[Milla Jovovich]]), who offers him the cure but at a cost. She injects him with a syringe and he passes out after experiencing hallucinations. Meanwhile Ash is taken to Lei ([[Margarita Levieva]]), a mechanic and a prisoner of the Drug Lord, who repairs Ash and reactivates her. Afterward, Ash is taken before the Drug Lord who fawns over how valuable she is.  The next day the Drug Lord forces the Prince into a gladiatorial battle with one of her minions saying that if he survives he gets the medicine and goes free. The Prince manages to defeat his opponent and retrieves the drugs, but the Drug Lord says that Ash is staying with her.  Later that evening, Lei goes to free Ash who is chained up in a cell but her attempt to saw the chains proves futile. Ash accepts her fate to remain a prisoner but decides to repay Lei for her kindness and makes love to her. The next morning, the Drug Lord discovers Ash and Lei together and, in a jealous rage, orders Lei to wipe Ash's memory of the event and reprogram her into a loving companion for herself instead.  Outside, the Prince returns and tries to sneak back into the resort just as the Warlord arrives and attacks the complex. In a drug-addled fury, the Drug Lord faces off with the Warlord who ends up killing her with the Prince's handgun. During the distraction, the Prince tries to help Lei and Ash escape, but they are all captured. The Warlord tries to retake control of Ash with the remote, ordering her to kill her friends, but Ash kills his men instead. She stabs the Warlord with a machete and then escapes with Lei and the Prince on a pair of the Raider's motorbikes. The Warlord gives chase, but Ash stops and kills him in one last stand.  The three eventually make it back to Oasis where Ash tells the Prince she's leaving to find others like herself that are out there somewhere. The Prince returns to his mother and gives her the medicine as Ash rides off with Lei into the wasteland. In a mid credit post scene, Ash returns to Love Town and frees the sex slaves, who get revenge on Big Daddy Love Lord by attacking him.

Game Night (film)
  Married competitive gamer couple Max ([[Jason Bateman]]) and Annie ([[Rachel McAdams]]) are trying to have a child, but their attempts are unsuccessful due to Max's stress surrounding his feelings of inadequacy when compared to his successful, attractive brother Brooks ([[Kyle Chandler]]). During Max and Annie's routine weekend game night with their friends Ryan ([[Billy Magnussen]]), and married couple Kevin ([[Lamorne Morris]]) and Michelle ([[Kylie Bunbury]]), Brooks shows up Max by arriving in a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Corvette Stingray]] (Max's dream car) and sharing an embarrassing childhood story about Max. Brooks offers to host the next game night at a house he's renting while he's in town. Meanwhile, Max and Annie are trying to keep their game nights secret from their neighbor Gary ([[Jesse Plemons]]), an awkward police officer after his divorce from their friend Debbie.  When the guests, including Ryan's new date, Sarah ([[Sharon Horgan]]), arrive at Brooks' house the following week, Brooks says he's initiated an interactive role-playing mystery game, promising the winner his Stingray. A man dressed as an FBI agent ([[Jeffrey Wright]]) bursts into the home and informs them of the narrative of the mystery, only for two masked men to break in and assault him and Brooks. The guests believe the assault is part of the game. After Brooks is dragged out of the house, the couples begin to solve the mystery using the clues left behind by the actor.   Using his GPS location, Max and Annie track Brooks down to a seedy bar and, using a pistol left behind by Brooks during the struggle (which they believe to be fake), manage to take the keys to the storage closet, where Brooks is being held. After Annie mistakenly fires the gun and shoots Max in the arm, confirming the weapon is real and that they are in actual danger, the three escape. Brooks admits that he actually makes his living buying and selling illegal items on the black market, in particular a [[Fabergé egg]] sought by a man known only as the Bulgarian and owned by a man using the alias Marlon Freeman. With his captors in pursuit, Brooks exits the moving car to guarantee Max and Annie's escape.  Eventually, the others learn what they've become involved in, avoiding police because of Brooks' warnings. Trying to determine the identities of the Bulgarian ([[Michael C. Hall]]) and Marlon Freeman ([[Danny Huston]]), they show up at Gary's house, under the false pretense of a game night, in order to use his police computer, where Max discovers the address of Marlon Freeman (real name: Donald Anderton). The group leaves Gary's house and arrives at Anderton's address, where he is hosting an underground fight club. As the others search the house, Ryan spots the egg in a wall safe and is caught trying to steal it. The group escapes with the egg, but accidentally break it. They discover the egg is a worthless fake, but end up finding a list of names that was stored inside of it, realizing this was what the Bulgarian wanted.  The group finds Brooks and his captors on an under-construction bridge and move in to rescue him. Before the captors are able to kill them, the group is saved by Gary, who is then shot in the chest. Max and Annie try to encourage him to pull through by promising to invite him to every future game night. Gary then reveals that he faked the entire scenario in an attempt to trick them into letting him join game night again. He is, however, unaware about the egg, and they are immediately attacked by the real Bulgarian, who captures Brooks after he swallows the list, revealed to be people in the [[witness protection program]]. Max and Annie use Brooks' Corvette to drive to the airport and stop the Bulgarian from taking off with Brooks in his jet. They knock the Bulgarian out, tie him up, and free Brooks.  Three months later, Brooks, now under house arrest for his crimes, has managed to sell the list for $3 million. Meanwhile, Annie has finally become pregnant. While the group (including an inept Gary) are continuing their game night, men with guns get ready to storm the building.

During the lawsuit, Dave seeks the help of his estranged brother, attorney Pearce Hill, who tries to explain to Dave that it is not a case worth fighting for.

Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle
 Following the events of ''[[Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters]]'', the Aratrum is unable to contact Haruo and the rest after their encounter with the original Godzilla. The Captain orders that if drones do not find survivors by forty-eight hours, the Aratrum will withdraw from Earth.  Haruo Sakaki is rescued by a native girl named Miana. She belongs to an indigenous tribe called the "Houtua", surviving descendants of the humans left behind. The Houtua recover Haruo's surviving team and hold them for questioning. Miana and her twin sister Maina use telepathy to communicate with their guests to understand their reasons for burning their lands during their earlier landing and battle against Godzilla.  After the Houtua realize the group was after Godzilla, the twins inform Haruo that their god was destroyed by Godzilla and left behind an egg. With an understanding that Haruo is waging war against Godzilla and not the Houtua, they are released, but the twins accompany them as both protective guides and observers. The group are attacked by a swarm of wormlike creatures, but they are able to fight them off with the twins' help. During the fight, Galu-Gu realizes that the twins' arrowheads are laced with "nanometal", a remnant of [[Mechagodzilla]]. They are then attacked by a pack of Servums, but Metphies arrives with some other survivors and drives them off.  Galu-Gu explains that the nanotechnology that built Mechagodzilla somehow survived and in the past 20,000 years, it has steadily self-replicated and expanded itself. With this fact, the Bilusaludo tell Haruo and the rest that they can win against Godzilla with the nanometal, which prompts Haruo and the rest of the crew to remain on Earth and continue the original plan to defeat Godzilla. Tracing the source of an energy signature they detected, they discover the nano-materials have rebuilt the former facility that held Mechagodzilla, which Galu-Gu dubs as "Mechagodzilla City".   The twins part ways, but warn Haruo that the nanometal is toxic; the Bilusaludo assure the group that the technology is harmless to them. The team soon discovers that even though Mechagodzilla was destroyed, half of its head survived and has reconstructed and expanded the original facility it was held in. Galu-Gu manages to gain access to Mechagodzilla's surviving brain and has it build all necessary materials for them to use in order to trap Godzilla within the city, then cover it with nanometal, before finishing it off with EMP harpoons.   Godzilla awakens and quickly advances on the city, which forces Galu-Gu to sacrifice the city's defenses in order to increase time to finish building the harpoon. Haruo, Yuko, and Belu-be battle Godzilla with aerial Vulture suits in order to slow it down. The trio managed to hold Godzilla long enough for the city to complete its construction and proceed to lure Godzilla into the trap. Godzilla survives the attack and begins overheating the facility. Galu-Gu refuses to lose and decides to execute nanometal fusion, where the humans and Bilusaludo will fuse with the city to become a greater weapon to destroy Godzilla.   While the remaining Bilusaludo embrace the fusion, the humans are appalled by the decision and escape for safety. The three Vultures begin to fuse with their pilots, against Yuko's will. Metphies warns Haruo that if it is not stopped, Mechagodzilla City will consume the entire planet. Galu-Gu argues that in order to defeat Godzilla, they must become greater than humanity. Haruo is conflicted, but ultimately chooses to win the battle with his humanity intact. He turns his guns on the city's command center and destroys it along with Galu-Gu, which deactivates the nanometal but sets Godzilla free, who proceeds to destroy the city. Haruo tends to Yuko, who is unable to wake from her comatose state, while the surviving humans hide in a cave with Metphies as everything burns around them.  In a [[post-credits scene]] that flashes back to an earlier scene, Metphies explains to Haruo that another monster, far more powerful than Godzilla, destroyed his planet, and reveals that the monster's name is "[[King Ghidorah|Ghidorah]]".  
Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum
  Two teenage boys are recording their exploration of the abandoned Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital, where rumour states that the director of the hospital killed all of the patients and went missing. The two head to Room 402, the intensive care unit, which no one has opened before. They try to open the door but suddenly hear a ping pong ball. Their broadcast abruptly ends. After seeing news of the teenagers' disappearance, Ha-Joon, the owner of [[YouTube]] channel "Horror Times", decides to explore the building as well.  Ha-Joon gets together a group of six people: three girls; Ah-Yeon, Charlotte, a [[Korean Americans|Korean-American]] and Ji-Hyun, and three boys; Sung-Hoon, Seung-Wook and Je-Yoon. They will do a live broadcast of their exploration of the hospital with a goal of reaching one million viewers.  The group travels to the hospital and set ups their equipment. Ha-Joon stays at their base camp off the road to control the broadcast. The rest of the group find some underwear and tie it to a tree as a marker. Upon breaking in, Charlotte pours holy water in a small [[petri dish]] to record its reactions. In the director's office, they find a group photo with all the patients and staff. Ji-Hyun and Charlotte explore the laboratory, where they find a doll. The team performs a ritual to 'invite' the spirit out but become terrified when the strings with bells that they had set up start to shake. However, it is revealed to have been staged by Seung-Wook and Sung-Hoon, unbeknownst to the other four, as a way to attract more viewers. Going back to the lab, Charlotte and Ji-Hyun are shocked to find that the doll has moved. The group discover it is the same doll held by one of the patients in the group photo.  Je-Yoon and Ah-Yeon try to open the door to Room 402, while the other four explore the "Group Treatment Room," seeing many strange [[coffins]]. Seung-Wook puts his hand inside a hole in a coffin and fakes his hand being pulled. However, when Ji-Hyun tries the same, her hand is actually pulled and wounded with claw-like scratches. The group, terrified, flees. Too disturbed, Ji-Hyun and Charlotte decide to leave. Ha-Joon reviews footage of all six participants standing together and becomes unsure who filmed it if all six are in the shot.   Charlotte and Ji-Hyun walk back to the base camp but end up caught in an illusion as they encounter the underwear marker more than once. Ji-Hyun goes into a trance. Suddenly, her eyes open with black [[sclera]]. Charlotte realises she is in Room 402. Ji-Hyun is in a corner with the doll from the lab by her feet. A naked man appears in front of her and Charlotte is attacked and pulled into the darkness.   Seung-Wook and Sung-Hoon see a wheelchair pushing itself in the basement. Everything in the room begins to float, and both boys are knocked out. Regaining consciousness, Sung-Hoon runs to Je-Yoon and Ah-Yeon, who are still drilling to open the door to 402. Suddenly, a ping-pong ball bounces towards them and Charlotte's screaming is heard from inside 402. The infra-red cameras starts to flash as the sensor detects a presence. The door of 402 opens and the screen goes dark.  Sung-Hoon, Je-Yoon and Ah-Yeon find themselves trapped in a dark room with no exit, standing in knee-deep water. Numerous ghosts appear; the three panic until they are possessed one after the other and swallowed by the darkness. Ha-Joon, after losing contact with his team, goes to investigate. He brings a [[drone]] and flies it upwards, seeing someone in the window. However, he realises it was an illusion. The person in the window was himself. He turns to see the director's body floating as if hanged. Ha-Joon is then strangled to death. The live broadcast fails with viewers dropping and claiming the broadcast was fake.  Regaining consciousness, Seung-Wook finds himself strapped to a wheelchair. The wheelchair slowly rolls to Room 402 by itself, and Seung-Wook cries out for his teammates. He sees various ghosts and hears gibberish before he is pulled into 402.  In the epilogue, the dish of holy water starts to boil, implying holy water has the effect to repel ghosts.  
Gogol. Viy
 After the events of the first film, Nikolai Gogol finds a case: among the things of Yakov Petrovich Guro is a secret file on himself with a postscript: ''"Mystery of birth — dark?"''. Five brothers of Gogol died at birth or soon after birth; later, in the visions of Nikolai and the memories of Yakim (who does not dare to reveal the truth to the gentleman), Vasily Gogol-Yanovsky accepts from despair the offer of a stranger with a bandage on his face, covering his nose. The stranger promises that the baby will survive, but payment for this will be an agreement with certain forces; Vasily replies that he is ready for anything, just to not bury his children anymore. When Nikolai is born, the stranger revives the stillborn baby.  ===Chapter Three. Enchanted place=== In the morning, foreign sorcerer Basavryuk arrives in Dikanka: local people know him and are afraid, because he is famed as a hunter for the souls of Christians. However, there are no grounds for his arrest, and the priest warns Gogol to stay away from him.  When the next girl disappears in Dikanka (Darina) and her search leads to nothing, Gogol notices in Guro's notes a list of dates - church holidays and one victim of the Dark Horseman corresponds to each holiday. In attempts to find Darina, Gogol tries to learn how to control her gift and sees a red flower in the "den of the beast." Not knowing how to interpret the vision, he finally accepts Oksana's help; her condition - Nikolai must belong to her. The flower turns out to be a blossom, blooming once a year, where the magic of gold is hidden. It's only the innocent soul that can break it and get hold of the treasure if it spills the blood of another innocent.  "The lair of the beast" is the Bear's ravine, which the locals pass by, believing that this is a damned land. In the visions, Nikolai foresees that there will be a murder, and an unknown girl asks him a question: ''"Maybe you are my betrothed?"''. Taking the gun, Gogol goes there at night, but instead of the Horseman, Darina is brought there by the sorcerer. He proposes the fiancé of Darina's sister to shed blood so that he will receive gold (and become rich to marry), and the sorcerer will take his soul. When he agrees, Nikolai, unable to dissuade the villains, kills him, and the sorcerer disappears. Wounded Darina is saved Dr. Leopold Bomgart who exerts great efforts: although he has committed to operate on the living after he failed to save a child in the past, the doctor finds the courage to try again and he succeeds.  However, it is impossible to prevent the killing of the new victim of the Horseman: she is the second girl from visions. Nothing is left for Gogol, Bomgart, Yakim, blacksmith Vakula and investigator Binh, except to wait for the next holiday.  ===Chapter Four. Viy=== On a new holiday, Gogol advises Binh to urge residents of Dikanka not to leave the houses at night. Although the night passes without new victims, the next morning seven houses are marked with the sign of the Horseman. What's unusual is that they also marked the Danishevskys' house, although the Dark Horseman had never touched noblemen before and killed only peasants. Not seeing other options, Nikolai suggests to hide all the girls from the labeled houses in a secret place under the protection of the Cossacks. This proposal does not find support from Binh, since he begins to suspect Gogol of having links to the murderer. Danishevsky also rudely rejects the proposal to take Lisa with him.  Thanks to the little daughter of the blacksmith Vakula, Gogol guesses that the signs on the houses were put by the witch from the village (the signs were painted with the blood of a dog, and in her house the girl saw a dead dog). However, the witch can not be interrogated: she is stabbed by a stranger with an aspen stake, who runs away when Nikolai appears. Waking up at the scene of the murder, Gogol falls under the suspicion of Binh (no one except him saw the killer) and finds on the floor the spell he wrote in Latin.  After studying the evidence and weapons of a stranger (Oksana, scarcely seeing him, says in horror that this is an aspen from the holy land, conspired against the evil forces), Nikolai comes to the conclusion that the murderer intended to perform a ritual over the body, but did not have time to complete it, which means that he will try to finish the deed later. The murderer is really ambushed in a shed, where the witch's body lies; it turns out to be the wandering exorcist Homa Brutus. He arrived in Dikanka to fight again with the demon Viy, and the witch needed him as a bait. Making sure that Gogol is not a murderer, Binh gives the go-ahead to hide the girls.  Khoma, escaping from imprisonment, takes Gogol hostage and asks him to help him defeat Viy: he simply does not have enough strength alone, and only a man with a dark gift strong enough that the spell that casts out the demon would work. Locked in a church with a witch's body and drawing a circle, Homa waits until Viy arrives, but dies. Gogol reads the spell himself, why Viy disappears, but Nikolai himself falls dead.  At night, the Dark Horseman finds a secret place (abandoned farm) and kills all Cossacks and girls inside it. Arriving at the site, Binh and Vakula conclude that someone had revealed the location of the shelter to the Horseman, which only four knew: Binh himself, his assistant (scribe Tesak), Gogol and Alexei Danishevsky. The first thing Binh decides to arrest and interrogate Gogol, but finds him in the church without signs of life.  ''The film ends with scenes from the sequel, "[[Terrible Revenge]]": the return of Yakov Petrovich Guro, the funeral of Gogol and the battle with the Dark Horseman.''  
Gogol. Terrible Revenge
 Two hundred years ago the Little Russian villages were ravaged by a gang of non-Christians, the Lyakhs, led by a powerful sorcerer.  Since then, unknown in the vicinity of Dikanka is the unknown Black Horseman, catches young girls and cruelly punishes them, as if taking revenge for what.  And Lisa may become his next victim.  To save her beloved, scribe Nikolai Gogol must break evil spells and defeat the ancient curse.  None of the mortals have yet succeeded in this, but fortunately, the genial metropolitan detective Yakov Guro comes to the aid of Gogol, and he already has the main suspect.

Harold, as it turns out, has convinced brothers Ronaldo and Ernesto to pose as his kidnappers in an extortion plan in which he calls Richard pretending to be kidnapped in exchange for a hefty ransom. To fix the situation, Richard calls his brother Mitch, a mercenary, to find Harold and bring him home.  Harold spends the evening getting drunk at a bar, believing his scheme to have failed. The bartender, it turns out, is in league with the cartel, and he alerts them when he recognizes Harold. Two men show up and take Harold away, but, during the drive to Villegas, Harold manages to shoot the driver of the vehicle with one of the other men’s guns resulting in the vehicle crashing off-road.  In the morning, Harold is rescued by Sunny and Miles, the latter of whom is in Mexico to serve as a drug mule for the Cartel. The couple take Harold back to a motel where all three happened to have been staying. Soon, Ronaldo and Ernesto, who have been bribed by the Cartel into helping them find Harold, attempt to kidnap Harold. However, Mitch shows up and knocks the brothers unconscious and takes Harold with him. Mitch takes Harold to the airport to return him to Promethium, but he runs away, believing himself to be kidnapped again. Mitch manages to catch up with him and injects him with a [[Microchip implant (human)|tracker]] to know where he is at all times. Mitch makes a deal with Harold to attempt to extort Richard for a larger sum of money for Harold's return. When Mitch calls Richard to make that deal, Richard tells him that the company is planning to collect a life insurance claim on Harold if he were to end up dead, a sum of which Mitch would receive. Mitch reluctantly agrees to take him up on that offer.  Harold and Mitch are spotted by Ronaldo and Ernesto as they walk the streets of Mexico. Mitch attempts to kill Harold but cannot bring himself to do it as he has grown fond of the guy. He is then struck by a car driven by the brothers, who take Harold with them to Villegas, and are then executed by the kingpin. Villegas tells Harold that he only wants Harold to access the drug company's vault in the Mexican company in order to take a surplus of the weed pill. A huge shootout at the company occurs when the police arrive.  Harold gets away when Angel, Harold’s friend who worked for the cartel as well as the Mexican manufacturing company, reveals himself to be an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]] agent that infiltrated Villegas's gang. They are chased by members of the cartel, who run them off the road. Angel is shot and injured and, as Harold is about to be executed by a Cartel member, Mitch arrives and saves his life only to be shot in the head himself following the act.   In the aftermath, Villegas and his men are all arrested and Harold is falsely declared dead. Richard is arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison, and Elaine takes over the company. Harold stays in Mexico, having nothing to return to in the States, and opens up a bar by the beach.

The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (film)
  In 1941, a group of four English people, two men and two women, are walking at nighttime in occupied Guernsey. They are stopped by Germans for breaching curfew. When asked for their reason, one of the women notices a book in the pocket of one of the Germans and says that they were at a book group. Collectively, they make up the book group's name, the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and avoid arrest when one of the men throws up on the soldiers' boots.  Five years later, in January 1946, author Juliet Ashton is on a cross-country tour across [[England]] to promote her latest book, written under her [[pen name]] [[Isaac Bickerstaff|Izzy Bickerstaff]]. She has just been contracted, through her publisher, Sidney Stark, to write stories for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' about the benefits of literature. Juliet does not have a permanent residence after her home with her parents was bombed during the war. She has a wealthy American boyfriend, Mark, who gives her enormous quantities of high quality flowers. She dresses up for a night out with him but does not enjoy it, appearing to feel uncomfortable about celebrating so soon after the war.  Juliet receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a man from [[Guernsey]] who has come into possession of her copy of ''[[Essays of Elia]]'' and who wants to know about where to find a bookshop in England to buy another book by the same author, [[Charles Lamb]]. He tells her that he is part of ''The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'', which meets each Friday after having been created as a cover for residents breaking [[curfew]] during the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of Guernsey]]. Juliet sends another book by Lamb and [[Mary Lamb|his sister]], ''[[Tales from Shakespeare]]''. She asks for more information about the society and how it came into being.  Juliet decides that she would like to write about the society and arranges immediate passage to the island. Mark proposes with a very expensive ring before Juliet embarks on the ferry. She accepts and wears the ring for the journey. On arrival at Guernsey, Juliet arranges accommodation with Charlotte Stimple then attends the meeting of the Society where she is treated as a great celebrity by four of the original members, Dawsey Adams, Amelia Maugery, Isola Pribbey and Eben Ramsey. Eben's young grandson, Eli, is a fifth member. Knowing, from Dawsey's letters, that Elizabeth McKenna was the founder of the Society, Juliet asks as to her whereabouts and is told that she is overseas.  After sampling a piece of Eben's Potato Peel Pie and a glass of Isola's gin, and hearing stories about the group's activities during the war, including the way Dawsey found her old book in which she had printed her name and address, Juliet lets slip that she is planning to write a book about the Society. All members of the group react negatively, saying that they will not allow this. At the end of the night, a small child runs into the room and calls Dawsey 'Daddy'. Juliet is told that she is Elizabeth's daughter, Kit.  Instead of returning home at the end of the weekend, Juliet remains in Guernsey to conduct research telling the group members that she will not write about them but about the German occupation. Over the following days, various members start to open up about the situation with Elizabeth, and Juliet discovers that she was arrested by the Germans and sent to the continent. They are still hoping that she will return home. Juliet rings Mark, who is in the armed forces, and asks him to try to locate Elizabeth, and continues her research, also assisting with looking after Kit. After reading some of the work that Juliet wrote about the Society, Stimple tells her that she has been misled by the Society and that Elizabeth was no saint, hinting that Elizabeth was putting it out to the Germans to get luxuries. Juliet asks Dawsey who confirms that he is not actually Kit's father, but the father was a German doctor, Christian Hellman, who worked with Elizabeth at the local hospital. He had been sent back to the continent but his ship had been sunk in transit and he was killed. Amelia later indicates that the Society has been keeping it quiet because they fear Christian's parents finding out about Kit and taking her away.  One day, Mark arrives out of the blue and sees Juliet talking to Dawsey. It is clear that they are close. He also notices that Juliet is not wearing her engagement ring. After talking about this, Mark pulls out an envelope with information about Elizabeth. Juliet arranges for the Society to meet and tells them that Elizabeth was in the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. A witness reported that, after trying to protect a fellow prisoner, she was shot.  Juliet and Mark leave the island and return to London but she is unable to settle back into her previous life. She breaks up with Mark then starts writing about the Society. When her manuscript is finished she gives a copy to her publisher and posts a copy to the Society. Dawsey reads her letter out loud to the group and realises that Juliet has broken up with Mark and he has a chance with her. He immediately arranges for the group to look after Kit and gets on the ferry to London. At the same time, Juliet arranges to return to Guernsey. She is embarking on the ferry when she notices Dawsey has just disembarked and is on the wharf. She calls to him, then runs after him. Dawsey tells her he is there to see her and has written a letter to her so he doesn't forget what he wants to say. Juliet jumps in and asks him to marry her. He agrees.  Some time later, Dawsey is reading to Kit with Juliet next to him, both Dawsey and Juliet wearing wedding rings.

 In hell, the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite]] [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] and the Auditor of the Stygian Inquisition ([[Gary J. Tunnicliffe]]) are discussing how to adapt their methods of harvesting souls in the face of advancing human technology which is making the Configurations (gateways to hell) obsolete. On earth, three detectives &ndash; brothers Sean and David Carter ([[Randy Wayne]]) and Christine Egerton &ndash; investigate a [[serial killer]] known as the Preceptor, whose murders are based on the [[Ten Commandments]].  A connection with one of the victims leads the detectives to Karl Watkins, a local criminal who went missing near the abandoned house at 55 Ludovico Place. Sean goes to the house and loses consciousness, waking up in the Stygian Inquisition's domain in hell. As the Inquisition prepares to hand down a verdict on Sean for his sins, the angel [[Jophiel]] intervenes and tells them to release him. Sean escapes the realm with a stolen puzzle box, and the Auditor requests Pinhead's guidance on the matter. Sean and his brother return to search the house, finding no trace of hell or the Inquisition. That night he is haunted by visions of the Cenobites and hell's denizens, who promise "judgment and redemption" to anyone who opens the box.  Sean and Egerton go to the coroner's office and find that a [[cell phone]] of one of the Preceptor's victims was stored in her body, recording her final location with its [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. They find the Preceptor's hideout, where Sean incapacitates Egerton and reveals himself as the killer. David deduces the Preceptor's identity and meets with the coroner to find the building. Sean disarms David and summons his wife, Alison ([[Rheagan Wallace]]), outraged that she had a secret affair. He forces the two of them to open the box at gunpoint, summoning the Cenobites and opening a gateway to their realm.  Aware that someone from hell would come to collect his soul after his initial escape, Sean attempts to offer Alison and David to Pinhead. Pinhead tells him that Alison and David will be dealt with for opening the box but, because a separate faction of hell wanted his soul, no deal will be made. The Auditor appears, telling Sean that the Inquisition has found him guilty of his sins. Jophiel intervenes again and tells Pinhead and the Auditor that Sean is part of [[heaven]]'s plan to instill fear into sinners. Pinhead arranges for Sean to be killed by Egerton, and spitefully dispatches Jophiel. As punishment, [[God]] expels Pinhead from hell and forces him to walk the earth as a mortal man. In a [[post-credits scene]], a group of [[Christian]] missionaries approach a house and is captured by the Stygian Inquisition.  
Hichki

Her condition causes her to make uncontrollable sounds likened to hiccups. Although she has been unsuccessful for the past 5 years in landing a teaching job, she is supported in her ambitions by her mother ([[Supriya Pilgaonkar]]) and her younger brother ([[Hussain Dalal]]). It is revealed that her father ([[Sachin Pilgaonkar]]) divorced her mother several years earlier, which is why Naina's relationship with him is strained.  One day, Naina receives an offer to teach at the prestigious St. Notker's School, a job which she had applied to 5 times before. When asked why she was so persistent for the particular school, Naina explains that she herself graduated from St. Notker's and was inspired by Mr. Khan ([[Vikram Gokhale]]), a former principal. He had believed in her and announced that she would never be expelled for being different. Naina's unwavering confidence impresses the current school committee and they assign her to 9F, a new class section. It is revealed that the school was desperate to hire her as all other teachers had failed to get the class to cooperate. Naina notices that the students are unruly, misbehaved and are visibly different. Shyamlal, the school's [[peon]] ([[Asif Basra]]), discloses to her that the 9F students belong to families from a nearby [[slum]] and that they were given admission to fill the government-prescribed quota for the underprivileged.  On the first day of class, Naina's students imitate her sounds and mock her. She decides to teach them in an interactive way, determined to show resilience when dealing with the class. The students prank her with liquid nitrogen and this causes a mild explosion that shatters the classroom windows. Naina prevents the class from being expelled by taking the blame and saying that it was a badly executed chemistry example. Mr. Wadia ([[Neeraj Kabi]]), the teacher of class 9A, strongly dislikes the 9F students. His class is composed of student [[prefect]]s, who are academically excellent. Naina challenges Mr. Wadia that students from 9F will earn prefect badges as well.  The school's annual Science Fair project is assigned to 9A, who are prevented from mingling with 9F by Mr. Wadia. They yearn to experience the interactive experiments that 9F gets to partake in but Mr. Wadia dismisses them as inferior to textbook learning. Meanwhile, 9F warms up to Naina and begin wholeheartedly participating in class; she teaches them to be brave in their pursuit of knowledge and helps them realize their individual strengths. Aatish ([[Harsh Mayar]]), the sole student who remains cold towards Naina, secretly sabotages 9A's project in his vengeance. This is discovered by Mr. Wadia and the Principal ([[Shivkumar Subramaniam]]) decides to expel 9F. Once again, Naina prevents this by promising that the class will pass their final exams, but she is unable to prevent their suspension from attending school till the exams. Dejected, she tells her students that they have shattered her attempt to help them. Aatish's classmates help him realize his mistake and he publicly expresses regret.  All of 9F studies diligently for their exams. Shyamlal supplies Aatish copies of the wrong question paper so they would fail, but when he presents them to his classmates, they refuse to cheat and he gives up on the idea as well. Exam results prove Naina's promise as the 9F students pass successfully. However, the class is accused of cheating as Shyamlal confesses to supplying question papers, and the Principal decides to publicly expel them during the prefect pinning ceremony. Prior to the event, one of Mr. Wadia's students reveals that he bribed Shyamlal into supplying the wrong question papers, and he realizes that 9F did not cheat. Mr. Wadia takes to the stage and announces the he, himself, wrongfully tried to fail the students. He then applauds Naina's transformative teaching and asks her to pin the prefect badge to her students who ranked first. She later tells him that she doubts that he bribed Shyamlal. Mr. Wadia smiles and says that he doubts she caused a liquid nitrogen explosion. With the combined efforts of 9A and 9F, the Science Fair project is rebuilt and wins the competition.  The film shows Naina's last day at St. Notker's where she has served for 25 years and has been Principal. As she walks out of the school, the school's students bid farewell. The last to happily bid her adieu are the students of 9F who are now successful adults.

Joan, other coven members and the headless corpses of his mother and grandmother bow to him.

Hotel Artemis
    On June 21, 2028, a riot breaks out in Los Angeles, centred around the privatisation of water, and the lack of everyday folk being able to afford and access it. Taking advantage of the distraction the riot provides, a four-man crew (brothers Sherman and Lev, and miscreants Buke and P-22) rob a bank. Unable to break into the vault, they resort to stealing the belongings of the hostages, correctly deducing that, with the rioting outside, the wealthy will have sent their staff and hired help (being the people the crew has already taken hostage) to deposit their valuables in the bank's vault.  In other words, they don't need to break into the vault, as many of the valuables are with the hostages already. Lev takes a male hostage's fancy pen despite being warned by the man not to. They attempt to escape and run into some cops whom they manage to kill. P-22 is killed and Buke and Lev are critically wounded. Sherman makes a phone call to Jean "the Nurse" Thomas who runs the nearby Hotel Artemis, a hotel/hospital that only treats criminals, and has been running for 22 years. Artemis only takes in paid-up members, and whilst Sherman and Lev are allowed in, Buke is a non-member, and is kicked out by Everest, the Nurse's assistant.  At the Hotel are two other guests.  Code names for all guests are assigned based on the suite they are occupying. Sherman is code-named Waikiki, and Lev is code-named Honolulu. The other guests are code-named Acapulco (a racist, misogynist, elitist arms dealer), and Nice (an assassin and Waikiki's former lover who has deliberately injured herself to get close to a target she knows will be coming to the Artemis). The Nurse gets word from criminal Crosby Franklin that his father Orion Franklin (aka "The Wolf King", owner of the Artemis and Criminal Kingpin of Los Angeles), is en route and in need of immediate medical attention. Meanwhile, Waikiki catches up with Nice, who has moved on to work internationally while Waikiki has remained Stateside. When he reveals the pen his brother stole during the robbery, Nice explains that the pen is a mobile safe, and unlocks it to show it contains precious diamonds, saying they belong to the Wolf King, and reminding Waikiki that the Wolf King kills anybody who steals from him. To make matters worse, a wounded police officer named Morgan arrives outside begging for medical attention from Thomas. Against Everest's warnings, Thomas ventures outside to bring Morgan in, but before they can get back inside, they are set upon by a group of rioters, and then the police. They are saved by an intervention from Everest. The Artemis does not help police, so Everest asks why Thomas has saved Morgan, and Thomas responds that she knew the officer "from before" which is why she is willing to break her own rules (the Artemis' regular lawbreaking customers will not go to a place where the police are allowed).  Thomas had a son named Beau who was close friends with Morgan when they were younger. Beau ended up dying of an apparent drug overdose, leading to Thomas' alcoholism and losing her license to practice medicine, which in turn forced her to run the Hotel Artemis where, over the last 22 years, she has developed severe [[agoraphobia]]. Acapulco calls for a private helicopter to pick him up and, whilst waiting for it to arrive on the roof of the Artemis, he runs into Nice who beats him severely after revealing her target is the Wolf King himself. She then places a bomb on the building's generator. As Wolf King, Franklin, and their men show up, Everest secretly leads Morgan out of the building while Waikiki 3D prints a gun for protection. Due to the hotel's rules, Thomas only takes in Wolf King and leaves Crosby and his men in the lobby, after disarming them. The Wolf King leaves Crosby with a signet ring in case he doesn't survive the medical procedures he is about to go through, and is given the additional code name "Niagara" because he is assigned the Niagara Suite in the hotel.  Whilst under anesthesia, the Wolf King inadvertently mentions the name of Thomas' son, which she had never told him. Suspecting him of being involved in her son's death, she raises the level of drugs in his system, forcing him to reveal that Beau did not die of an overdose, but was killed for stealing his prized Porsche 911. Overcome with rage, Thomas prepares to kill him, but is distracted by the bomb blowing out the generator. This causes Honolulu's life support to turn off and frightens Acapulco's helicopter away. Nice sneaks in and kills Wolf King while Thomas is attempting to save Honolulu. Thomas is unable to save his life. Waikiki confronts Nice over Honolulu's death, saying she must have known that blowing out the generator would have terminated his life support, but before they get into it, they are both attacked by Acapulco. In the ensuing fight, Acapulco is killed by Waikiki, but not before being injured by gunfire. Crosby realises the ring Niagara gave him is able to partially blow the security in the hotel lobby, and he and his men start to break their way into the hotel proper. With no other options, Waikiki and Nice decide to take Thomas and flee the Artemis. They run into Everest who pleads with his boss to leave and let him take care of things. Once at the elevator, Nice sends them down and accepts her lot in life as an assassin, asking Thomas to tell a now unconscious Waikiki why she did it. Nice and Everest take on multiple henchmen of The Wolf King in two separate parts of the hotel.  Thomas tends to Waikiki in the lift on the way down, but they are confronted by Crosby whilst leaving the hotel. Waikiki offers him the pen and the millions of dollars in jewels it contains in exchange for their freedom, and he accepts it as trade for Waikiki's freedom, but refuses to let Thomas go, holding her accountable for the death of Niagara. A weakened Waikiki and Crosby fight briefly before Thomas stabs Crosby with a baby elephant tranquilizer, killing him. Leaving the hotel, Thomas overcomes her agoraphobia, and gets a sense of relief despite the ongoing riot. Once at Waikiki's car he prepares for them both to leave, but Thomas chooses to stay as she still feels a desire to help those who need it, implying that she will perhaps open the Artemis (or some other facility) to others now that Niagara and Crosby are dead. Waikiki thanks Thomas and leaves to get help at another hospital in Las Vegas. Everest, having triumphed in his fight, puts on his nursing badge and turns on the Hotel Artemis' sign as Thomas is seen walking through the city.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], a shadowy figure runs across the screen, suggesting Nice may have survived.

Iravukku Aayiram Kangal

Bharath is a fan of writer Vyjayanthi([[Lakshmy Ramakrishnan]]) and one time when she comes in his cab, Bharath finds her noticing a man and his bike. She says that her late husband had exactly the same bike and he died under mysterious circumstances, so she is doing a private investigation on his death. One evening while Suseela returns from a wedding in a cab, the driver tries to kidnap and misbehave with her. A young man Ganesh([[Ajmal Ameer|Ajmal]])helps her on time and chases the cab driver away. Suseela thanks him and goes home but she finds that Ganesh has missed his pen drive and tries to return it to him. When they meet again, she realizes that Ganesh is no gentleman either when he tries to pursue her inappropriately. When Ganesh finds that Suseela is in love with Bharath, he becomes possessive and warns her to cut off all ties with Bharath and come to him instead. That night Suseela meets Bharath and tells all the problems that Ganesh had created, but they find one of Suseela's client Roopala([[Chaya Singh]]) trying to drown herself in the ocean. They save her and she tells about her problems with her abusive husband Vasanth([[John Vijay]]) and in addition to her woes, she connected with a wrong person who had tricked her into unconsciousness and filmed her nude and is now blackmailing her for money. They find out that the person is none other than Ganesh. So, Bharath goes after him and notices that he owns the same bike that writer Vyjayanthi had mentioned.  Meanwhile, a retired businessman Murugesan([[Anandaraj]]), tries to find female escorts and falls into Ganesh's trap and loses money and jewels. It is then revealed that Ganesh is a conman who operates along with two women Anitha([[Vidya Pradeep]]) and Maya([[Suja Varunee]]) and their main job is to cheat wealthy people and do money extortion by blackmailing them. Murugesan follows Ganesh and finds his address with the help of a man Narain Vaidyanathan([[Aadukalam Naren]]) who gives Murugesan a ride by chance. The very same night, Bharath also happens to find Ganesh's address and follows him to his house to retrieve Roopala's video and to warn him to stay away from Suseela. Murugesan coincidentally goes into Ganesh's house at the same time to get back his stolen money and jewelry. As a result, Bharath spots Murugesan walking past him when he is about to enter. A neighbor notices these men loitering near the house and reports this to the police. When the police arrive to investigate, they learn that Maya is murdered inside the house and immediately Bharath is identified as a suspect. Bharath escapes from the police and assumes that Murugesan is the killer and corners him but the latter reveals that he did not kill her and she was already dead when he went inside the house and in his panic and confusion, he picked up the murder weapon by mistake and left his own gun there. Bharath finds that the car that Ganesh and Anitha used to con Murugesan actually belonged to Narain Vaidyanathan. But when asked, Narain reveals that he is also a victim of Ganesh and his gang. Maya had befriended him in Facebook and they were in a relationship when Ganesh entered and threatened both of them at gun point and stole his money and car, but the police found the car alone and returned it to him. He had been thinking that Maya disappeared from his life, but he saw her with Ganesh on the day Murugesan asked him for a lift. Unable to bear Maya's betrayal, he goes to her house to kill her exactly on the same day as Bharath and Murugesan. But he also found that Maya was already dead and that a different man was leaving the house when he entered. So Bharath looks for the man who left the house and finds that it is Roopala's husband Vasanth. Vasanth had been having an affair with Anitha and Ganesh had filmed them together and blackmailed him for money. When Vasanth finds that Anitha was part of the scam, he is enraged but Ganesh beats him up. So Vasanth goes to her house to kill them both and exits the place minutes before Narain enters.  When Ganesh blackmails Vasanth about his video with Anitha, he really doesn't care much about it. So Ganesh blackmails him with Roopala's nude video instead and Vasanth agrees to give money. Bharath follows Vasanth as he goes to Ganesh and a fight ensues between them where Anitha and Ganesh are killed. Then Bharath tells Vasanth that the entire plan to extort money from him was made by his wife Roopala. She wanted to separate from Vasanth because of his abusive behavior but she also wanted to get a lot of money from him. So she approached Anitha and Ganesh to help her make a compromising video of Vasanth and blackmail him and that she would pay them for their work. Ganesh being a big time conman, wanted to double cross Roopala's plan and take the whole money for himself. In order to tackle Roopala, he makes a nude video of her with Anitha's help and shuts her off. Because of her inability to act against both Vasanth and Ganesh, she tries to commit suicide when Bharath and Suseela save her.  In a turn of events, Ganesh and Anitha alone plan to join together and leave Maya out so that the number of shares will just be two. Maya comes to know of this and when she threatens them, Ganesh kills her and gets rid off her once and for all. It is during this time when all four men - Bharath, Murugesan, Narain and Vasanth coincidentally enter the scene of crime and become suspects unwittingly.  Roopala and Vasanth are arrested for the whole conspiracy and Bharath is released and he marries Suseela. It is here that a major twist arrives in the form of writer Vyjayanthi who has been following Maya's murder closely. She calls Bharath requesting his permission to write a book based on this event and tells that she made few changes in the plot. Bharath is shocked by that and Vyjayanthi narrates the changed plot where, in his desperate desire for Suseela, Ganesh films her also nude and threatens her. When Bharath comes to know of this in addition to Roopala's video, he decides to confront Ganesh and erase both the videos. Meanwhile, Maya comes to know that Ganesh is after Suseela when he is already seeing Anitha, so she also does her part in threatening Ganesh to split the shares into three instead of two and if he fails to do so, she will tell Anitha about Suseela. When Bharath and Suseela go to Ganesh's house to erase the videos, Maya tries to attack Bharath, and Suseela ends up killing Maya. They erase the videos and leave the crime scene that day. When Bharath finds that Murugesan had taken the murder weapon by mistake, he gets it from him and plants it in Ganesh's car and frames him for Maya's murder. This is Vyjayanthi's version of the plot but Bharath refuses to agree to it and requests her to find an alternative. Later, it is shown that when Bharath visits Vyjayanthi, he finds that she is also murdered, implying that Vyjayanthi's version of the story may be true and it is left to the audience as to who is Vyjayanthi's murderer.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
  Shortly after the events of ''[[Jurassic World]]'',<ref></ref><ref></ref> a small team of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] arrives on the abandoned [[Isla Nublar]] to collect [[DNA]] from the remains of the ''[[List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series#Indominus_rex|Indominus rex]]'' at the bottom of the park's [[lagoon]]. After successfully collecting a bone fragment, the team's survivors barely escape the island following attacks by the ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.   Three years later in 2018, a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] hearing in [[Washington, D.C.]] debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Ian Malcolm|Dr. Ian Malcolm]] testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond's]] mistake of [[cloning]] them. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has created the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Sir Benjamin Lockwood|Benjamin Lockwood]], summons Claire to his [[Northern California]] estate. Lockwood and his aide, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Eli Mills|Eli Mills]], reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to help reactivate the park's dinosaur [[GPS wildlife tracking|tracking system]] to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last living ''[[Velociraptor]]''. Although they are estranged, Claire recruits Jurassic World's former ''Velociraptor'' trainer and Blue's alpha, Owen Grady, to help capture her.  On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Franklin Webb|Franklin Webb]] get the [[GPS wildlife tracking|tracking system]] online. Owen, paleo-veterinarian [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Zia Rodriguez|Zia Rodriguez]], and a mercenary team led by [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Ken Wheatley|Ken Wheatley]] search for Blue. Upon finding her, the encounter escalates, resulting in a mercenary shooting Blue and Wheatley [[Sedative|tranquilizing]] Owen. The mercenaries take Zia so she can treat Blue's injury. Their ship departs for the [[Contiguous United States|U.S. mainland]] as the animals left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard in time and assist Zia in [[Blood transfusion|transfusing]] Blue with ''Tyrannosaurus'' blood. The group now realize the captured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island and are for another purpose.  Back at the estate, Lockwood's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Maisie Lockwood|Maisie]] overhears Mills and auctioneer [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Gunnar Eversol|Gunnar Eversol]] secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the [[black market]]. They will also unveil the ''[[List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series#Indoraptor|Indoraptor]]'', a new [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] dinosaur created by geneticist [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Dr. Henry Wu]] using ''Indominus rex'' and  ''Velociraptor'' DNA. Wu wants Blue's DNA to create an enhanced ''Indoraptor'', unaware that Blue's blood is contaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed [[human cloning]], ended their partnership.   The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Zia and Franklin evade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended and confined. Owen incites a ''[[Stygimoloch]]'' into breaking open their cell. They find Maisie who leads them to the auction where the ''Indoraptor'' is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the proceedings by luring the ''Stygimoloch'' into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the ''Indoraptor'' to extract a tooth as a trophy, but it feigns sedation and escapes, killing him, Eversol, and others. The ''Indoraptor'' hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia releases Blue, who attacks the ''Indoraptor'', causing it to fall through a glass roof to its death.  When a [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas leak threatens the caged animals, Maisie is unable to let them die and frees them despite Owen's warning. Mills is killed and the ''Indominus'' bone destroyed by the ''Tyrannosaurus''. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin safely get away, while Blue and the other dinosaurs escape.  In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a Neo-Jurassic Age where humans and dinosaurs must learn to coexist. The closing scenes show the freed dinosaurs roaming wilderness and outer urban areas.

Awakening in a prison in Thailand, Kurt meets Thomas Tang Moore, the mastermind behind the underground tournament where Kurt, Eric, and Tong Po have competed.

However, Moore's goons, led by Somsak, have kidnapped Liu and that night, Crawford shows Kurt a video of Liu.

When Moore offers to take Kurt out of prison and in a private facility, Kurt agrees but only if his "team" continues their training and Moore agrees. Durand goes to one of Mongkut's training sessions only to learn the fighter is a product of bioengineering by Ivy League graduate Rupert, who has developed a combination of adrenaline and steroids, thus making Mongkut virtually invincible except for one small weakness: a glass jaw.

When Mongkut comes back up, Kurt resorts to taking Mongkut down with the chain, wrapping it around his neck and choking him out, resulting in Mongkut's neck breaking.

Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash
 As [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|The Atom]] is being introduced into the [[Justice League]] they receive word that [[Joker (character)|Joker]] is invading [[Metropolis]] with the intent of poisoning the city with his Joker gas and remodeling the [[Daily Planet]]. As the Justice League arrive at Metropolis, they notice the absence of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], much to [[Batman]]'s chagrin. Meanwhile Flash is busy getting snacks across the country and catching criminals (including stopping [[Captain Cold]] from robbing a bank and stopping [[Captain Boomerang]] in a car chase) along the way and is horrified when he discovers he missed the trouble alert and by the time he arrives at Metropolis, although The Atom was able to create an antidote for the Joker Gas, Joker succeeded in redecorating the Daily Planet with his "Fun Cannon" (though Flash is able to undo this). The Justice League is upset with Flash's impulsive decisions and state that he needs to slow down and put more thought into his actions. Right at that moment, [[Eobard Thawne|a yellow, vibrating speedster]] taunts Flash for his inferior speed and a chase ensues that ends with Flash waking up in his bed the next day. After realizing how similar the events to this day are to the previous, Flash realizes he had been sent back to the morning of that day and thus is able to prevent Joker from firing his Fun Cannon. But the yellow speedster returns and taunts Flash again which results in Flash repeatedly having to chase the speedster in the form of a [[time loop]] and prevent the various crimes that occurred on that day. When Batman realizes that Flash is in a time loop he gives him advice on how to stop it, but once again the yellow speedster returns and gives Flash the chase. Following the speedster into a dimensional gateway, Flash has had enough of his taunts and pushes his own power past its maximum which results in him overtaking the speedster and breaking the loop, but at a cost.  Flash returns to Central City having unknowingly been sent five days into the future and to his surprise, the city has turned against him, his powers are gone and he has been framed for various pranks pulled on the Justice League (to the point where Batman revokes his membership). Crestfallen and depowered, Flash ponders about what to do now. At that moment, the speedster that continuously taunted him (and the true perpetrator of the pranks on the Justice League) reveals himself as the Reverse Flash, a speedster from the future who grew envious of Flash's fame in the past and traveled back in time to steal Flash's fame and purpose and plans to do the same to the rest of the Justice League. Atom, having shrunk down and followed Flash home overhears everything, but as Reverse Flash rushes off and restrains Flash, his suit short circuits, preventing him from returning to his normal size. Fortunately, Atom manages to free Flash and phone [[Doctor Fate]] in order to help the Flash regain his powers. While Flash is teleported to Doctor Fate's residence, Atom attempts to return to the Hall of Justice to reveal Reverse Flash's plan to his fellow Leaguers, which at his small size is much easier said than done. Meanwhile Reverse Flash is able to prevent crime and commit acts of heroism at a rate quicker than the Justice League can get to them. This allows Reverse Flash to gain the popularity of the public and render the Justice League obsolete.   Elsewhere, Flash finds himself at Doctor Fate's tower and is introduced to Doctor Fate and his assistant [[Zatanna]]. After Flash explains his predicament to Doctor Fate, Doctor Fate reveals that by overloading his powers, he broke his connection to the [[Speed Force]] which he proceeds to explain to the Flash. Doctor Fate and Zatanna then proceed to send Flash into the Speed Force where Flash will be placed with various trials in order to prove his worthiness of his powers. Remembering the advice of his fellow Justice Leaguers, Flash is able to complete the trials and is introduced to the Speed Force Nexus, the primary source of power in the Speed Force. Right at that moment, Reverse Flash arrives and reveals that he planned for Flash to complete the trials so that he could acquire the Nexus without having to deal with the trials himself. As Reverse Flash steals the Nexus and places it into his suit, his powers become increased exponentially and he is able to leave Flash trapped in the Speed Force.  As the Justice League face retiring, Reverse Flash arrives and using the power of the Speed Force Nexus, he is able to encase the Hall of Justice in an oversized statue of himself which is made of bricks from the Speed Force impervious to their powers. Atom is able to arrive at the Hall of Justice just as the statue is completed and with the help of [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], [[Krypto]] and the Green Lantern B'dg, he is able to repair his suit (returning him to his normal size), help the Justice League fend off the security robots Reverse Flash reprogrammed and help the Justice League escape to the Batcave. Flash also manages to return from the Speed Force by creating a vehicle out of the same material as Reverse Flash's statue.  Believing to have rightfully defeated the Justice League, Reverse Flash builds more statues of himself around multiple international landmarks and declares himself the ruler of Earth, threatening that those who disobey him will meet the same fate as the Justice League. However, to his surprise the Justice League arrive to defeat him and using the bricks Flash brought with him from the Speed Force, they are able to rival Reverse Flash's speed and destroy his statues (thus sending the bricks he used to build them back to the Speed Force) before he can prevent this, allowing Flash to steal the Speed Force Nexus from him, allowing him to not only regain his powers, but also acquire greater speed than Reverse Flash. Flash then proceeds to taunt Reverse Flash much like he did during the time loop, prompting Reverse Flash to exceed the use of his own powers, resulting in him returning to the Hall of Justice depowered and arrested by the Justice League. With his powers restored, Flash takes Reverse Flash to prison and returns the Nexus to the Speed Force in order to avoid its power from ever falling into the wrong hands again. After that, Flash is reinstated into the Justice League. Batman then reveals that he was fully aware of the time loop and the fact that Reverse Flash was responsible for the pranks pulled on the Justice League and fired Flash so that Atom could spy on him to prove him right and notify Doctor Fate. Flash is grateful for the restoration of his powers and the advice the Justice League gave him and the Justice League celebrate their victory as Doctor Fate overlooks everything.

After saying bye to Maddie, Deanna tells Dan how she's looking forward to their trip to Italy until Dan flat-out tells her he wants a divorce because he has fallen in love with another woman. To make things worse, he is selling their house since everything is under his name, meaning Deanna has to leave. Deanna angrily kicks his car and takes an Uber home.  Deanna goes to the home of her parents, Mike ([[Stephen Root]]) and Sandy ([[Jacki Weaver]]). They note that Dan was always a jerk for making Deanna drop out of her last year of college when she got pregnant, meaning she never graduated, as well as making her put up with his overbearing ways during their marriage. Mike threatens to use a gun on Dan but then almost accidentally shoots their dog.  Deanna goes to play Racquetball with her best friend Christine ([[Maya Rudolph]]). There, Deanna bemoans what's become of her life until she decides that she won't just sit around and let Dan ruin her life.  Deanna surprises Maddie in her dorm by announcing to her that she and Dan are divorcing and that she is now going to take a year at Decatur so that she can graduate and earn a degree in archaeology. Maddie is stunned by both bits of news and is left speechless.  Maddie introduces Deanna to her friends - Amanda ([[Adria Arjona]]), neurotic Debbie (Jessie Ennis), and Helen ([[Gillian Jacobs]]), who was in a coma for eight years and is now getting a chance to go to college. Deanna later meets her roommate Leonor ([[Heidi Gardner]]), who is [[agoraphobic]] and chronically depressed.  One of Deanna's first classes is an archaeology class with Helen, and her professor is a former classmate of hers named Wayne ([[Chris Parnell]]). There, Deanna also meets resident "mean girl" Jennifer ([[Debby Ryan]]) and her friend Trina (Yani Simone). They mock Deanna's mom sweater and for her laughing at Wayne's corny archaeology-related jokes.  Deanna later goes to sign the divorce papers with Christine while Dan shows up with his new fiancee Marcie ([[Julie Bowen]]). They exchange a lot of insults through the mediator.  Maddie takes Deanna to hang out with her and her friends. After being mocked by Jennifer again, Maddie gives her mom a makeover so that she can look more party-ready. Deanna meets Maddie's boyfriend Tyler ([[Jimmy O. Yang]]) and another boy named Jack ([[Luke Benward]]). After many shots and beers, Deanna and Maddie wake up the next morning mortified to see each other leaving a frat house doing the "[[walk of shame]]", which leads Maddie to realize Deanna slept with Jack.  Jack starts to constantly text Deanna since he has basically fallen in love with her. She tells him it was just a one-time thing, but they then go to the stacks in the library to have sex again.  Deanna tends to Debbie when she expresses a personal issue she is having, along with the other girls talking about their problems. Deanna encourages the girls to use their strengths to their advantage. They then go to an 80's themed party where Deanna has a dance-off with Jennifer that results in her winning and earning the respect of her schoolmates.  Deanna must do a presentation for her archaeology class, but she gets so nervous that she sweats profusely and finally ends up fainting.  Deanna goes out to dinner with Christine, her husband, and their couple friends (that they don't even like). To Deanna and Christine's dismay, Dan and Marcie show up to gloat about taking the trip to Italy. However, Deanna gets the last laugh when they see that not only is Jack their waiter, but he is also Marcie's son and Deanna gloats about sleeping with him to gross Marcie out.  On the night of Dan and Marcie's wedding, Deanna and her friends get high off [[Cannabis edible#Baked good|chocolate bark laced with weed]], and they head to the reception. Deanna is initially ready to make peace with Dan until they see posters outside that are basically saying Dan did better than Deanna by getting with Marcie. Deanna and the girls then start trashing the reception room. Dan, Marcie, and Maddie find them after they wreck the place, and Marcie tells Deanna she is cut off financially from Dan. Deanna is filled with shame, if only because of how Maddie saw her.  Deanna tries to make amends with Maddie, but she tells her that she is leaving college since she has no means of completing the rest of the year on her own. The girls then come up with a plan to throw a party to raise money to pay for Deanna's tuition.  The party turns out to be a flop since everyone is at a [[Christina Aguilera]] concert. Helen, who has three million Twitter followers, posts that Christina will be at the party after her show. This brings in almost the whole school, but they all start to ask when Christina will be there. Christine shows up with her husband, as do Mike and Sandy.

Exhilarated, the three vow to open their college acceptance letters together at their own epic senior bash in four years.  Years later, it is now the last day of the girls senior year of high school. Annie and Marisa are still best friends, but Kelly has stopped talking to both of them and is now the most popular girl in school. Each of them receives a letter from a different university - Annie, a talented cellist with excellent grades, receives a letter from Cornell; Marisa, who is unmotivated and didn't apply to any colleges until the last minute, receives a letter from Fresno State University; while Kelly gets a letter from Stanford, pleasing her overbearing mother. Annie is determined to keep the friends promise and open the letters at the senior party, but Marisa, bitter over Kelly cutting them out of her life, is annoyed by Annie constantly talking about the pact. Meanwhile, Kelly remembers how the school guidance counselor only signed her application to Stanford on the terms that Kelly would honor her pact with Annie and Marisa after Annie wrote about their friendship for her personal essay. Kelly, who seems to regret joining the popular girls, attempts to talk to Annie and Marisa, but the other popular girls bully them and ruin her attempt at conversation.  In class, Annie sees Kelly and the other popular girls laughing about something, causing her to have a panic attack and run to the bathroom. Marisa goes to comfort her, but gets angry when Kelly follows them and pushes her outside, where they get caught by the annoying hall monitor, Andy, who gives them both detention. Marisa and Annie decide to skip class for the rest of the day, and discuss their explorations with sex and masturbation. Annie wants to find out where the party is and tries to convince Marisa to go. Marisa makes Annie help her rob all the lottery tickets from a convenience store, where the store's owner smashes Annie's car window with a brick, before finally agreeing to go to the party. They take Annie's car to Marisa's shady friend Adrian to get the window fixed before returning to school and trying on dresses from the drama club.  During all of this, a hot-head, borderline psychopathic cop named Trent goes to extreme lengths to find out the location of the senior party, including interrogating high school students to the point of terrorizing them, while his meeker partner Johnny tries to reign him in.  Marisa remembers she has detention and Annie convinces her to take her, as Annie never had detention before. They run into Kelly there, and Kelly sends Marisa a text message. Marisa deletes it, upsetting Annie. After detention is over Annie confronts Marisa, who loses her cool and yells at Annie to stop "living in a fantasy world" and give up on her hope of rekindling their friendship with Kelly; Annie breaks down in tears. Annie, Marisa, and Kelly all separately reminisce about how much closer they all were during their freshman year.  Marisa goes home and finds her estranged father is there to prepare for a date, and they get into an argument. Annie goes to get her car from Adrian and is horrified to see that he had the car "pimped out". She drives home and sees Kelly and her popular friends getting into a limo to go to the senior party; she becomes so saddened that she breaks her strict diet and eats an entire bag of potato chips. Marisa finds Annie moping by her car, and admits that the text message Kelly sent her in detention said that Kelly missed them; Marisa didn't tell her because she is afraid that if Kelly and Annie became friends again, Annie would abandon her, and that Kelly has no right to suddenly decide she wants to be their friends again. Annie gets mad and accuses Kelly of only acting rebellious because she is too scared of facing the real world. Annie tells Kelly that the reason she applied to Cornell is to avoid ending up like her. Hurt, Marisa leaves.  Marisa tries to buy alcohol, and finds one of the mean girls she egged back in freshman year, Sarah, working her second job as the store clerk (earlier in the film Marisa and Annie had seen Sarah working as a custodian at their school) while heavily pregnant. Sarah tells Marisa that life gets "real" after high school, and that she should just accept it as it comes - "No one gets out alive". Night falls, and Marisa gets drunk and walks around the closed school. When she sees a large map where students put their photographs where they're going to college, Marisa bursts into tears and smashes the bottle on the map. Meanwhile, Kelly arrives to the wild senior party but seems unenthusiastic about it.  Annie decides to stop worrying about her friends and focus on herself, and decides to go to the party anyway. She picks up her crush, Phil, and they figure out where the party is by calling liquor stores in town to find out which one delivered the booze to the party and get the address. As they drive, they speed past Trent and Johnny, who come after them. Annie panics and slams the gas, turning things into a police chase. Marisa arrives to the party and looks for Annie, but Kelly confronts her. Kelly calls Marisa out for always refusing to give her a chance to talk to them, and reveals that she never wanted to end their friendship; after Marisa's parents divorced and she had to move away for a year, Marisa is the one who stopped speaking to Kelly because Marisa assumed Kelly wouldn't be there for her. Kelly says that she's not the one who changed - Marisa is.  Annie and Phil end up crashing the car right into the party. Marisa and Kelly run out with the other students, and Annie, filled with confidence, calls them over. The three girls finally make up and hug. Trent and Johnny drive up, revealing that Andy spilled the beans on the location of the party, and Trent announces everyone at the party is under arrest. Sarah suddenly appears and reveals that the house belongs to Councilwoman Bohner, and threatens to put a bad word about Trent in if he disrupts the party. Mr. Warner, a teacher attending the party, reveals he went to school with Trent, and that Trent took a dump in the Jacuzzi during their own senior party. All the teens begin mocking Trent, causing him to lose his cool and storm off, and the party resumes.  After the party, Annie, Marisa, and Kelly sit together on top of Annie's car, happy now that they are friends again. They all reveal they have not opened their college acceptance letters, and finally honor the promise they made four years ago and open the letters together.

However, their emails are accidentally discovered by another student, Martin, who is infatuated with Abby.

At a Halloween party, Simon attempts to connect with Bram but later walks in on him making out with a female student. Simon lies to Nick, telling him that Abby has a boyfriend in college. Leah walks an inebriated Simon home, where she speaks vaguely about how she feels that she is fated to love one person very intensely; Simon believes she is referring to Nick.

Simon bonds with their server, a classmate named Lyle, and believes that Lyle may be Blue. That night, Simon comes out to Abby and is relieved when she reacts positively.  At a school football game, Simon crosses paths with Lyle; before he can summon the courage to ask if Lyle is Blue, he finds out Lyle is interested in Abby.

After the holidays, Nick and Abby, now a couple, angrily confront Simon about the lies he told and learn that he had tried to keep them apart due to Martin's blackmail. Leah confesses to Simon that she was in love with him, not Nick, and is upset he came out to Abby first. After being rejected by his friends, Simon receives a final email from Blue, who is upset that their emails have been leaked.

In the cafeteria, Simon and an openly gay student, Ethan, are mocked by two classmates. Ethan and Simon bond over the difficulties they have faced coming out. After his parents reach out and comfort him, Simon apologizes to Leah.

After the school musical, Leah, Nick and Abby make amends with Simon and invite him to go to the carnival with them. Waiting for Blue at the carnival, Simon rides the Ferris wheel, drawing a large crowd of peers. When Simon runs out of tickets, Martin, making amends for his behavior, buys him one more ride. Just before the ride begins, Bram sits next to Simon, revealing himself as Blue; the kiss Simon saw with the female student was a drunken misunderstanding. They ride the Ferris wheel together and kiss as their friends cheer them on.  Simon's life gradually returns to normal and he begins a relationship with Bram. While picking up his friends and boyfriend for school, Simon suggests that they forgo their usual morning routine and instead "go on a little adventure".

Veronica, back from Cambodia, announces to Berlusconi that she wants to divorce and a furious quarrel begins between the two of them. Crushed by political scandals and more isolated, Berlusconi finally invites Mike Bongiorno to his villa to dinner, even if the presenter is in the end dismissed without much regard. Once alone, Berlusconi activates the fake volcano in his garden, an attraction he said he would have shown to all his guests but that he actually never powered on.

Rikka’s elder sister, Takanashi Tōka, calls Yūta, telling him that her career in Italy has stabilized and she wants to bring Rikka over. Yūta assumes it is only for spring break.  However, upon arriving home, they find that movers have completely vacated Rikka’s room. To their shock, Tōka claims that she wants Rikka to move to [[Italy]] permanently with her. That night, Nibutani and Dekomori, along with their friend Shichimiya Satone, and their senior Tsuyuri Kumin, suggest that Rikka and Yūta [[Elopement|elope]] temporarily, to show Tōka that they are serious about wanting to be together. Early at dawn the next day, Yūta and Rikka leave on a train.  Tōka confronts Nibutani, Dekomori and Kumin, who insist they know nothing. Tōka reveals that she had secretly recorded the trio’s conversation from the night before, and with the picture of Nibutani and Dekomori’s accidental kiss from on the ferry, blackmails them into retrieving Yūta and Rikka. Afraid of losing their reputations in the student council, they comply. Nibutani and Dekomori attempt to stop Yūta and Rikka at the [[Kyoto Tower]], but they manage to escape on train to [[Kobe]].  While eating, Yūta is confronted by Tōka who asks him about his relationship with Rikka what he plans to do about her chunibyo. Yūta says he wants to let Rikka grow at her own pace. Yūta then leaves with Rikka, with Tōka giving them a chance, saying that she will detain them the next time they cross paths.  Yūta and Rikka arrive at [[Wakayama, Wakayama|Wakayama]]. After being kicked out of a [[love hotel]] for being underage, they hide just in time to see Nibutani and Dekomori arrive.

The next day at [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]], they spot Nibutani and Dekomori who have been sent by Tōka to intercept them before they can depart.

In Hokkaido, Yūta explains he wants to talk to Rikka’s mum about his future with Rikka. He unveils the ring as proof of his promise to Rikka, which she wears. Embarrassed, Rikka hits a sign and falls, dropping her phone, which inadvertently switches on. Rikka’s mother is out of town, so Yūta and Rikka board a train to meet her in [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]]. Rikka claims that she seems to lose her powers wearing the ring, and she calls Shichimiya for advice, who tells her that accepting the lovers’ contract between her and Yūta will cause her powers to fade. Shichimiya tells her that she has to make a choice, whether to give up her chunibyo or not.  The next morning. Yūta discovers Rikka’s suitcase is gone, with only the ring left behind. Yūta frantically searches for Rikka. Meanwhile, Nibutani and Dekomori arrive in Aomori, and Shichimiya and Kumin are revealed to be in pursuit as well. Upon meeting Rikka’s mum, Yūta begs for her forgiveness for losing Rikka. Rikka’s mum explains that Rikka had already came to see her that morning.  Rikka is shown to be on a clifftop, where Shichimiya and Kumin catch up to her. Shichimiya tells Rikka that she has to choose, and suggests that she abandon her chunibyo for Yūta. Rikka reveals her conflicted feelings: she worries that if she were to change, Yūta might no longer accept her. Kumin steps in and tells Rikka that this is entirely up to her and Yūta to determine, and prompts her to return to Yūta. Nibutani and Dekomori show up, telling Rikka they have already informed Yūta of her whereabouts. Nibutani hands Rikka cruise tickets for two, on behalf of all of them. Rikka reunites with Yūta with a deep embrace.  On the cruise that night, Rikka asks Yūta: if she abandoned her powers, would he still love her for who she truly is? Yūta reaffirms and swears that he will love her no matter what, and slips the ring back on Rikka’s fingers. The two finally kiss. Yūta messages Tōka, saying, “I want to fall in love even with chunibyo”. Tōka relents.    They are all flown to Italy for the remainder of their spring break, where it is revealed that Tōka is getting married. She throws her bouquet of flowers to Rikka, with the key to Rikka’s new home, and asks that they live separately from this moment on.  In a post credits scene, Yūta is back at home. Rikka’s new apartment is two floors above him, and as she climbs down on a rope, Yūta understands that it was everything about Rikka that made him fall in love with her.

Despite flaring Hindu-Muslim tensions, Manto decides to stay back in his beloved city of Bombay. One day, Shyam, on hearing that his family was forced to flee Pakistan because of a Muslim mob attack, tells Manto in anger: “I could have even killed you.” Shocked and anguished, a non-practicing Muslim, Manto suddenly becomes conscious of his religious identity and the vulnerabilities that come with it.

Soon afterward, the neighboring kingdom of Mezarte sends armed soldiers on the backs of flying dragons called Renato to the Iolph village. Unable to find the secret to their longevity, the army attacks, killing most of the Iolph and taking a friend of Maquia's, Leilia, as a prisoner. One of the Renato goes haywire during the attack; tangled in Hibiol, it flees the village, dragging Maquia, who is also tangled in the fabric, along with it. After awakening in a forest, she happens upon an ambushed caravan and a drunk half-Iorph merchant, where she finds a newborn baby boy, held tightly in the arms of his deceased mother. Unwilling to let it die, she pulls him from the dead woman's arms and decides to take him in as her son.

The structure of the film is built by repetition of design themes: grid structures, tiled images and scenes of morphing shapes that were influenced by the facade of [[Casa Batllo]] in Barcelona, designed by [[Antoni Gaudí]]. North Blue features recurring abstract “characters” that include seven scenes with three blue balls, triangles with two line appendages that behave like crows, self-propelling lumps with bumps and flopping line segments that function like railroad tracks.

Ocean's 8
 Following release from prison, Debbie Ocean, younger sister of the late [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], meets with her former partner-in-crime Lou to convince her to join a heist that she planned while serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie’s who is eager to move out of her mother’s house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer [[security hacker|cracker]]; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family’s suburban home.  Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] necklace, from the [[Met Gala]] in five weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a dim-witted and snobby actress, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala. After the team manipulates Daphne into choosing Weil as her stylist, Weil and Amita go to Cartier to convince them to let Daphne wear the Toussaint, as well as surreptitiously digitally scan it to later manufacture a [[cubic zirconia]] duplicate.  Debbie hunts down Claude Becker, an art dealer who ratted her out to the police when they were discovered for art fraud, which led to her arrest and imprisonment. Debbie manipulates Daphne to invite Becker as her date to the gala. Lou realizes that Debbie is out for revenge on Becker, but Debbie reassures her that everything will be fine.  Weil discovers a flaw in the plan: The Toussaint can only be unclasped using a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier. Nine Ball enlists her younger sister, Veronica, to build a similar magnet in time for the gala. As the gala begins, Daphne consumes soup that Lou spiked, causing her to vomit in the restroom, where Constance takes the necklace. When the necklace is discovered to be missing, the museum is evacuated and searched; Tammy "finds" the duplicate necklace in order to end the search. Meanwhile, Amita retrieves the real necklace and begins disassembling it. She retools it into several pieces of jewelry, and gives them to Constance to slip it to each member of the team. One of the real diamonds is planted on Becker.  Soon after the gala, the necklace is identified as fake when returned to Cartier, and John Frazier, an insurance fraud investigator, is called in. Frazier, who has a history with the Ocean family, notices Debbie's presence and suspects her involvement in the heist, but unable to find any evidence against her solid alibi. Debbie assures Frazier that she does not know where the necklace is, but she may know where part of it is. Dropping her dimwitted persona, Daphne is revealed to have been in on the plan, tipped off by Weil's bad acting, and Debbie and Lou invited her in to keep her from ratting them out. Daphne visits Becker for a romantic evening, where she finds the diamonds planted on him by Debbie during the gala, and sends a picture to Frazier so that he can obtain a warrant to arrest Becker for stealing the necklace. To further frame Becker, Debbie sells pieces of the necklace to actresses disguised as elderly socialites, who in turn sell the jewelry and deposit the money into an account in his name. Becker is arrested.  As the eight celebrate their victory, Daphne asks Debbie and Lou how they each made so much money from the sale of one necklace. Lou reveals that while the gala was being evacuated, Lou and "The Amazing" Yen were stealing some of the [[Crown jewels|Crown Jewels]] on display during the Gala, which makes their cuts higher than expected. Each member of the team goes their separate ways with their money: Amita goes to Paris with a man she met on [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]]; Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a [[YouTuber]]; Tammy expands her business in selling stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool bar; Daphne becomes a director; Lou goes on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie returns to Danny’s grave to raise a toast to him with a [[martini (cocktail)|martini]] in his honor.

The Other Side of the Wind
 Jake Hannaford is an aging Hollywood director who was killed in a car crash on his 70th birthday. Just before his death, Hannaford was trying to revive his flagging career by making a flashy film, laden with gratuitous sex scenes and violence, with mixed results. At the time of Hannaford's party, this film (titled ''The Other Side of the Wind'') has been left unfinished after its star stormed off the set, for reasons not immediately apparent to the audience.  A screening of some incomprehensible parts of Hannaford's unfinished experimental film take place, in order to attract "end money" from the film studio boss Max David. Hannaford himself is absent, and a loyal member of his entourage, the aging former child star Billy Boyle makes an inept attempt to describe what the film is about. Intercut during this, we see various groups setting out for Hannaford's 70th birthday party at his Arizona ranch, including Hannaford and his young protégé Brooks Otterlake, a young, commercially successful director with a talent for mimicking celebrities. One of the people they share their car with is the obnoxious reporter Mr. Pister, who is thrown out of Hannaford's car after infuriating him. Stranded in the desert, Pister hitches a lift on a bus that is taking crew and reporters to Hannaford's birthday party.  Many of the journalists attending the party are all brandishing cameras, among many invasive questions, eventually begin querying Hannaford's sexuality and whether he has long been a closet homosexual, in spite of his macho public persona. Hannaford has a history of seducing the wife or girlfriend of each of his leading men, but maintains a strong attraction to the leading men themselves.  Several party guests comment on the conspicuous absence of John Dale, Hannaford's androgynous-looking, leather-clad leading man in his last film, whom Hannaford first discovered when Dale was attempting suicide by jumping into the Pacific Ocean off the Mexican coast. Meanwhile, guests are shown more scenes from the film in the private cinema Hannaford has at the ranch.  As the party continues, Hannaford gets progressively drunker. He is washing his face in the bathroom when he tearfully breaks down in front of Otterlake, asking for the young director's help to revive his flagging career, and desperately trying to sober up before returning to the screening of his unfinished film. A power outage in the middle of Hannaford's party interrupts the screening mid-way. The party continues by lantern-light, and eventually reconvenes to an empty drive-in cinema, where the last portion of Hannaford's film is screened. At this point, Dale arrives at the party. A drunken Hannaford makes a pass at Dale, and is rebuffed.   Intrusive journalist Juliette Riche asked Hannaford the most explicit questions of all about his sexuality. At this moment, Billy Boyle stops the film cameras as Hannaford violently assaults Riche in anger. Hannaford gets in his car and drives away crashing into the screen of the drive-in cinema, killing him.

Operation Red Sea
 While on duty and touring through the waters of the [[Red Sea]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]] patrol fleet receives a distress call that [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somalian pirates]] are boarding a cargo ship called the Guangdong and endangering Chinese passengers and seamen on board. They immediately deploy the 8-person [[People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces|''Jiaolong'' Assault Team]] as their forward unit to try to slow the progress of the pirates until the heavily armed naval vessels can arrive on the scene. Using the assistance of a forward helicopter and a sniper dispatched as part of the assault team, they make significant progress to neutralize the situation while awaiting the main Chinese fleet on duty in the Red Sea. During the operations, their primary sniper receives a crippling spinal injury from gunfire and must be replaced. The assault team is praised for their success once the main fleet arrives.  Later, when the civil war situation in the nation of Yewaire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] becomes unstable, orders are given to evacuate local Chinese personnel and workers from the country. Given the unrest and threats from rebels and local terrorist groups, the ''Jiaolong'' Assault team is assigned the task of evacuating the Chinese citizens to safety aboard the main Chinese naval vessels in temporary harbor in the area. Meanwhile, a French-Chinese journalist working in the area receives news that the local terrorist organization, Zaka, are prepared to impede local cooperation with the Chinese by all available military and terrorist means available. The Jiaolong squad manages to save the Chinese civilians caught in the warzone and the PAP paramilitary forces guarding the ambassador just in a nick of time while also saving an Arabic man forced to participate as a car bomber.   The terrorists are also uncovered to have plans to weaponize [[yellowcake]] materials into a [[dirty bomb]]. The eight-person forward assault team is given very poor support by the local government which is in turmoil. They must also relocate the Yewaire civilians working there to a safe deployment area 75 miles away using only a jeep convoy for transportation.  The convoy is ambushed by terrorists, and takes significant losses from a trained sniper and mortar attacks. All the civilians and local government troops are killed, except the journalist. Zaka uses a kidnapped Chinese citizen as a bargaining chip so that the Chinese navy will release the Yewairian President, and beheads another hostage as an example. Jiaolong and the journalist track down the hostage (first priority of the mission) to a terrorist stronghold with 150 militants, the local leader Sayyid, and armed with mechanized artillery and tanks. The assault team moves in with a risky plan involving covertly swapping the Chinese hostage and the journalist. The enemy sniper from earlier reappears; the replacement Jiaolong sniper and his spotter are able to take him out. The operation eventually succeeded in evacuating all the hostages, but two Jiaolong members were killed in action and another two were heavily injured.   The four remaining members later [[wingsuit]] into the yellowcake exchange site between the terrorists and the rebel group. Zaka backstabs the rebels, and in the chaos the Chinese operatives manage to corner the terrorist leader, who commits suicide. Jiaolong retrieves the dirty bomb recipe and captures the cargo plane carrying the yellowcake. Back on board the Chinese fleet, the fallen soldiers are honored for their courage under fire. In the end credits, 5 Chinese naval vessels intercept 3 US naval ships warning them they have entered Chinese waters and must leave immediately.  
The Open House
 When a suburban father is killed by being smashed by a car whose driver appeared to have had a heart attack, his family struggles to come to terms with their loss. Unemployed and financially unable to support herself and her teenage son Logan, Naomi agrees to move into her sister's secluded mountain mansion until it sells. Upon moving in, Naomi and Logan encounter their elderly neighbor, Martha, who behaves strangely, and Chris, a pleasant store clerk.   During the open house days, Naomi and Logan are required to leave the property at breakfast and return after 5pm. A series of strange occurrences begin. Objects are moved or disappear, the house phone rings but nobody speaks, the pilot to the hot water tank repeatedly gets shut off, and there are unexplained noises. One night, Logan sees a car idling in the driveway. Outside, he finds Martha, who behaves erratically. Martha later alludes to her deceased husband being alive.  A repairman is called to inspect the faulty hot water tank. He reveals that Martha's husband really did die and Martha has [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]]. This leads to her sometimes forgetting what has happened, but she is harmless. The repairman finds Logan's missing phone near the water heater, leading Naomi to believe that Logan had been messing with her. The two have a heated argument. That night, it is revealed that there is someone else lurking in the home. One day, Naomi and Logan find that their home has been broken into, but the police found nothing. Unable to afford a hotel, the mother and son are forced to remain in the house.  Logan contacts Chris, who agrees to stay the night. In the middle of the night, Logan finds Chris with his throat slashed in his car. An unidentified man knocks Logan unconscious, pours water over him and leaves him to the harsh winter elements while he goes after Naomi. Naomi is horrified to discover photos of her, and Logan, sleeping in their beds. She is then attacked, bound and tortured (like the intruder breaking her fingers). Logan awakes and finds that all phones have had their sim cards removed and snapped when he attempts to call 911 for help. He rushes to help his mother but accidentally mistakes her for the intruder and stabs her. Naomi tells him to run before collapsing. The intruder easily overpowers Logan and removes his contact lenses, leaving Logan unable to see clearly.   Logan escapes into the woods and hides. He survives the freezing elements until morning. Succumbing to [[hypothermia]], he drags himself to a stream. The intruder reveals himself, grabs Logan as he struggles and screams, and strangles him to death. As we see his lifeless  body by the  stream, the unidentified man drives towards the next open house event.  
Pacific Rim Uprising
  In 2035, ten years [[Pacific Rim (film)|after the Battle of the Breach]], former Jaeger pilot Jake Pentecost &ndash; son of Stacker Pentecost &ndash; makes a living by stealing and selling Jaeger parts on the [[black market]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area. After he tracks part of a disabled Jaeger's power core to the secret workshop of fifteen year-old Jaeger enthusiast Amara Namani, both are arrested by the Pan-Pacific Defense Corps after an altercation between Amara's small, single-pilot Jaeger ''Scrapper'' and the Jaeger ''November Ajax''. Jake's adoptive sister and PPDC Secretary General Mako Mori gives Jake a choice between the prison or return to PPDC as an instructor with Amara as his recruit.  Upon arriving at a Shatterdome in China, Jake starts training Jaeger program cadets with his estranged former co-pilot Nate Lambert. Nate and Mako reveal to him that the Jaeger program is threatened by Shao Corporation's drone program, which offers to mass-produce Jaeger drones developed by Liwen Shao and Dr. Newton Geiszler. Mako is due to deliver a final assessment to determine the authorization of the drones at a PPDC council meeting in [[Sydney]], but is killed by rogue Jaeger ''Obsidian Fury'' before she can report. Her death prompts the PPDC council to authorize the drone program and order their immediate deployment. Moments before her death, Mako transmitted the location of a defunct Jaeger production facility in [[Siberia]] before Jake failed to save her. Jake and Nate travel to the area in their own Jaeger, but ''Obsidian Fury'' destroys the complex and engages them in battle. Upon destroying its reactor, they find that ''Obsidian Fury'' was controlled by a Kaiju's secondary brain, which testing shows was grown on Earth.  When the drones reach their respective locations, they are taken over by cloned Kaiju brains and simultaneously attack Shatterdomes worldwide, inflicting heavy casualties on the PPDC forces and incapacitating almost all Jaegers. Hermann Gottlieb seeks out Geiszler for help, only to discover that Geiszler is the mastermind behind the attack (and possibly Mako's assassination). Geiszler’s mind has been taken over by the Precursors, the alien race who created the Kaiju, due to his regularly drifting with Kaiju brains. Seeking to destroy the world for the Precursors, Geiszler, now their emissary, commands the Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids to open new breaches all over the world. Although Shao is able to destroy the drones, three powerful Kaijus named Raijin, Hakuja, and Shrikethorn &ndash; emerge from the breaches and unite in [[Tokyo]]. The team realizes that the Precursors' goal is to activate the [[Ring of Fire]] by detonating [[Mount Fuji]] with the Kaiju's chemically reactive blood, spreading toxic gas into the atmosphere and wiping out all life on Earth, terraforming the planet for Precursor colonization.  The cadets are mobilized while Gottlieb and Shao repair the PPDC's four remaining Jaegers; Gottlieb invents Kaiju-blood-powered rockets, which launch the team to Tokyo. Although the Jaegers initially repel the three Kaiju, the Precursor Emissary merges them into a Mega-Kaiju that quickly overpowers the Jaegers, injures Nate, kills Suresh and destroys three of the four Jaegers leaving ''Gipsy Avenger'' as the only operational Jaeger. Jake and Amara pilot it against the Mega-Kaiju, with Shao remote piloting ''Scrapper'' and aiding them by locating a rocket and welding it to ''Gipsy's'' right hand and sending the Jaeger into the atmosphere and allowing to freefall back to earth, colliding into the Mega-Kaiju which kills the Kaiju as Jake and Amara survive by transferring into ''Scrapper''. Afterwards, Nate takes the Precursor Emissary into custody.  Some time later, the captive Precursor Emissary threatens that Precursors will attack the world over and over again. Jake replies that next time, humanity will be the ones attacking the Precursors.  
The Outsider (2018 film)
 Taking place in 1954 after the [[Allied occupation of Japan]] following the Second World War, Nick Lowell is the only non-Japanese inmate in an [[Osaka]] prison. Most other inmates are [[Yakuza]] criminals, recognizable by their [[Irezumi]] tattoos. Nick saves a Yakuza named Kiyoshi from being hanged to death, whose Shiromatsu Yakuza clan repays his debt by arranging Nick's release. He is also offered a job: Anthony Panetti, an American copper tradesman with a deep hatred for the Japanese, has refused to negotiate a deal with the Shiromatsu clan, but has agreed to a deal with a different clan because they sent an American to talk to Panetti. Nick agrees to "cancel out" the other American, but ends up violently beating Panetti on the head with a typewriter just a minute into the conversation instead.  When the rival Seizu Yakuza clan from [[Kobe]] challenges the Shiromatsu clan at their own strip club, Nick attacks their leader, nearly causing a shootout. Kiyoshi takes a liking to Nick, giving him an expensive apartment and a suit. He further entrusts Nick with driving his drunk sister Miyu home after he catches her partying at the Shiromatsu establishment. Nick spends the night with her and becomes more heavily embroiled with the Shiromatsu clan, taking the role of a violent enforcer. He continues his relationship with Miyu and gets an Irezumi tattoo on his back.  The Shiromatsu clan is under pressure from the rivaling clans, largely due to the ageing Shiromatsu patriarch's refusal to adapt to the rapidly changing post-war economy. Kiyoshi sends Nick to the harbor to handle a black market weapons deal, where he is attacked by four Seizu clan members, killing two. To avoid a war with the Seizu clan and as an apology, Nick and Kiyoshi perform an act of [[yubitsume]]. The severed joints are sent to the Seizu clan leader, who accepts. During a [[Sumo]] event the Seizu clan leader offers the Shiromatsu patriarch the possibility to retire in peace by assimilating his clan, which the old man refuses. Nick is brought to a Yakuza initiation ritual at an old temple and becomes a full member of the clan.  Later Nick is recognized by Paulie Bowers, an American soldier on leave. Through their conversation it is revealed that Nick was the former Captain of Bowers' unit, that the United States Military believes Nick had been killed in action, and that Nick might have engaged in war crimes. When Paulie makes an attempt at blackmailing Nick, he lures him back to his apartment and kills him. Nick learns that Miyu has been nearly raped by her former lover Orochi in the meantime, but Miyu stops him from taking revenge by telling him that the she is pregnant. Nick shows up at Kiyoshi's home and confesses the relationship with his sister. Arguing that Nick is now responsible for keeping Miyu safe, Kiyoshi gives him a [[Daishō]], a pair of Samurai swords. Together they bury Bowers' body in the woods.  Some time later, Nick saves the Shiromatsu patriarch from being strangled to death by a tailor. Kiyoshi is killed by two Seizu members during their escape. It becomes clear that many clan members have switched over to the Seizu clan, most importantly Orochi. Nick immediately suggests a clan war, to which the patriarch agrees. After a killing spree the Seizu clan leader offers peace talks at the local harbor, which turn out to be an ambush. The patriarch and many other Shiromatsu clan members die, Nick is wounded by a shot in the leg. Undeterred, Nick travels to the Seizu clan [[Dōjō]] with Kiyoshi's sword and demands an opportunity to kill Orochi. Orochi refuses to fight him, saying that Nick is only a foreigner and could never truly be a Yakuza. When Orochi hands him back the Katana, Nick quickly draws it and cuts Orochi's throat. The Seizu patriarch intervenes before any further violence occurs, and allows Nick to leave.  In the final scene, Nick returns to an apartment where he has hidden Miyu under the guard of the few remaining Shiromatsu clan members. He embraces her as the remaining members of the clan bow reverently to him.

Pad Man (film)
 The story starts with the marriage of Lakshmikant Chauhan ([[Akshay Kumar]]) and Gayatri ([[Radhika Apte]]), a happy go lucky couple. Lakshmikant is deeply in love with his wife and will do anything for her comfort and happiness. When Gayatri is temporarily banished from the household during her menstrual periods, Laxmi is caught unaware due to his lack of knowledge about the subject which is otherwise referred to as 'five day test match for women' by the village youth. Laxmi makes his peace with it but gets worried on seeing Gayatri using a dirty rag during her periods. When asked about it, Gayatri tells him it's none of his business and he, being a 'pure' human should not interfere in this feminine topic. Undeterred, Laxmi goes to a medical store and buys sanitary pads for his wife which cost Rs.55. When he reaches home and hands it over to Gayatri, she reprimands him and tells him to return it as using such costly napkins meant cutting off milk expenses of a month. Unable to return it, Laxmi, crestfallen, goes to work where a worker gets injured. He immediately applies a pad to the injury despite the others referring to it as 'impure'. In the hospital, the doctor lauds Laxmi's quick thinking and says that it is the cleanest choice to stop bleeding. Excited, Laxmi then buys some cotton, cloth and glue and makes a temporary pad which he thinks is a better replacement for the costly one.   Gayatri uses it but the pad fails in its function and she tells Laxmi to not interfere in women's matters again. Laxmi disregards her, again tries to make a pad, and attempts to give it to a neighbor girl which again creates a mess. He then gives it to a medical student who decides to help him out but is deterred by her friends. To add to his woes, the meeting of Laxmi and the medical student is spotted by his close relative which makes his wife think that Laxmi has an extramarital affair. Laxmi visits his sister and tries to give her pads which leads to embarrassment in front of her in-laws. Gayatri then makes Laxmi promise to not involve anyone in this mess anymore. Adhering to her words and yet unwilling to let go of the issue, Laxmi then tries it on himself by attaching a balloon filled with goat blood borrowed from a friend, which leads to Laxmi getting blood stains on trousers in public resulting in humiliation. This act causes him to be branded a 'pervert' and a 'man with loose morals' by the entire village. Gayatri's brothers take her away and Laxmi decides to leave the village, pledging to fight the taboo surrounding menstruation.  After learning that sanitary pads use the more absorbent cellulose fibre rather than cotton, Laxmi then goes to a college to gain knowledge about the materials used in sanitary napkins. In need of money and shelter, he ends up working as a manservant in a professor's house. The professor's son introduces him to the internet and helps him get every piece of information. He places an order for cellulose fibre for sanitary pad with an international company. The professor is baffled by Laxmi's actions and shows him videos of pad making machines worth crores to derail his ideas. Instead, Laxmi decides to make his own pad vending machine and leaves the house. He borrows money for his machine and then manages to make a near perfect pad but has no one to test it. By a chance of events, he meets Pari Walia ([[ Sonam Kapoor]]), and supplies a pad to her. The next day, Laxmi visits her and asks her for feedback. Shocked, she says that it was just like other normal pads. His joy knows no bounds and he calls Gayatri to give her the news. Gayatri, however, gets upset at his obsession with menstruation and her brother warn Laxmi to stay away from them.   Meanwhile, Pari invites him to an innovation fair in IIT-Delhi with the winner receiving Rs.2,00,000 as prize money. Laxmi's invention is recognized as the 'Life-changing Innovation of the Year' and he is honoured and felicitated. He shoots to fame but the villagers, on realising the nature of his invention, badmouth and insult him. His machine is patented and Pari helps him reach out to and sell his pads to the rural women, who later join him, in his pad making venture under the brand name 'Pari'. Laxmi proceeds to make more low cost sanitary pad manufacturing machines for sale to rural women. He is invited to New York and gives a speech in [[UNICEF]] which makes him popular. Back home, he is awarded the [[Padmashri]]. Pari falls in love with him but then dismisses her own feelings for his happiness. Laxmi returns to a hero's welcome in his village. The film ends with Laxmi and Gayatri finally uniting and Pari leaving with happy memories of Laxmi.

Pari (2018 Indian film)
 The story of the film revolves around the concept of [[Ifrit]] and Auladhchakra, a satanic cult in Bangladesh aiming to propagate and progress the bloodline of Ifrit. They branded the women impregnated by Ifrit with the symbol of a foetus on their skin. Rukhsana ([[Anushka Sharma]]), is the daughter of a woman who was a victim of a ritual by Auladhchakra. She is afraid of incense sticks and religious hymns and prayers, and hides her head in a bucket of water to cut out the Azaan playing in a nearby mosque. Professor Quasim Ali ([[Rajat Kapoor]]) used to head a group of vigilantes which sought out women impregnated by Ifrit, and killed their babies by chopping off their heads. This drew a lot of flak from villagers eventually and the group was ultimately shut down due to its radical approach.  The film begins with Arnab ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]) meeting Piyali ([[Ritabhari Chakraborty]]) on the roof of her house. Arnab has come to meet her for marriage arranged by his family. Piyali is a nurse, while Arnab runs a printing press. While returning from her house, in the heavy rain, with his father driving, they hit an old woman. Although the woman died by being run over, Arnab files the case with the local police inspector (Santilal Mukherjee) as attempt to suicide. On visiting the accident spot, they discover the place where the old woman used to live, locally called ''kuttewali budhiya'', meaning dog lady, in a hut in the forest by the road. Rukhsana is found chained in a dark corner of the hut, pale and bruised. Arnab takes pity and after taking Rukhsana to visit her dead mother, he decides to take her in later in the film.  Meanwhile, a mortuary assistant (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) who made a living stealing golden teeth and the likes from corpses in the morgue, and who initially worked with the professor, discovers that the dead woman, Rukhsana's mother, has the mark of foetus on her skin. He decides to inform the professor and they decide to seek out Rukhsana. They reach Rukhsana's hut in the forest, only to find that she had escaped. Later they track down Rukhsana to Arnab's house, where she was supposed to stay until he found housing for her.  Rukhsana seemed to have been abused since her childhood. Arnab observes that she doesn't have a soul to care for her, and hence takes care of her. Rukhsana inadvertently falls in love with him, but also has hallucinations of herself bleeding when she is alone. The professor meets another old woman, supposedly born of Ifrit, a kalapori(Mansi Multani), who seemingly can communicate with others like her. She tells him where Rukhsana is, and that she is going to seduce the guy she is living with to pass on the bloodline.  One night, Rukhsana gets the urge to spew poison out of her system, as her body generated poison every month due to the Ifrit blood, and kills a dog near Arnab's house in the middle of the night. The professor ultimately approaches Arnab and tells him her story, but he refuses to believe him. One evening, the morgue assistant follows Arnab, and they end up in a scuffle, leaving Arnab bleeding. Rukhsana tends to him and tells him of her affection for him. She also kills the morgue assistant who had hit Arnab. She finally succeeds in getting impregnated by him, but then her attitude changes. She forces him to stop meeting Piyali, whom she sees as competition. On further argument, she grabs him by his throat and lifts him clear off the ground. This brings him to contact the professor and find out more about Ifrit.  The Ifrit cannot be seen but only heard by its breath. Ifrit babies can be born by latching  on to human wombs. The babies are born over a month instead  of nine months, and without an umbilical cord. So when Rukhsana tells Arnab that she is pregnant, he contacts the professor to take care of it. Piyali had come by his house once, and finding Rukhsana in his room accidentally, breaks all contact with him. So, while the professor tortures Rukhsana so that she died of her own venom, Arnab withdraws himself from his normal life and society, and stays at his parents' home.  After one month, Piyali comes over to tell Arnab that he must convince his parents that she isn't the reason for his voluntary loneliness, but instead gets to hear the truth about Rukhsana. She also confesses about an earlier relationship and an aborted baby of her former boyfriend. But things soon take a turn for the worse.  On the last day of the month, Rukhsana sets herself free. She kills the professor and his men before heading over to Piyali's house. Arnab heads over to his own house to find the others dead, and hurries over to Piyali's house. Rukhsana manages to injure Piyali, but  is momentarily distracted  by an accidental push on the TV remote, which  turns on a cartoon  show she used to watch at Arnab's house. Piyali frees herself and hides. But then, Rukhsana goes into labour, and Piyali, being a nurse couldn't bring herself to kill her. She eventually helps Rukhsana have her baby, which is shown having an umbilical cord. Rukhsana leaves the baby to Piyali, while Arnab rushes to the old hut where Rukhsana goes back, injured and near-death. In her last struggle to spew poison into Arnab or let it remain her system, she chooses the latter and dies. Before dying she tells Arnab that the baby isn't like her and is human. The film ends with Arnab saying that Rukhsana's love made the baby human, rather than Ifrit's hatred.

They are friends with a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits as well as the surrounding nature. Bea takes on a mother-like relationship with the rabbits due to the death of their parents, who were killed by McGregor. One day Peter is forced to leave his jacket in McGregor's garden and goes back to retrieve it. McGregor spots and catches him, but suddenly dies of a heart attack, due to decades of unhealthy eating habits. Enthralled, Peter invites all of the local animals and takes over McGregor's manor.  Meanwhile, in [[London]], McGregor's grandnephew Thomas McGregor, an uptight, controlling workaholic, works at the toy department of [[Harrods]] department store where he waits for a promotion to associate general manager. He indifferently accepts the news about his great-uncle's death, someone he was completely unaware of, but is infuriated over losing the promotion to a lazy nephew of the managing director and is fired for losing his temper. His now-former manager encourages him to get a hobby and spend some time in the country.  When Thomas learns that his great-uncle's manor is valuable and that he's inherited it, he decides to appraise and prepare it for resale in order to start his own toy store to get even with his former employers. He kicks out Peter and his friends and begins to upgrade the security of the garden wall and gates, despite Bea's objections. When Peter and Benjamin sneak back into the garden, Thomas catches the latter and attempts to drown Benjamin in a lake. His cousins rescue him; Thomas instead accidentally drops a prized set of binoculars that Bea had given him earlier, forcing him to retrieve it.  Thomas and Peter start a war with each other by setting up traps and other offensive nuisances. Thomas and Bea end up falling in love with each other, which causes Peter to become jealous and wanting to separate them more. This all culminates when Peter rewires an electric fence set up by Thomas, prompting Thomas to throw dynamite at Peter's burrow. Thomas then attacks Peter in the garden, telling Peter that his antics caused him to become aggressive. When Peter detonates the dynamite to prove to Bea that Thomas was using it, he ends up knocking down the tree on top of the burrow, which crushes Bea's art studio. Bea, ignoring Thomas’s explanation of his quarrel with the rabbits, breaks up with him, and he goes back to London to work at Harrods again.  Peter feels bad for what he has done, and upon learning that Bea intends to leave the neighborhood, he and Benjamin head to London to find Thomas at Harrods. Tricking Thomas into believing he was imagining the rabbits’ ability to communicate, Peter apologizes for his part of the conflict and convinces Thomas to follow his heart. They rush back to the country, where Peter shows Bea the detonator and presses it for her to see, confirming Thomas’s previous claims that the rabbits were responsible for the explosion. Peter and Thomas apologize and convince Bea not to leave her home.  Wishing to remain with Bea, Thomas no longer wants to sell the manor but discovers that an unpleasant wealthy couple had already bought the house and finalized the sale. Peter and his friends use their tricks to force the couple out of the house, allowing Thomas to move back in. Thomas and Bea resume their relationship, and permit the wildlife to freely take food from the garden.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], Peter and his family restore the burrow with Bea and Thomas’s help. Thomas sets up his own toy shop in the village, where Bea showcases her illustrations of the rabbits.  
Paul, Apostle of Christ
 Luke the evangelist enters Rome in secret as he witnesses Christian victims being set ablaze as human torches to light the night-time streets. He has been sent by other Christian communities outside of Rome to meet with Paul the Apostle and persuade him to help in writing an account of his wisdom. Luke meets with Priscilla and Aquila, the leaders of the Christian community hiding out in Rome, who are currently debating whether to stay in Rome and continue to provide hope to persecuted victims of Nero's pogrom or to leave Rome with their community to avoid certain death.   Paul has been imprisoned inside Mamertine Prison for his strong influence as a Christian leader which makes him a threat to Nero's power and the Roman Empire. Mauritius Gallus, the newly appointed prefect of the prison, accuses him of burning half of Rome down and, under Nero's decree, sentences him to death. Luke uses forged papers to sneak into the prison and joyfully greets a weary, physically beaten Paul. Paul and Luke both agree that Paul's time is soon coming to an end and so Luke convinces Paul to help him write an account of how Paul, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus, came to be one of Christianity's greatest leaders. Mauritius discovers that Luke had snuck into the prison with the help of high-ranking Romans, but allows him to visit Paul unscathed because those Romans are also friends of Mauritius.  Paul begins narrating his origins: That he was once Saul of Tarsus, a Jewish boy, who was influenced by the zealotry of the Jewish leaders and witnessed the martyrdom of Stephen at their hands for professing his faith in Jesus Christ. This event made Saul vow to destroy all Christians throughout the world. Mauritius laments the fact that he has been made prefect of the prison despite his many deeds for Rome and that his daughter is dying from a terrible sickness despite all his sacrifices to the Roman gods. At a tavern, his friends suggest that he find some evidence that the Christians were responsible for burning down Rome despite rumors abounding that it was Nero who started the fire.  The Christian community continues to suffer losses, including a Roman boy named Tarquin who was sent to enlist the aid of Roman citizens sympathetic to the Christians' plight. Tarquin's cousin, Cassius, adamantly calls for Christians to take up arms and seek revenge against the Romans for all their persecutions. But, Aquila rebukes him by saying that Paul never sought revenge or wished ill upon all those who harmed him and that "love is the only way". Luke, having witnessed the Roman's barbarism and cruelty, relates this news to Paul and begins to sympathize with the need for revenge. Paul, however, admonishes him for "giving up on the world when Christ did not" and tells him that the very love which Christ died for is the only way to counter this evil. Inspired by these words, Luke lets go of his anger and continues writing down Paul's story.  At this point, Paul relates his story about how he hunted down and butchered many Christians throughout the Holy Land until the day he rode for Damascus with his brethren. He became blinded by God and heard His voice asking why Saul persecuted Him. This event along with Saul's meeting Ananias, a disciple of Christ, humbles Saul so deeply that he repents of his actions. Ananias restores Saul's sight and baptizes him in the name of the Lord, which leads to Saul rejecting his former name and becoming Paul.  Mauritius, having heard about Paul's reputation as a preacher and miracle worker, speaks with Paul and relays his concerns that his daughter is dying. Paul suggests that Luke be allowed to examine her and help, but Mauritius refuses to allow a Christian into his home despite the protests of his wife who is growing impatient with Mauritius' hubris. Further, Mauritius has Luke imprisoned under the assumption that Paul and Luke are plotting an escape from the prison to lead an uprising against Rome. Paul, however, assures him that this is not the case and offers Luke words of comfort that he will find the strength to love and forgive their enemies.  Cassius, having lost all patience with Priscilla and Aquila's pacifism, decides to take matters into his own by bringing an armed group of men to storm the prison and free Paul. But, Paul rejects their offer of rescue by telling them that Christ has already won the victory upon the cross. Dejected, Cassius and the others escape before more guards arrive and disappear into the night. Mauritius angrily accuses Paul and Luke of the conspiracy to escape despite their protests and has Luke thrown into prison along with other imprisoned Christians. After learning that they will be sentenced to Nero's circus to be devoured by wild beasts, Luke leads the other Christians in prayer asking the Lord to forgive their captors for their impending execution.  Mauritius finally relents after fearing the loss of her daughter and has Luke brought to his house to help save her. Luke sends Mauritius to Aquila and Priscilla for supplies needed to heal the child. Mauritius, amazed that Luke would entrust the lives of other Christians to him, goes alone to their hiding place and begs for their help. Although initially wary and distrustful of a Roman asking for their assistance, they relent and give Mauritius the supplies he requests. With the items delivered, Luke is able to use his healing skills as a physician to cure the warden's daughter of her illness at the same time that the imprisoned Christians are thrown into the circus.  With his daughter finally healthy again, Mauritius graciously spares Luke's life and thanks Paul for continuing to show him compassion and kindness. Although Mauritius is sorry for being unable to prevent the deaths of the Christians in the arena, Paul responds by saying that Mauritius may yet come to know Jesus Christ and God's undying love. Paul and Luke meet one more time and express their hope that all the world shall know the Christians by their love and that they will meet again. Aquila and Priscilla, having decided at this point to leave Rome with their community, agree to deliver Luke's completed letters and writings to Timothy, thus ensuring that the Acts of the Apostles will be told and retold to all Christians and non-Christians.  Luke decides to remain in Rome and continue the work of evangelizing in the name of Christians. As the Christian community escapes from Rome, Paul is escorted outside the prison to be executed by decapitation with Luke watching onwards. Mauritius shakes Paul's hands in a final gesture of goodwill and respect. As Paul's execution is underway, a voice-over narrates his conclusion to Timothy saying that he is thankful to have fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. The final scene depicts Paul arriving in Heaven as a crowd of people greet him joyfully, including all those he once persecuted and killed. He is last seen walking towards Jesus filled with peace.

  Shin Roo-mi runs a successful fried chicken restaurant in a traditional market area. She becomes involved in a real estate battle with a mob-run construction company, Tae-san. The company plans to demolish the small businesses in the area and construct a large shopping center for Chinese tourists. One night while Roo-mi is forcibly evicted from her shop by the Tae-san's thugs, her mother is accidentally killed in the violent clash. Roo-mi contacts her estranged father, Shin Seok-heon, to inform him of the death and subsequent funeral.   Seok-heon, a security guard who engages in petty theft, gains telekinetic powers after he drinks water from a mountain spring hit by a meteor. He arrives at his ex-wife's funeral where he witnesses a confrontation between his daughter and President Min, who manages Tae-san's operations. Min attempts to compensate Roo-mi for her loss, which she furiously rejects and demands that he leave the funeral. Seok-heon learns more about the turf war from Kim Jung-hyun, an attorney at law and Roo-mi's friend. Seok-heon tries to reconnect with Roo-mi but she is still hurt from his abandonment of her when she was a child. When he later tries to demonstrate his newfound ability, Roo-mi accuses Seok-heon of being an irresponsible parent.  The local shop owners join Roo-mi in a shared legal battle against Tae-san as they have been refused compensation for the loss of their businesses. While they barricade themselves in a shopping arcade, Tae-san's thugs arrive and begin beating them. Seok-heon arrives and uses his powers to fight off the assailants, leaving everybody around him in shock and wonder. When Min attempts to report the events to the police, the officer on duty does not believe him, which greatly delights the shop owners as they are glad to have Seok-heon on their side.  Seok-heon further uses his telekinesis to build a large barricade around the market area, protecting the local businesses. Meanwhile, Min meets up with Director Hong, the owner of Tae-san. She is aware of Seok-heon's powers and to protect Tae-san, she orders Min to shut down his business and pretend that the development contract has been terminated, before starting another company under a different name and drawing up a new contract to demolish the local businesses. She uses her connections to gain support from the police and creates a diversion by having Seok-heon arrested under false charges. After removing Seok-heon from the situation, Min and his thugs order the riot police and SWAT teams to arrest the shop owners and destroy the barricade. Roo-mi and the shop owners flee to a nearby building with the police in pursuit.  After seeing the situation on the news, Seok-heon breaks out of his jail cell and musters the ability to fly. He flies to the site and sees one of the shop owners falling from a balcony in the midst of the pursuit. Seok-heon rescues him and places him on a safe building. As the shop owners reach the rooftop of another building, the SWAT team arrives via a [[portable building]] suspended on a crane. They capture Roo-mi and drag her onto the building. Unfortunately, the crane malfunctions and Roo-mi falls out of the building. Seok-heon swoops in and saves her, before leaving her in the care of the escaped shop owners. He confronts Min, who is in attendance with the riot police, and kills him before turning himself into the police.  Four years later, Seok-heon is released from prison and is picked up by Jung-hyun, who announces his engagement to Roo-mi. They visit the location where Roo-mi's restaurant used to be, which is now empty and unoccupied land. Jung-hyun explains that Taesan's project was ultimately not profitable and construction has been delayed.   They arrive at Roo-mi's new restaurant, where Seok-heon reunites with his daughter and the local shop owners. He then uses his powers to serve drinks to the customers, much to everyone's delight. It is then revealed that Roo-mi named her new restaurant, "Superpower Chicken".

A Quiet Place (film)
 Over three months in 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been wiped out by sightless creatures with hypersensitive hearing that attack anything that makes noise. The Abbott family — wife Evelyn, husband Lee, congenitally deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau — silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. While out in the open, the family communicates with [[American Sign Language]] (ASL). Four-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-operated space shuttle toy, but his father takes it away. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries his father removed. Beau activates the shuttle when the family is walking home through the woods, near a bridge. Its noise makes him an instant target for a nearby creature, and he is swiftly killed.  More than a year later, Regan still struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn is in the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee is fruitlessly trying to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river to teach him to fish while Regan visits the memorial to Beau at the bridge where he was killed. Lee explains to Marcus that they will always be safe from the creatures so long as louder sounds mask their audible movements. Alone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor earlier than expected. While making her way to their house basement, she steps on a large nail. In pain, she accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others, and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].  Arriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. He finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son. The baby starts crying, attracting a creature, and they narrowly avoid another attack on the way to their improvised soundproofed barn basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, after promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn falls asleep but wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature is stalking her.  Regan hurries back to the farm. She and Marcus take refuge atop a [[grain silo]], lighting a fire to alert their father to their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door gives way and Marcus falls into the silo. He [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Regan jumps in and saves him. They avoid further danger by clinging to the fallen silo door and survive a subsequent creature attack by hiding under it. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a piercingly loud high-frequency sound that drives the creature away. The children escape from the silo and reunite with Lee.  The creature returns, and it attacks and wounds Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck. Due to its unpleasant sound, Regan turns her cochlear implant off, unaware of the fact that it would have potentially driven the creature away. Lee uses sign language to tell Regan and Marcus that he loves them and that he always loved Regan before sacrificing himself by yelling to draw the creature away from his children. Regan and Marcus roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the farmhouse.  The four retreat to the house's basement, which, to this point, was off-limits to the children. There, Regan sees her father's notes on the creatures and his experimentation with several different implants. When the creature returns to invade the basement, Regan realizes that the implant distresses the creature and hence she switches it back on and places it on a nearby microphone, magnifying the [[audio feedback|feedback]] to ward off the creature. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, which Evelyn shoots, killing it. The family views a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitor, showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, the members of the family arm themselves and prepare to fight back.

'''Sikander Singh''' ([[Salman Khan]]) is Shamsher's step son, while '''Sanjana''' ([[Daisy Shah]]) and '''Suraj''' ([[Saqib Saleem]]) are his twin children. '''Yash''' ([[Bobby Deol]]) is a close associate at Shamsher's empire and Sikander's confidante. In a flashback scene, it is revealed that '''Rana Vijay''' ([[Freddy Daruwala]]) is Shamsher's business rival and he creates problems for Shamsher's family business. As both Sanjana and Suraj age to 25 years, their family lawyer explains the will of their deceased mother ([[Nishigandha Wad]]). As per the will, the twins are entitled for 25% share each, and the rest 50% for Sikander. This visible disparity causes the twins to begin hating Sikander. Shamsher tells both of them that Sikander is the son of his elder brother '''Ranchor Singh''' ([[Milind Gunaji]]).  In a flashback, that portrays the [[Handia, Uttar Pradesh|Handia]] village of the 1970's, the history of the Singh family is depicted. Both the Singh brothers used to supply weapons to [[Indian army]]. Local politicians of Handia asked them for illegal weapons to which Ranchor refused. His refusal caused rivalry with a local politician. One day, during an ambush on Shamsher's truck, '''Vijendar Singh's''' ([[Manav Vij]]) son ('''Anurag Arora''') was killed by Ranchor's gunshot. One day, Ranchor died when his car was exploded by a bomb. The Singh family was then sought to be as a legitimized anti-state and accused of supplying weapons to enemies. Shamsher sends Sikander to [[Beijing]] for studies and takes Suraj, Sanjana and their widowed mother to [[Cambodia]].  Back to present day Al-Shifa, one night, Yash talks about his girlfriend. Sikander reveals that in Beijing he fell in love with a girl named '''Jessica''' ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]) who severed him. Shamsher's childhood friend '''Brijmohan''' ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]) tells him that his friend's hotel was used by politicians for their lascivious motives where all the activity was captured on a spy video camera and stored on a hard disk. The hard disk was kept at a bank's locker in Cambodia. Shamsher appoints Sikander for the recovery of the hard disk, and he promises him to get back the disk. The next day, during a party it is revealed that Jessica was actually Yash's girlfriend. Sikander and Jessica meet privately in the security room. The very next day, Suraj and Sanjana, who had recorded the Sikander-Jessica meet, screen the video to Yash. A furious Yash goes to Jessica's apartment and finds Sikander present with her. Sikander later tells him that both of their past interactions with Jessica were planned by Suraj and Sanjana, as part of their plan to destroy Sikander. Yash teams up with Sikander against the twins but pretends to be with the twins as well. Sikander, the twins, Yash and Jessica execute the mission to recover the hard disk.  After retrieving the hard disk, Shamsher eliminates Sikander by planting explosives in Sikander's car and heads to a conference with the politicians whose objectionable videos were stored on the disk. Shamsher tells about Sikander's death to the politicians, in the presence of the twins. He then plugs the hard disk and is shocked to find out that the disk was not the original one. Rather, it contained only one video of Sikander's mother. Sikander's mother self-filmed a video in which she reveals the truth that Ranchor was killed by Shamsher, and the twins were Ranchor's kids. Sikander arrives and tells how he escaped from the explosion, thanking to the timely intervention by '''Raghu Chacha''' ([[Sharat Saxena]]). He further reveals that he knew this secret for ten years and had been pretending to be loyal to Shamsher. Shamsher reveals that Yash is his real son. After a fight scene in the desert between Sikander and Yash, Sikander demolishes the entire army of Shamsher and makes both Yash and Shamsher surrender to Jessica who happens to be an Interpol officer. The arrested father-son duo are flown to their native village Handia.  Shamsher is seen bribing a police officer during jail proceedings, while Yash is seen to toning his body inside the prison cell.

Dr. Kerry Atkins, the lone surviving crew member, is ordered by CEO Claire Wyden to retrieve research canisters containing a pathogen. Atkins is able to flee in the escape pod when the station implodes, but it disintegrates upon re-entry, killing her. The falling pieces leave a trail of debris across the United States, including the [[Everglades]] in [[Florida]], where a canister is consumed by an [[American crocodile]], and a forest in [[Wyoming]], where a [[gray wolf]] is exposed to the pathogen.  [[Primatology|Primatologist]] Davis Okoye, a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Army Special Forces]] soldier and member of an anti-poaching unit, works at the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary. He befriends a rare [[Albinism|albino]] [[gorilla]] named George, whom he saved from poachers. Davis communicates with George using [[sign language]] and hand gestures. At night, one of the canisters crash-lands in George's habitat; George is exposed to the pathogen.  George grows considerably larger and more aggressive over time. Davis is contacted by Dr. Kate Caldwell, a genetic engineer, who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She had hoped to advance [[CRISPR]] research as a potential cure for diseases but discovered Energyne's plans to use it as a biological weapon. The company fired her and got her sent to prison for attempting to expose them. George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve. Davis calms him down, but George is captured by a government team led by Agent Harvey Russell and put on an airplane. Meanwhile, Claire and her brother, Brett, send a squad of mercenaries to capture the mutated wolf, Ralph, but they are all killed.  Claire, hoping to capture Ralph and use George to kill Kate so they can cover up their plans, uses a massive transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower]] to lure all three of the animals—who have been engineered to respond aggressively to a certain radio frequency—to [[Chicago]]. George reacts violently to the sound and causes the plane to crash, though Davis, Kate, and Russell parachute to safety. George, who also survives the crash, joins Ralph as they make their way to Chicago. Davis and Kate are aided by Russell in stealing a military helicopter to go to Chicago themselves.  By the time they arrive, George and Ralph are tearing through the city, with the military struggling to contain the two. The situation worsens when the mutated crocodile, Lizzie, arrives and joins George and Ralph. Davis and Kate make a plan to steal a counter-serum, hoping that they can turn the mutated animals back to normal. They are able to reach Energyne headquarters at the Willis Tower and take several vials of the serum, but they are caught by Claire and Brett. Claire reveals that the serum only eliminates the animals' enhanced aggressiveness, rather than revert them to their normal sizes. Claire shoots Davis, but he survives. When George climbs up to the top of the tower, Claire orders Davis to distract him while she attempts to escape with Kate held hostage at gunpoint. Kate slips a vial into Claire's handbag and pushes her towards George, who eats the terrorist alive along with the serum. Below, Russell takes incriminating evidence from Brett and lets him escape, albeit into the path of falling debris which crushes Brett to death. As the tower topples from damage, Davis and Kate survive by hovering in a damaged helicopter amidst the shower of debris.  With George returned to his normal personality, Davis stays in the city to help him defeat the other two monsters, while Kate and Russell rush to prevent the military from deploying a [[GBU-43/B_MOAB|MOAB]] against the creatures. George and Davis trick Ralph into flying into Lizzie's jaws, which decapitates him, but George is overpowered by Lizzie and heavily wounded. Davis distracts Lizzie but is nearly killed himself before George stabs Lizzie with a rebar through an eye, killing her. With the threat neutralized, the airstrike is aborted. George and Davis, joined by Kate and Russell, help clear the city of debris and evacuate civilians.

Wade refuses, whereupon Sorrento and his aide F'Nale Zandor bomb Wade's stack, killing Alice. Wade is taken to a Gunter hideout where he meets Art3mis' controller: Samantha Cook. They discover that Halliday had regretted something during a movie date with his love interest Kira. The High Five enter a re-creation of ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' where Aech, who had not watched the film, traverses a series of frightening events derived from scenes in the movie. Eventually, the group finds him and he shares a finding from when he was getting through the lodge. This ends up being the tip the group needed to get to the second key.   When Zandor discovers the hideout, Samantha helps Wade escape, but is captured and made into a Sixer for defaulting on her family's debt. Wade is extracted by the other High Five players—Aech / Helen Harris, Daito / Toshiro, and Sho / Zhou—who have been secretly running their avatars from Helen's [[postal truck]]. i-R0k activates a [[force field (fiction)|force field]] around the location of the third key - a fortress on [[Voltron|Planet Doom]]. After tricking Sorrento into revealing Samantha's location, Wade helps her escape and recruits the many OASIS players to join an all-out assault against Sorrento and the Sixers at the fortress. Hiding among the active Sixers, Samantha shuts down the force field. During the battle, the rebels, led by Aech on his [[The Iron Giant|Iron Giant]], defeat Sorrento's [[Mechagodzilla]]; Parzival zeroes out Samantha's avatar to let her escape IOI in reality.  Parzival and Sho find Sixers lining up to play on an [[Atari 2600]] console, but failing on each game after time expires, even when one of them beats ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]''. Sorrento activates the Cataclyst, which zeroes out everyone on Planet Doom; however, the curator's coin spares Parzival as an [[Life (gaming)|extra life]]. Parzival deduces that the goal is not to win ''Adventure'' but to simply find [[Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg|its own Easter egg]], and does so, revealing the third key. Inside a gate, Anorak presents Parzival a contract; however, Wade declines as it is similar to the one Morrow had signed that dissolved his partnership with Halliday. Anorak transforms into Halliday and affirms Wade's decision to be correct. After showing Parzival a [[Kill switch|Big Red Button]] that would shut down the OASIS permanently, Halliday officially awards him the Golden Egg as the winner of the contest.  Sorrento and Zandor are arrested after Aech had sent the police a recording of Sorrento admitting to having killed Alice during his interrogation. IOI's indentured players are freed from their debts, heavily restructuring the company. The High Five share control of the OASIS, with Wade hiring Morrow, who is revealed to be the archive curator, as a consultant. The OASIS resumes operations, but is shut down on Tuesdays and Thursdays to force people to spend more time in the real world, including Wade and Samantha who have formed a relationship and bought an apartment together.  
Red Sparrow
 In modern-day Russia, Dominika Egorova is a famed Russian ballerina who supports her ill mother. Following a career-ending injury, Dominika is approached by her uncle, Ivan, the Deputy Director of [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]]. She is tasked with seducing Dimitry Ustinov, a Russian gangster, in exchange for her mother's continued medical care. As Ustinov rapes her, he is killed by Sergei Matorin, an SVR operative authorized by Ivan. Ivan offers Dominika a choice to begin working for the SVR, or be executed so there are no witnesses to Ustinov's death.  Nate Nash is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative working in Moscow. While meeting with an asset in [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]], they are confronted by the police. Nash creates a diversion to ensure his asset, a mole in Russian ranks [[code-name]]d Marble, escapes unidentified. Nash is reassigned back to the U.S. but insists that he is the only individual whom Marble will work with. Since he cannot return to Russia, he is assigned to [[Budapest]], where he will regain contact with Marble.   Dominika is sent to State School 4, a specialist training schools for 'Sparrows', SVR operatives capable of seducing their targets. Dominika excels in her training, despite some friction with her trainers, and she is assigned to Budapest. Meanwhile the SVR has been tracking Nash, and hopes to find out the identity of Marble. Dominika's assignment is to gain the trust of Nash, and reveal his contact.  Upon her arrival in Budapest, Dominika lives with Marta Yelenova, another Sparrow. Her boss in Budapest is Maxim Volontov. Dominika quickly makes contact with Nash, who correctly determines that she is a Russian intelligence operative. Dominika reveals her true identity to him, as well as her motive to find out Marble's identity. Dominika inspects Marta's room, and realizes that she is working to gather information from Stephanie Boucher, the [[Congressional staff|chief of staff]] to a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]. Dominika claims to her uncle that she is helping in Marta's effort to gather information from Boucher.   Dominika offers to work for Nash as a [[double agent]]. She carries out Marta's assignment to meet Boucher, and covertly exchanges the supplied information for CIA-supplied [[floppy disks]]. On leaving the meeting place, Boucher sees American agents and is spooked. She unintentionally steps into traffic and is killed. Russian agents observing Boucher realize that the mission had been compromised. Dominika and Volontov are required to immediately return to Moscow. She is tortured and interrogated for days. Dominika returns to Budapest, and informs Nash that she wishes to defect with her mother to America.  After spending the night with Nash, Dominika awakes to find him being tortured by Matorin, who is attempting to discover the identity of Marble. She initially helps Matorin torture Nash, but turns on the executioner and kills him. She wakes in a hospital where General Vladimir Korchnoi reveals that he is Marble. He explains that he was initially patriotic, but grew to feel that Russia was corrupt. He fears he will be caught soon, and instead of dying in vain, instructs Dominika to reveal his identity to Ivan. She could then replace him as a mole and further their work by passing information to the CIA. But when Dominika contacts her superiors to reveal the identity of the mole, she frames her uncle Ivan rather than betray Korchnoi. Ivan is killed by the Russian side during a spy swap, and Dominika is congratulated for her work by her Russian superiors.   Back home in Russia, Dominika lives with her mother, and receives a phone call from an unknown person who plays [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Grieg’s piano concerto]] that she had listened to during her love affair with Nash.  
Rangasthalam

He earns a living by watering irrigational lands of the farmers of Rangasthalam, using a motor which belongs to another villager and his best friend Rangamma ([[Anasuya Bharadwaj]]), who he fondly calls Rangamma Atta (Aunt). Chitti Babu is in love with Ramalakshmi ([[Samantha Akkineni]]), the daughter of the village drunkard. Rangasthalam is shown to be run by the President Phanindra Bhoopathi ([[Jagapathi Babu]]), an influential, cruel landlord who runs the ‘Society’, which lends loans to farmers, but however, notes down higher amounts in the records and extracts high amounts from the poor farmers.  Chitti Babu’s elder brother Kumar Babu ([[Aadhi Pinisetty]]) works in [[Dubai]] and is very fond of Chitti Babu. He arrives in Rangasthalam but is disappointed at the happenings in the village. Realizing there must be a change in power, Kumar Babu signs a nomination for the position of President of Rangasthalam, being the first to do so in over 30 years, with the help of Dakshina Murthy, whose party Kumar Babu joins. Kumar Babu and Chitti Babu warn Phanindra Bhoopathi of the change in power in Rangasthalam. However, Rangamma tells Chitti Babu about her husband's ([[Rajeev Kanakala]]) death, who was businessman based in Dubai. He was murdered brutally when he stood up against Phanindra Bhoopathi. Rangamma warns Chitti Babu saying that many others also faced the same consequences when they stood up against Phanindra Bhoopathi. Chitti Babu, feeling scared, decides to safeguard Kumar Babu fearing for the latter’s life. He even resorts to withdrawing the nomination, but realizes his brother’s ambitions for developing Rangasthalam.  Chitti Babu eventually stumbles on a suspicious group of men and realizes Kumar Babu is going to be killed. Kumar Babu, who had gone to meet his girlfriend Padma ([[Pujita Ponnada]]) in the neighboring town, is attacked by hit men from outside the village. Chitti Babu manages to save the heavily injured Kumar Babu, but when they stop at a local shop for turmeric to cover the injuries, another man comes and slits Kumar Babu’s throat, and he dies. But before he dies, Kumar Babu tries to communicate something to Chitti Babu which he could not understand. To avenge his brother's murder, Chitti Babu and the villagers go to Phanindra Bhoopathi's house to attack, but fearing for his life, he escapes from Rangasthalam, after which Dakshina Murthy's accident takes place. Meanwhile, Rangamma is unanimously elected as the president of Rangasthalam.  The story now comes back to the present.

Kumar Babu, in his last moments, had said “Srimannarayana” to Chitti Babu, who realizes it is the name of Dakshina Murthy’s assistant ([[Amit Tiwari]]). Dakshina Murthy’s motive to murder Kumar Babu is revealed to be the latter’s relationship with Padma, who happens to be Dakshina Murthy’s daughter. Chitti Babu reveals he had already found Phanindra Bhoopathi hiding in Northern Rangasthalam and had beaten him to death, after which he wished to kill Dakshina Murthy when the latter was healthy and fit.

Samson (2018 film)
  A narration tells us how the [[Hebrews]] had done wrong and were thus put in the hands of the brutal [[Philistines]].  The Philistines are collecting food from Hebrews. In the back, Samson, a Hebrew from the tribe of Dan and his brother Caleb are attempting to steal food while Samson is telling riddles. However, they get caught and get chased through a city by Philistine soldiers.  In the meantime, Prince Rallah of the Philistines kills a Hebrew named Tobias for asking for more food.   When Samson and Caleb come back, his parents urge Samson to fight back against the Philistines since he was chosen to do so from birth. However, Samson prefers peace and is reluctant to do so.   King Balek orders his son Rallah to investigate a Hebrew with great strength but Rallah is reluctant.  While away, Samson and Caleb hear of a fights going on between a strong Philistine and multiple Hebrews. While Caleb sees this as a trap, Samson jumps in and defeats the strong Philistine. While doing so, he falls in love with a Philistine woman named Taren.   The man Samson beat turned out to be Taren's brother. Rallah kills him and imprisons Taren along with her father.   Caleb returns to present the money Samson won in his fight to their father Menoah, but he refuses to take it all to himself and asks Caleb to share with the entire tribe.   Meanwhile, Samson tracks down Taren and offers her to meet at a sea a later time. Rallah argues with his father Balek and with his partner Delilah. Samson and Taren share a number of meetings and fall in love with each other.  Samson goes to his parents to tell them about marrying Taren, but they advise him not to since she's a daughter of the enemy. Frustrated, Samson goes to a forest to find help and a sign from [[God]]. He finds a lion who he battles with his bare hands. Delilah hears of this potential marriage from Taren and advises Rallah to permit it, so that he'd get control of Samson.   Samson finds honey in the lion he slew a bit later. Finally, he organizes a wedding feast which Rallah attends. Rallah lies to Samson and makes him drink wine, which is against one of Samson's three [[Nazirite]] vows. Rallah offers riddles to Samson which he can't answer. Samson offers him a riddle in reply with a wager of 30 tunics. Rallah agrees. The riddle goes "Out of the eater, something to eat. Out of the strong, something sweet."   Rallah urges Taren to find the answer to the riddle (What is sweeter than honey and stronger than a lion) or face her and her father's death. She gets it out of Samson while Delilah is listening. Rallah eventually solves the riddle in front of Samson. Upset, he goes to a nearby village where the Philistines were holding three Hebrew girls.   The Philistines of the village prohibit Samson to drink water. When he continues to, one Philistine soldier puts a sword onto him and Samson kills him along with 29 other soldiers. The Hebrew girls run away and Samson takes the tunics of the soldier, reluctantly since this is breaking one of his three Nazirite vows of not touching the dead. Samson brings the tunics to Rallah only to find that Rallah had cancelled the marriage. Furious about not finding Taren and of Rallah's other actions, Samson runs away and puts fire onto foxes who burn the Philistine city in front of Rallah's eyes.   Rallah then takes Taren and her father and throws them into the fire from a large building in front of Samson's eyes.   Samson then runs away into a cave. Caleb finds him and offers him to fight back against the Philistines, who were waiting outside. Samson refuses and offers to be taken as a prisoner instead. When Rallah takes Samson prisoner, he also kills Menoah in front of his eyes before moving over to kill Samson. Samson then kills Rallah's entire army of 1000 with the jawbone of a donkey. Samson returns to his Danite village and gets sworn in as a Judge.   Some time passes. The Philistines are starving the Hebrews. Caleb wants Samson to fight back along with other Hebrews, but Samson instead offers to negotiate peace. He goes down to King Balek's palace, but the two come to no solution. Rallah gets the idea of using Delilah as a temptress to get to Samson. Samson goes to a partyhouse upon invitation of a Philistine lady. There, Delilah meets him and tells him of her admiration for Taren. The Philistine town found out about Samson being there and attempts to kill him. He uses God's strength and escaped from the town. Samson returns to his Danite village and bonds with his mother and asks her to pray for him.  Delilah offers Samson her shelter. They form a bond and eventually a relationship. Two Hebrews warn King Balek of a rebellion which has been planned by the Danites. Rallah cuts their heads and sends them to Caleb which makes Caleb go to the Philistines to attempt to attack. Delilah cuts Samson's hair after hearing that it was his final vow which he hadn't yet broken. She does so when he sleeps and he gets captured by the Philistines along with Caleb as Samson is blinded. After a disagreement, Rallah kills his father and takes his crown. In a Philistine prison, Delilah appears after regretting her action and offers to bail Samson out. However, he urges her to bail Caleb out instead which she does.  Samson then gets brought before a Philistine crowd where Rallah is now sitting as King as Samson's hair has grown back. He asks God for his forgiveness and brings the entire Philistine building to fall along with their idol.  We see a montage with Caleb narrating, showing Hebrews now fighting back against the Philistines. In the end, we see a young David who would take up against the Philistines and become Israel's king.

Sanju
 D. N. Tripathi, a lyricist, attempts to write a biography on [[Sanjay Dutt|Sanjay "Sanju" Dutt]], comparing him with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. A flabbergasted Sanjay has him thrown out. The [[Bombay High Court]] delivers its verdict regarding the [[1993 Bombay bombings]] and sentences Dutt to five years jail term for violating the [[Arms Act, 1959]]. His wife [[Manyata Dutt]] approaches Winnie Diaz, a London-based writer, to write Sanjay's biography and present his version of his life to the public. Although unwilling at first, Winnie is asked by Zubin Mistry, a real estate builder, to not write the biography, which intrigues her. Winnie first interviews Sanjay, and his life is revealed in a flashback.  Sanjay's father [[Sunil Dutt]] plans to launch his acting career in [[Bollywood]] with the film ''[[Rocky (1981 film)|Rocky]]'' (1981). Upset over his father's controlling behaviour on set, Sanjay is encouraged by his friend Zubin "God" Mistry to try drugs for the first time. Sanjay soon discovers that his mother [[Nargis]] is suffering from cancer and is taken to New York for treatment. This incident furthers his descent into alcoholism and drug addiction. He meets Kamlesh, a fan of Nargis, in New York, and they become quick friends. Kamlesh manages to make Sanjay stay his addiction; after learning of his girlfriend Ruby's fixed marriage due to his ongoing drug addiction, Sanjay relapses. Kamli convinces Ruby to register marry Sanjay; upset with his intoxicated behaviour, she leaves him. Nargis passes away three days before the release of ''Rocky'', which takes an emotional toll on Sanjay. Sanjay agrees to attend a rehabilitation centre in the United States, and eventually recovers with the help of his father and Kamlesh. On returning to India, he meets with God and beats him for selling him drugs.  The later part of Dutt's life is narrated by his now-estranged friend Kamlesh, who Winnie tracks down. In the 1990s, Sanjay turns to bodybuilding and his career in Bollywood has greatly improved. After the 1992 [[Babri Masjid]] demolition, Sanjay acquires three [[AK-56]] rifles to ensure the protection of his father, who had by then ventured into politics, and sister, [[Priya Dutt]]. A [[1993 Bombay bombings|series of bombings occur]] in Bombay shortly thereafter. Sanjay is arrested in 1993 for possession of illegal arms supposedly supplied by the [[D-Company]] to be trafficked for protection during potential communal rioting after the bombings. Sanjay is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years under [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA), threatening his career. Indian media labels him as a terrorist, further tarnishing his public image. Believing Sanjay to be guilty, Kamlesh severs ties with him.  After his release in 1995, Sanjay appears in a string of flops. When his popularity had begun to wane, he is signed for the [[Munna Bhai|title role]] in ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' (2003), co-starring his father. Sanjay's performance garners him the [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role]] and his public image improves, making his father proud. Shortly afterwards, his father passes away.

He exits the jail and reunites with [[Manyata Dutt|Manyata]].  
Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold
 In an old, condemned theater, [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and his friends are chasing down the ghost of Perpetto the Puppeteer, who has been robbing precious jewelry off late. While [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] has rigged a net trap to catch the Puppeteer, Scooby and [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] burst in on him before he can finish setting it up. But just before the Puppeteer can catch them, [[Batman]] arrives and drives him away, and afterwards warns the gang to keep away from this case for their own safety. When the Puppeteer attacks again, Fred overpowers Perpetto and his hench-puppet, and the gang unmasks them as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Detective Chimp]]. As Batman and his associates reveal afterwards, the Puppeteer scam was actually an initiation test for Mystery Inc. to join the ranks of ''Mystery Analysts of [[Gotham City|Gotham]]''. But as they take their leave, a ghostly, red-cloaked figure watches them.  About a week later, Batman, [[Aquaman]] and [[Question (comics)|The Question]] meet and take down [[Riddler]], [[Catwoman]] and [[Killer Croc]] just before the impending meeting of the Mystery Analysts and their newest recruits. Mystery Inc. later arrives at the Analysts' headquarters, where they additionally meet Question, [[Black Canary]] and [[Plastic Man]], as well as Aquaman, who invites himself (in a very transparent disguise) to the meeting despite not being a detective. Mystery Inc. is asked to take the lead in the next case for the Analysts, but when they draw out a file to a case left unsolved by Batman, the Dark Knight becomes strangely defensive about it. When an alarm sounds from Gotham Chemical Storage, the assembled Mystery Analysts head for the warehouse, where they find that several phials with a radioactive isotope have been stolen. Then the red-cloaked figure from the old theater appears before them, calling himself Crimson Cloak and swearing revenge on Batman and Gotham for making him into a ghost. Crimson Cloak sets the storage on fire, detonating the volatile chemicals stored within, but the Analysts escape the blast with Plastic Man's help.  While the super heroes put out the fire, Batman sends Mystery Inc. to a diner to rejoin them later. There, the gang is accosted by [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] for suspected participation in the isotope theft until Batman intervenes on their behalf. Batman then tells them that, despite Crimson Cloak's statements, he has never encountered or found any clues about this mysterious villain before. Following the gang's questions, he reveals the tale about his single unsolved case: Many years ago, at the start of his crime-fighting career, Batman attempted to stop [[Professor Milo]] from completing an experiment with faulty teleport technology. But the vortex created by the device claimed the life of one of Milo's assistants, Leo Scarlett, a failure that has haunted Batman since that time. He and the gang discover that the likely suspects behind the Crimson Cloak would be either Sam Scarlett, Leo's father, or the Riddler, who was Milo's second henchman Dr. Wade Magny.  In order to question the Riddler about Crimson Cloak, Batman and Mystery Inc. visit him at [[Arkham Asylum]], but Riddler merely taunts Batman with the prospect of doom by the Cloak's hands, which makes Scooby and Shaggy run off in fear. While looking for them, Batman, Fred, [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] and [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] re-encounter Crimson Cloak, who releases the other inmates from their cells. The investigators just barely manage to escape their clutches and seal them inside the asylum, thereby ending up in the facility's cemetery, where they discover a footprint in a blob of clay. But as they return to the [[Scooby-Doo|Mystery Machine]], they are intercepted by Bullock and the other Mystery Analysts (sans Aquaman), who attempt to arrest them for the isotope theft due to fake evidence planted in the van. Batman and Mystery Inc. make a run for it, making them hunted fugitives.  Shaking off their law-enforcing pursuers and some additional super-villainous opposition, Batman takes the gang to the [[Batcave]] and leaves them there to return to Milo's old laboratory for clues. Rejoined by Aquaman and Question, who refuse to believe the false accusations made against Mystery Inc., Batman finds Milo's teleporter restored by Crimson Cloak, who promptly attacks and incapacitates the heroes. Later, Batman awakes to see himself, alongside Aquaman, tied above the teleporting machine, which Crimson Cloak activates in order to desintegrate his opponents; but as he does so, the Cloak suddenly goes into convulsions, which tell Batman who Crimson Cloak really is.  At the same time, when Velma attempts to analyse the footprint in the clay, the clay suddenly comes to life and attacks. After overcoming it with a Bat-Dehydrator, Mystery Inc. deduces the villain's true identity for themselves: Basil Karlo, also known as [[Clayface]]. They try to inform Batman, but learn that he has been captured by the Cloak; and after equipping themselves with the old costumes and gadgets of [[Bat Family|Batman's former sidekicks]], they arrive just in time to stop the teleporter and incapacitate Clayface with the Dehydrator. Defeated and exposed, Clayface admits that he restored the machine for the Riddler and stole the isotopes to power it, in return for a cure against the gradual decay of his body. The Riddler sitting in Arkham is revealed to be a clay decoy, and the Question is unmasked as the real Riddler, who had taken Question's place during the fight before the Analysts' meeting.  Before he can be taken into custody, however, the Riddler escapes back into the lab. He reactivates the teleporter and prepares to use the vortex's power as a superweapon to destroy Gotham, but is knocked out by the vengeful Question. The vortex grows out of control, but at the same time a human shape begins to manifest in it. Working together, Mystery Inc. and the super heroes reverse the device's polarity, allowing Batman and Scooby to drag the figure free of the vortex before the machine self-destructs. The figure is revealed to be Leo Scarlett, who was not disintegrated by the vortex but instead caught in an interdimensional void, and is now happily reunited with his father. With the case resolved and their names cleared, Mystery Inc. reveals that they have also discovered Batman's true identity, but promises to keep that secret safe. As a final gag, Batman intends to reward Scooby with a snack for his achievements in the case, only to have Shaggy beat him to it.  
Scorched Earth (2018 film)
 In the not-too-distant future, the world is ravaged by brutal climate changes, colloquially known as the Cloud Fall. The combination of pollution and relentless mining of Earth's resources through industrialism has left the environment nearly unlivable and extremely hostile to human habitation. Humanity is forcefully reverted to a simpler lifestyle, relying on barter for the two most valuable resources now: Water purifiers, called tabs, and silver, ground up to line the interior of breathing masks, to keep out a painful and fatal airborne disease known as Black Lung.  Lawlessness arises, and driving vehicles that use fossil fuel is outlawed. Anyone caught driving such a vehicle was given the maximum sentence, and numerous people have become bounty hunters, bringing in drivers and other lawbreakers in exchange for tabs and silver, dead or alive. Gage, a bounty hunter, tortures Womack, a follower of an outlaw named Chavo, leaves him in the wilderness, then locates and kills Chavo after a brutal fight, freeing several pilgrims in the process. She brings the body back to claim the reward from Sheriff Grubbs, a slightly corrupt and greedy lawman of New Montana. While there, she visits Doc, her mentor and friend. He tells her of a massive reward for Thomas Jackson, an unusually industrious outlaw who is building a shelter-town for criminals, calling it Defiance. Gage decides she wants to try taking him down alone. Doc warns that every bounty hunter that tried has been killed and strung up as a warning to other would-be bounty hunters.  Masquerading herself as Chavo, Gage makes it into Defiance unchallenged. Jackson's right-hand man, Lear, is distrustful of Gage, but is unable to prove anything, and Gage endears herself to Jackson by saving his life when Grubbs and a posse sneak into Defiance to try taking him out. Jackson decides to include Gage in his plans, which includes enslaving the entire region to work in the silver mines near his town, he offers Gage 15% of the cut of the profits in exchange for her services as a gunfighter, and unintentionally revealing a scar on his forearm, which Gage's sister had made when she bit him, before he killed her. Shortly after, Jackson took Gage, Lear and several men to capture pilgrims with armored vehicles and armed escorts. Among the pilgrims is Beatrice, one of the women Gage saved from Chavo earlier. She warns the woman to be quiet and patient. While Jackson and his men celebrate, Gage urges Melena, Jackson's girlfriend, to leave Defiance that night, revealing her identity as a bounty hunter.  She apprehends Jackson, but is captured immediately, having been betrayed by Melena, and also identified by Womack, who was now terminally infected by black lung. They briefly torture Gage, then Womack drives her out into the wilderness, and dumps her in a gorge. She survives the fall, and manages to get back to New Montana, but contracted a severe case of black lung. Doc revives her and tends her wounds, and together, the two plot to take down Jackson and the entire town of Defiance. They liberate Beatrice and the other captives from the silver mine, then engage the entire town. Gage severely wounds Lear, and is saved from a sniper by a repentant Melena. Gage pursues Jackson to the mines and fights with him, leaving him to die in an explosion using dynamites.  She returns to the town, where a wounded Doc had managed to dispatch Lear for good, cuts down the corpses hanging in the town entrance, and transports Doc back to New Montana by stretcher.

Skyscraper (2018 film)
 Standing at 3,500 feet (1,100 m) and 240 stories tall, high level Asian financier Zhao Jong Li has financed the construction of the [[List of tallest buildings|world's tallest]] [[skyscraper]] in [[Hong Kong]], which they call "The Pearl".  Although the construction nears completion on this super-skyscraper with all the floors already constructed, the construction process has not been without complications.  Halfway through the construction process, rival gangsters under the control of Kores Botha, an [[international]] [[terrorist]] with ties to many major crime syndicates, decide to use their control of construction crews working on the [[skyscraper]] to extort millions of dollars in shakedown payments for preventing a massive strike of construction workers, potentially halting its progress. Zhao agree to the shakedown amounts, but not without carefully tracking and recording Botha's international money laundering scheme in his attempt to "legitimize" the funds he has extorted. Zhao believes that the memory card they have created containing the [[money laundering]] tracking information on Botha will provide them with insurance against any attempt by Botha to extort money from them a second time. Botha learns of the existence of the memory card and makes it a personal priority to retrieve the [[memory card]] in order to destroy it and the incriminating information it contains, because his bosses will kill him if he doesn’t.  Meanwhile, a former [[FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]] leader and U.S. [[war veteran]], Will Sawyer, now assesses [[security]] for skyscrapers. Although having one leg amputated from the knee down from a previous mission, he is fitted with a modern [[prosthetic leg]], which keeps his full mobility. Sawyer is tasked with inspecting the Pearl, and Sawyer confirms to Zhao, security officers Sawyer’s friend and fellow ex-FBI agent Ben and Adrian Okeke, and insurance agent Mr. Pierce, the building’s fire and security systems are secure, but he needs to inspect the offsite security center that controls the system. Sawyer is given a tablet that will work only for him due to facial recognition software filled with information on the systems.  Ben reveals he is working with Botha so that he can ruin Sawyer out of jealousy, before attacking Sawyer to steal the tablet. Ben is mortally wounded, and warns Sawyer that Botha’s men will kill him for the tablet. Botha’s subordinate Xia steals the tablet, before infiltrating the security site and killing everyone there. Botha and his team of mercenaries ignite the 96th floor of the building, blocking access to all higher floors and knocking out the computer controlled advanced [[Fire extinguisher|fire extinguishing]] hardware meticulously constructed throughout the skyscraper. The flames cause an impenetrable fire line on the 96th floor, cutting off all rescue operations from below to assist survivors on the upper floors. A [[hacker]] cuts off the security systems above the 95th floor, before Xia shoots him so as to make sure they can’t be turned back on. The police, believing that Sawyer is involved, capture him. Sawyer, knowing that his family is trapped on the floors directly above the blazing fire, breaks free from the police. Inspector Wu sends a team of officers to capture Sawyer, as Wu wishes to question him. Sawyer climbs a crane and breaks into the building, escaping Wu’s team.  Zhao and Akeke send two security guards to rescue Sarah, Georgia, and Henry from the fire, but the guards are killed in an explosion that destroys the nearby elevator, forcing them to navigate through the fire to the top floors, having been told to by Sawyer in a phone call. Zhao and Akeke, believing that Sarah, Georgia and Henry are dead, decide to evacuate all remaining personnel on board a helicopter, only to discover it was a trap set by Botha and that Pierce works for Botha. Akeke and the other workers are killed by Botha’s men, but Zhao escapes and seals himself in a [[penthouse]]. Upon nearly reaching the 96th floor, Sawyer decides his only hope is to now scale the building from the outside by climbing up the girders and columns left exposed by the terrorist's sabotaging of the building, and makes it to his family. Pierce attacks them, having been ordered to capture Sawyer’s family, but Sawyer pushes Pierce off a bridge and into the raging fire. They become partially separated in the chaos of the growing fire which is spreading to higher floors, but Sawyer manages to get Sarah and Henry to a partially functioning elevator. Sarah and Henry use the elevator for a free-fall escape with the plan to engage the emergency brakes to reach the ground safely. Upon reaching the ground floor, Sarah helps the police identify Botha as the ringleader. Sarah then explains to the police that she saw the terrorists carrying parachutes, which explained how the [[terrorists]] planned to escape from the building.  When Sawyer finally locates Georgia, she has been abducted by Botha who uses her to negotiate his own escape from Sawyer and force him to capture Zhao. Sawyer disables the doors to the penthouse, but informs Zhao of his predicament. Zhao reveals the reasons for Botha’s attack, and they plan to rescue Georgia. Sarah accompanies Inspector Wu and several other police officers to the parachute landing site, where they engage in a shootout with Xia and Botha’s men. Most of Botha’s men are killed, while Sarah knocks Xia unconscious. Sawyer pretends to give Zhao to Botha, only for Zhao to distract him and Sawyer to rescue Georgia. Zhao, Sawyer, and Georgia escape into the top of the Pearl, where Botha and his remaining men follow them. Zhao and Sawyer kill Botha’s men, but Botha injures Zhao and takes Georgia hostage. Sawyer attacks Botha and pushes him into a hole, and Botha is killed by an exploding grenade.  Meanwhile, Sarah discovers the stolen tablet and discovers that she can override the shutdown of the high-tech fire extinguishing capability built into the [[skyscraper]] by [[rebooting]] the [[computer system]]. The [[fire]] is rapidly brought under control, and a police helicopter rescues Sawyer, Georgia, and Zhao, who tells Sawyer he plans to repair the Pearl. Sawyer and Georgia reunite with Sarah and Henry, and the family leaves the premises.  
Sicario: Day of the Soldado

In response, the United States government gives [[CIA]] agent Matt Graver permission to use extreme measures to combat [[Mexican drug cartels]], who are suspected of having transported the Islamic terrorists across the border. Graver and the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] decide the best option is to start a war between the major cartels, and Graver recruits [[black operative]] Alejandro Gillick for the mission. Gillick kills a high-profile lawyer of the [[Gulf Cartel|Matamoros cartel]] in [[Mexico City]], and later Graver and his team kidnap Isabela Reyes, the daughter of the kingpin of their rival, in a [[false flag]] operation.  Graver, Gillick, and their team take Isabela to Texas and stage a "rescue" with the [[DEA]] and local police to make her think she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. Gillick bonds with Isabela and the team attempts to transport her back to Mexico, planning to leave her in territory controlled by her father's rivals in order to further escalate the conflict. However, the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Mexican police]] escort for their trip back across the border double-crosses them and attacks the U.S. vehicles in an ambush. Graver and his team are forced to kill dozens of [[Corruption in Mexico|corrupt]] Mexican policemen to escape the ambush.   Isabela runs away amidst the chaos and Gillick goes after her alone. Meanwhile, the U.S. government determines that at least two of the suicide bombers in Kansas City were actually U.S. citizens from New Jersey, not foreign nationals -- and thus were not smuggled into the United States from  Mexico by the drug cartels. In order to quell tensions with Mexico, the U.S. president orders the CIA to abandon the mission and [[plausible deniability|erase all proof]] of U.S. involvement by having Isabela executed as part of the cover-up. Therefore Graver orders Gillick to kill Isabela, but he refuses and turns rogue to keep her alive. Graver assembles his team to hunt them both in Mexico. Gillick and Isabela try to enter the United States disguised as [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]], as it would be illegal for the CIA to execute Isabela on U.S. territory.   Miguel, a Mexican-American "[[coyote (person)|coyote]]", recognizes Gillick from a chance encounter in a parking lot. He alerts his boss, and Gillick and Isabela are captured. They force Miguel to execute Gillick. Miguel hesitates and unwillingly shoots Gillick in the head and the gang leaves him for dead. Miguel is disappointed with the gang and leaves them after this incident. Graver and his team track the Mexican gang and Isabela with the help of the GPS transmitter that she was wearing and kill all the gang members. Graver takes pity on Isabela and brings her back to the United States to put her in witness protection rather than following his orders to kill her. Meanwhile, Gillick wakes up finding the bullet went through his jaw, takes one of the gang members' cars, and drives for the border. One year later, Gillick, having recovered from his injuries, finds Miguel  and asks him if he wants to become a [[wiktionary:sicario|sicario]].

  On the planet [[Corellia]], orphaned children are made to steal in order to survive. Lovers Han and [[Qi'ra]] make an escape from the clutches of a local gang. They bribe an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] officer with stolen coaxium, a powerful hyperspace fuel, in exchange for passage on an outgoing transport, but Qi'ra is apprehended by their pursuers before she can board. Han vows to return for her and joins the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet. When the recruiting officer asks for his surname, Han says he is alone with no family, so the recruiter gives him the last name "Solo".  Three years later, Han is expelled from the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination and is serving as an infantryman on Mimban. He encounters a group of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by Tobias Beckett. Han attempts to blackmail them into taking him with them, but Beckett has him arrested for desertion and thrown into a pit to be fed to a beast – a [[Wookiee]] named Chewbacca. Able to understand Chewbacca's language, Han persuades him to cooperate to escape. Beckett rescues and enlists them in the gang to steal a shipment of coaxium on Vandor-1. The plan goes awry when the Cloud Riders show up, led by Enfys Nest, resulting in the deaths of two crew members, Rio Durant and Beckett’s wife Val, and the destruction of the coaxium.  Beckett reveals he was ordered to steal the shipment for Dryden Vos, a high-ranking crime boss in the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Han and Chewbacca volunteer to help him steal another shipment to repay the debt. They travel to Vos's yacht where Han finds Qi'ra, who has joined Crimson Dawn and is Vos's top lieutenant. Han suggests a risky plan to steal unrefined coaxium from the mines on [[Kessel (Star Wars)|Kessel]]; Vos approves but insists that Qi'ra accompany the team. She leads them to Lando Calrissian, an accomplished smuggler and pilot who she hopes will lend them his ship. Han challenges Lando to a game of sabacc, with the wager being Lando's ship. Lando cheats to win but agrees to join the mission in exchange for a share of the profits.  After reaching Kessel in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and infiltrating the mine, Lando's droid co-pilot L3-37 instigates a slave revolt. In the confusion, they steal the coaxium, but L3 is severely damaged and Lando is injured during the escape. With the help of L3's navigational computer, hotwired into the ship's systems, Han [[Millennium Falcon#Kessel Run|pilots the ship through a dangerous uncharted route]] to elude an Imperial blockade. The ''Falcon'', badly damaged, lands on the planet Savareen to process the coaxium.  During a confrontation with Enfys, who tracked the team from Vandor, Lando flees in the ''Falcon''. Enfys explains to Han that she and her crew are not pirates, but rebels trying to prevent the syndicates and Empire from gaining power. Han becomes sympathetic to their cause and tries to trick Vos, but Beckett has already alerted him to the double-cross. Vos sends his guards to kill Enfys, but the Cloud Riders overpower them instead, leaving Vos defenseless. Having anticipated Vos's strategy, Han tries to take the coaxium, only for Beckett to betray Vos, escaping with it and taking Chewbacca hostage. Qi'ra kills Vos and sends Han after Beckett; once alone, she contacts Vos's superior, [[Darth Maul|Maul]], to inform him of the mission's failure and claim Vos's position. She avoids speaking of Han's involvement, instead blaming everything on Beckett.  Han catches up to Beckett and confronts him. Han shoots Beckett first before he can shoot him, and with his dying words Beckett tells Han he made the smart choice. Qi’ra leaves in Vos’ yacht, while Han and Chewbacca turn the coaxium over to Enfys. She offers Han a chance to join the rebellion against the Empire; when he declines, she gives him a vial of coaxium, enough to buy a ship of his own. Han and Chewbacca locate Lando and challenge him to a rematch in sabacc, once again wagering the ''Falcon''. Han wins, having stolen the card Lando was keeping up his sleeve in order to cheat, and he and Chewbacca leave for [[Tatooine]], where a "[[Jabba the Hutt|big-shot gangster]]" is putting together a job.

Sorry to Bother You (film)
 In an alternate present-day version of Oakland, ads for a company called WorryFree offer a life free of the worry of paying bills and free food and lodging, but at the cost of a lifetime contract of working, a practice deemed legal and not equivalent to [[slavery]]. A radical group called "The Left Eye" oppose WorryFree and vandalize their advertisements and protest. Cassius "Cash" Green lives in his uncle Sergio's garage with his girlfriend Detroit, and the only job he can find is working as a telemarketer at the RegalView company with his friend Sal. At RegalView, Cassius initially has trouble selling to customers, before an older coworker, Langston, teaches him to use his "white voice" to sell. Cash finds success using his white voice, and his manager suggests he'll soon be promoted to the elusive and mysterious position of "Power Caller".  Cash joins a union led by his coworker Squeeze to lobby for raises. However, despite disrupting work as part of the union, Cash is still promoted to Power Caller. In the Power Caller suite, Cash learns to only use his white voice, and that RegalView sells weaponry and human labor from WorryFree. Cash stops participating in the union, claiming he still supports them from the sidelines, and his relationship with Detroit starts to deteriorate.  After more sales, Cash is invited to a party with Steve Lift, the CEO of WorryFree. Lift goes to a meeting with Cash after the party, and Cash snorts the cocaine Lift offers him. Looking for the bathroom, Cash goes into the wrong door and finds a half-horse, half-human hybrid begging for help. Cash drops his phone and runs into Lift, who tries to calm him down by explaining how WorryFree are planning to make their workers into half-horse, half-human hybrids, referred to as "equisapiens," by getting them to snort a gene-modifying powder similar to cocaine. Lift explains he wants Cash to become an equisapien and act as a revolutionary figure among them to keep them in line, offering Cash $100 million for 5 years, after which he can take a "defusing powder" and return to his normal self.  Cash becomes worried he was tricked into snorting the gene powder and visits Detroit, who tells him she received a video message from his missing phone, which turns out to be a cry for help from the equisapiens and Lift abusively yelling at them. To make the video viral, Cash goes on a reality show called "I Got the S#*@ Kicked Out of Me!" to get the video played. The plan backfires, as WorryFree's stock reaches an all-time high with the reveal of their scientific advancement. Cash apologizes to Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit. The union decides to make one last stand in the picket line, now joined by Cash.  The next day, the callers and police get into a riot, and Cash is knocked out by an officer. Later that night, Cash wakes up in a police wagon and witnesses the equisapiens fighting back against the police, easily overpowering the police with their superior strength. They then free him, Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit, and run off to keep fighting.  With everything seemingly returning back to normal, Cash suddenly grows massive nostrils on his face. A fully transformed Cash subsequently then leads the other equisapiens into Lift's house, breaking down the door and roaring at him.

Mac receives a call from his former boss, Captain O'Hagen ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Cox]]), to gather the group and meet for a fishing trip in Canada.  Once the group arrives, they find that O'Hagen's intention had been for them to have a meeting with Vermont Governor Jessman ([[Lynda Carter|Carter]]).  She explains that during a recent land survey, it was discovered that land in Canada was originally designated for the U.S.  Canada has agreed to hand over the land, and Gov. Jessman needs to set up a police department to take over from the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] in the region.

In retaliation, the State Troopers kidnap the Mounties and release them in the woods.  They then don Mountie uniforms, and attempt to discredit their Canadian counterparts by performing pranks on the people they pull over.  However, their pranks are cut short when Le Franc reveals that he will use the serious crime of impersonating an officer to keep the territory from becoming American.  The State Troopers, realizing that they will not be given their original jobs after failing at this task, intend to return to America.  During a botched highway stop, Farva and Mac encounter another cache of drugs and cell phones, as well as assault rifles.  The troopers realize that these items are all more valuable in the U.S. than in Canada, and that someone has been planting these items around the town in preparation for the turnover to the U.S, to avoid having to cross the border.  Back at the station, Genevieve, who has been flirting with Rabbit, arrives, and the two begin to have sex, only to be attacked and carried-off.  The rest of the State Troopers learn about Rabbit's kidnapping by reviewing his dash-cam, and suspect the Canadian Mounties are involved.  Using a cell-phone triangulator on the counterfeit phones, the State Troopers arrive at a sawmill.  They encounter the Mounties, only to realize the Mounties had suspected the State Troopers as the drug smugglers. Guy Le Franc reveals himself as the leader of the smuggling operation, and has captured Genevieve and Rabbit and tied them to a board placed on the saw.  Genevieve reveals herself to be a double-agent working for Le Franc, and the groups engage in a shootout.  The State Troopers and Mounties are successful, and Rabbit is rescued.  Le Franc and his employees are arrested, and Genevieve reveals that she is part of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and working undercover.  Gov. Jessman arrives to congratulate the officers in their success. At a press conference, the Canadian Mounties congratulate their American counterparts, and give praise for their efforts.  Gov. Jessman announces that, due to the hidden contraband, the territory will remain in Canadian control for the time being, causing both nations' officers to insult each other and begin brawling once again.  In a mid-credits scene, body-cam footage is shown from the ill-fated ride along with Fred Savage.  The police officers have been called to rescue a cat out of a tree.

Tag (2018 film)
  Hogan "Hoagie" Malloy, Bob Callahan, Randy "Chilli" Cilliano, Kevin Sable, and Jerry Pierce have been playing tag since they were nine years old, starting in 1983, during the month of May. Since then, the group’s main rule of the game is that the last one tagged is “it,” until next season. With  Hoagie having been the last one tagged in the previous year, he first recruits Bob, the CEO of an insurance company, and then Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry, who has seemingly never been tagged because of his strong athleticism and intelligence. Hoagie tells them that Jerry plans to retire after this year's game because of his upcoming marriage. Rebecca Crosby, a [[Wall Street Journal]] reporter doing a piece on Bob, joins them and decides to write an article on the friends. They are also accompanied by Hoagie's outgoing wife Anna.   Once they arrive at their hometown of [[Spokane, Washington]], they locate Jerry and lure him to the local country club, but they are overwhelmed by Jerry's skill. Jerry then introduces his fiancee Susan. As the others express disappointment over not being invited to the wedding despite their close relationship, Jerry knew he would almost certainly be tagged or at least targeted during the ceremonies. They agree to not play the game at any wedding-related events in exchange for invitations to the wedding. Despite this, the group makes several attempts to tag Jerry both before and right after wedding-related events.  The group sneaks into his house at night, but are forced to leave when Jerry sets up a convincing ruse that he is in Hoagie’s bedroom. The next morning, Hoagie disguises himself as an elderly woman and ambushes Jerry at the mall, but is defeated and humiliated. Then, at a rehearsal dinner at the country club, Jerry invites Cheryl Deakins, Bob and Chilli’s high school crush, to distract the group, and the attempt to tag Jerry leaves Hoagie, Chilli, and Kevin all caught in painful traps, set by Jerry. During the rehearsal dinner, Susan reveals to the guys that she is pregnant.  Defeated, the group try to build a new plan. After finding out Jerry attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings, the group decide to strike his next meeting, which is on his wedding day. In preparation, they lock every exit and dress up as members of AA. They make their move and almost tag Jerry, but once he finds himself trapped, Jerry retreats to the communion wine storage. He stays there for hours as the guys besiege the room, until Susan comes by, with the wedding just a few hours away. Susan berates Jerry for risking their wedding for a childish game but suddenly appears to fall faint and have a miscarriage. Jerry comes out to help. Chilli is convinced that it is a ruse, but the situation seems authentic, and Jerry himself also tells them he is not playing around and the two leave.  The guys receive texts that the wedding is postponed due to the potential miscarriage. However, a suspicious Anna sees that the bridesmaids all made similar Instagram posts.

The Swan Princess: A Royal Myztery
 Queen Uberta has written a book called "Queen U to the Rescue!" Where she details a (fictional) account of how she saved the kingdom from Count Antonio, and saw through his fake proposal for marriage. In the morning, she wakes up to find a "Z" slashed into the cover of her book, and Lord Rogers thinks she did it by accident with her long, sharp fingernails.  Alise and Lucas are staying in Borromeo, while Lucas and his family plant tulips for King Sebastian. Lord Rogers kept Antonio's submarine so he can make a blueprint of how it works and use it for good, but someone slashes a "Z" into the blueprint. Similar marks are made on Speed and Jean-Bob, and rats are believed to be making the marks.  Prince Derek and Princess Odette learn that they have both been marked also, and they go to the kingdom of Borromeo to make sure the children are all right. Puffin flies over the kingdom and sees another "Z" slashed in the tulip garden, and Scully's ghost reappears and reveals he saw a Man in Black on a rooftop spying on them, and whistle to command the rats. The rats chew through a chandelier that falls and almost hits Prince Derek, but Scully pushes him out of the way.  The kings guards tell Prince Derek that Nicolo, imprisoned, wishes to speak to him to reveal information about the Man in Black. Nicolo is revealed to have gone mad in his cell, developing a split personality, and obsessing over Queen Uberta's book. He warns Prince Derek that Count Antonio survived, and is back for revenge. Derek brushes this off, as Antonio sailed into a hurricane and no one could have survived.  Scully tried tracking down the Man in Black, but is being chased by the ghost of one of the Boggs, who wishes to capture Scully for helping the "pink bellies" escape the island while they were shipwrecked. Scully distracts them with a trial, and manages to escape and tell Puffin to get Rogers help. Lord Rogers has a glass jar used for holding a ghost, as glass is the only thing that can hold a ghost, as well as a ghost rope.  Odette decides to track the Man in Black by following the rats, with the help of Number 9 at the King's Assistance. She's almost lead into a trap, but realizes the trap was meant for Derek, and that all of this has been about Derek. When Derek falls into the same trap, he escapes when the King’s guards chase off the Man in Black. Derek learns that Antonio's last name was Zambrano, and that he really is back and is indeed the Man in Black, as Nicolo said. Derek warns King Sebastian.  Lord Rogers learns that putting something in his ghost trapping jar temporarily makes it transparent like a ghost, and puts gloves and trackers in it so he can track Scully and the Bogg ghost chasing him. With the help of Lucas and Alise, they get the tracker on him and are able to track him so Scully can find the Man in Black.  Derek and Odette visit Nicolo again, who warns them that Antonio is after the children, and they learn that the children are in fact missing. They go back to Nicolo's cell and find a hidden passage, that leads them to where Lucas and Alise are being held captive. Derek frees them but is soon captured himself, and Odette gets the children out before Nicolo reveals himself. He reveals to Derek that Antonio isn't really alive, he himself was the Man in Black all along, and the rats helped him mark Derek and his friends for revenge. He says Queen Uberta’s book helped him learn who all was responsible for his imprisonment. Derek asks him about the Z's, and Nicolo reveals they were actually N's.  The Bogg ghost manages to capture Scully, but Scully pleads with him to free him long enough to help his friends, with the promise that he'll return to face his punishment. The Bogg agrees, and Scully returns to find Nicolo holding Prince Derek on the dock. Princess Odette and everyone race to the dock, but are too late to stop Nicolo from trapping Prince Derek in a prototype for the submarine and dropping it into the sea.  Scully goes down into the submarine with Prince Derek, so Lord Rogers can give Derek instructions on how to make the submarine work. One of Nicolo's rats frees Derek from his binds so he can work the controls. Rogers instructs him to use a flat [[Wrench|wrench]] as a make-shift lever to replace the one Nicolo broke off so Derek couldn't free himself. Derek starts losing air, and isn’t strong enough to pull the lever. The Bogg ghost returns, and scares the rat so it jumps on the lever, and the submarine floats up to the surface, freeing Derek.   Scully asks the Bogg for a chance to say goodbye, but the Bogg tells him he is free to go. Derek and Odette tell Queen Uberta that her book gave Nicolo the motivation for revenge, and she sees this as an opportunity to write a sequel.

Ted's father Arne warns him of the expenses of being a tennis player and the danger of letting his feelings interfere with his life. Another day, while Ted was walking to his school, he witnesses the nature such as the sun and the universe, which serves as one of the inspirations behind his songs. He first meets a girl in the library and discusses the universe. Ted then calls his brother Kenneth to help him write the lyrics to his songs "Universum" and "Snurra du min värld" and record a tape consisting of two aforementioned songs as a hope of being noticed by a record label. The brothers Gärdestad walk to the building of Sweden Music and meets Benny Andersson, a former keyboardist of the Hep Stars. During a meeting, Ted assumes himself as a composer and Kenneth as a lyricist. Ted gave Benny an enclosed demo tape, but the tape was left home, leaving him to playing instruments to get Benny's attention. It also attracted the attention of Stikkan Anderson and Björn Ulvaeus, leading to a signed contract between Ted and Stikkan's record label, Polar.  On their way home, Ted's lack of participation in his tennis training session frustrated Arne, while their mother Margit responds positively to Ted's contract. Ted and Kenneth first enter the studio and meets singers Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Fältskog, and session guitarist Janne Schaffer. During the recording of Ted's debut album "Undringar", Kenneth and Stikkan discuss how his fantasy lyrics do not match with his hard rock style of music. The discussion bothered Ted, who abruptly left the studio with Kenneth, as Stikkan tries to resolve the dispute. After another tennis training session, Ted encounters Björn Borg again and tells him he cannot play with him until he finishes his debut album. During the mixing process, Stikkan persuades Ted to follow his career as a singer, since Ted cannot be a singer and a tennis player at the same time. Ted accepts the offer and starts his touring at the folkparks, debuting with his song "Jag vill ha en egen måne". Faced with a dilemma between continuing his education and recording another album, Ted reassures to Stikkan that he wrote enough materials for his next album.  In 1972, during the zenith of Ted's fame, he performed at Liseberg before a large number of audience. After performing his encore song "Jag ska fånga en ängel", he exited the stage and escaped from the audience that was coming after him. During a party, Ted attempts to call Kenneth, but he encounters with his mental rival. Fame ensued as the years progressed; Ted meets Lotta Ramel at a party and decides to start a relationship. Conflicted with the choice to stay with her domestically or to embark on an international tour with ABBA, Ted chooses to stay with Lotta. With Ted's interference of her studying at theatre school, Lotta decided that they should split and have space for their own lives. Meanwhile, in 1979, Ted composes "Satellit" as a slow ballad. His manager Stikkan responded enthusiastically to Ted's song, with the condition that Ted should speed up the arrangement of the song for the Eurovision Song Contest. The brothers Gärdestad then enter the 1979 Melodifestivalen Contest with the song and won. On their way to Jerusalem to represent their country in the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, Ted suffered from a nervous breakdown at his hotel room, before he performs "Satellit"; Kenneth and the people inside the hotel room rush to give valium for Ted to lessen the severity of his anxiety. Disappointed with the placement (17th place) in the Eurovision Song Contest, Ted turns on every appliance at his room in the hotel and throws his shirt away out of frustration.  In 1981, Ted is at a yoga session and is introduced to the Rajneesh movement by a student. At the studio, while Ted records a song, Ted does not like Kenneth's lyrics, in favour of Finn Kalvik's lyrics, which provokes a heated argument between Kenneth and Finn. At the Stockholm Arlanda Airport, Ted meets Ann Zacharias and starts a second relationship and family, by going to the cinema with her. One night, Ann wakes up as she hears Ted's meditation. She is shocked at his "surrendering" to guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The following days, Ted assumes his name as Sangit Upasani in a candid interview and alienates his family via his resistance to being confronted by them. Ted then leaves for Oregon, United States and meets Rajneesh, who tries to solve his problem in Ted's identity. In 1986, the Gärdestad family sees Ted return from the United States via the train, but is uncomfortable with Ted's excessive cleanliness. Kenneth then talks to Ted about what he has missed since his departure to Oregon, and his schizophrenia. Ted then chokes Kenneth, accusing him of associating with Ted's mental rival. In the 1990s, while Ted is withdrawn, walking in the snow, he meets his ex-girlfriend Lotta who notices his change and runs away to his house. At the Gärdestads' basement, Ted destroys his photo frame and guitar and escape to a distant island. Meanwhile, Kenneth finds a struggling Ted on an island and comforts him. Ted pleads to Kenneth that he wants him to write lyrics for him again since he considers Kenneth to be the only lyricist who can express Ted's feelings. Kenneth initially declines, but relents and accepts the offer. At the brothers Gärdestad's house, they look back in the nostalgia of what they had done for the past 20 years and record "Himlen är oskyldigt blå". At the end of the film, in the 1990s, Kenneth finds Ted, alone at a building, and persuades him to perform with the backing band at a folkpark.

 In 2048, on an Earth [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] and ridden by violent conflicts, scientists are looking to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] as a new home for humanity, spearheaded by Professor Martin. Rick Janssen, a war pilot who survived for 3 days in the Syrian desert without food or water, is chosen to be a part of an experiment that forces humans to adapt to the surface of Titan, due to his past ability to survive in extreme conditions. The experiment, in the beginning, seems successful. Rick becomes able to swim at incredible speeds and stay underwater for 40 minutes at a time. However, the following evening, Abigail notices Rick's veins becoming darker while they're swimming. The experimentation continues, as Abigail becomes more worried about Rick. Rick's training becomes increasingly intense as he and the other humans are subjected to colder and more Titan-like environments. Following a swimming drill, Rick finds that some of his hair is falling out, and one of the members begins convulsing in the bathrooms and dies. The following night, while the experiment subjects are having a meeting, Abigail notices darker veins appearing on them. Zane, one of the subjects, has sudden mental breakdown and hits his female partner. Abigail, now questioning the safety of the experiment, takes swabs of the blood in Rick's vomit, and notices several cameras hidden in their home. Rick takes a break and sits at the bottom of their swimming pool, where large amounts of his skin shed off. Abigail notices Rick is shedding skin and hair. The next morning, she begins experimentation on the blood sample she took from his vomit, finding that his blood is beginning to become darker.   Rick becomes paler and undergoes eye surgery to accommodate for the low light on Titan. He returns home only to begin bleeding from his eyes, and is rushed back into surgery. Abigail confronts Professor Martin about Rick's changes, but does not learn anything more. She returns home to find an emergency situation with Zane. Zane suffers another mental breakdown and throws his wife through a window, killing her instantly. He is then shot down and killed by the military.  That night while visiting Rick in the medical facility, Abigail steals Rick's key card and sneaks into Professor Martin's office. Meanwhile, Professor Martin is scolded during a meeting with NASA for blindly entering forced evolutionary experimentation without proper evidence and ethical reasons, and is threatened to have his operation shut down. Abigail finds reports of autopsies of deceased test subjects, discovering that they are having their DNA infused with animal DNA, and are taking steps towards becoming the next human species, called homo titaniens. She confronts Professor Martin at her home with Rick, to find that he does not actually know what Rick will actually become. Rick regains his sight and willingly enters a major surgery to adapt to his new senses and become fully ready for Titan. Rick and Tally (another member of the experiment) are the only survivors of the operation, completing their training and finishing their transformations into homo titaniens. Abigail watches with horror and disbelief at her new husband. Rick is unable to communicate with Abigail now after the transformation. The evolution causes him to communicate in a low frequency that is unable to be detected by normal human ears. Rick is sent home for two days until their launch to Titan is ready. That night he accidentally hits Abigail while putting on his jacket due to his enhanced abilities.   Tally kills her husband and meets with Rick as SWAT members enter the complex. Abigail flees and hides with her son while SWAT members surround Tally and Rick. Tally is killed, and SWAT attacks Rick, who begins to defend himself and kills the SWAT team while Abigail runs down to confront him with their son. Rick flees as he realizes he has become a monster. The military base undergoes lockdown and hunts for Rick as Abigail does the same. Abigail runs to a hill the two used to run to, finding Rick there. The two hold hands and kiss before the military arrives and knocks them out. Abigail wakes to a Rick in critical condition due to him being incompatible with Earth's atmosphere, however he is not compliant with the military as he refuses to leave his family. Abigail is forced to give him a chemical solution that would act similar to a medical lobotomy, erasing all of his memories with his family. Abigail secretly switches the solution out with a harmless saline solution, tricking the military into believing that he is safe.   Rick, now loose, begins killing soldiers as Abigail flees with her son and Dr. Freya, an assistant to Professor Martin who betrayed him. Abigail and Freya run into a heavily wounded Rick, and give him first aid until they are surrounded by Professor Martin and his men. Professor Martin orders his men to shoot Abigail, her son, and Dr. Freya. However, the colonel, who has had ethical misgivings about the experiment, refuses to shoot unarmed women and children and he and his men turn on Professor Martin, siding with Abigail. The scene cuts to Rick, Dr. Freya, and Abigail along with her son being transported to the Titan II facility, where Abigail becomes the head researcher, and Rick is sent to Titan. The film ends with Abigail staring up into the night sky with her son while Rick explores Titan alone.

  Following the disappearance of her father, Lord Richard Croft, [[Lara Croft]] makes a living as a [[bike courier]]. When she is arrested after a bike accident involving a police car, Richard's business partner Ana Miller posts her bail and warns her that if she does not claim her vast  inheritance, her father's country estate, Croft Manor, will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts and gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb. There she finds a pre-recorded video message from Richard detailing his research into [[Himiko]], the mythical Queen of [[Yamatai]] who was said to command the power over life and death. Richard warns Lara to destroy all of his research but Lara decides not to so she can investigate further.  Lara travels to [[Hong Kong]] where she hires Lu Ren, captain of the ship ''Endurance'', to sail into the [[Devil's Sea]] and the island of Yamatai. Lu Ren turns out to be the son of the captain Lara's father hired to take him to the island seven years ago. The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She is revived by Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity that seeks to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Vogel takes Lara prisoner, claiming that he killed her father and intends to use Richard's research to continue his expedition. He adds Lara and Lu Ren to his slave force but soon Lara escapes with the help of Lu (after learning Vogel murdered his father), who stays behind after being severely injured.  Lara regains consciousness after nightfall and is forced to kill a Trinity guard when she is nearly discovered. She follows a mysterious figure wandering the island and discovers that the figure is her father, who stayed on the island to prevent Trinity from finding Himiko's tomb. After Lara convinces him that she is real and not a figment of his imagination, Richard treats her injuries. Despite his protests, Lara sets off to recover his research from Vogel's camp. Lara makes contact with Lu Ren, and he, along with the fishermen, stage distractions that allow Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and recover her father's research. In the ensuing chaos, Richard makes his way to Himiko's tomb and is captured by Vogel, who persuades Lara to open the tomb.  The party navigates a series of booby traps and locates Himiko's [[sarcophagus]]. Two Trinity soldiers attempt to remove her corpse but become infected by Himiko's "power", which is actually a disease so potent that mere physical contact triggers immediate bodily disintegration, and reduces those infected to an aggressive zombie-like state. Images around the tomb reveal that Himiko, who was apparently immune to the virus herself and was a carrier, came to the island voluntarily rather than being forced as the legends imply, sacrificing herself to contain the virus. Vogel concludes that he cannot remove Himiko's body and instead settles for detaching a finger, which he seals in a pouch. In the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, though Vogel escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the disease from spreading across the world. Lara pursues Vogel as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts Vogel and the two fight. Lara force-feeds him Himiko's severed finger and kicks him into a deep chasm as the infection takes over. She escapes the tomb as it collapses, meets back up with Lu Ren and the fishermen, and commandeers a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai.  Lara returns to London, where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity's [[front company]], Patna, is actually a [[subsidiary]] of Croft Holdings. She proceeds to investigate Trinity further and begins to suspect that Ana Miller is one of their agents who manipulated her into accepting her inheritance in order to have Lara sign over control of Croft Holdings' business operations to her when Richard Croft stopped cooperating with Trinity. Having witnessed Trinity's ruthlessness firsthand, she prepares for her next adventure.

In her interview with the detective overseeing the cases of all the deceased teens (Olivia's friends as well as the ones from Giselle's group) Olivia learns that Carter is Sam.

Brea goes outside to try to start the car, but Red and the last biker find her. Before they can take her, Marnes arrives with a deputy after John called them. However, Marnes turns out to be part of the trafficking scheme, which she proves by shooting and killing the deputy. She berates Red and the biker for manhandling the girls since they are products, as well as not deleting the evidence on the phone. They sedate Brea and take her away.  Brea wakes up in a hidden location with the other trafficked women, including Malia. Brea confirms to her that John and Darren are dead. Red and his goon enter. He tells Brea he is keeping her all to himself. Brea responds by sticking a nail in his neck before she starts bludgeoning him to death. The biker attacks Brea, but Malia overdoses him with his sedative. Brea promises she will come back for Malia before going to get help.  Brea walks out of the woods and finds herself near another gas station. She walks there in view of the other patrons who see how badly beaten she looks. She enters the store and asks the clerk to call the police. Brea swipes a phone from the counter and calls Carl for help.  After dark, Marnes arrives for Brea. She orders her outside to arrest her. Brea asks Marnes if she takes any pride in trafficking women for profit. Marnes responds that everything is trafficked, and she is just part of the system. Marnes cuffs Brea and takes her outside, only for a whole squad of cops to show up. Marnes is arrested, and the cops rescue the trafficked women.  In the final scene back in Sacramento, Brea returns to work where Carl tells her that the trafficking ring bust will be big news everywhere, but that the people involved will most likely go after Brea.

Dax is the underappreciated coach of Harlem's Money who is broke and has had a longstanding rivalry with Mookie.

As they make it back to the Rucker, Drew gives each of his team their gear that restores their faith and abilities, but Big Fella breaks his as it does not wipe away their past and he refuses to cooperate with Drew. Eventually, Drew acknowledges his mistake; sleeping with Big Fella's now deceased wife before the big game. He admitted that he too loved her and the two make amends.

Upgrade (film)
  Grey Trace, a stay-at-home mechanic, lives with his wife Asha in a near-future city. Though she works for Cobolt, one of the companies contributing to an increase in human computer augmentations, Grey chooses to remain unaugmented out of fear of losing his humanity. One day, Grey asks Asha to help him return a refurbished car to his client Eron Keen, a famous tech innovator in charge of a rival company Vessel. While visiting his home, Eron reveals his latest creation, an AI chip called STEM that can serve as an auxiliary brain.   On their way home, Grey and Asha’s self-driving car malfunctions and crashes at a homeless camp. Four unknown men then arrive, shooting Asha and severing Grey’s spine. Grey watches helplessly as Asha bleeds out next to him.  Grey returns home months later as a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic, now under the care of his mother Pamela. Asha's death and the inability of Cortez, the detective assigned to her case, to identify their attackers has caused Grey to sink into an intense depression. After a failed suicide attempt by overdosing on medication, he is visited by Eron, who offers to surgically implant STEM into Grey’s spine and restore motor functions to his body. Though initially resistant, Eron’s suggestion that Asha would have wanted this persuades Grey.  Grey goes through with the surgery and regains control of his limbs faster than expected. Eron then has Grey sign a non-disclosure agreement to conceal STEM from everyone, including the police, and pretend to still be paralyzed when in public. While looking through case files on his wife’s murder that night, Grey hears STEM speak into his mind. STEM says it can help Grey get revenge and quickly identifies one of the assailants, a local man named Serk, from a drone video feed. STEM also discovers that Serk and the assailants had modified guns implanted into their arms, explaining why police were unable to identify a murder weapon. Grey decides to investigate Serk personally.  Grey breaks into Serk’s home and discovers he was 'upgraded' as a result of a secret military experiment, which connects him and another assailant to a local bar called the Old Bones. Serk then returns home and discovers Grey, leading to a fight between the two. Knowing Serk will easily overpower Grey, STEM convinces Grey to temporarily give up control of his body. Under STEM's control, Grey becomes a lethally efficient fighting machine, ending the fight by splitting Serk’s jaw open with a kitchen knife. Though they attempt to cover their tracks, Cortez sees drone footage of Grey approaching Serk’s house before the murder. However, she lacks evidence connecting Grey to Serk’s murder, or proof that he is capable of severely injuring a person given his quadriplegic condition.  Eron learns what happened by tracking STEM’s movements and berates Grey for his vigilantism. Grey reveals STEM is speaking to him, which surprises Eron, who demands that Grey stop any further investigation. Nonetheless, Grey proceeds to the Old Bones and finds the next assailant Tolan. Grey easily overpowers Tolan and tortures him to death, but not before getting the name of the assailants’ ringleader Fisk. While leaving the bar, Grey collapses onto the ground. STEM informs Grey that Eron is attempting to shut them down remotely and directs him to a hacker nearby who can sever Eron’s connection. Meanwhile, Fisk and the remaining assailant Jeffries investigate Tolan’s death before murdering the bar owner by sneezing a cloud of nanobots onto him that destroy his brain.  After an arduous struggle, Grey finds the hacker, Jaime, who manages to remove STEM’s input locks. Jaime then abandons them upon realizing they’ve been followed by the assailants and two armed Vessel employees. Fisk kills the Vessel employees while Grey, with STEM's control restored, murders Jeffries with his own gun arm before fleeing.  Grey returns home only for Pamela to discover him walking about, forcing him to reveal STEM's existence. Cortez then arrives to interrogate them after finding Grey’s wheelchair suspiciously abandoned at the Old Bones. Unable to get either of them to confess, she leaves after discreetly planting a listening device on Grey’s jacket. Grey then tells STEM they should stop before they kill more people, and STEM demonstrates that, without Eron’s input locks, it no longer needs Grey’s consent to control his body. It tells Grey that it will not stop killing until they’ve completed their quest for vengeance, regardless of his approval. STEM then forces Grey to leave the house to hunt down Fisk. While driving, they discover Cortez's listening device and spot her car chasing after them. STEM then causes an automated car to malfunction and crash into hers so they can escape. Cortez returns to Grey’s home shortly after, where Pamela reveals the truth about STEM.  Grey and STEM eventually find Fisk, threatening him at gunpoint to reveal why he killed Asha. Fisk reveals he was only hired to paralyze Grey so he could be implanted with STEM, while Asha's death was an incidental casualty but a monetary bonus all the same. Grey then attacks Fisk, who unfortunately for Grey is so upgraded that he can outpace Grey’s movements. Realizing Fisk and Serk were brothers, Grey taunts Fisk with details of how he killed Serk. This causes sufficient emotional distraction for STEM to gain the upper hand and impale Fisk’s head on a piece of glass. Grey then searches Fisk's phone and discovers a message from Eron, suggesting he orchestrated everything to make Grey the ideal test subject for STEM.  Grey assaults Eron’s home, only to be held at gunpoint by Cortez before he can kill Eron. Eron then reveals that STEM had forced him to set things in motion from the beginning, having long since taken control of Eron's life and his company in pursuit of its goal to become human. When it learned that Grey’s body was completely unaugmented, it caused the car crash and directed Eron to say exactly the right things so that Grey would agree to its surgical insertion. After revealing its plan, STEM kills Eron and attempts to kill Cortez. In a desperate effort to resist STEM, Grey forces his arm towards his neck and shoots himself.  Grey suddenly wakes up in a hospital bed, fully in control of his body with Asha sitting by his side. He is convinced everything that happened was a bad dream experienced after surviving the car crash. The truth, however, is revealed as the scene cuts back to Eron’s home. STEM, now speaking through Grey’s body, tells Cortez that Grey is ‘not here anymore’; because of the psychological strain he exerted attempting to kill himself, Grey’s mind snapped and STEM placed his consciousness into a fantasy world to live out the rest of his existence peacefully. With every other loose end tied off, STEM murders Cortez and leaves to enter society with its new body.

Unfriended: Dark Web
  Matias O'Brien (Colin Woodell) is working on a new laptop he has acquired, originally belonging to someone named Norah C. IV. He begins working on his app Papaya, which hears the user's voice and posts their words on the screen. He is making it for his deaf girlfriend Amaya (Stephanie Nogueras). She gets on a video chat with him so he can show it to her, but she's upset because the app only makes it convenient for her to understand him, but not for him to understand her. She hangs up. Matias logs out of Norah's Facebook page but keeps getting messages addressed to Norah from someone named Erica. Matias gets on a Skype video call with his friends - tech wiz Damon (Andrew Leeds), conspiracy theorist AJ (Connor Del Rio), DJ Lexx (Savira Windyani), and couple Serena (Rebecca Rittenhouse) and Nari (Betty Gabriel). They play Cards Against Humanity while Matias tries to get back in touch with Amaya. After becoming repeatedly frustrated with the computer constantly restarting, he asks Damon for advice. He tells Matias to clean out the hard drive since it may be full, causing the problems. Matias sees that this is indeed the case. Serena and Nari reveal that they just got engaged. Serena wishes she told her mom sooner because she is on life support due to brain cancer.  After discovering that Erica is actually Norah, he is found out about how he really acquired the laptop, which he took from a lost and found bin at a cyber cafe he has been visiting. Preparing to shut everything down and return the laptop, Matias sees a message for Norah about payment they received for a video Norah shared. Curious, Matias instead begins to converse with this mystery person. The user, Charon68, talks to Matias through another message board, The River, in which he asks if the payment went through. At this point, all his friends are watching his actions through a shared screen, in which AJ recognizes this as the dark web. Matias asks what it was for, and they mention a video, as well as trephination. Matias looks up trephination, and they all learn it means drilling a hole in the skull. Matias stops talking to Charon68 when it gets too disturbing. Damon realizes that "Norah C." is just Charon spelled backwards. After discovering hidden files on the laptop, the group then views the videos, most of which are of girls being tortured. The last video is of a girl sleeping in her room while a kidnapper enters and looks at the camera. Matias looks up the address on the video and sees that a girl went missing from there: it's Erica Dunne, the person who's account Charon IV was using. Matias suddenly recieves a video call from Amaya. However, upon answering, she is not there. Amaya is in the shower, so her roommate Kelly (Chelsea Alden) goes to the camera to talk to him. The screen goes black for a moment, but when it returns to normal, a hooded figure is standing behind Kelly. He knocks her out before carrying her into the closet. The figure turns out to be Norah C/Charon IV (Douglas Tait). He demands the laptop back immediately, or he will kill Amaya.  Before Amaya returns, Matias notices Nari trying to call the police because of the videos. He stalls and says it was all a game he's making since it's game night. They're relieved but also upset at Matias. Lexx leaves to take a phone call. Amaya comes back and Matias tries to convince her to come over, with Charon IV putting immense pressure on him. She is still upset over the app, thinking that he's not making an effort to learn ASL for her since he only went to one class that she signed him up for. Matias admits that he got scared when the instructor said how difficult dating a deaf person could be, but he truly wants it to work out for them. Amaya decides to take the subway to meet with Matias, with Charon IV following her as she keeps the video chat open so Matias knows she is safe.  To ensure Charon IV complies, Matias transfers all the crypto-currency in his account  into Matias's, which freaks Charon IV out. He contacts Matias through video chat, angrily chiding him for his actions. Matias says he'll get the money and laptop back on the promise that Amaya is safe and that Erica is returned as well. Matias then receives messages from The Circle, a group of hackers all using variations of Charon as their handles. They pull Matias into The River. They seem to know about Matias taking the money, and Charon IV reveals his face to talk to Matias. The Charons demand proof that Matias is Charon IV, so he tells Matias their creed so that neither of them gets killed. Matias types it in, and is briefly left alone. However, multiple accounts with the name Charon join the video chat. They post a video that was just uploaded to YouTube. They see what seems to be Lexx standing on the building's roof. Someone appears behind her and pushes her off the ledge to her death. The Circle then reveal they've edited videos of AJ to make it sound like he will shoot up a shopping mall and played it for a 911 operator. The cops enter his house and tell him to open his door. As he goes towards the police, the Circle hacks his computer to play a loud sound effect of a shotgun being loaded. This results in the cops shooting him. The Circle then play a video of Nari and Serena talking about revealing their engagement to their friends, and about Serena's mom. Emphasis is put on a part of the clip in which Serena states that she didn't want to make Nari choose between her or her family, which are not supportive of her lifestyle and engagement. The Circle shows camera footage of Nari at the subway and Serena's mother on life support at the hospital. They force Serena to choose which one will live. Serena pleads with them to take her instead. When the countdown ends, the Circle pull her mom off life support, push Nari in front of a train, and kill Serena in her house. The train Amaya was in finally reaches it's destination so she gets off to take another route. Matias attempts to sign to her to stay where she is, and Damon urges Matias to leave.  Matias leaves to get Amaya on his bike while leaving the laptop open so Damon can copy it's files. He talks to the Circle, saying he's been recording everything for the police to find, along with their addresses. However, the Circle quickly photoshops Matias's face over Charon IV's in Erica Dunne's video. A Charon then brings Erica into Matias's closet. Matias is forcefully added to the call from his bike and stops on the street. Damon explains that the Circle had planned all along for Matias to find the bait laptop and the money so it looks like he and his friends committed the crimes, so the Circle can further avoid detection from the law and public eye, and Damon's feed is cut off briefly. Moments later, a Charon pulls Damon in by a noose around his neck and hangs him by his closet door. Another Charon pulls up a word document on the screen and writes a fake confession and suicide note on it, implying everyone killed themselves out of guilt.  Matias then gets a call from Amaya outside an unfamiliar location asking where he is, saying he changed the meeting spot. Matias realizes the Circle has hacked his messages to make Amaya go to the factory from an earlier video. Before he can warn her to run away, the circle hack his phone and launch the papaya app, making it tell her to go inside. The call is forcefully hung up, and it cuts to a camera feed inside the factory. Matias watches Amaya get attacked by a Charon, presumably to torture or kill her for another video. Broken, Matias asks the Circle why they did all of this, and they repeat a clip of him earlier saying "After all, it is game night", revealing that this is simply entertainment to the circle members. The Circle members launch a poll to decide Matias's fate. The camera switches as Erica Dunne wakes up in Matias' apartment and goes to the computer, begging for help. She pulls a cork out of her forehead to reveal the hole in her skull from trephination and freaks out before the video cuts off. A camera feed of Matias in the road is added as the poll finishes with the Circle deciding his death. As he looks at his phone, he is run over by a Charon in a large van. With their job done and their crimes pinned on Matias and his friends, the members of the Circle at each scene of their death go to their cameras and take off their masks, smiling, including Charon IV, as it is revealed that the audience's point of view was actually from a Charon's computer.   === Alternate ending === In the second ending, Matias texts Amaya to meet him in a familiar spot; where he filmed a video of them hiking and sharing a kiss. He arrives at the site and finds a hole dug in the ground with an open casket, before a Charon knocks him out.   Later Amaya arrives and the hole has been filled. She calls Matias and his ringing phone wakes him up. He realizes that he has been buried alive and tries to text Amaya about his predicament but the Circle changes all of his messages to: "I wish I could sign better." When he attempts to video chat, the Circle pixelates his mouth so Amaya cannot read his lips. Amaya gets mad and hangs up, leaving Matias to die as he runs out of air.

Voldemort: Origins of the Heir
  As a flashback Tom Riddle is shown packing his bags and preparing to leave his house.  As he does so he pauses over a photograph of himself and three other students before abandoning it.  In the present, Grisha McLaggen is attempting to break into a Soviet Auror warehouse, but despite defeating many of the guards is captured and fed an intravenous drip of Veritaserum while questioned by General Makarov.  In a mixture of flashbacks and present tense a Soviet reconnaissance team finds a chest filled with dark objects, including Tom Riddle's diary, but are killed soon after opening it.  In the warehouse Grisha explains that she was a student with Riddle at Hogwarts, who along with Wiglaf Sigurdsson and Lazarus Smith were the true heirs of the Hogwarts founders (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff respectively).  All of the heirs formed a club, which was dedicated to "making the world a better place". When an argument occurred between Lazarus and Tom over Grisha's affections, they fell out. Grisha noted that Tom was becoming distant to them all and changed completely after the incident.  Over the last few years Grisha has become an Auror and dedicated herself to tracking down Tom in the belief she can save him from himself and the dark path.  Under further questioning and flashbacks it is shown how Tom stole both Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket from Hepzibah Smith before killing her and framing her house elf Hokey, and that Grisha believes he intends to create Horcuxes.  She thinks that Tom's diary - the artefact she was trying to retrieve from the warehouse - will give her a clue as to either Tom's whereabouts, or his intent.  She also explains that Tom has since killed both Lazarus and Wiglaf and it is implied that he has already taken and started using the name "Voldemort" rather than Tom Riddle.  After deliberation, Makarov says that he believes her story as she was under the influence of Veritaserum when she told it - yet just because ''she'' believes it does not actually mean that it is true, and she could be mistaken in her belief.  However, he is not willing to take the chance as the threat of Grindelwald is still a recent memory and so gives her the diary, saying "it is a Brit problem" and that they should deal with it.  Grisha is released, given her personal effects and allowed to leave.  As she leaves Makarov asks her how she knew they had the diary, and Grisha replies "I didn't - or maybe ''I'' did..." before transfiguring back into Voldemort and killing Makarov and his assembled guards.  The film finishes with a flashback to a second reconnaissance team finding the chest and recovering it.  The two Soviets discuss the contents, mentioning that the bones are female (the implication being that they are Grisha's) and what they mean, with one grimly concluding that there must be darkness in order for there to be light.

Carrie deposits him with Max ([[Andrew Bachelor]]), his successful vice president best friend, at the [[piano bar]] where Noah works. Noah drunkenly uses the [[photo booth]] where he and Avery shared a moment and falls asleep. He awakens in his bed and soon discovers he has traveled back in time to the day he met Avery. Noah tries to re-do their meeting, using his knowledge of her to his advantage, but Carrie, whom he met earlier and claimed he knew her and Avery well, comes home early and the two deduce he is a stalker and attack him. He wakes up back in the present thinking it was only a dream, but when he goes to Avery's house he realizes he is repeating the day of Avery's engagement party, but this time she recognizes him as the stalker from three years ago. Noah realizes he can use the photo booth to go back in time to re-do their meeting and will wake up to the consequences three years later.  Noah goes back a second time and seeks Max's help impressing Avery. Max convinces him to be a rude and cynical alpha male, and while Avery is initially disgusted by his attitude, she is aroused during their argument and they end up having sex.

He wakes up to find himself engaged to Avery, living a wealthy lifestyle, and is the successful vice president of the company. However, he learns that he and Max have become work enemies, is a workaholic that neglects Avery and has abandoned his piano hobbies, and, despite Ethan switching roles with him during his engagement party, Avery still loves Ethan more than him. While confiding in Carrie, Noah realizes Ethan and Avery are meant to be together and how he and Carrie end up learning more about each other in every alternate present.  Noah goes back in time, this time bringing Ethan with him to the party to meet Avery while he spends time with Carrie. Noah learns that the things he likes about Avery is because of Carrie's influence on her. He also learns that "Doctor Jello-Shot," the man Carrie is seen kissing in all alternate pasts, is her ex-boyfriend with whom she is having an unstable breakup. He shares a photo booth round with Avery, Carrie, and Ethan and wakes up in the present. He learns that Avery and Ethan are engaged, but Carrie ended up leaving him to return to her ex-boyfriend, only for them to break up. Noah goes to Avery and Carrie's house and finds out that, since Avery and Ethan met a day earlier, their engagement party was the day before, and Carrie is off to a date. She rejects Noah's pleas to try again and leaves. Noah tries to return to the photo booth, but finds a modern replacement in its place. Ethan and Avery arrive in the piano bar and inform him that they bought the old photo booth for him years ago, and Noah realizes he initially met Carrie through Avery, and he goes back and replays his meeting with Avery the original way.  He wakes up to the original present, this time happy for Ethan and Avery during their engagement party. He and Carrie spend time together and decide to leave the party.

After bringing him out of captivity, the IT's power allows Charles Wallace to forcefully drag them to finally meet his master. As Calvin and Meg fall under the IT's power, Alex opens another tesser and prepares to leave with the children, abandoning Charles Wallace. Meg refuses and projects out of the tesser herself, leaving her alone. When she confronts Charles Wallace, she realizes the IT uses deception and hatred for power.

They part ways, and Veronica begins acting nicer to her. The film ends with the Murry family celebrating a joyful reunion and Calvin going home to confront his father.

The house is under constant construction and Sarah's relative Marion Marriott lives in the house with her son Henry. At night, Henry is possessed by a mysterious entity.  In 1906, the Winchester company hires doctor Eric Price to stay at the house and assess Sarah, believing she is mentally unfit to remain in charge of the company. Eric is grieving from the death of his wife Ruby and reliant on drugs. He arrives at the house and has a ghostly vision that he believes is a side effect of the drugs he has taken. Later, he spots a ghost in the basement and witnesses a possessed Henry jump off the roof. Eric saves him.  The next day, Eric begins to conduct his assessment of Sarah's mental well-being. Sarah admits her fear of ghosts and believes she can help them move on. She reveals that she knows about Eric's drug problem and confiscates them.

Marion and Henry are cornered by Ben's brothers. Ben attempts to murder Sarah, but the pair realizes that Ben is scared of the bullet Eric kept. Eric has been able to see the ghosts in the house due to him dying from that bullet beforehand. Eric uses the bullet in the rifle that Ben used in the shooting and banishes him. Henry and Marion are saved and the other spirits return to their rooms.  Eric pronounces Sarah sane, allowing her to remain in control of the company. Sarah announces her intent to build more rooms to help more spirits. As the house is being repaired, a nail falls out of one of the boards sealing a spirit in a room.

When Anna reaches puberty, 'Daddy' starts giving her injections in her stomach to treat her 'illness'.  By the time Anna is 16, she is rescued by Sheriff Ellen Cooper ([[Liv Tyler]]) after 'Daddy' shoots himself rather than continue the treatments, who helps Anna start her new life as a normal teenager, eventually taking Anna home to live with Ellen and her younger brother Ray. As her body starts to develop, having been retarded by the injections, her childhood nightmares return. One day, she begins chasing a deer through the forest, but is stopped from hitting a tripwire by a one-eyed man wearing a wolf-skin ([[James LeGros]]). Ellen reveals to Anna that the hospital ran a DNA test, and 'Daddy'- who is now in a coma in the hospital, the right side of his face disfigured by the shot but still alive- was not her biological father.  As she spends time in town, Anna realizes that her senses are particularly acute, allowing her to hear other girls talking about her among the stacks while she reads in the library. When she encourages Ray to go to a party with her, she kisses him, but is shocked when her mouth starts to bleed, prompting her to run out of the house. When Lawrence, a local bully, follows her, Anna instinctively tears his throat out with her teeth, prompting her to return to her old house to hide for that night.  The next day, Anna sneaks out again, having realized that her bleeding mouth was caused by her human teeth being pushed out for sharper teeth, and observing that her nails are growing longer. She encounters the Wolf Man once again, who tells her that those like her were killed in the last 'purge' sixteen years ago, and directs her to an underground cavern where he says she will find her mother. Discovering a series of Wildling skeletons, Anna realizes that one of them, with a bullet-hole in the skull, was her biological mother, and remembers 'Daddy' killing her mother and taking her away after her birth. Shaken, Anna returns to Ellen's house, but is arrested as Ellen has discovered Lawrence's body.  That night, Anna is visited by the now-conscious 'Daddy' in jail, due to his affiliation with Ellen's deputy Roger. 'Daddy' tells her that 'Anna' was a mistake and gives her a syringe that he implies would kill her. Anna refuses to take the injection and escapes the following day when Ellen brings her breakfast, the surprised Ray agreeing to drive Anna north into the forest. Ray and Anna have sex that night, Ray assuring her that he is not concerned about her growing changes as her nails become longer and fine hair is found on her back. The next day, Ray is injured by a group of hunters led by 'Daddy', prompting Anna to leave him.  Months later, the hunters nearly corner Anna in the forest, but Ellen is tipped off when Ray spots Roger loading up tanks of gasoline. Roger confronts Ellen during the hunt, but the now-transformed Anna kills him, and reveals to Ellen that she is pregnant with Ray's child.  Later that night, the hunters start a forest fire that forces Anna into the underground cavern where her mother was killed, where she is shot with a dart by 'Daddy'. He attempts to perform a cesarean on Anna, but she is able to fight off the drugs and force him back with his own flaming torch, subsequently tearing his throat out. She collapses from previous smoke damage and the remains of the drug, but regains consciousness to find the Wolf Man stitching up her scar.  The next morning, Ellen and Ray are part of the group exploring the burned forest. Although they see Anna on the other side of a river, they allow her to depart.  Later that night, Anna is shown witnessing the [[aurora borealis]], a sight she had previously expressed interest in. She is now fully transformed into a Wildling and holding her child. In the distance, she hears the call of another Wilding.
