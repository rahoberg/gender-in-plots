12 Monkeys
 A deadly virus released in 1996 wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. In 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of [[Philadelphia]]. Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport.  Cole arrives in [[Baltimore]] in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but disappears moments later, and wakes up back in 2035. He is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield during [[World War I]], is shot in the leg, and then is suddenly transported to 1996.  In 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the [[Cassandra metaphor|Cassandra complex]] to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters tells Railly that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision, while humanity's gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990 Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines's virologist father.  About to be apprehended by police, Cole is transported back to 2035, where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission. But when he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her he now believes himself insane. Railly, meanwhile, has discovered evidence of his time travel, which she shows him. They decide to depart for the [[Florida Keys]] before the onset of the plague. On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines's father in an animal cage.  At the airport, Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are on the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines's father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.  Cole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. After drawing the gun he was given, Cole is fatally shot by police. As Cole lies dying in Railly's arms, Railly makes eye contact with a small boy—the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the future scientists.

Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls
 In the [[Himalayas]], after a failed rescue mission results in a raccoon falling to its death (a [[parody]] of ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]''), [[Ace Ventura]] undergoes an [[Mental breakdown|emotional breakdown]] and joins a [[Tibet]]an [[monastery]]. Once he has recovered, he is approached by Fulton Greenwall, a [[British people|British]] correspondent working for a provincial [[consulate general|consulate]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Africa]]n country of Nibia. Because Ace's presence is troublesome to the monastery, the Grand Abbot gives Ace excuses to justify his departure, and sends him off with Greenwall.  Thereafter, Greenwall takes Ventura to Africa, and warns him about the hostility of gorillas as it is mating season. Greenwald then asks Ventura to find the Great [[Albinism in biology|White]] [[bat]] 'Shikaka', a [[sacred animal]] of the Wachati tribe, which disappeared shortly after being offered as [[dowry]] of the Wachati Princess, who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince to form armistice and peace between the two people. After arriving in Nibia and meeting with consul Vincent Cadby, Ace begins investigating his case, but must overcome his intense [[chiroptophobia|fear of bats]] in order to succeed.  Accompanied by his [[capuchin monkey]], Spike, Ace travels to [[Africa]] to search for the missing bat. He eventually befriends the tribe's princess, who tries to seduce Ace. However, Ace admits his oath to [[celibacy]], but quietly masturbates in a hut afterwards. Ace then befriends the tribal prince, Ouda, who assists Ace throughout the film. Thereafter much of Ace's activity involves eliminating obvious suspects—animal traders, poachers, and a [[Safari park]] owner among others—and enduring the growing escalations of threat between the Wachati and the Wachootoo. After being attacked with drugged blow-darts, Ace suspects the medicine-man of the Wachootoo of taking the bat, as he strongly disapproves of the wedding. He travels to the Wachootoo tribal village, with Ouda translating the chief's words, rather poorly. The Wachootoo mistake Ace as the "White [[Devil]]", and have him go through many dangerous and humiliating challenges to gain their trust. He eventually does when his pain makes the chief, entire tribe, and even Ouda laugh for the first time in years. Despite this, if the bat is not returned in time, the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe.  As a last joke, Ace is shot in the butt by a non-drugged blow-dart by the Chief.  As he and Ouda walk back to the village, Ace realizes the dart he was shot with earlier in the film is not the same as the one he was just shot with—meaning the Wachootoo didn't take Shikaka.  Confused by the case, Ace consults the Grand Abbot via [[astral projection]]. Advised by the Abbot, Ace deduces that Vincent Cadby has taken the bat and hired Ace to divert suspicion from himself, having planned to let the tribes destroy each other so that he can then take possession of the numerous bat caves containing [[guano]] to sell as [[fertilizer]] worth billions. When Ace confronts Cadby with this knowledge, Ace learns he was hired as Cadby's alibi, and he is arrested by tribal security chief, Hitu. Shortly after, Ace calls an [[elephant]] to escape, and summons herds of jungle animals to destroy Cadby's house. Cadby then tries to shoot Ace, but is defeated by Greenwall who punches him in the face. Cadby escapes with the bat in a car, but Ace follows him in a [[monster truck]]. In pursuit, Ace destroys Cadby's car, leaving the bat cage lodged in a tree.  Ace, despite his chronic fear of bats, bravely yet dramatically returns the bat just as the tribes are about to meet on the battlefield, until they notice the bat and kneel before it. Cadby is watching nearby, but is discovered by Ouda. Ouda then calls him the "White Devil" to give Ace more time, and Cadby is pursued by both tribes. After escaping, he encounters a female gorilla that mistakes him for a mate and is subsequently raped. The Princess is married to the Prince, who is revealed to be the man who humiliated Ace during one of the Wachootoo tribal challenges earlier. Moments later, it is discovered that the young bride is no longer a [[virgin]], apparently on Ace's account. Despite this, peace between the once-separate tribes is achieved, by having everyone joining together and furiously chasing after Ace. Ace runs through the jungle fearfully, concluding the movie.  
The Addiction
  Kathleen Conklin (Taylor), a young [[philosophy]] student at [[New York University]], is attacked by a woman ([[Annabella Sciorra]]) called "Casanova", who tells Kathleen to "order me to go away" and, when Kathleen is unable to do so, bites her neck and drinks her blood. Kathleen develops several of the traditional symptoms of [[vampirism]], including aversion to daylight and distaste for food. The film follows her degradation. It is hinted that vampires become immortal in this film but the price is an addiction to blood. Vampires are shown blaming their victims for not being strong enough to resist them. Kathleen meets an anthropology student ([[Kathryn Erbe]]), who becomes her victim. After Kathleen drinks her a blood and she weeps incredulously, Kathleen coldly informs her: "My indifference is not the concern here, it's your astonishment that needs studying". Kathleen later meets Peina (Walken), a vampire who claims to have almost conquered his addiction and as a result is almost human. For a time he keeps her in his home trying to help her overcome hers, recommending she read [[William S. Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.  At her graduation party, Kathleen ominously announces, "I'd like to share a little bit of what I've learned". She, Casanova, Jean and some of Kathleen's other victims attack the family, friends, faculty and other attendees in a bloody, chaotic orgy. Afterwards, Kathleen, apparently overdosed from the bloody bacchanal and looking wracked with regret,  wanders the streets. She ends up in a hospital and asks the nurse to let her die. The nurse says no one will let her die. Kathleen decides to commit suicide by asking the nurse to open the curtains.  Kathleen is confronted by Casanova, who stops her suicide attempt and quotes Sproul to her. Kathleen gives in to her new fate and in the final scene, she is shown walking away from a grave with her name on it, in broad daylight. Her birth date on the tombstone is October 31, 1967 and the date of her death is November 1, 1994. The movie ends with Kathleen quoting the line: "self revelation is annihilation of self".

The film also includes a number of Minton's private stereo photographs that were not publicly released during his lifetime. Some of these images reveal how Minton was able to take some of the photographs of the skyscraper construction without actually standing on them.

Above the Lake
 A poor poet (perhaps Blok himself), his ghost-lady and the third character, subtly hinting with beauty and an article on Dantes, are immersed in authors not in a feast of aestheticism, but in the simple and eternal reality of our sinful world. Exhausted by passions, they are pathetic, they are beautiful in their own way, but how impudent are their impulses, completely fitting into the scheme of the classical love triangle. And only the imagination of the Poet, even spurred by cocaine, can transform this wretchedness into a hymn to the eternal confrontation of two men who have fallen in love with one woman.

The American President
 Popular [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President Andrew Shepherd is preparing to run for re-election. The President and his staff, led by [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] and best friend A.J. MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] by passing a moderate crime control bill. However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] do not want it, and [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] think it is too weak. If it passes, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed by his staff to be a shoo-in, and Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and the Congressional support to pass it, by the [[State of the Union]].  With the [[President of France]] about to arrive in the United States to attend a [[state dinner]] in his honor, Shepherd—widowed when his wife died of cancer three years earlier—is placed in an awkward predicament when his cousin Judith, with whom he had planned to attend the dinner, gets sick.  The President's attention soon focuses on Sydney Ellen Wade, just hired by an environmental [[lobbying]] firm to persuade the President to pass legislation committing his Administration to substantially reduce [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide emissions]]. During their first meeting, Shepherd and Wade are immediately intrigued by each other. At this meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill by the date of the State of the Union, he will deliver the last 10 votes. Whatever his personal feelings toward Wade, he expresses this to his staff, especially the pragmatic A.J., as a sound political move. He believes Wade will not be able to get enough votes to meet her side of the deal, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.  Later that evening, in a series of phone calls, Shepherd invites Wade to the state dinner. During the State dinner and subsequent occasions, the couple fall in love. When the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson learns "the President's got a girlfriend," he steps up his attacks on Shepherd and Wade, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and his [[family values]]. The President refuses to respond to these attacks, which drives his approval ratings lower and costs him crucial political support, without which his crime bill seems doomed to failure.  At the White House Christmas Party, Wade is dejected about her meeting that day with three Congressmen from [[Michigan]] about the environmental bill and how it was a dismal failure; in the process, she inadvertently mentions to the President and A.J. that the Congressmen in question said the only bill they were more interested in defeating than the President's crime bill was Wade's environmental bill. Shepherd and A.J. are conflicted by this information as Wade clearly had no idea of the implications of this casual conversation, much less that they might actually use this information in their favor and against her environmental bill.  Eventually, Wade does manage to get enough votes to meet her part of the deal. However, in the meantime, Shepherd's team discovers he is exactly three votes short, with no other apparent options to acquire them except by shelving the environmental bill, thus solidifying the support of the three Congressmen from Michigan—which he agrees to do. This results in disaster for Wade as she is immediately fired from her lobbyist job for failing to achieve her objectives, as well as seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation. She visits the White House to break up with Shepherd and says that she has a job possibility in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He tells her politics is making choices, his number-one has always been the crime control bill, and that he does not want to lose her over this. She congratulates him on getting the leverage to pass a crime bill that in no way will help fight crime. She concludes, "Mr. President, you have bigger problems than losing me—you've just lost my vote."  On the morning that he is to deliver his State of the Union Address, and after an argument with A.J., Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebukes Rumson's attacks on his values and character, as well as his painting Wade as a political whore, stating flat-out "You want a character debate, Bob? You better stick with ME, because Sydney Ellen Wade is ''Way out of your league.''". He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in [[fossil fuels]] — far more than the 10% originally envisioned — and that he is withdrawing his support for the weak crime bill, promising to write a stronger one in due time. In his speech he even promises [[gun control]], in an attempt at root-and-branch solving of America's problems. His passionate and erudite defense of those things in which he believes, in contrast to his earlier passive behavior, galvanizes the press and his staff.  Shepherd declares he is "going over to her house and I'm not leaving until I get her back", but Wade enters the [[Oval Office]] before he can leave. The couple are reconciled and the President, accompanied by Wade, leaves to give his State of the Union Address. The film ends with Shepherd handing Wade a bouquet of roses and [[Cornus florida|dogwoods]] (the state flower of her native [[Virginia]]), and entering the House chamber to thunderous applause.

He is penniless after losing all of his possessions in a [[shipwreck]] returning from a years-long expedition to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. Now dependent upon the hospitality of his patron, William is employed to catalog Sir Harold's specimen collection and teach his younger children the natural sciences, assisting their governess, the unassuming Matty Crompton ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]).  William quickly becomes enamoured with Sir Harold's eldest daughter, Eugenia ([[Patsy Kensit]]). Eugenia is softly spoken, anxious, and still mourning the recent death of her fiancé. Despite his impoverished circumstances, Eugenia proves receptive to his advances and accepts his proposal of marriage. Although Sir Harold grants his approval, Eugenia's snobbish and spoilt brother Edgar ([[Douglas Henshall]]) takes an intense dislike to William because of his humble origins.  Soon after the marriage, Eugenia informs William that she is pregnant. She insists on naming the boy 'Edgar' after her brother, frustrating William. Eugenia's behaviour alternates between coldness towards William, locking him out of her room at night, and moments of intense sexual passion. Over time the couple has four more children, although William never warms to them. He instead spends much of his time with the Alabaster children and Matty, observing the activity of an [[ant colony]] in the forest. Returning via the stables from an excursion, William discovers his brother-in-law Edgar raping a very young servant girl. Edgar tells William that the girl wanted it, but it is clear the girl is terrified of Edgar. William forms a strong bond with Matty Crompton, who encourages his scientific activities and displays a strong intelligence of her own. They collaborate on a book about the colony, which is successfully published in London.  One day, during a hunting excursion, William is summoned back to the house by a servant boy who claims that Eugenia wishes to speak to him. He walks into the bedroom, surprising Eugenia and Edgar while they are engaging in [[incest]]uous sex. Eugenia then confesses that she and Edgar had been having sex since they were children and that her fiancé committed suicide after discovering this. Eugenia tells William that when it started she was too young to properly understand and kept it secret, but after she became engaged and saw herself through the eyes of her fiancé she felt guilty. In tears, Eugenia explains that she tried to stop, but that Edgar's will was too strong for her. William realises that he has been used by Edgar to continue practicing incest and that all of the children (who bear no resemblance to him) are Edgar's.  Matty reveals her knowledge of the affair to William during a [[Scrabble]]-like game by discreetly moving around letter tiles that spell INSECT to INCEST. Meeting in her attic room, she explains that the servants were also aware and it was through their instigation that the secret was exposed to William. Expressing frustration at her life and her dependency on the Alabasters, Matty reveals that she has published her own book on the insects and has bought two tickets for passage aboard a ship bound for the Amazon. William is initially reluctant for them both to go; despite his attraction to Matty, he does not feel that the [[rain forest]] is a suitable place for a woman. After she assures him of her strength, and reveals that she loves him, William acquiesces to her plan.  Before leaving, William meets with Eugenia one last time and tells her he intends never to return. He also promises to keep her secret, for fear of injuring her ailing father with the news, and hopes she may find a way to live with her grief. The movie ends with William and Matty departing in a coach for [[Liverpool]], eager to begin their new adventure and leave the past behind.

Since kindergarten, he has been regularly harassed by handsome but cruel Rick Sanford and his complacent cohorts, for not being "normal" due to being overweight and is, in their view, "[[Angus cattle|named after a cow]]". His only friend is Troy Wedberg, who is also a social outcast. He also has feelings for Melissa Lefevre, though he is fearful of expressing it because she is [[courtship|dating]] Rick. Eventually, tired of the abuse from Rick, Angus applies to a [[magnet school]] where he hopes to be free of the constant humiliation. However, well aware of his feelings for Melissa, Rick rigs an [[election]] so that they will dance together in the upcoming freshman Winter Ball as King and Queen, respectively. While confronting Rick about the stunt, he is ordered by the principal not to lay a hand on Rick or he would be expelled and lose his chance to go to the magnet school.  To get ready for the dance, Angus gets help not only from Troy, but also his mother, Meg, and his narcoleptic grandfather, Ivan. Angus fears that his largeness makes him an inept dancer and would embarrass both him and Melissa. To fix this, Ivan takes him to Madame Rulenska, where despite his best efforts, he comes out worse than before (and injures her in the process). Later on, despite his request for a black tuxedo and wanting to be normal, Ivan purchases him a plum one and tells him that he can be normal and an individual at the same time. He tells him that running away to another school will not solve anything and that he needs to stand up against Rick while he still can. He also mentions that he doesn't let anyone tell him that his relationship with April is a mistake because she is 30 years younger than him and they see each other as perfect.   One day after [[American football|football]] practice, Angus opens his locker and sees that his favorite pair of boxers is missing. He and Troy later discover that Rick hoisted them up the flagpole for the school to see, which then fly squarely onto Melissa's face as she passes by. Angus storms home in anger, but Rick and company quickly kidnap Troy. Outside the school, they ask him for anything that would embarrass Angus at the Winter Ball. He refuses their request and tries to escape, only to break his arm as he trips to the floor while Rick gives him an ultimatum. At home, Meg tells Ivan that having Angus transfer to a magnet school would be for the best. She hates seeing him suffer another day with humiliation and does not think Ivan has the right answers. In turn, Ivan confronts Meg for over-mothering Angus and warns her that letting him run away from his bullies to another school is a mistake. He mentions if Angus stands any chance of ending his humiliation, he needs to make the change by standing up for himself and facing his bullies. Ivan admits he never let Meg run away from her problems and admires how strong she is today.  Meanwhile, Angus helps Ivan prepare for his and April's wedding. As Angus waits outside Ivan's room on the day of the wedding, he confides with him about his love for Melissa. Angus admits he is proud of him because he has the strength to not care if everyone else sees his marriage to April as wrong since they love each other. He wishes to have Ivan's strength to stand up to Rick and tell Melissa how he feels. When he tries to wake him, Angus quickly discovers that Ivan has died and tells the wedding guests there. Distraught, Angus opts to stay home for a few days trying to cope with Ivan's death. By that time, fearful that Rick will hurt him even more, Troy gives him a [[videotape]] containing footage of Angus practicing his dancing with an inflatable doll while confessing his feelings for Melissa. Troy visits Angus at home to offer his condolences, but he doesn't listen and it leads to an argument between them. When Troy calls him out for not understanding how it felt to be ostracized by Rick, Angus snaps and tells Troy that he knows better because he has faced rejection as well. Angus also admits he won't go to the Winter Ball mainly because he still plans to transfer, to escape both Rick's humiliation and to better cope with Ivan's death.  Later that week while cleaning up from the wedding that never happened, Angus receives a box from April and opens it, revealing the plum suit that he had earlier rejected. She wishes him luck in the future and leaves. In that moment, Angus realizes that Ivan was right all along: he needs to stand up for himself and face Rick or nothing will change. Resolved to follow Ivan's advice, he rejects an interview from the magnet school, wears the plum suit, and marches to the dance in the school [[gym]]nasium. Outside the gym, Troy warns him to turn around and return home at once because Rick has a bad prank planned for him. A furious Angus rebuffs his request, revealing he is sick of enduring Rick's torment. He meets Melissa inside, and they converse for the first time. As they are introduced to the students, Rick plays Troy's videotape on the monitors, and the students laugh. A humiliated Melissa runs out in tears and Angus follows her, infuriated with Troy for betraying him to Rick. Outside, he apologizes, but she does not blame him. Surprisingly, Melissa shows her disgust with Rick and reveals to Angus that she is [[bulimia|bulimic]]. She also mentions that Rick is very controlling and also [[Domestic violence|abusive]] towards her and the other students, making them fear him. Angus learns that Melissa likes him more than Rick because he is kind and respectful of others. Finding common ground, they go back inside and dance, even as she helps him out with some of the steps. After they receive a mild reception from the students, Rick scolds her, while Angus comes to her defense. Rick begins aggressively shoving Angus and follows up with a hard punch to the face, breaking Angus's nose and sending him crashing through a table. Rick sarcastically tells him, "Welcome to high school", and adds that he's glad he's leaving the school. Angus defiantly rises to his feet and furiously shouts back, "I'm still here, asshole!" Angus then repeatedly pushes Rick until he falls to the ground, telling him that no matter how many times Rick knocks him down, he will always get back up. Angus petitions him to realize that there are many people that don't fit his idea of "normal," and are unwittingly ostracized for it, and are fed up with the humiliation. He gives Rick a choice to join them and accept the students as individuals or continue rejecting them by thinking himself as normal. Rick selfishly chooses the latter by replying, "Whatever I am, it's something you're never gonna be," to which Angus retorts "Thank God!" The students congratulate Angus for taking a stand against Rick and even Rick's former friends abandon him. Melissa dances with Angus again and Troy enacts a little revenge on Rick by breaking his nose with his cast and impressing a girl upon whom he has a crush.  In the end, Melissa asks Angus to walk her home, and they kiss before Melissa retires for the night. Angus rejects the offer to transfer to the magnet school, realizing that his grandfather was right and that he doesn't have to run away anymore. Angus mentions that Rick was suspended for his video prank and for breaking Troy's arm and that his popularity with the other students suffered because of it.  ===Alternate cut=== Early in production, the film contained scenes wherein Angus' father was [[homosexual|gay]], reflecting the original story. Producer [[Dawn Steel]] at first approved the idea, but upon seeing a test screening she asked director Johnson to cut it. Hence, it is said early in the film that he died when Angus was born.  In addition, deleted and extended scenes are integrated into the cut-for-television version of the film to make up running time.

Apollo 13 (film)
   In July 1969, astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] hosts a [[house party]] where guests watch [[Neil Armstrong]]'s televised first human steps on the Moon. Afterwards Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on [[Apollo 8]], tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface.  Three months later, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's [[Vertical Assembly Building]], his boss [[Deke Slayton]] informs him that because of problems with [[Alan Shepard]]'s crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, [[Ken Mattingly]], and [[Fred W. Haise, Jr.|Fred Haise]] train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to [[rubella|the measles]], and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, [[Jack Swigert]]. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] the night before launch to see him off.  On April 11, 1970, Flight Director [[Eugene F. Kranz|Gene Kranz]] gives the go-ahead from Houston's [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] for the Apollo 13 launch. As the [[Saturn V]] rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the [[transposition, docking, and extraction|maneuver]] to connect the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] ''Odyssey'' to the [[Lunar Module]] ''Aquarius'' and pull it away from the spent rocket.  Three days into the mission, the crew makes a television transmission, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert turns on the [[liquid oxygen]] tank stirring fans as requested, one of the tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. They attempt to stop the leak by shutting off fuel cells #1 and #3, but to no avail. With the fuel cells closed, the Moon landing must be aborted, and Lovell and Haise must hurriedly power up ''Aquarius'' to use as a "lifeboat" for the return home, as Swigert shuts down ''Odyssey'' before its battery power runs out. In Houston, Kranz rallies his team to come up with a plan to bring the astronauts home safely, declaring "failure is not an option". Controller [[John Aaron]] recruits Mattingly to help him invent a procedure to restart ''Odyssey'' for the landing on Earth.  As Swigert and Haise watch the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their attention to the business of getting home. With ''Aquarius'' running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and a fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When [[carbon dioxide]] approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on ''Aquarius'' shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.  Mattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts ''Odyssey'' by transferring extra power from ''Aquarius''. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release ''Aquarius'' and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that ''Odyssey''s [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to [[ionization blackout]] is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.  As helicopters bring the three men aboard the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.

Assassins (film)
 Robert Rath ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) is a paid [[assassin]] who wants to retire, haunted by the memory of murdering his own mentor Nicolai years ago. He is on an assignment when someone else gets to the 'mark' (target) before he does. That intruder turns out to be Miguel Bain ([[Antonio Banderas]]), a fellow assassin and a competitive sociopath. Bain plans to kill Rath to become the number one assassin.  As Rath tries to figure out who sent Bain, the contractor offers him a lucrative job that could allow him to retire: kill a computer hacker named Electra ([[Julianne Moore]]) and the four Dutch buyers of a computer disk and retrieve the disk. Electra has set up [[CCTV]] cameras and an elaborate mechanism for remotely moving items between rooms in the building where she is based.  Bain gets there first and kills the four Dutch buyers, who turn out to be [[Interpol]] agents. Rath, meanwhile, spares Electra, and the two escape from Bain with the disk. Rath exchanges the disk for his fee, given to him in a briefcase, which actually contains a bomb placed by his own contractor in an attempt to kill him. Electra then tells him she had swapped the disk, not sure if Rath was coming back. Rath demands a greatly increased fee from his contractor, this time to be wired to a bank.  The contractor (who is also Bain's contractor) sends Bain a new mark: Rath. Rath and Electra travel to the bank, where Rath identifies the decrepit, abandoned hotel that Bain will use as a sniper post and plans a trap.  After Bain's apparent death, Nicolai appears, revealing that he had had a bulletproof vest on when Rath had shot him years ago. Knowing that Nicolai would kill him too, Bain revives and joins Rath in shooting him dead. Bain still plans to kill Rath and become number one. Electra puts on her sunglasses, allowing Rath to see Bain; Rath shoots through his own jacket to kill him.  
As Good as Dead (1995 film)
 Nicole (Traci Lords) is a makeup artist with an ulcer who befriends Susan (Crystal Bernard) at a club. Susan harbors a sadness over the death of her mother and the fact that her father left when she was two years old. Nicole takes Susan to her house where she shows her the location of the spare key and lends her some clothes, saying that she will even begin to feel different after wearing them for a while. Nicole invites Susan to a party at a fancy house where she admits to Susan that she spent time in jail for shoplifting. After drinking alcohol her ulcer flares up and Susan drives her to the hospital. Nicole does not have insurance so they use Susan's name and insurance to sign her in.  Susan takes medical leave from work and uses the time for a brief vacation. She calls the hospital for information about the patient checked in under her name but the staff refuses to give her any information. She calls her office to check her voicemail but is informed that "Susan Warfield" died in the hospital. She finds that her apartment has been rented and her belongings have been repossessed.  Susan learns that Nicole's body was taken from the hospital and cremated at a ceremony paid for by a man claiming to be her brother "Aaron Warfield" even though Susan has no brothers. Her ATM card is rejected so she takes a bus to Nicole's apartment and begins wearing her clothes. She learns that the death was due to a transfusion of the wrong type of blood and fears that she could be accused of manslaughter for having given incorrect medical information so she assumes Nicole's identity completely and visits the lawyer, who says that he is suing for $10 million for negligence and tells her where "Aaron Warfield" is staying in a hotel.  At the hotel she finds the room of the wrong Warfield and encounters her own father Edgar Warfield, whom she has never met but recognizes from an old wedding photograph. Edgar confirms that "Aaron Warfield" is his son (therefore her half-brother) and warns her to stay away from him because he does not treat women well. She confronts him about the daughter he never knew and he says that he returned to town for her funeral and met up with Aaron, who was already in town. She leaves her phone number as "Nicole" and returns to the hospital, where she learns that a technician named Eddie Garcia was fired for entering the blood type as B- instead of A-, though Eddie argues that he saw someone watching him enter the computer access code and that person must have used it to change the data.  A police car turns on its sirens when it sees Susan driving Nicole's car because Nicole had a warrant due to several unpaid parking tickets. While escaping Susan nearly runs into a car driven by a pianist named Ron (Judge Reinhold), who shows great interest in the way she dresses and asks her to dinner. After dinner she finds that someone has broken into her apartment through the front door and Ron offers to stay in case the intruder returns. Susan tells him about the half-brother and lets him repair the door but does not let him stay the night so Ron sleeps out front in his car and catches a man snooping around the house in the night but the man escapes.  The next day Ron returns with groceries and they go to the hotel to get a picture of Aaron to show to Eddie Garcia. She is surprised that Ron is given the key to Aaron's room simply by asking for it. In the room Susan finds a picture of Edgar with a man she believes to be Aaron so they leave. She insists on showing the picture around the hospital alone while Ron goes to Eddie Garcia's apartment, where Ron explains that he can relate to Eddie because he was also fired from a hospital for stealing drugs. Eddie tries to escape Ron catches him and throws him off the fire escape to his death.  Ron picks Susan up from the hospital and drivers her to Eddie's place, where they find police surrounding the building and are told that Eddie committed suicide. The attorneys inform Edgar Warfield of the suicide and that the hospital is willing to settle because it appears to be an admission of guilt. Edgar calls Susan and arranges to meet her to scatter the ashes over the ocean before his flight departs.  Ron becomes suspicious because of Susan's avoidance of the police so Susan invents a story for her new persona "Nicole" about being a convicted shoplifter. Ron urges her to confess more but she convinces him to rush to the meeting with Edgar. On the ride there he accuses her of using Susan for her money. She denies it but he accuses her further of trying to shake down the family to get some of the insurance money, revealing that he is Aaron Warfield and caused the death of Susan because she refused to lend him money. He is also jealous of his father Edgar's closer relationship with his physical therapist Henry, the man shown in the photograph with him, and proposes that they join forces to take Edgar's money. Susan confesses to Edgar that she is Susan and Aaron attempts to throw Susan off a cliff into the ocean. Edgar pulls them back from the brink and attempts to throw his father off the edge as well. Susan throws Nicole's ashes in Aaron's eyes and he falls off the edge of the cliff. Susan loses her job but avoids felony charges and finally gets a chance to get to know her father.

Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold
 The three finalists for ''Plaything'' Magazine's "[[Centerfold]] of the Year" are Inga (Raelyn Saalman), Betty (Tammy Parks) and Angel Grace ([[J. J. North]]). During a photoshoot, Betty makes some rather scathing remarks regarding Angel's appearance. Angel becomes self-conscious, and goes to Dr. Lindstrom ([[John LaZar]]) at his clinic. Angel had taken beauty enhancing treatments previously, but now wants to get back on the program. Though Lindstrom warns her that any additional doses could be fatal, Angel still pleads to be put back on the program. Dr. Lindstrom gives her a case with several vials, cautioning her to only take one a day. That night, Angel takes her first vial. The result of it causes her breasts to increase in size.  Shortly thereafter, Angel, Betty and Inga go to the Plaything Mansion, and meet Bob Gordon (Jay Richardson), the founder of ''Plaything'' Magazine. The night before the photoshoot with all the girls, the shoot's photographer Mark (Tim Abell) tries to sleep with each of the girls. Though Betty and Inga shoot him down, Angel gives into his sweet talk.  Angel accidentally oversleeps and misses the beginning of the [[photoshoot]]. As she checks herself in the mirror, she realizes that she didn't take a vial the previous day, and wrinkles are settling in. In an act of [[despair (emotion)|desperation]], she takes 3–5 vials. The [[overdose]] causes her to [[Syncope (medicine)|pass out]] for just a moment. When she reawakens, she has grown easily 1–2 feet taller than normal. Angel is oblivious, even though her high heels and bikini seem smaller.  Making her way to the photoshoot, Angel and the girls begin posing for Mark, before Angel suddenly [[Syncope (medicine)|faints]]. While Mark, Betty and Inga go to alert Gordon, Mark's assistant Wilson (Ted Monte) stays behind.  When the group returns, Wilson and Angel are gone. Wilson emerges from behind a nearby cliff, followed by Angel, now over 60 feet tall.  Sometime afterward, a [[circus tent]] is set up for Angel, who is still upset at her sudden [[growth spurt]]. Back at the Plaything Mansion, Mark and Gordon plot to use Angel's size as a major selling point for the magazine, and then turn her over to the [[government]] for experimentation. Wilson overhears the conversation, and confronts Mark about the plan; Mark shrugs off Wilson's concerns.  Over the next couple days, Mark tries to win over Angel's embarrassment at being a [[giantess]], in hopes that they can conduct her '60-foot photoshoot'. He explains that Gordon has arranged for a specialist to come in and help her, and that they have tried to call Dr. Lindstrom for her, but haven't been able to reach him.  Wilson one night sneaks into Angel's tent, and explains what he overheard. It is here that Wilson finally confesses his love for Angel, and his concern over Mark and Gordon's plan.  After the conversation, Angel wanders out into the nearby [[desert]] to think.  The next day, Wilson manages to get a hold of Dr. Lindstrom, who agrees to come up to the Mansion to see Angel. As he finishes the conversation, Mark finds a rough-copy of the next issue of ''Plaything'', with a 3–6 page spread, promising Plaything's 'Biggest Centerfold Yet.' Betty finds the issue and grows angry that Angel appears to have trumped her.  Some distance away from the [[Mansion]], Mark has finally convinced Angel to do the photoshoot, taking pictures of her as she bathes in a wooden [[watertower]].  Betty, hellbent on revenge, tries to recruit Inga to her cause, but gets no sympathy. Sneaking into Angel's room, Betty finds Angel's case from the Lindstrom clinic, and takes some of the vials.  Angel meanwhile, has finished her shoot in the watertank and is snuggling with Mark, when  Gordon and Wilson meet up with her. Gordon continues his lie about a specialist coming, when Wilson finally exposes them as liars in front of Angel. Angel grows upset at being lied to, but the mood is shattered when Betty appears, having grown to 60&nbsp;ft. Angel and Betty begin fighting, just as Dr. Lindstrom arrives. Lindstrom tries to administer a [[tranquilizer]] dart on Angel, but it instead ends up striking Betty, who pulls it out and throws it at Gordon. Angel and Betty then continue their fight which eventually leads them to downtown [[Los Angeles]].  As Lindstrom, Mark and Wilson arrive, the girls have sent a myriad of people running down the darkened streets. Wilson uses Lindstrom's special antidote, which shrinks Angel and Betty back to normal. Angel happily decks Betty, whom Mark runs to. Wilson goes to Angel's side, and the two embrace. Mark meanwhile, forcibly tries to kiss Betty, who explodes, due to an instability with the antidote.

August Vacation
   
Babe (film)
 Babe, an orphaned piglet, is chosen for a "guess the weight" contest at a [[county fair]]. The winning farmer, Arthur Hoggett, brings him home and allows him to stay with a [[Border Collie]] named Fly, her mate Rex and their puppies, in the barn.  A duck named Ferdinand, who crows as roosters are said to every morning to wake people so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten, persuades Babe to help him destroy the alarm clock that threatens his mission. Despite succeeding in this, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat, and in the confusion accidentally destroy the living room. Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand (now a fugitive) and the house. Sometime later, when Fly's puppies are put up for sale, Babe asks if he can call her "Mom".  Christmas brings a visit from the Hoggetts' relatives. Babe is almost chosen for [[Christmas dinner]] but a duck is picked instead after Hoggett remarks to his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. On Christmas Day, Babe justifies his existence by alerting Hoggett to sheep rustlers stealing sheep from one of the fields. The next day, Hoggett sees Babe sort the hens, separating the brown from the white ones. Impressed, he takes him to the fields and allows him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elder ewe named Maa, the sheep cooperate, but Rex sees Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs and confronts Fly in a vicious fight for encouraging Babe. He injures her leg and accidentally bites Hoggett's hand when he tries to intervene. Rex is then chained to the dog house, muzzled and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe.  One morning, Babe is awakened by the sheep's cries and finds three dogs attacking them. Though he manages to scare them off, Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result. Hoggett arrives and, thinking that Babe killed her, prepares to shoot him. Fly is so anxious to find out whether he is guilty or innocent that, instead of barking orders at the sheep, she talks to them to find out what happened. Learning the truth, she barks to distract Hoggett, delaying him until Esme mentions that the police say [[feral dogs]] have been killing sheep on neighboring farms and asks him why he has taken his shotgun out.  When Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheepherding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house. However, Duchess scratches him when he tries to speak to her, so Hoggett immediately confines her outside. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans eat pigs. Horrified, he runs out to the barn and learns from Fly that this is true. The next morning, Fly discovers that Babe has run away. She and Rex alert Hoggett and they all search for him. Rex finds him in a cemetery and Hoggett brings him home. However, he is still demoralized and refuses to eat. Hoggett gives him a drink from a baby bottle, sings to him "[[If I Had Words]]" and dances a [[jig]] for him. This restores Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection and he begins eating again.  At the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. They give him a secret password, first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, he is unanimously given the highest score. While he sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him by saying, "That'll do, Pig. That'll do."

An Awfully Big Adventure
 A hotelier ushers a child into a bomb shelter during the [[Liverpool Blitz]].  We see a brief flashback to a woman leaving her baby in a basement surrounded by flickering candles.  Before departing from the house, she quickly drops a string of pearls on the child's pillow, twined around a single rose.  Years later, 16-year-old Stella Bradshaw lives in a working class household with her Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Lily in [[Liverpool]].   Lacking an adult in her life to whom she feels close, she frequently goes into phone booths to "speak with her mother", who never appears in the film.  Her uncle, who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], signs her up for speech lessons and pulls strings to get her involved at a local repertory theatre.  After an unsuccessful audition, Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter, the troupe's sleazy, eccentric director, and Bunny, his faithful stage manager.  The impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly, self-absorbed Meredith whose [[homosexuality]] completely eludes her.  Amused, he gives her the small role of [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|Ptolemy]] the boy-king in ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' but ignores her otherwise.  Meredith reveals himself to be an amoral, apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension.  He reserves his greatest cruelty for Dawn Allenby, a desperate older actress whom he callously dismisses from the company; she later attempts suicide.   Meredith also has a long history of exploiting young men.  Stella is quickly caught up in the backstage intrigue and also becomes an object of sexual advances from men in the theatre company, including P. L. O'Hara ([[Alan Rickman]]), a brilliant actor who has returned to the troupe in a stint playing [[Captain Hook]] for its Christmas production of ''[[Peter Pan (play)|Peter Pan]]''.  In keeping with theatrical tradition, P.L. also doubles as Mr. Darling.  P.L. carries himself with grace and charisma, but privately is as troubled and disillusioned as the other members of the cast.  Haunted by his wartime experiences and a lost love, he believes, she bore him a son he never knew.  P.L. embarks on an affair with Stella, to whom he feels an inexplicably deep emotional connection.  Stella, who is still determined to win over Meredith remains emotionally detached,  but takes advantage of P.L. affections, seeing an opportunity to gain sexual experience.  The last straw for Stella is during a cast outing when Geoffrey, a fellow teenage stagehand whom Potter has been sexually toying with, bursts out and headbutts him in the nose.  The cast rushes to comfort Geoffrey, but Stella exclaims that he ought to be sacked.  P.L. explains to her that Meredith has spent his life harming people like Geoffrey and causing pain to people like Bunny who really love him: "believe it or not, it doesn't much matter him or her, old or young to Meredith.  What he wants is hearts."   Concerned, P.L. visits her aunt and uncle, who disclose Stella's history.  He finds out that Stella's long-missing mother was his lost love, whom he then knew by the nickname Stella Maris, making Stella—whom he's been sleeping with—his child, a daughter rather than the son he had imagined.  Keeping his discovery to himself, P.L. gets on his motorcycle and drives back out to the seaport.   He distractedly slips on the wet gangplank, hits his head, and is pitched into the water.  Before he drowns, he sees the woman from earlier flashbacks, clutching the infant.  Stella is later seen hastening to the phone booth to confide her woes over the phone to "her mother"—Absent Stella Maris had years ago won a nationwide contest to be the voice of the speaking clock.  It is her recorded voice that provides the only response to her daughter's confidences.

Balto (film)
 In [[New York City]], an elderly woman, her granddaughter and her [[Siberian Husky]], Blaze are walking through [[Central Park]], looking for a memorial statue. As they seat themselves for a rest, the grandmother tells a story about [[Nome, Alaska]] back in 1925, shifting the film from [[live-action]] to [[animation]]. [[Balto]], a [[wolfdog]] hybrid, lives on the outskirts of Nome with his adoptive father, a [[snow goose]] named Boris and two [[polar bears]], Muk and Luk. Being half-wolf, Balto is shunned by dogs and humans alike. His only friends in town are a beautiful red [[husky]] named Jenna, whom Balto has a crush on, and her owner, Rosy. He is later challenged by the town's favorite sled dog, Steele, a fierce and arrogant [[Alaskan Malamute]].  Later that night, all of the children, including Rosy, fall ill with [[diphtheria]] and the doctor is out of [[antitoxin]]. The local wireless operator relays news of the outbreak and word travels to the territory capital of [[Juneau]], where the governor orders antitoxin to be sent to Nome. However, severe winter weather conditions prevent medicine from being brought by sea or air and the closest rail line from Juneau ends at [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], 600 miles east of Nome. A dog race is held to determine the best-fit dogs for a sled dog team to get the medicine. Balto enters and wins, but Steele stamps on Balto's paw which causes him to growl at the musher, getting him disqualified out of fear that he might turn on the musher due to his wolfdog heritage. The team departs that night with Steele in the lead and later picks up the medicine successfully, but on the way back, conditions deteriorate and the disoriented team ends up stranded at the base of a steep mountainside slope with the musher knocked unconscious.  When the word reaches Nome that the sled team is missing, the town prepares for the worst. Balto sets out in search of the sled team, along with Boris, Muk and Luk. On the way, they are attacked by a huge [[grizzly bear]], but Jenna, who followed their mark tracks, intervenes. The bear pursues Balto out onto a frozen lake, where it falls through the ice and drowns, while Muk and Luk dive in to save Balto from a similar fate. Jenna is injured in the bear fight and cannot continue. Balto instructs Boris and the polar bears to take her back home while he continues on alone; Jenna gives him her bandanna and Boris gives him some advice.  Balto eventually finds the team, but Steele does not want his help and attacks him repeatedly until he loses his balance and falls off a cliff. Balto takes charge of the team, but Steele, refusing to concede defeat, throws them off the trail and they lose their way again. While attempting to save the medicine from falling down a cliff, Balto himself falls. Back in Nome, Jenna is explaining Balto's mission to the other dogs, but they don't believe her. When Steele returns, he claims the entire team, including Balto, is dead; he uses Jenna's bandanna as supposed proof. However, Jenna sees through his lies and assures Balto will return with the medicine, but the others remain skeptical. Using a trick Balto showed her earlier, she places broken colored glass bottles on the outskirts of town and shine a lantern on them to simulate the lights of an [[aurora]], hoping it will help guide Balto home.  When Balto regains consciousness, he is ready to give up hope, but when a large, white [[wolf]] appears and he notices the medicine crate still intact nearby, he realizes that his part-wolf heritage is a strength, not a weakness, and drags the medicine back up the cliff to the waiting team. Using his advanced senses, Balto is able to filter out the false markers Steele created. After encountering further challenges and losing only one vial, Balto and the sled team finally make it back to Nome. A pity-playing Steele is exposed as a liar and abandoned by the other dogs, ruining his reputation. Reunited with Jenna, Boris, Muk and Luk, Balto earns respect from both the other dogs and the townspeople. He visits a cured Rosy, who thanks him for saving her life.  Back in the present day, the elderly woman, her granddaughter and Blaze finally find Balto's memorial, and she explains the [[Iditarod]] trail covers the same path that Balto and his team took from Nenana to Nome. The woman is then revealed to be an older Rosy when she repeats the same line, "Thank you, Balto. I would have been lost without you," before walking off to join her granddaughter and Blaze. The film ends with the Balto statue standing proudly in the sunlight.

The Toolshed's top client, Curl Industries, is being sued in a [[class action lawsuit]] in a case currently on appeal at the Washington state Supreme Court. Curl Industries is accused of poisoning the water supply to a small town, resulting in the birth of disabled children. Grimes gives Crowe $1 million to bribe one of the justices, Justin Beach (David Ogden Stiers), into swinging the verdict in favor of Curl Industries.  Crowe and Toolshed operative Todd Stapp (Michael Beach) buy Justice Beach's $25,000 gambling debt from [[bookmaker]] Bobby Birdsong (James Hong) and pay for information on Beach's personal life from his friend, Les Goodwin (Daniel Hugh Kelly). During a secret progress report meeting, Crowe is revealed to in fact be a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] for the CIA, albeit against his will. Crowe was dismissed from the agency on suspicion of stealing a $50,000 bribe meant for an Iraqi colonel.  Crowe's former boss, William "Smitty" Smithfield (Michael Murphy), is threatening prison time for the disappearance of the bribe as leverage to get Crowe to infiltrate the Toolshed. The CIA intends to acquire the firm and use it as a [[black operations]] hub with Smitty in charge. During the meeting, as he turns over the $1 million bribe money for inspection, Crowe secretly records his conversation with Smitty, who also forces him to sign a receipt. Stapp later discovers Crowe's secret objective and extorts a payoff from Smitty to remain silent about it.  Beach accepts the $1 million bribe delivered by Crowe. He and his mistress Julie Ames (Gia Carides) sign a receipt to ensure Beach's cooperation. Beach buys tickets for a flight to the [[Caribbean]] and sends Julie ahead with the money, telling her he intends to leave his wife and join her. However, after reneging on his agreement and voting against Curl Industries, Beach commits suicide.  Despite the setback caused by Beach's death and his vote, Wells and Crowe continue with their plan to murder Grimes. Wells spends a romantic weekend with Grimes at his fishing cabin. Crowe sneaks in and shoots Grimes, then beats Wells to make it appear like the murder was a robbery gone wrong.  Wells and Crowe then take over the Toolshed, though Wells now rebuffs Crowe's affections towards her, having used him to get what she wanted. Upon hearing of her lover's death, Julie travels to Europe, sending Goodwin postcards telling him how she's enjoying spending the $1 million. Goodwin sells this information to Crowe, who in turn takes it to Wells.  Wells orders Crowe to find and kill Julie because of her knowledge of the bribe attempt. Smitty confronts Wells in her office at the Toolshed and informs her of the CIA's plan to take over and also of Crowe's involvement in the agency's infiltration.  Julie buys a gun from Goodwin and goes to Crowe's apartment to kill him in revenge for Beach's death. She arrives shortly after Wells, who also came to kill Crowe. In a chaotic shootout, Julie blindly fires at both as Crowe and Wells shoot each other dead.  Julie somehow remains unharmed. As she meticulously picks up her shell casings, she finds Crowe's briefcase containing incriminating evidence, including the tape of his conversations with Smitty and the receipt she and Beach signed. After burning the receipt, Julie mails the tape to the [[U.S. Attorney|U.S. Attorney's office]] to expose the corrupt dealings of both the CIA and the Toolshed.

Before Sunrise
 The film starts on June 16, 1994 with Jesse meeting Céline on a train from [[Budapest]] and striking up a conversation with her. Jesse is going to [[Vienna]] to catch a flight back to the [[United States]], whereas Céline is returning to university in [[Paris]] after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse convinces Céline to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her marriage and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked another guy, and this is a chance to realize that he himself is not that different from the rest; in his words, he is "the same boring, unmotivated guy." Jesse has to catch a flight early in the morning and does not have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they decide to roam around in Vienna.  After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the [[Wiener Riesenrad]] at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, [[religion]], and their observations of the city. Céline tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she "loved him too much". When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in [[Madrid]], but they had broken up when she was avoiding him while he was there. He decided to take a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a [[Eurail]] pass and traveled around Europe.  When they are walking alongside the [[Donaukanal]] (''Danube canal'') they are approached by a man who, instead of begging, offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice in it. Jesse and Céline decide on the word "milkshake", and are soon presented with the poem ''Delusion Angel'' (written for the film by the poet [[David Jewell (poet)|David Jewell]]). In a traditional [[Viennese café]], Jesse and Céline stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing each other's friends they pretend to call. Céline reveals that she was ready to get off the train with Jesse before he convinced her. Jesse reveals that after he broke up with his girlfriend, he bought a flight that really was not much cheaper, and all he really wanted was an escape from his life.  They admit their attraction to each other and how the night has made them feel, though they understand that they probably will not see each other again when they leave. They simply decide to make the best of what time they have left, ending the night with the implication of a sexual encounter between them. At that point, Jesse explains that if given the choice, he would marry her instead of never seeing her again. The film ends the next day at the [[Wien Westbahnhof|train station]], where, just as Céline's train is about to leave, the couple decides not to exchange any contact information but instead to meet at the same place in six months.

He returns to Bangalore where he works as an assistant executive for Kanara Advertising Service. Revanth is congratulated by all his colleagues including his boss and close friend James ([[Ramesh Bhat]]). He is, however, disappointed because he even though he has won an international tournament, he has absolutely no fans, very limited press coverage and no sort of recognition from the society.<br> While he is expressing his disappointment to James, he gets a call from a lady who claims that she is his fan and is calling to congratulate him personally. However, she refuses to reveal her name, instead challenges Revanth to identify her within the next half an hour, with the only clue that her name starts with R. He takes up the challenge. James and Revanth start writing down the Hindu names starting with R. Revanth is interrupted by his boss, who asks him to conduct the interviews for batch of candidates. Revanth intelligently takes the interview where he asks all candidates to write Hindu names starting with letter R. After 10 minutes, Revanth has with him lots of Indian names starting with R but is still not able to identify the mystery woman. The lady disconnects the call as she gets offended by some of the names suggested by Revanth &mdash; which were actually provided to Revanth by James.  After a couple of days, she calls again, and he apologizes for his behavior. He is mesmerized by her voice and really falls for her. He expresses his desire to meet her. She accepts only if he can find out the number where she is calling him from in the next two minutes. She gives him a puzzle, solving which he would be able to get her phone number. Revanth solves the puzzle incorrectly and gets into trouble by going to a wrong phone booth in search of the mystery woman. Revanth is frustrated by his failure when James suggests to seek the help of telephone exchange to find from where the calls were being made. Again, they fail at that too, but James meets a girl who is a telephone operator with whom he has a fling.  Revanth ends up in more trouble like getting arrested by the police for being in a room where a girl committed suicide, goes on to extreme tasks like measuring the angle of Dr Ambedkar's hand in front of Vidhana Soudha; all to find out the phone number and address of the mystery woman. He names her "Beladingala Baale", who now gives Revanth one month to find where she lives. In the meantime, based on the clues in a letter posted by the mysterious woman, Revanth determines that her name is Ramya.  Revanth has an upcoming tournament against Polonski, who is visiting India. However, before playing Polonski, Revanth has to win against the local chess master Prabhakar ([[Avinash]]). On the day of the match, he is accused of hypnotizing Prabhakar with a lemon in his pockets which was actually given to him by a novelist, Seetharam. Seetharam was avenging himself since Revanth had refused to write a testimony for his book. Revanth is disqualified from the game and has to resign from his job, too. But when he was about to resign, Beladingala Baale calls him, encourages him not to give up, and to fight this allegation. She suggests that he should challenge Prabhakar and six other chess players into playing against him simultaneously, where he would play blindfolded.  Revanth decides to try out her suggestion and challenges Prabhakar and six others. He successfully defeats each of them and his tarnished image is cleared with him being hailed a true champion.  Meanwhile, James tells Revanth that he is getting married to Sulochana ([[Vanitha Vasu (Kannada actor)|Vanitha Vasu]]), the telephone operator who helped them out while tapping his phone. Revanth tells Ramya over the phone that he is happy for James and expresses a desire to meet Ramya. She tells him to decode her address fast as the deadline is only four days away.  There are only a couple of days left and Revanth gets frustrated by his failure. He has a match against Polonski on the same day Ramya's deadline expires. He has to go to Delhi for the match. Ramya calls him and tells him that he can meet her right-away as she is giving a party to her friends at Ashoka hotel but only if he can arrive there in five minutes. Revanth reaches Ashoka hotel but could only see her hand decorated with jewels in a room filled with her friends. Revanth then calls up James and asks him to come to the hotel with five of his friends on bikes. James arrives there with his friends and Revanth asks them to follow Beladingala Baale's friends individually as he is confident that one of them will go to meet Ramya. Revanth's plan backfires as his friends themselves get caught by the women while following them. He has to leave for his match to Delhi and he heads to the airport.  While playing against Polonski, Revanth is constantly disturbed as he has only a few hours to decipher Ramya's address. In fact, the moves he makes in the chess game start to solve the puzzles that Beladingala Baale had given him to find her address. He messes up his chess moves but he finds her address there. He realizes from the clues given by her that her house is in JP Nagar, Bangalore. Polonski wins the match, but Revanth exclaims, "You have won this match, but I have won the match of my life". He calls James and tells him to search for posh houses in JP Nagar which are named Ramya. He also calls Sulochana and asks her to find the phone number of anyone whose name or company starts with Ramya in JP Nagar. From this he finds her number as 6137336.  As he rushes out of Bangalore airport, he is met by Ramya's father. Revanth explains to him that there are still couple of minutes for the deadline to expire and he has identified the address and phone number so he has won the bet. Ramya's father asks him to accompany him to their home. On the way home in their car he hands a letter written by Ramya to Revanth. Ramya writes in the letter that she had a rare disease and had only six months to live. She wanted to make friends and not tell anyone about her disease. Revanth is devastated by her letter. Her father invites him inside but instead he turns around and starts walking away without seeing her. On being asked, he tells James that she was in his imagination and he wants to keep her alive in his imagination, so he will not see her dead body. The film ends as he walks out of her house's gateway.

Some time later, the woman meets her friend at the Caffè Excelsior, but notices the director sitting nearby. She approaches him and confesses, "I killed my father. I stabbed him twelve times," and then walks away. The director follows and they talk about the killing that took place a year prior, for which she spent three months in jail before being acquitted. She takes him to the "scene of the crime" at the waterfront. Conflicted by her feelings for the director, she says, "You remind me of—somebody." They walk to her apartment and make love.

In the French countryside, a man pulls a woman from the railroad tracks as a train passes.

A woman enters his compartment, gets a phone call, and says, "Don't call me again." Meanwhile, on a nearby hill, an artist ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]) is painting the very landscape the train is passing through. He explains to a woman the value of copying from the masters.  ;''This Body of Filth'' In [[Aix-en-Provence]], the director is contemplating the paintings in his hotel lobby when he notices a man entering the building across the street to deliver architectural drawings. When he reemerges, the man, Niccolo ([[Vincent Perez]]), passes a young woman ([[Irène Jacob]]) in the doorway and decides to follow her. He asks if he can accompany her, and she tells him she's going to church. Niccolo is surprised that this quiet woman has little to say and seems uninterested in the world around her. She tells him that to be happy we need to eliminated pointless thoughts—that she prefers the quiet.  As they walk along the cobblestone streets, the young woman tells Niccolo that she longs to escape her body, that it needs too much and is never satisfied. Niccolo seems more interested in her body. When she does not respond to his romantic approaches, he observes that she looks like someone who is in love, like someone who is satisfied. She acknowledges that she is. When they arrive at the [[Church of Saint-Jean-de-Malte]], the young woman enters the church, and he follows her inside. During the service, the young woman appears deeply spiritual as the choir sings. Detached and bored, Niccolo walks around like a tourist gazing up at the architecture before sitting down away from the congregation.  Later Niccolo wakes up in the now empty church following the service. He runs out into the dark streets looking for the young woman, finding her at a well. They talk about the impermanence of things. He admits that he is scared of death, and she tells him she is scared of life—the life people lead. Niccolo accompanies the young woman home, stopping in an entranceway to escape the rain. Asked what would happen if he fell in love with her, she responds, "You'd be lighting a candle in a room full of light." When they reach her apartment, he asks to see her the next day. She replies simply, "Tomorrow I enter a convent." Niccolo walks out into the night and the rain.

He spends his days drinking with friends and creating disturbances across his father's estate. One day, Billy ruins a dinner meeting between his father and his associates by acting obnoxiously. Brian loses confidence in his son and chooses the conniving Eric Gordon as his successor. When Billy begs his father to reconsider his decision, Brian reveals that he secretly bribed Billy's school teachers to give him passing grades. The two finally compromise: Billy must complete all 12 grades in two-week intervals to prove he is competent enough to manage the company.  Shortly after enrolling into school, Billy becomes attracted to a teacher named Veronica Vaughn, who initially ignores him. Nevertheless, Billy successfully progresses through his first two grades. He finds himself as one of Veronica's students in the third grade and earns her respect by standing up for Ernie, his friend and classmate. Billy becomes popular among the third graders and misses them as he advances through school. Billy's progress alarms Eric, who becomes increasingly agitated as Billy completes each grade. Eric blackmails principal Max Anderson into claiming that Billy bribed him for passing grades, with pictures of Anderson's previous career as a masked  [[wrestler]] who accidentally killed a man in the ring.  Brian swiftly terminates his agreement with Billy and renames Eric as his successor. Billy grows distraught and reverts to his carefree lifestyle. Veronica motivates him to return to school, while his grade school classmates convince Max to retract his bribery accusations. Brian agrees to give Billy another chance but Eric cites that Billy failed the challenge by taking more than two weeks to complete a grade. He then threatens to sue Brian if he does not pass the company onto him. Billy intervenes and challenges Eric to an academic [[decathlon]] to finally settle their feud with the winner getting to run the company.  Both men excel in different activities but Billy manages to take a single-point lead before the contest's final event, a ''[[Jeopardy!]]''-style academic test. Billy stumbles on the opening question in the event, and Eric is given the chance to win the contest by answering a question about business ethics. Eric, being a highly unscrupulous businessman, cannot conceive of an answer and breaks down. He brandishes a handgun, but Max (in his wrestling gear) tackles Eric before he can harm Billy. Eric recovers from the attack and attempts to shoot Veronica, but he is shot by Danny McGrath, a rifle-wielding madman whom Billy apologized to earlier for bullying him.  At his graduation ceremony, Billy announces he will pass the hotel business to Carl Alphonse, one of his father's more polite businessmen, and attend college in order to become a teacher. Eric watches on and fumes in frustration over Billy's decision.  
The Big Green
 Teacher Anna Montgomery ([[Olivia d'Abo]]), who is on an exchange program from [[Surrey]], England, is placed into a school in the fictional tiny town of Elma, Texas. She struggles to connect with the children at first, as they believe they are underachievers doomed to dead end lives  after receiving the lowest test scores in the state for four years running. She is also shocked to learn that the children think very little of everything. So instead of teaching geography to the inattentive class, Ms. Montgomery breaks the globe in an attempt to introduce the kids to a new game. After some confusion, the children begin to learn the game of [[Association Football|soccer]]. Then at the end of the first session, Ms. Montgomery tells them that they have been entered into a league in [[Austin, Texas]], but their first game was the next day. At this point, the town Sheriff's Deputy Tom Palmer ([[Steve Guttenberg]]) becomes co-coach while at the same time becoming enamored of Montgomery.  The team travels to Austin to play against the Knights, who are the state champions and undefeated for that season. Because none of the kids have learned the rules, they do not know how to play and lose 18–0. They lose heart and do not want to play anymore, until they discover the talent of new classmate Juan Morales (Anthony Esquivel), but have to persuade his mother to let him play. From the beginning, she insists that Juan avoids making bonds with anyone around because of how much it would hurt him if they had to leave soon. The reason they move a lot is because she is trying to keep a low profile to avoid being caught on account of legal citizenship matters. However, after enough begging from the clan, she reluctantly agrees to let Juan join the team. Once Juan joins the team, they go on a remarkable run to the finals, with a record of eight wins, two losses, and one tie, and in the finals they meet the Knights. As the town goes crazy for the final, hometown boy and current Knights coach Jay Huffer ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) returns to Elma, and finds in the bar the drunken father of Kate Douglas ([[Jessica Robertson]]), one of the players, who tells Huffer (who also just so happens to have a job with the IRS) via bribery that Juan and his mother are illegal immigrants, leading to an investigation that the sheriff forces Deputy Palmer to take up that ultimately forces them to flee frantically to avoid deportation. Though we learn that Juan was born native, while it was his mother who wasn't. Kate is left furious with both her father and Deputy Palmer over the situation, but Montgomery is able to convince her to stay on the team and forgive them.  On the day of the final, Deputy Palmer goes looking for Juan to help the team in the final, and by halftime the team is down 2–0. With 10 minutes to play, there is an injury to a Knights player, and in this time Juan returns with Deputy Palmer and his mother, and he is substituted into the game immediately. He sets up Elma's first goal, and with the last kick of the match, scores the equalizer himself. The game then goes into a shootout, and after the first three shots are scored by each team, both teams miss their fourth kick. In the final kick, the Knights captain, top scorer in the league and son of the coach, Jay Huffer Jr., steps onto the field. The Big Green goalie Larry Musgrove ([[Patrick Renna]]), who suffered from visions of the opposition players becoming "monsters," manages to turn himself into a monster in his own fantasy, in order to psych out the opponent and save the kick. The final kick for the championship was to be taken by the Big Green's smallest, and youngest player, Newt Shaw ([[Bug Hall]]). As he runs in to take the kick, he slips but still sails the ball into the bottom left corner, giving the championship to the Big Green. Huffer, having made a bet with Montgomery if his Knights were to lose, kisses the Big Green's goat mascot, much to his disgust.  At the beginning of the movie, there was a billboard for the town's only other sporting success, in [[American football|football]] back in the 1970s, but the end of the movie shows a new billboard, one documenting the success of the Big Green, and also a sticker saying they had the 4th highest test scores in the state.

Bontoc Eulogy
 The unnamed narrator, a serious [[Filipino-American]] immigrant, muses of his days in the [[Philippines]] and continues on to speculate on the mysterious disappearance of both of his grandfathers. His curiosity leads him to research his past and urges him to discover the whereabouts of his kin. He offers the audience an inside look to his internal conflict regarding his family history by narrating throughout the film. Much of the movie consists of snapshots and footage of the [[World's Fair]] and some of the "real" footage has been, in fact, just a reenactment of what is thought to be the past.  The film begins with the narrator thinking of his children and subsequently thinking of his days as a child in the Philippines. He expresses his sadness of belonging to neither country (America or Philippines) and his desire to gain a foundation for his personal history. With this said, the narrator recounts the story of both of his grandfathers' lives. One of the grandfathers' (Emeliano) had fought in the revolution against [[Spain]] in 1896 and the [[Philippine-American War]] in 1899, only to be killed in the trenches and never have his body found. The narrator speculates that his grandfather is probably buried in one of the several mass graves on the outskirts of [[Manila]].  While Emiliano had an interesting death by fighting in the war, the other's story was far more interesting. The other grandfather, named Markod, had been an Igarot warrior in the Philippines. When the Americans had first came to the village, the tribal members were afraid. But, they soon realized that the Americans wanted to become friends and take them to America to showcase their culture. Markod was, at first, hesitant since his wife was expecting a child. In 1904, Markod and several families of his village decided to go America as participants in the [[St. Louis World's Fair]]. At the time, Markod had been a young chief, known for his skills as a hunter and warrior.  Markod was first taken to [[San Francisco]] on a boat and then taken to [[St. Louis]] on a train, where 2 of his companions froze to death in a boxcar. Once at [[St. Louis]], the Igarots built an entire village out of the "traditional" elements of the [[Philippines]]. The St. Louis World's Fair was set to begin.  At the [[World's Fair]], many people came to see the men and women on display at the Philippine reservation. These people wanted to catch a glimpse of the Filipino in flesh and blood, in their "natural habitat". Over 1,000 "natives" of various heritages were on display simultaneously at the fair. Native tribes which had not known of each other's existence were placed next to each other on the reservation. The aim of this was to show to the American people the various stages of social progress, from "barbaric" to "civilized" and [[Christian]]. Markod admired the skills of the different tribes and he marveled at the various animals on display at the fair.  One day, a sick baby girl born to an African couple was taken away and never seen again. The father of the child talked about the incident and the authorities of the [[World's Fair]] became wary of an uprising. Extra scouts were posted in the village. Markod thought about how the Western people say that their [[God]] is strong, but their medicines are weak. The death of the child deeply disturbed Markod and he became fearful that evil things would begin to happen. Markod became homesick and missed his wife and home in the mountains. He became disturbed at the noise and brightness of the fair and longed for the quietness of his home. Two Igarot men also disappeared and the whole village mourned at their death. They mourned for days while the American public watched, unaware of their grief.  Markod tried to escape after this incident. He escaped into the woods and relished the music of the sounds of nature he knew so well. He hoped to get by unnoticed and would be able to escape from the fair. When reaching the edge of the forest, he fell into a deep sleep, only to awaken surrounded by unknown American faces. He was then placed in a solitary confinement to keep him from escaping.  When the World's Fair ended, Markod mysteriously disappeared. The narrator comes back into the plot here and he discovers through archives, that there had been an unusual incident just before the closing of the fair, which involved the death of an Igarot male. The remains had been mangled beyond recognition, but authorities had determined that he was Filipino by the color of his skin. This man could have been Markod, or he could have been put on display at other fairs around the country. Still, Markod's remains could currently be displayed at the [[Smithsonian Museum]] where the brains of two Filipinos had been removed immediately after their death.  At the end of the film, the location of Markod's body was still unknown and the narrator still wonders on the whereabouts of his ancestor.

Braveheart
 In 1280, [[Edward I of England|King Edward "Longshanks"]] invades and conquers [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] following the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland]], who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including ''Prima Nocte''. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to [[Action at Lanark|slaughter the English garrison]] in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.  Longshanks orders his son [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of [[Robert the Bruce]], the son of nobleman [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Elder]] and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife [[Isabella of France]] to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.  After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay, having been bribed by Longshanks, betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the [[Battle of Falkirk|battle]]. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce, but filled with remorse, Bruce gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.  In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, "Mercy", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.  In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.

Time passes, Holly is free and with Abe and her daughter, which is celebration to all family and friends. Robin is now in a wheelchair, very far along with [[AIDS]] and not expected to live much longer. At the party, Robin weakly begins to sing the Roy Orbison song "[[You Got It (Roy Orbison song)|You Got It]]" as a reference to her first conversation with Jane, and Jane gently finishes the song. In the final scene, Robin has died from AIDS, Holly and Abe plan to stay in Arizona and become a family, and Jane hits the road to seek a new life in [[Los Angeles]].

The Brady Bunch Movie
  Larry Dittmeyer, an unscrupulous real estate developer, explains to his supervisor that almost all the families in his neighborhood have agreed to sell their property as part of a plan to turn the area into a shopping mall, except for the Brady family.  At the Bradys' house, Mike and Carol are having breakfast prepared by their housekeeper, Alice, while the six children prepare for school. Jan is jealous of her elder, popular sister Marcia. Cindy is tattling about everything she's hearing. Greg is dreaming of becoming a singer (but sings folk songs more appropriate to the seventies). Peter is nervous that his [[Puberty|voice is breaking]]. Bobby is excited about his new role as hall monitor at school.   Cindy gives Mike and Carol a tax delinquency notice (which was earlier mistakenly delivered to the Dittmeyers) stating that they face foreclosure on their house if they do not pay $20,000 in back taxes. The two initially ignore the crisis, but when Mike's architectural design (which is exactly the same as their house) is turned down by two potential clients, he tells Carol that they may have to sell the house.   Cindy overhears this and tells her siblings and they look for work to raise money to save the house, but their earnings are nowhere near enough to reach the required sum. Mike manages to sell a [[Japan]]ese company on one of his dated designs, thereby securing the money, only for Larry to sabotage it by claiming that Mike's last building collapsed.  On the night before the Bradys have to move out, Marcia suggests that they enter a "Search for the Stars" contest, the prize of which is exactly $20,000. Jan, having originally suggested this and been rejected, runs away from home. Cindy sees her leave and tattles, and the whole family goes on a search for her. They use their car's [[citizens' band radio]], and their transmission is heard by Schultzy ([[Ann B. Davis]]), a long-haul trucker who picks up Jan and convinces her to return home.  The next day, the children join the "Search for the Stars" contest with a dated performance that receives poor audience response compared to the more modern performances of other bands. However, the judges — [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]], [[Micky Dolenz]], and [[Peter Tork]] of [[The Monkees]] — vote for them, and they win the contest as a result. The tax bill is paid and their neighbors withdraw their homes from the market, foiling Larry's plan and securing the neighborhood.  Later, Carol's mother ([[Florence Henderson]]) arrives and finally convinces Jan to stop being jealous of Marcia, only for Cindy to start feeling jealous of Jan.

During a late night delivery, Max accidentally stumbles across a fire in Bragdon's mansion and is cornered by FBI Agent Palmer ([[Jon Polito]]), but accidentally picks up Agent Palmer’s gun and manages to escape. Max later sees a news report in which Palmer claims that Bragdon was killed in the fire, which was set up by Max to stop him from exposing a money-laundering conspiracy. Now on the run from the law, Max contacts his boss and learns that a final package is to be delivered to Bragdon, but at his mountain cabin in Devil's Peak.  Max heads for Devil's Peak to clear his name, but a store clerk and scoutmaster Jack Erickson ([[Brad Sullivan]]) recognize his face and he is forced to threaten both with his gun, gluing Erickson to his car's steering wheel and ordering him to drive off to lure the police away while stealing Erickson's van. He is subsequently mistaken for a scoutmaster scheduled to lead a group of boy scouts on an expedition. Max goes along with the ruse to keep heading for Devil's Peak. The FBI find and release Erickson, and set up a base of operations at a nearby cabin while Palmer and Erickson pursue Max and the scouts. Though they are nearly captured, Max cuts the bridge between two cliffs, forcing Palmer and Erickson to take the longer route.  Along the way, the scouts build a makeshift radio and learn who Max truly is. They lace his water with sleeping pills and use smoke signs to signal their location to Erickson. Max ends up sedated, but Palmer handcuffs Erickson to a tree and captures Max alone, promising the scouts a rescue helicopter, but the suspicious scouts follow in secret. Max awakens and Palmer leads him to a helicopter, where Max discovers Bragdon is alive, working with Palmer to steal the laundered money from the authorities and having faked his death after coming under suspicion in order to frame Max. Before they can kill Max, the scouts intervene and knock Palmer out, but Max falls into the river and the scouts follow. They reach safety and throw their backpacks in the river to drive Palmer and Bragdon off. Out of supplies, the scouts decide to remain with Max and help him reach Devil's Peak. Meanwhile, one of the scouts' mothers, Mrs. Patterson ([[Ann Dowd]]) uncovers Max's discarded tissue and realizes that he is leading them to Devil's Peak, and gives chase in her van when Palmer's bumbling assistant, Agent McMurrey ([[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]]), refuses to help her. She arrives first, but is captured by Bragdon.  Max and the scouts arrive as Bragdon receives the final package. Palmer catches up and prepares to kill them, but is subdued by Erickson, who freed himself and followed Max. Max sneaks into the cabin to free Mrs. Patterson. Bragdon appears and forces them to the edge of the cliff at gunpoint. Mrs. Patterson's son, Gordy, charges Bragdon but falls over a cliff and hangs onto a branch for his life. Max knocks Bragdon out and climbs down the cliff and pulls Gordy to safety.  With Bragdon and Palmer captured, Max's name is cleared and in response to his efforts, he is awarded a scoutmaster's honor and given charge of an even bigger group of scouts for a more challenging mission, to his chagrin.

Canadian Bacon
  Thousands of former employees are outraged with military businessman R.J. Hacker ([[G. D. Spradlin]]), who had closed down his weapons manufacturing plant, Hacker Dynamics. At a conference held at the former plant, he pins the blame for the shutdown of his business on the current [[President of the United States]] ([[Alan Alda]]), who has just arrived. The President defends his own belief that the future of the children is more important than war, which has caused major decline in his approval rating. After the conference, he expresses to confidantes General Dick Panzer ([[Rip Torn]]) and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Stuart Smiley ([[Kevin Pollak]]) his discontent about not having an enemy to engage in war. An attempted negotiation with [[President of Russia|Russian President]] Vladimir Kruschkin ([[Richard E. Council]]) to start a new [[Second Cold War|cold war]] with Russia fails, and the President's suggestion of a war on international terrorism is deemed too absurd.  Serendipitously, American sheriff Bud Boomer ([[John Candy]]) offensively criticizes Canadian beer while attending a hockey game between the neighboring nations in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. The ensuing brawl ends up on the news and catches Stuart's attention; Stuart, in turn, collects more information about Canada from a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent named Gus ([[Brad Sullivan]]), who suggests Canada as their new enemy. Before long, television channels are littered with [[Anti-Canadianism|anti-Canada]] propaganda, which Boomer believes wholeheartedly. He prepares for war by distributing guns to his fellow sheriffs, including his girlfriend Honey ([[Rhea Perlman]]) and their friends Roy Boy ([[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]]) and Kabral Jabar ([[Bill Nunn]]). After they apprehend a group of Americans "dressed as Canadians" attempting to destroy a hydroelectric plant, despite Gus's protests, they sneak across the border to litter on Canadian lands, which leads to Honey being arrested by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. In a rescue attempt, Boomer, Roy Boy and Kabral sneak into a Canadian power plant and cause a countrywide blackout. When the President learns of this, he orders Boomer's immediate removal from Canada before it's too late.  Hacker, seeking revenge on the President for shutting down his business, uses a software program ("Hacker Hellstorm") to activate missile silos across the country. The President learns that the signal causing the activation of the silos originated from Canada, and summons Hacker. Hacker offers to sell a program to the President that can cancel out the Hellstorm — for $1 trillion. With only six minutes left, the President is trying to figure out what's going on. Stuart, fed up with the President being too busy to give Hacker the money, realizes that Hacker, getting up to leave, is the one controlling the silos, not Canada, and, after storming up, takes the operating codes from him required to stop the Hellstorm (accidentally killing Hacker in the process). The President orders Stuart's arrest, despite his protests that he is now able to give the codes to the President so they could deactivate the missiles which are aimed at [[Moscow]]. As the launch time approaches the President pleads with [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] Clark MacDonald ([[Wallace Shawn]]) over the phone to stop the launch.  Meanwhile, Honey was taken to a mental hospital upon her capture and escaped all the way to the [[CN Tower]]. She discovers the central computer for the Hellstorm located at the top and destroys it with a machine gun, aborting the launch sequence. She then reunites with Boomer, who had tracked her to the Tower, and they return to the United States via a speedboat.  An ending montage reveals the characters' fates: Boomer realizes his dream of appearing on ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''; Honey has been named "Humanitarian of the Year" by the [[National Rifle Association]]; the President was defeated in the next election by a large landslide and now hosts "Get Up, Cleveland"; Stuart served eight months in prison, but was pardoned by the new [[Oliver North|President]]; General Panzer committed suicide after learning that "[[Hogan's Heroes]]" was fictional; Gus was last spotted heading to [[Mexico]]; R.J. Hacker's body has been viewed daily at Republican National Headquarters; Kabral has become a hockey star, winning the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] three years in a row; Roy Boy's whereabouts become unknown; and MacDonald is "still ruling with an iron fist."  
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh

Candyman kills Purcell in a public bathroom following a book signing. Annie's brother, Ethan, is accused of Purcell's murder because of previous confrontations between the two over the subject. After one of Annie's students claims to have seen the Candyman, she tries to discredit the legend by invoking his name. Annie summons Candyman to New Orleans on the eve of [[Mardi Gras]], where the killings begin in earnest. Her husband, Paul Mckeever, becomes one of Candyman's victims, while one of her students, Matthew, disappears.  The Candyman is revealed to be Daniel Robitaille, son of a slave on a [[plantation]] in New Orleans. Daniel was chosen by a wealthy landowner to paint a portrait of his daughter Caroline, resulting in an affair between the two. After Caroline became pregnant, Caroline's father organized a [[lynching|lynch mob]] to hunt down Daniel, cut off his right hand, and coat him in honey from a nearby beehive. A small boy tasted the honey and proclaimed "Candy Man!"; the crowd chanted the name as Daniel was stung to death. Caroline's father taunted the disfigured Daniel with Caroline's mirror, leading to the mirror containing Candyman's [[soul]]. Caroline hid the mirror in Daniel's birthplace before giving birth to his daughter, Isabel, a [[Creole peoples|Creole]] who is raised by her mother as white. The mirror grants Candyman his ability to kill when called upon.  Annie is revealed to be the descendant of Daniel and Caroline. Candyman stalks Annie so he may kill her and himself at midnight on [[Ash Wednesday]]. After talking with Ethan, Annie visits Honore Thibideaux, who tells her Caroline moved to New Orleans after Daniel's death. Candyman appears and kills him with bees while Annie escapes. At the police station, Candyman slays a detective interrogating Ethan, who is shot dead when he tries to escape. Octavia, Annie's guilt-ridden mother, admits Coleman tried to link their family to Candyman but denies he exists. Incensed by her disbelief of him, the Candyman introduces himself before killing her; Annie flees. It is revealed that Coleman, driven to madness at his search for the mirror, eventually gave in and summoned Candyman to justify his search at the expense of his life.  Annie flees to Daniel's birthplace, where she finds Matthew. She falls through the stairs into the flooded basement, where she finds the mirror and Candyman. He reveals that the mirror is the source of his resurrection and tries to sacrifice her. Annie destroys the mirror, destroying Candyman in the process. The slave quarters crash into the river, but Matthew saves Annie by pulling her out. Several years later, Annie has Paul's daughter, who she has named Caroline. After Annie kisses Caroline goodnight and leaves the room, Caroline starts to chant Candyman's name. Annie stops her and tells her to go to bed.  
Carnosaur 2
 At the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]], a teenage hacker boy named Jesse is caught trying to steal dynamite. His uncle bails him out, and a workman teaches him how to operate a [[forklift]]. That night, an animal appears at the repository's mess hall and kills everyone but Jesse. When communications from the repository cease, a group of technicians and scientists are called on to investigate. The facility, once a [[uranium]] mine, laboratory, and refinery, has become a classified government facility. The investigators find the place deserted; three go to the control room to try to reboot the computer system, while the other three form a search party. They locate Jesse, catatonic and in a state of shock.  They take him back to the control room and demand answers from Major Tom McQuade, the head of the mission, who evades their questions. When they demand to leave, he orders them back to work, despite their continuing problems with the communications equipment. The main crew heads down to a lower level to investigate the situation while the pilot, Galloway and computer expert Moses stay in the control center with Jesse. On the lower level, the crew gets more and more suspicious but McQuade continues to act as if he knows nothing. When an animal drags Kahane down a tunnel and kills him, the crew flee back to the control room, realizing that McQuade had been up to something after all. Jesse, listening to their radio chatter, realizes what happened and flees the room just before a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' appears and eats Moses. Galloway flees to the helicopter and starts it up. Before the crew can reach her, a ''Velociraptor'' in the back seat attacks her. Galloway loses control and crashes the chopper, stranding the crew.  The group returns to the control room, kept safe by heavy metal doors. There, they learn of [[Carnosaur (film)|the dinosaur's origins]] from McQuade: a brilliant genetic scientist working for a [[poultry farming|poultry company]] went mad and decided to wipe out all of humanity by using a [[virus]] made from prehistoric [[DNA]] to [[impregnate]] first the [[chicken|birds]], then human females with dinosaurs. The government narrowly contained the situation, but kept some of the eggs for analysis, storing them in the plant to be hidden. The eggs hatched and killed off the entire crew, and the electrical damage is putting the plant at risk of meltdown. McQuade organized the mission to prevent the meltdown and save the dinosaurs for research. The crew, unsympathetic to McQuade, decide to blow up the dinosaurs with dynamite. McQuade chases after them but is beaten in a brief fight. McQuade explains that he was trying to stop them from going into the facility's lower levels, because radiation from secretly stored nuclear waste and warheads is leaking out and the containment will eventually fail completely.  Jesse devises a plan to [[Crash (computing)|crash]] the computers to send the site into emergency mode, which should get an evacuation squad to come and rescue them. Once the plan is put into place, the group begins making its way back to the surface. They continue using dynamite to hold off any dinosaurs while getting to the elevator. A raptor breaks into the elevator and eats Rawlins. Monk and McQuade are injured and blow themselves up to kill the remaining raptors.  Jesse and Jack, now on their own, continue making their way up. Jack, however, has taken a long fall and is injured. Jesse runs outside to find the evacuation team waiting. He tries to get them to go back for Jack, but they refuse, so he runs back in himself and encounters a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Jesse helps Jack get to the rescue helicopter, just as the ''T. rex'' bursts out and bites the head off one of the rescue crew. Jesse runs back again, and gets in the forklift. Using the forklift remote, he opens the door to the elevator shaft and wrestles the dinosaur with the forklift, eventually weakening it enough to push it down the shaft. Jesse and Jack are flown off, and Jesse uses a remote detonator to detonate the rest of the dynamite, destroying the facility and preventing a meltdown.

Casino (1995 film)
  In 1973, sports handicapper and Mafia associate Sam "Ace" Rothstein is sent to Las Vegas to run the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Union]]-funded Tangiers Casino on behalf of the Chicago Outfit, which secretly controls the Teamsters, while Philip Green serves as the Mob's front man. Taking advantage of gaming laws that allow him to work in a casino while his gaming licence is pending, Sam doubles the casino's profits, which are skimmed by the Mafia before they are reported to income tax agencies. Impressed with his work, Mafia boss Remo Gaggi sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicholas "Nicky" Santoro and his associate Frank "Frankie" Marino to protect Sam and the whole operation. Nicky's volatile temper soon gets him banned from every casino in Las Vegas, so he gathers his own crew and engages in independent shakedowns and burglaries, instead.  Sam meets and falls in love with a hustler and former prostitute, Ginger McKenna. They conceive a daughter and marry, but their marriage is proven difficult by Ginger's covetousness and love for her manipulative former boyfriend, con artist-turned pimp Lester Diamond. Lester is beaten severely by Sam and Nicky after they catch him conning Ginger out of some money. Ginger subsequently turns to alcohol. Meanwhile, Sam makes an enemy in county commissioner Pat Webb for firing his brother-in-law Don Ward for incompetence. When Sam refuses to reinstate him, Webb pulls Sam's license from the backlog, forcing him to face a hearing for his gaming license while secretly arranging for the board to deny Sam. Sam blames the incident on Nicky's recklessness and the two argue furiously in the desert after Sam attempts to tell Nicky to leave Las Vegas.  Meanwhile, the casino counters begin stealing some money for themselves, prompting the Midwest Mafia bosses to put Artie Piscano of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mafia]] in charge of overseeing the transactions. Piscano is unable to find the thieves, but keeps tabs on everything he knows about Las Vegas in a private notebook, ranting about it in his grocery store. The FBI, investigating a separate crime, have wired Piscano's store, and Piscano's detailed complaints, complete with names, spurs the FBI to begin investigating the casino. Meanwhile, Sam finally seeks divorce from Ginger, tired of her alcoholism. She then kidnaps their daughter, Amy, taking her to Los Angeles, and plans to flee to Europe with Lester. Sam convinces her to come back with Amy, and then scolds her for stealing his money and kidnapping their daughter. After he overhears Ginger talking on the phone about killing him, he kicks her out of the house, but soon relents. Ginger then approaches Nicky for help in getting her valuables from their shared vault in the bank, and the two start an affair. Sam discovers this after finding Amy tied to her bed by Ginger, who is with Nicky at his restaurant. Sam disowns Ginger, as does Nicky. A furious and drunk Ginger crashes her car into Sam's driveway, making a scene, and retrieves the key to their deposit box after distracting the attending police. Even though she succeeds in taking her share of the money from the bank, she is arrested by the FBI as a material witness.  The FBI moves in and closes the casino. Green decides to cooperate with the authorities. Piscano dies of a heart attack upon observing federal agents discover his notebook. Nicky flees Las Vegas before he can be caught. The FBI approaches Sam for help, but he turns them down. The bosses are arrested and put on trial, and decide to eliminate anyone involved in the scheme to prevent them from testifying. Among those killed are three casino executives, Teamsters head Andy Stone, and money courier John Nance. Ginger travels to Los Angeles and ultimately dies of a drug overdose in a motel. Sam himself is almost killed by a car bomb, and suspects Nicky was behind it. Before Sam can take revenge, Nicky and his brother Dominick are ambushed by Frankie and their own crew, beaten and buried alive in a cornfield, the bosses having had enough of Nicky's behavior and suspecting his role in Sam's car bombing.  With the Mob now out of power, the old casinos are purchased by big corporations and demolished. The corporations build new and gaudier attractions, which Sam laments are not the same as when the Mafia was in control. Sam subsequently retires to San Diego and continues to live as a sports handicapper for the Mob, in his own words, ending up "right back where I started".

La Cérémonie
  ''La Cérémonie'' tells the story of a young woman, Sophie Bonhomme ([[Sandrine Bonnaire]]),<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135028/La-C-233-r-233-monie/overview New York Times Review]</ref> who is hired as a maid by the Lelièvre family. The Lelièvres live in an isolated mansion in Brittany. The family consists of four members: Catherine ([[Jacqueline Bisset]]) and Georges, the parents, who have no children together, but one each from previous marriages. Gilles is Catherine's and her ex-husband's son. He is a lonely teenager who loves reading and has a passion for arts in general. Melinda is Georges' and his late wife's daughter. She studies at a university and only spends the weekends at home, where she invites her boyfriend Jérémie. The household chores are excessive for Catherine – who owns her own art gallery – so she requires a maid's help and hires Sophie. Throughout the film Sophie avoids using the dishwasher, refuses to take driving lessons, buys fake eyeglasses, and has trouble giving a cashier the correct change. The viewer finds out later that Sophie is illiterate and has a history of violence since she is believed to have killed her handicapped father, or at least not to have rescued him from the fire she might have set in his house.  Once in the small village, Sophie meets Jeanne ([[Isabelle Huppert]]), the postmistress, who occasionally works in a charity and reads a lot. However, Jeanne proves to be a bad influence on the maid since she is jealous and aggressive towards a lot of people, including the Lelièvres, whose mail she vandalises. She also has a violent history. The two friends meet regularly either for a charity project (that they end up ruining) or for a film; television being Sophie's main pastime. Sophie is treated rather nicely at the Lelièvres, who mean well towards her, but their patronizing attitude and the affection they have for each other create a feeling of jealousy and frustration both in Sophie and in Jeanne. This frustration reaches its climax when Georges fires Sophie for attempting to blackmail Melinda, who found out about her illiteracy. It is what triggers the climax of the film, which sees Sophie and Jeanne seize Georges’ shotguns and murder the family who were watching an opera on television.  Jeanne leaves the crime scene and is killed in a car accident by the priest who had fired her from the charity she worked for. Sophie, for her part, walks away from the house after having wiped their fingerprints off the guns, making her way through the police squads at the accident. The end credits begin with the music of the opera that is being played back by a policeman on Melinda's tape-recorder, which Jeanne stole and put in her car. At the end of the credits, the gunshots can be heard on the tape and then the voices of Jeanne and Sophie, constituting evidence against them. Chabrol presents an ambiguous view of culture and class conflict in this film, which he jokingly called "the last Marxist film."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=P8&xml=/arts/2006/04/15/bfdvd15.xml DVDs of the week: ''The Night of The Shooting Stars'', ''Day of the Dead'' and more] 15 April 2006</ref>

On the advice of the estate's executor, the three plan to stay at the [[castle]] until they can liquidate the estate.

He has emerged hungry for [[blood]], leading to a series of unexplained [[death]]s and disappearances, including that of a non-English speaking [[prostitute]] whom John picked up and brought to the castle after being rejected by his wife, who becomes angry with him for [[Infidelity|cheating]].  When the [[police]] name John their prime suspect, he must find the true murderer before he or his family becomes the next victim. Along the way, he must not only battle the [[monster|creature]] itself but overcome [[demon]]s from his own [[guilt (emotion)|guilty]] past.  The prostitute is sexually mutilated and killed by the monster, who also prowls around the bedroom of the terrified Rebecca, who can hear, but not see, him. The monster later kills one of the [[policemen]] investigating the castle, as well as the maid who lives at the castle and finds the prostitute's body.

Catnapped!
 For a whole week, Toriyasu and his little sister, Meeko, have been missing their pet dog, Papadoll. Toriyasu thinks he ran off, but Meeko claims it was an alien abduction. Though Toriyasu mocks Meeko for her over-imaginative ways, she isn't far off from the truth. On the way to school, Meeko sees what looks like a cat in clothes slipping into the shadows. Later that evening, three [[anthropomorphic]] feline scientists, Henoji, Suttoboke and HoiHoi go into Toriyasu and Meeko's room intending to take Toriyasu with them on a trip. Instead they end up waking and taking Meeko as well. She accompanies them in their vehicle (a balloon that resembles a cheshire cat) with a tired Toriyasu.  The cats soon reach their own world: Banipal Witt, a world of incredibly strange variety. Suddenly, they run into the Sleeping Cat, the very support of Banipal Witt. If the Sleeping Cat wakes, their world would [[Armageddon|be destroyed]]. The two children soon find that Banipal Witt is far different than their home: Three minutes in the human world is one day in Banipal Witt and the cats are only anthropomorphic in Banipal Witt (Henoji having remarked that, because of the human world, their life expectancy has decreased). Both Toriyasu and Meeko are turned into anthropomorphic kittens<ref></ref> by the sun of Banipal Witt (which is magical in nature) as soon as they set foot on Banipal Witt.  Soon, the kids meet the leader of a resistance: Master Sandada, a powerful wizard. Sadly, in the absence of the trio sent to find Toriyasu and Meeko, Sandada has fallen victim to a curse from Lady Buburina, a dictator-like princess that has gone insane and (due to an enchantment) turns anyone she touches into a balloon. Sandada was unable to protect himself, because his last line of defense- a mystic glove called the Sorcerer's Arm -was stolen by DohDoh, his apprentice that had fallen to insanity due to a curse. Master Sandada explains that he brought Toriyasu here to catch Papadoll, who has supposedly been wreaking havoc across Banipal Witt.  ChuChu, DohDoh's younger sister and the strongest fighter for the resistance, comes to warn that Papadoll has been abducting more villagers and is approaching their location fast. Papadoll soon arrives and the kids can't believe their eyes: Their dog has been turned into a giant, flying monster. DohDoh leaves Sandada with an [[ultimatum]] from Buburina: If Sandada doesn't surrender before the next sunrise, great disaster shall befall Banipal Witt. Meeko manages to get Papadoll to calm down, but an interruption from Toriyasu sends Papadoll into a fit of rage. In the confusion, Meeko is taken hostage and things begin to look grim.  Some time later, Sandada explains that when a creature from another world is touched by the sun twice, they become what Papadoll has become. Expectedly, Toriyasu freaks out, demanding to go home, but the others manage to reason with him because of the fact that he needs to save his sister.  Meanwhile, at the palace, the prisoners (including Meeko) attempt to break out. Meeko comes close, but ends up trapped near the throne room. Listening in on a conversation between Buburina and her parents, she finds out that Buburina's power is supposed to be a punishment that was cast by a wizard who sought revenge against her for sending his daughter to her death (even though Buburina claimed that it wasn't her fault).  Back at Sandada's manor, Toriyasu (along with Henoji, Suttoboke, HoiHoi and ChuChu) are sent by Sandada to Buburina's palace to knock Papadoll out with a pill that contains sleeping powder that Sandada claims would make an animal like Papadoll sleep for a week and Papadoll's chain. Before leaving, Sandada says that only Toriyasu has the power to turn Papadoll back to normal.  Later that night, Buburina calls an assembly to inform her prisoners of their fate. She tells her prisoners of her plan to create a giant mouse that would be used to wake the Sleeping Cat should anyone rebel against her, sending Banipal Witt into turmoil. Meeko, however, ridicules Buburina's plan, claiming that Papadoll wouldn't do that. Meeko demands the return of Papadoll and insults the princess by calling her a witch. Buburina, having been upset by Meeko's insult, tries to turn her into a balloon and pop her, but finds she cannot (the curse only affects people from Banipal Witt). Realizing that Meeko is a human, Buburina plans to make Meeko her new monster slave once the sun rises. She then turns all her prisoners into balloons (so that she can finish her mouse balloon) and throws Meeko inside also.  Under cover of night, Toriyasu and the others prepare to sneak into the castle to free Papadoll and save Meeko. Unfortunately, the plan goes awry, as Toriyasu accidentally wakes Buburina up when the rope he is on slips, setting off alarms all over the castle. Toriyasu and ChuChu make an escape, while Suttoboke (who broke off from the group because he got Meeko's scent) runs into DohDoh in an attempt to save Meeko.  Quickly, Toriyasu and ChuChu (after having a bonding moment) regroup in time to see Suttoboke and Meeko release the mouse balloon. With Buburina's plan falling apart at the seams, DohDoh goes to try to kill Meeko and Suttoboke, while Toriyasu and ChuChu go to try to get Papadoll under control and stop Buburina.  In the ensuing air battle, Toriyasu suffers through a temporary depression caused by DohDoh's taunting (having remembered a time when he beat Papadoll to release some built-up anger that had been caused by teasing from three neighborhood bullies). DohDoh, however, is dealt a hard fate by karma, as he breaks the mouse balloon when he gets too close to the castle and loses his hold on the Sorcerer's Arm. Toriyasu, remembering what Master Sandada had said before he left, regains faith in himself and tries to take Papadoll back. Buburina, however, refuses to give back Papadoll and nearly makes Toriyasu fall to his death after Buburina tears Papadoll's collar off.  During his fall, Papadoll finally remembers Toriyasu (having ignored Buburina's orders to eat Toriyasu) and Toriyasu remembers how much Papadoll means to him (shown in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] form). Toriyasu then goes insane for only a few seconds before regaining composure after landing on one of Buburina's victims. Using the victim as a means of transportation (even though the said victim tries to protest as best he can to this idea), he reaches Papadoll (avoiding seeking missiles fired by Buburina) and regains control of him with ChuChu's help. However, the signal tower (the enormous [[flare gun]]-like device that lights Banipal Witt's sun every morning) goes off, leaving Toriyasu and the others only a few seconds to save Meeko.  Quickly, they rescue Meeko and make it home. Buburina and DohDoh both end up with miserable fates: Buburina is left sinking into a small lake, and DohDoh tangled in what remains of the mouse balloon.  Toriyasu and Meeko return to normal (no longer transformed by Banipal Witt's sun), Toriyasu and ChuChu develop a relationship and the cats say that the two can visit any time and they can also choose to be cats again if they want. Before returning home, Meeko makes a prediction that Buburina will make a comeback.  The next morning, Toriyasu and Meeko return to a normal life. Unbeknownst to the children, Meeko is right again: The cats go to Toriyasu and Meeko's school due to some urgent business that came up only recently, leaving the movie on a [[cliffhanger]].  
Casper (film)
 In the town of [[Friendship, Maine]], two young boys Nicky and Andreas enter a creepy, old mansion called Whipstaff Manor, apparently on a dare, but they are scared away by a ghost named [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]. Later, after the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers he has only left her Whipstaff Manor in his will. Carrigan and her assistant, Dibs, learn of a treasure allegedly hidden somewhere within the manor, but upon investigation they find the manor haunted by Casper and his obnoxious prankster uncles, the [[Ghostly Trio]], who scare the two off the property. The two make several attempts to force the ghosts out of the manor by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team, to no avail. Meanwhile, a lonely Casper watches a news report of paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat. Longing for a friend, this provides Casper the idea of inspiring Carrigan into summoning Dr. Harvey to Whipstaff. Harvey and Kat have an estranged relationship due to the former’s reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. Moving into Whipstaff, Casper's attempt in befriending the Harveys fails when his uncles try to scare them out of the house.  The next morning, Casper manages to gain the Harvey's trust when he serves them breakfast. He follows Kat to school where she becomes popular when her class learns that she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party there. However, Amber, Kat’s classmate who immediately dislikes her, becomes envious of Kat stealing her spotlight, since the party was originally going to be held at her place. Amber plots with her boyfriend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey meanwhile attempts to have therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who reveal that they know Amelia; in exchange for getting Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to go through the "red tape" involved to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.  Meanwhile, Kat learns Casper has no memory of his life and unlocks and restores his old playroom to remind him. Casper comes across an old wooden [[sled]], recalling that when he was a young boy, his father bought it for him. Casper was so happy that he played outside on a very cold day until he caught a severe cold and died of [[pneumonia]]. After his death, he became a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper’s father was declared legally [[Insanity|insane]] after he built a machine named the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture down into the manor’s basement, where they discover the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak in, steal the formula that powers the Lazarus, and plot to use the machine to their advantage, believing it could grant them immortality. However, the two attempt to kill each other in order to test the theory and retrieve the treasure which they think is in the basement's locked vault; as a result, Carrigan falls off a cliff to her death, and rises as a ghost.  Meanwhile, Dr. Harvey becomes dispassionate after the trio pull a prank on him, prompting them to take him out for a night on the town. Unknown to Harvey, they plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but end up having a change of heart after a drunken Harvey states that he is going to tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death down a manhole.  Back in the secret laboratory, Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, steals what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launches Dibs out of a window when he tries to double-cross her and have the treasure for his own future. Casper and Kat trick Carrigan into stating that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing her to be involuntarily ejected into the [[afterlife]]. The alleged treasure is revealed to be Casper’s prized baseball, signed by [[Duke Snider]]. When Dr. Harvey returns with Casper's uncles, now as a ghost, Kat is distraught. Her despair prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life once more, restoring her father instead.   The Halloween party kicks off upstairs. As Amber and Vic prepare their prank, they are thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and flee the manor in terror. A dejected Casper is visited by the spirit of Amelia, who has become an angel in heaven instead of a ghost. As a reward for his selfless sacrifice, she temporarily transforms him into a human boy, until ten o’clock. The now flesh-and-blood Casper dances with Kat, while Amelia speaks with Harvey, revealing that she was so content with her husband and daughter while alive, that she has no unfinished business, encouraging him to move on. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten and, after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, which scares off the party guests, leaving him and the Harveys to dance to the Ghostly Trio's music.

A Chinese Odyssey
  ===Part One=== 500 years ago, during their journey to the west to fetch the Buddhist scriptures, [[Sun Wukong|Monkey]] got annoyed with the constant nagging of his master, [[Tang Sanzang|Longevity Monk]], and decided to betray him. He was intercepted and subdued by [[Guanyin]], who decided to give him a second chance after Longevity Monk pleaded for leniency and sacrificed himself.  Monkey is reincarnated in the present as Joker, chief of a group of outlaws. Joker and his gang are attacked by two demons, [[List of Journey to the West characters#Spider Demons and Hundred Eyed Demon Lord|Spider Woman]] and [[Baigujing|Bak Jing-jing]], who threatened and force them to do their bidding. Joker's second-in-command (a reincarnation of [[Zhu Bajie|Pigsy]]) secretly overheard the demons' plan to capture Longevity Monk and feast on his flesh to gain immortality. Joker subsequently fell in love with Bak Jing-jing. [[Subhuti|Grandpa Buddha]] shows up in disguise as a bunch of grapes, informs Joker about the danger he is in, and gave him a magic mirror which can reveal a being's true form.  The group are attacked by Bull King, who is also after Longevity Monk. Joker and Pigsy flee with Bak Jing-jing and Spider Woman to Waterfall Cave, where the two demons starts fighting over Joker. Bak Jing-jing and Joker eventually flee from the cave while Spider Woman is impregnated with Pigsy's child by accident. As Bak Jing-jing had been poisoned by Spider Woman, Joker goes back to the cave to ask for the antidote, but is imprisoned by Spider Woman. In the meantime, outside the cave, Bak Jing-jing is captured by Bull King, who cures her of the poison.  Inside the cave, Joker finds Pandora's Box, which can open up a time portal when moonlight shines on it and when "[[Heart Sutra|Prajñāpāramitā]]" is chanted. He also overhears Guanyin's voice, telling him that he was actually Monkey in his past life and is destined to continue his quest to escort his master on the journey to the west. His true destiny will be revealed after he gets three marks on the sole of his foot. Meanwhile, Bull King and Bak Jing-jing enters the cave and fight with Spider Woman. Bak Jing-jing commits suicide after mistakenly believing that Joker has betrayed her love and fathered a child with Spider Woman.  Joker finds Bak Jing-jing and tries to save her by travelling back in time with the aid of Pandora's Box, but each time he arrives a few seconds too late to stop her from committing suicide. He finally manages to make it on time to prevent Bak Jing-jing from slitting her throat, but she sacrifices herself to save him from Bull King. Joker travels back in time again, but ends up going back in time by 500 years. Outside the cave, he encounters a fairy, Zixia, who confiscates Pandora's Box and sears three dots on the sole of his foot to mark him as her servant. This fulfils his true destiny as Monkey. He looks in the magic mirror given to him by Grandpa Buddha earlier and is shocked to see a reflection of himself as Monkey.  ===Part Two=== After travelling back in time, Joker learns more about his past life and reunites with his master, Longevity Monk, and his fellows, Pigsy and Sandy. However, he does not want to accept his fate as Monkey because he just wants to get back Pandora's Box and return to 500 years later to save Bak Jing-jing. Zixia falls in love with him after he pulls out her sword from its scabbard because she made a promise to marry the person who can unsheathe her sword.  Zixia and Longevity Monk are captured by Bull King, who wants to take Zixia as his concubine and feast on Longevity Monk's flesh to become immortal. Pigsy and Sandy try to rescue their master but he refuses to leave unless Joker promises to fulfil his destiny. Joker goes off in search of Zixia, rescues her, and they flee from Bull King. In the ensuing fight between Joker and his companions against Bull King, Joker falls off a cliff and finds himself back in Waterfall Cave, where he meets Grandpa Buddha and Bak Jing-jing. Bak Jing-jing agrees to marry Joker initially, but she leaves later and tells him to save Zixia because she knows he's actually in love with someone else. Shortly after, Spider Woman comes to Waterfall Cave and kills everyone, including Joker. At the point of death, Joker realises the one he truly loves is Zixia.  Joker, as a ghost, hears Guanyin's voice inside the cave again, reminding him about his destiny. He decides to accept his fate and puts on the golden circlet, therefore transforming into Monkey. He returns to the world and rushes to Bull King's city to save his master and stop Bull King's wedding ceremony with Zixia. As he is now Monkey, he must relinquish all his human desires, including love, so he tells Zixia he is not Joker and pretends to scorn her.  Monkey and Bull King engage in battle. When Bull King realises he is losing, he uses [[Princess Iron Fan]]'s magic fan to churn up strong winds that will blow the entire city towards the sun and kill everyone in the process. Monkey succeeds in stopping Bull King and saves everyone, but Zixia sacrifices herself to save him. As she dies, Monkey reveals his love for her and, as a result, his circlet tightens and causes him to feel extreme agony. In anger, he beats up Bull King before escaping together with his master, Pigsy and Sandy by using the Pandora's Box.  Monkey wakes up later and finds himself in a cave, but with his master and fellows this time. Outside the cave, in a busy city, Monkey sees the incarnations of Joker and Zixia in a standoff on top of a wall. He uses his powers to possess Joker's body and gave Zixia a long and passionate kiss before leaving Joker's body. Joker recovered and is surprised to see himself locked in an embrace with Zixia, but accepts and continues the romance with her. They notice Monkey walking away in the crowd below and laughed at his appearance. Monkey does not turn back until outside the gates where he gave a final glance at the embracing couple and continues on the journey to the west with his companions.  
Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest
 Eli and Joshua are being taken into foster care with William and Amanda Porter of Chicago after the death of their father, who was killed by Eli. The two boys do not mix well with a home in modern Chicago; their formal, Amish-like clothes from Gatlin and Eli's fire-and-brimstone prayer at dinner, as well as his bringing a suitcase full of corn to Chicago, strike their new parents and neighbors as unusual. On his first night in Chicago, after everyone else has gone to sleep, Eli quietly leaves the Porter's house for an empty factory on the other side of a nearby cornfield. Taking with him the suitcase of corn, Eli prays to "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" and plants corn seeds on the grounds of the factory, causing rows of corn to appear almost instantly.  The next day, at their first day in school, Eli nearly gets into a fight with T-Loc, a student in Joshua's grade, and harshly criticizes Joshua for playing basketball with some of the other students. Disgusted with the lifestyle being lived by modern children, Eli decides to bring He Who Walks Behind the Rows to Chicago, which soon kills a homeless man who finds the cornfield. Joshua starts spending less time with Eli and makes friends with neighbors Maria and Malcolm.  The social worker who brought Eli and Joshua to the Porters discovers that Eli was adopted originally from Gatlin, Nebraska (the town from the first film). Furthermore, Eli has not aged since 1964. She tries to warn the Porters, but she is quickly burned alive by Eli. Amanda begins to notice Eli's strange mannerisms and when she tries to cut down his cornfield it attacks her. She attempts to escape, but trips on a pole and her head is impaled on a broken pipe, killing her instantly. William finds the cornfield Eli has planted and realizes that with its seemingly perfect nature invulnerable to disease, able to grow out of season and in the worst of soil, it could be a highly marketable product. Despite the death of his wife, which was arranged by Eli, William finds backers and looks forward to the massive profits Eli's strain of corn will bring.  Eli neglects to inform his foster father of another property the corn possesses&nbsp;— it is able to turn children who eat it into followers of "He Who Walks Behind the Rows". Eli begins to decisively sway the students of his high school towards his beliefs, turning them against the principal and directing them to abandon such previously-typical activities as basketball. The principal, alarmed at Eli's converting the students, attempts to inform other staff, but they do not believe him, as Eli's efforts have had another effect: They have restored order at the school to a degree few thought possible.  By the time Joshua realizes the full truth, Eli has killed both of their foster parents, the school principal, Malcolm and Maria's parents, and now has full control of his fellow students. Confronting him, Joshua reveals that he has gone back to Gatlin and found the bible of "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" (which resulted in Malcolm's death), a book that Eli holds sacred and, together with his own body, can survive indefinitely if one is intact. Eli roars, "Give me the book!" and charges. Joshua throws the book down, and as Eli scrambles to pick it up Joshua stabs Eli and the book with a sickle, destroying both.  After Eli dies, "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" rises from the cornfield, revealed to be a grotesque monster with several tentacles. He Who Walks Behind The Rows kills several of Eli's followers (who have snapped out of Eli's control) in horrific ways, including T-Loc. After a brief struggle, Joshua uses the sickle to repeatedly stab at the monster's lower body, which resembles a large tree root sticking out of the ground. "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" collapses and dies.  As the film closes, the first shipment of Eli's corn arrives in Germany, the beginning of shipments all over the world.

 Cheryl "Cher" Horowitz is a well-intentioned but superficial girl, who is attractive, popular and extremely wealthy. A few months shy of her sixteenth birthday, she has risen to the top of the high school social scene. She lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a ferocious $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died from a freak accident during a routine liposuction procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher's best friend is Dionne Davenport, who is also rich, pretty, and hip, and understands what it's like to be envied. Though Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray, Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor on Dionne's part.  Among the few people to find fault with Cher is Josh, her socially conscious ex-stepbrother, who visits her during a break from college. Josh and Cher spar continually but without animosity; she mocks his scruffy idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain, and superficial, and says that her only direction in life is "toward the mall". Cher plays matchmaker for two lonely, nerdy, hard-grading teachers, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She achieves her superficial purpose, to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad report card; but when she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. Cher decides to give back to the community by "adopting" a "tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover and initiate her into the mysteries of popularity. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her toward Elton, a popular rich snob.  Her second matchmaking scheme backfires when Elton rejects Tai and attempts to seduce Cher. When a handsome new student named Christian arrives at their school, Cher takes a shine to him and attempts to secure him as her boyfriend. Eventually, Murray spells it out to her and Dionne that Christian is not interested in her because he is gay.  Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on good terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Cher's "project" works too well, and Tai's popularity surpasses her own. The situation reaches crisis stage after Cher fails her driver's test and can't "renegotiate" the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confides that she's taken a fancy to Josh and wants Cher to help her "get" him. Cher says she doesn't think Josh is right for Tai, and they quarrel, ending with Tai calling Cher a "virgin who can't drive". Feeling "totally clueless", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.  After much soul searching, Cher realizes she loves Josh. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort.  Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss.  Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love; and Cher wins a $200 bet for catching the bouquet at the wedding.

Wallace and Gromit discover a lost sheep has wandered into their house.

Wallace and the sheep rescue Gromit and hide out in the fields. Wendolene and Preston arrive in the lorry to round up the sheep. When Wendolene demands Preston stop the rustling, he locks her in the lorry with the sheep and drives away, intent on turning them into dog food.  Wallace and Gromit give chase on their motorcycle. When Gromit's [[sidecar]] detaches and rushes over a cliff, he activates its aeroplane mode and resumes the chase from the air. Wallace becomes trapped in the lorry and he, Wendolene and the sheep are transported to Preston's factory, where Preston has built an enormous Knit-o-Matic. The captives are loaded into the wash basin, with Shaun escaping, and Preston pulls out the nozzle to suck them into the shearing machine.  Shaun activates neon signs to reveal the factory's location to Gromit, who flies in and attacks Preston. Shaun sucks Preston into the Knit-o-Matic, removing his fur and exposing his robotic endoskeleton. Wendolene reveals that Preston is actually a robot, created by her father to serve the family, which "turned out evil".

The City of Lost Children
 Krank ([[Daniel Emilfork]]), a highly intelligent but evil being created by a vanished scientist, is unable to dream, which causes him to age prematurely. At his lair on an abandoned oil-rig (which he shares with the scientist's other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin), he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, who in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denree (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One ([[Ron Perlman]]).  After the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of [[Siamese twins]] called "the Octopus") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denree's kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette, follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello ([[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]]) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which secrete a poison that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other, before rescuing One. However he leaves Miette behind, who almost drowns before an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor retrieves her.  Miette leaves the diver's lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello's stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette's tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denree.  Back at Krank's oil-rig, Irvin gets one of the clones to release a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of how they were created. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil-rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha pushed him off to take it for themselves. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denree.  Miette is almost killed by Martha, but the diver harpoons her. She then finds Denree asleep in Krank's dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must enter the machine herself. In the dream world she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace Denree as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank's mind. One and Miette rescue all the children while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. He regains his senses as everyone is rowing away, and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the [[blasting machine]], blowing up him and the rig.  
Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable
 In the film, ''[[Timon and Pumbaa]]'' (''[[The Lion King|Lion King]]'') were chopping down trees and clogging up rivers to build the [[Hakuna Matata]] Lakeside Village. [[Simba]] comes to them and explains how their actions are harmful to [[nature]]. This lesson was explained with live-action footage, some left over from ''Symbiosis'' (with clips of people such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Native Hawaiians]] and [[Masai people|Masai]], clips of [[New York City]] and other locations such as the [[Amazon Rainforest]], [[Serengeti]], [[Andes]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Geno's Steaks]] in [[Philadelphia]], and images of animals such as [[monkeys]], [[bald eagles]], [[snakes]], [[elephants]] and [[wildebeest]]).   The film opens with [[List of The Lion King characters|Mufasa]]'s voice explaining that everyone is connected in the great circle of life. A montage of animals and a few clips from ''Symbiosis'' open to the song, [[Circle of Life]].   The focus of the main story is on [[Simba]]. He decided to show Timon and Pumbaa how another creature (man) is similarly forgetting how everyone is connected. He explained to them that, at first, they were small in numbers, so they only took what they needed to survive, which at that time wasn't much. However, as the human population grew, necessities for living space, power, and food increased.  Timon and Pumbaa are initially excited by man's developments, but Simba shows them the price that comes with the human necessities. He explains that humans have caused harm to the environment with their excessive consumption through activity such as deforestation, endangerment of species and pollution. He says that once humans realized what they were destroying, they began to repair the damage through recycling, alternative energy and conservation programs. He explains that humans helped other creatures in nature by studying them to learn their needs.  Timon and Pumbaa decide to help the humans give back to nature, but Simba shows them that they already can at home. Timon and Pumbaa unclog the rivers, thus giving the water back to the other creatures on the Savannah. The film ended with Simba's mighty roar and a shorter montage set to the end of the title song.  
Circle of Friends (1995 film)
 Set in 1950s Ireland, the film focuses on the experiences of Bernadette "Benny" Hogan and her two friends: Eve Malone and Nan Mahon. They are characterised early on in childhood, during their [[First Communion]]: Benny is the beloved and well-fed only child, Eve the orphan raised by nuns and Nan is destined to be defined by her beauty. The three girls grow up in the small town of Knockglen. Skip to eight years later: Nan has moved on to Dublin years earlier, and Benny and Eve have graduated from the local convent school and are heading to Dublin to attend university.  Eve's education is financed by the local wealthy Westward [[Protestant]] family. The family has also willed to her a cottage on their property. Eve boards at a [[convent]] in Dublin, while Benny must commute daily between home and [[Dublin]], her parents being loath to let her go. They would prefer she marry the loathsome and creepy Sean Walsh, her father's faithful employee at his tailor shop.  Once in Dublin the two girls reconnect with a mature and sophisticated Nan who is quite aware of her bewitching effect on the opposite sex. Benny eventually falls in love with Jack Foley, a handsome [[rugby football|rugby]] player and doctor's son, studying medicine and expected to follow in his father's footsteps, though he is not quite convinced that this is the career for him. After the College Ball, Benny and Jack begin a relationship, Eve starts to date Aidan, a friend of Jack's, and Nan becomes involved with the much older Simon Westward, who the group ran into as they entered the dance and whom Nan "accidentally" arranged to run into at a lunch. While Benny is able to resist a physical relationship with Jack, Nan is not and believes that Simon truly loves her.  When Benny's father dies suddenly, she is forced to suspend her university studies to take care of her mother who is devastated by her husband's passing, and to run the family shop. Sean Walsh attempts to woo her into marriage. Benny notices the accounts of the prosperous Hogan business are missing significant funds, creating a mystery over [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry bookkeeping]]. She suspects Sean has something to do with it but has no proof.  Eve's cottage, in an isolated sector of the Westward estate, serves as a party location for the three young women and their friends. Nan and Simon visit it secretly for their trysts. Sean, who has been spying on the cottage since the first party to watch Benny, witnesses Nan and Simon's sexual relationship, having hinted at it to Eve during Benny's father's funeral. Nan becomes pregnant and reveals the news to Simon, sure he will marry her. Instead, Simon ends their relationship, stating he must marry for money, not love, to maintain the family fortune. He attempts to pay her off with a large cheque to get an abortion in England.  A desperate Nan goes out to find Eve's boyfriend Aidan, but runs into a depressed and drunk Jack, who has not seen Benny since her father's funeral. She convinces him to take her as his date to a rugby team party and lures him into having sex with her. She later pretends that he is the one who got her pregnant. Jack does what he believes is the honourable thing and asks Nan to marry him. He tells Benny about the baby and the engagement and she is devastated. Eve grows suspicious of someone using the cottage after finding a half-burned newspaper in the fireplace. The nuns from her old convent told her they had seen lights on at the cottage and smoke coming from the chimney. Nan suggests that perhaps the cottage is haunted to cover up her and Simon's secret meetings there.  Eve throws another party which a still devastated Benny attends alone. Nan, oblivious to the pain she's caused by her deception, convinces Jack they should attend the party, though he feels uneasy about going to Eve's. As he speaks to a sad Benny, Nan seeks out Eve, bringing her flowers and a present of a vase, acting as if nothing has changed and she and Eve are still the best of friends. An enraged Eve, having figured out the truth of what Nan has done and that Simon, not Jack, is the father of Nan's baby, confronts her, threatening to tell Jack the truth and screaming at Nan that she had broken Benny's heart. Eve, enraged at Nan for not realising how much damage and hurt she has caused her friends, comes towards her waving a knife she was using to cut bread. As Nan backs away, she falls into a glass door which shatters, cutting her in the arm and severing an artery causing her to bleed profusely. Jack comes to Nan's aid, tending to the bleeding that Eve has been trying to stop. Benny, seeing Eve and Jack attending to Nan, leaves the party.  Jack tries to contact Benny but she refuses to answer the phone. Though he has learned the truth of Nan's deception, Jack escorts Nan to the train station despite her protests that it has nothing to do with him now. She asks that he and Benny forgive her for her desperate actions. Nan heads to England to have her baby (or to have an illegal abortion).  Curiosity over the missing money from the family store finally gets the best of Benny, and she snoops around Sean's living area above the tailor shop. She finds several pornographic pictures of larger women during her search. Sean finds Benny in his room and attempts to sexually assault her. She fights him off, and in the process finds the money that he has embezzled from her family for the duration of his employment. She demands that he leave or she will call the Garda (police). He tells her that he would have married her but now he wouldn't touch her. As he leaves, she throws his clothes at him, hitting him in the face with his coat.  After Jack sees Nan off, he goes to visit Benny to try to win her back. He explains to Benny that helping stop Nan's bleeding made his hesitations over becoming a doctor disappear and he knows it is what he wants to do for the rest of his life. Jack also tells Benny that he loves her and if she'll have him back, he wants to marry her and that she is the one. He never loved Nan. Benny, unwilling to let him off so easily, tells him his actions have changed both her and their relationship, and it will take quite a bit of time for him to gain her trust again. She tells him they will have to get to know each other as they are now and they will just have to see where it takes them.  Benny's voiceover states that Jack threw himself into his medical studies, as well as his pursuit of Benny. He demonstrates his patience and humility, devoting himself to his studies as well as Benny. Benny states that she moved to Dublin at the start of the new school year to share a flat with Eve. A paper Benny writes causes a stir at the university and sets her on course to her future career as a writer. With time, Benny falls in love with Jack again. The final scene shows Benny taking Jack to Eve's cottage. As he follows her inside, Benny says "Bless me father, I have sinned" implying the pair have finally consummated their relationship.

Karen Ross ([[Laura Linney]]), assisting at TraviCom's headquarters, does not hear back from their team and activates a remote camera at the camp, discovering the camp destroyed and numerous corpses; something large suddenly knocks over and destroys the camera. Karen alerts TraviCom's CEO and Charles' father, R.B. Travis ([[Joe Don Baker]]), who informs her that the group was really there looking for a rare blue diamond only found there which would greatly enhance their capabilities, but does not offer any hope to rescue them. Travis implores Karen to lead an expedition and she makes Travis swear that he is sending her to look for Charles, not the diamond. She warns him if he is lying, she will make him sorry. "And that's a promise!".  Meanwhile, Peter Elliott ([[Dylan Walsh]]), a [[primatologist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his assistant Richard ([[Grant Heslov]]) teach [[human communication]] to [[primate]]s using a [[gorilla]] named Amy (voiced by [[Shayna Fox]]). With a special backpack and glove, her [[sign language]] is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned that Amy is having nightmares and psychological problems, due to several drawings Amy has made of jungles and the [[Eye of Providence]]. Peter attempts to gain funding to take Amy to Africa, but the university is reluctant, and Peter begins inquiring elsewhere. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka ([[Tim Curry]]) offers to fund the expedition; Karen, having learned of the trip, offers to fund it as well and to come along, hoping to discover the fate of her team.   In Africa, the group meets their expert guide Captain Munro Kelly ([[Ernie Hudson]]) but they are captured by the local authorities and militia leader named Captain Wanta ([[Delroy Lindo]]), who grants them passage for a sizable bribe. Amy detests Karen Ross and repeatedly insults her as she is threatened by another female near Peter. As the group boards another plane, Munro reveals that Homolka has led previous [[safari]]s in search of the "Lost City of Zinj", with disastrous results. The group must parachute into the jungle after their plane is shot down by Zairean soldiers.  On the ground, they encounter a native Ghost Tribe. The tribe leads them to Bob Driscoll ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]), a member of Charles' expedition, who they have been attempting to revive from his [[catatonic]] state. On seeing Amy, Bob begins screaming and soon dies. They continue by boat, and learn that Homolka is interested in finding Zinj and its fabled diamond mine ([[King Solomon's Mines]]); Homolka believes that Amy's drawings suggest she has seen the mine and hopes she will lead them there. After an attack by hippos, they find the ruined camp and Zinj nearby. While searching the city, Richard is attacked and killed by a killer grey gorilla, which the rest of the team take down. They take shelter at the ruined camp, other grey gorillas kept at bay by automated sentry guns set up by Karen.  When day breaks, they return to the city, discovering [[hieroglyph]]s that say that the people had taught the grey gorillas, a unique species due to the volcanic environment, to guard the mine and kill anyone that approached it. The group suspects that the gorillas turned on their masters but still protect the mine now. They find the diamond mine and Homolka starts to collect large diamonds, but a pack of gorillas appear and kill him. Munro, Karen, and Peter fight off the gorillas and flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Charles' body, holding a giant blue diamond. As Amy helps to fend off the gorillas, Karen is able to fit the diamond into a portable laser, using it to fire and ward off the gorillas. The volcano begins to erupt, and Munro, Karen, Peter and Amy escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing the gorillas.  Karen contacts Travis to report on finding the diamond and confirming Charles' death. When she sees Travis was only interested in the obtainment of the diamond all along and does not care about Charles, she uses her laser to destroy the TraviCom satellite. In the nearby wreckage of a cargo plane, they find a usable hot-air balloon, and prepare to leave. Peter sees Amy watch a pack of mountain gorillas nearby, and lets her go, telling her goodbye. The three take off in the balloon, and Karen has Peter throw away the diamond as they leave.

Vigilance  ([[Rajan P. Dev]]) and Menon, A.I.G.  ([[N. F. Varghese]]), who are involved in criminal activities like instigating communal riots and large scale distribution of counterfeit currency.  Bharathchandran and Mohan Thomas are set on a collision course when Mohan and Co. brutally murder justice Mahendran ([[Karamana Janardanan Nair]]), chairperson of the Poovanthura commission, possessing evidence that could potentially incriminate Rajan Felix and Menon, for their direct involvement in communal riots at Poovanthura. Bharatchandran is not only assigned to investigate the homicide but also made police commissioner of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city. Assisted by ASP Prasad Menon ([[K. B. Ganesh Kumar]]) and ASP Mohammed Ikbal ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]), two dynamic but brash officers, Bharath tries to solve the mystery,  but soon to hit a dead-end. Until Bharath's fiancée Indu, who is also a lawyer, tips him off about the news clip on an assault on a drunk police constable Gopinathan ([[Maniyanpilla Raju]], who also was coincidentally the security for Justice Mahendran. In an attempt to take Sunny in, while he was in college results in a massive riot as well as a standoff with Rajan Felix, who tries to save Sunny by trying to take him into his custody claiming previous charges.    The only clue that is left with Bharath and crew are based on Vattapara Pithamparan's ([[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]]), a trade union leader, tipoff, that Sunny had actually attacked Gopinath because of Gopi's comment on counterfeit currency. With this vital clue Bharat unearths more dirt on Mohan Thomas & Co. Further Bharath arrests Srilatha Varma (Chithra), Mohan's legal advisor and mistress, but is brutally murdered in a hotel elevator by Wilfred Vincent Baston ([[Bheeman Raghu]]), a Goan hitman, who had also murdered Justice Mahindra. Bharath is successful in nabbing Antony Ignatius Pemento, Wilfred's right-hand man and zeroes in on Wlfred. Then he stages a coup by arresting both Rajan Felix and Menon, who are brutally tortured to reveal details on their alliance with Mohan Thomas and also sheds light on their agenda. Ikbal is killed brutally in an attempt to arrest Wilfred Vincent Baston. This enrages Bharath Chandran, who later brutally kills Wilfred and then Mohan Thomas at an outhouse by torching the whole house, thus taking law into his own hands

Accepting her fate, she turns to face Foley. However, just as he is about to kill her, M.J. shoots him in the [[Brachial plexus|brachial nerve]], giving him one last chance to surrender. When he pulls his gun back on her, however, she shoots him dead.  Some time later, Daryll Lee writes a letter to another serial killer, instructing him on how to kill Helen, and revealing that he had been aiding Foley all along.

Crimson Tide (film)
 In post-Soviet [[Russia]], civil war erupts as a result of the ongoing conflict in [[Chechnya]]. Military units loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, a Russian ultra-nationalist, take control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him.  A [[United States Navy|US Navy]] nuclear submarine, , is assigned to a patrol mission to be available to launch its missiles in a pre-emptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer, one of few commanders left in the US Navy with combat experience. He chooses as his new [[executive officer|XO]] Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience.  During their initial days at sea tension between Ramsey and Hunter becomes apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. ''Alabama'' eventually receives an [[Emergency Action Message]], ordering the launch of ten of its missiles against the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fuelled. Before ''Alabama'' can launch its missiles, a second radio message begins to be received, but is cut off by the attack of a Russian  loyal to Radchenko.  The radio electronics are damaged in the attack and cannot be used to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch Captain Ramsey decides to proceed. Hunter refuses to concur as is required because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that ''Alabama'' is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order is not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles as part of the fleet's standard redundancy doctrine. Ramsey argues that the other American submarines may have been destroyed.  When Hunter refuses to consent Ramsey tries to relieve him of duty and replace him with a different officer. Instead Hunter orders the arrest of Ramsey for attempting to circumvent [[Two-man rule|protocol]]. The crew's loyalty is divided between Hunter and Ramsey, but the [[Chief of the Boat]] sides with Hunter ("by the book") in having Ramsey relieved of command and confined to his stateroom, putting Hunter in command. ''Alabama'' is attacked again by the Russian submarine. ''Alabama'' destroys it but during the chaos a counter-mutiny ensues and Ramsey retakes the bridge, confining Hunter, the Chief of the Boat and a few others to the officers' mess.  Hunter escapes his arrest and gains the support of the weapons officer in the missile control room further delaying the launch. Other crew members try to repair the radio while the battle for command continues. Eventually Ramsey traps Hunter on the bridge thus quelling all mutinous actions, but with the radio team reporting they are near success, the two men agree to a compromise; they will wait until the deadline for missile launch to see if the radio can be repaired.  After several tense minutes communications are restored and they finally see the full message from the second transmission. It is a retraction ordering that the missile launch be aborted because Radchenko's rebellion has been quelled. After returning to base Ramsey and Hunter are put before a naval tribunal to answer for their actions. The tribunal concludes that both men were simultaneously right and wrong so Hunter's actions were lawfully justified.  Unofficially the tribunal chastises both men for failing to resolve the issues between them. Thanks to Ramsey's personal recommendation the tribunal agrees to grant Hunter command of his own sub while allowing Ramsey to save face via an early retirement. Both men then reconcile their differences and part ways.

His father, who treated Erik considerably better than his mother, lives in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Dexter ([[Joseph Mazzello]]), an 11-year-old boy who contracted HIV through a [[blood transfusion]], is Erik's neighbor. Initially, Dexter is put off by Erik, but they become both good friends despite their differences. Erik seeks a family in Dexter and his congenial mother, Linda ([[Annabella Sciorra]]), due to his bad relationship with Gail, but Erik keeps the friendship a secret from her, knowing that Gail won't approve due to her own prejudice in regards to AIDS.  Gail discovers the friendship one night after Linda comes over to ask Erik about something Dexter ate in the boys' quest to find a natural cure for his disease. She is furious and warns Linda to keep Dexter away, but Linda, who resents her, ignores her and encourages the friendship. When the boys read an article in a tabloid about a doctor in distant [[New Orleans]] who claims to have found a [[cure]] for AIDS, they set out on their own down the [[Mississippi River]] in the hope of finding a means of saving Dexter's life.  Initially, the boys start taking a boat down the river with a bunch of degenerates, but eventually steal their money (as they were never treated well by the group) and try to hitchhike the rest of the way. When the boatmen find that their money has been stolen, they locate the kids at a bus station and proceed to chase them until they reach a dead end in a dilapidated building. Erik draws a switchblade, causing one of the men to draw a knife as well. Dexter suddenly grabs the knife from Erik, and cuts his hand to cause himself to bleed. He threatens the boatman with his blood, saying that he has AIDS and could easily transfer the disease to him (the boatman has open wounds on his arm as a result of an injury received when chasing the boys). Dexter then chases the boatmen off, threatening them with his bleeding hand. Once the two men are gone, Dexter realizes what he has done in directly exposing his blood to the outside environment. He suddenly feels sick, so Erik helps to escort him back to the bus station. Realizing that their journey must end if Dexter is to be treated, Erik resorts to calling Linda to have her pick the boys up when they arrive on the bus in Stillwater.  Once they return, Dexter spends the rest of his time in the hospital. Erik stays with Linda, knowing that not only will Gail be angry, but she will not let him visit Dexter in the hospital. Dexter and Erik prank the doctors three times that Dexter's dead. But when the third doctor arrives to check him, Dexter really has died. While driving Erik home, Linda notices a mother holding her young child while crossing the street. With the child serving as a reminder of Dexter, she pulls over and breaks down crying. Erik apologizes to her, saying that he should have tried harder to find a cure. Linda, taken aback by his comment, embraces Erik, explaining that he was the happiest thing in Dexter's difficult life. Upon arrival at home, they are confronted by a furious Gail. When Gail starts to hit Erik, Linda quickly intervenes and asks to talk to her privately.  Once the two are inside Linda's home, Linda angrily and tearfully informs Gail that 1. Erik best friend has died and he is going to the funeral. And 2. That’s if she ever lays another hand on him she will report her to [[child protective services]].  At the funeral, Erik places one of his shoes in the coffin and takes one of Dexter's to let sail down the river (as earlier in the trip when Dexter's having nightmares, Erik told Dexter to hold one of his sneakers as a reminder that he's always by his side). This way, the shoes represent the boys' souls and their will to live.

[[Interpol]] detective Netah explains that the Sons of the Dragons are descendants of 108 Buddhist monks who rebelled against the [[Manchu]] reign in China centuries ago, and that the "Freeman" is their bringer of death. Shimazaki then tells everyone that Emu is the Freeman's next target, as she was the only witness to his son's assassination, and the assassin's code is that a person who is given Freeman's name becomes his next kill. However, shortly after their meeting is adjourned, Shimazaki and his bodyguards are ambushed outside the precinct by a masked Freeman and his assistant Koh. After dispatching the bodyguards and disabling the nearby police officers, Freeman successfully kills Shimazaki before running off. During his escape, he passes by Emu, who recognizes his eyes through his mask.

Yo kills the thugs and wounds Ryuji, but Emu is shot in the process. Against his own code, Yo brings Emu to the nearest hospital.  Days later, Emu travels to Japan and reunites with Yo, who tells her about his origin. Years ago, he was Yo Hinomura, a renowned pottery sculptor who stumbled upon a roll of negatives during his exhibit in [[New York City]]. Yo developed the photos in his hotel bathroom, revealing the torture and execution of a man wearing dragon tattoos similar to what he would eventually wear. Before leaving his hotel, he was drugged and abducted by the Sons of the Dragons, who implanted subliminal messages into his mind using [[acupuncture]] techniques. During his first mission, where he killed [[Italian Mafia|Mafia]] boss Antonio Rossi, he began to shed tears; hence his name Crying Freeman.  Yo is notified by Koh that Ryuji's gang have attacked a soya factory in [[Shanghai]] that was protected by the Sons of the Dragons. As retribution, Yo and Koh travel to Shimazaki's funeral outside Tokyo to kill Ryuji and wipe out the clan. During the funeral, while having sex inside a closet, Kimie reveals to Netah that the Shimazakis were set up by the Hanadas to be assassinated so they could take over the clan. Yo and Koh wipe out the clan, but as Koh prepares to kill Yo for treason, Ryuji guns him down before the entire complex blows up and kills him.  Yo returns to his home, where he prepares the area to self-destruct and arms himself to battle Netah and Kimie, along with her henchmen. Despite being wounded by Netah, Yo kills the henchmen and defeats Netah and Kimie - the latter by stabbing her near the heart. Kimie gives Yo her word of honor that in exchange for saving her life, he and Emu won't be pursued. While Yo and Emu leave the premises, Netah prepares to shoot them from behind, only to be killed by Kimie. Yo and Emu are last seen riding a speedboat into the sunset.

Harry refuses to give Dawg his piece and escapes with Morgan's help, but not before being mortally wounded. A dying Harry reveals to his daughter the location of the map piece: on his scalp.  After [[scalping]] her dead father for the piece, Morgan, now the captain of her father's ship, the ''Morning Star'', sets out for the treasure. Unfortunately, the instructions appear to be in Latin, which no one on board reads. So, they go to nearby Port Royal to find a translator. There, they learn that one of the slaves up for auction, a con man and thief named William Shaw, is fluent in Latin. After threatening a man determined to outbid her, Morgan wins the auction. Unfortunately, she is recognized from her wanted poster and is chased out of town, along with her crew and Shaw. Humiliated, corrupt Governor Ainslee vows to find her, either to arrest her or form a partnership for half her profits. He enlists the help of chronicler John Reed, who often follows pirates to write his books.  The crew then goes to Mordechai in Spittlefield Harbor. Before they can learn where the second piece is, Dawg appears. A fight ensues, during which Mordechai is killed and Morgan is shot, while Shaw secretly finds the piece and keeps it to himself. After they escape on the ''Morning Star'', Morgan collapses from her wound, but is saved by Shaw, who is a self-proclaimed doctor. The two start a romance. Morgan figures out that the words on the map, when read backwards, spell out half the coordinates to the island.  Dawg's ship, the ''Reaper'', bears down on them. Morgan directs hers toward a coral reef and a gale. Shaw manages to piece together the location of Cutthroat Island with his and Morgan's piece, but is caught and thrown in the brig. During the storm, Reed sends a carrier pigeon revealing their location to Ainslee. Meanwhile, the majority of the crew led by the treacherous Scully mutinies and maroon Morgan and those loyal to her in a boat.

Dead Man
 William Blake ([[Johnny Depp]]), an [[accountant]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], rides by train to the frontier [[company town]] of Machine to assume a promised job as an [[accountant]] in the town's metal works. During the trip, the train Fireman ([[Crispin Glover]]) warns Blake against the enterprise while passengers shoot [[American Bison|buffalo]] from the train windows. Arriving in town, Blake discovers that the position has already been filled, and he is driven from the workplace at gunpoint by John Dickinson, the ferocious owner of the company. Jobless and without money or prospects, Blake meets Thel Russell ([[Mili Avital]]), a former prostitute who sells paper flowers. He lets her take him home. Thel's ex-boyfriend Charlie surprises them in bed and shoots at Blake, accidentally killing Thel when she tries to shield Blake with her body. A wounded Blake shoots and kills Charlie with Thel's gun before climbing dazedly out the window and fleeing Machine on Charlie's horse. Company-owner Dickinson just happens to be Charlie's father, and he hires three legendary frontier killers, Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny "The Kid" Pickett to bring Blake back 'dead or alive'.  Blake awakens to find a large [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] man ([[Gary Farmer]]) attempting to dislodge the bullet from his chest. The Man, calling himself Nobody, reveals that the bullet is too close to Blake's heart to remove, and Blake is effectively walking dead. When he learns Blake's full name, Nobody decides Blake is a reincarnation<ref>In an interview Jarmusch states "For Nobody, the journey is a continuing ceremony whose purpose is to deliver Blake back to the spirit-level of the world. To him, Blake's spirit has been misplaced and somehow returned to the physical realm." [http://www.nytrash.com/deadman/deadjj.html]</ref> of [[William Blake]], a poet whom he idolizes but of whom accountant Blake himself is ignorant. Nobody resolves to escort Blake to the Pacific Ocean to return him to his proper place in the spirit-world.  Blake and Nobody travel west, leaving a trail of dead and encountering [[wanted posters]] announcing higher and higher bounties for Blake's death or capture. Blake learns of Nobody's past, marked both by Native American and white racism; it is detailed that he is the product of lovers from two opposing tribes, and how as a child he was abducted by English soldiers and brought to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated and learned of the proper William Blake's art and poetry before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. He gained his name, Nobody, at this point, the literal translation of which is revealed to be "He who talks loud, saying nothing".  Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a [[vision quest]]. On his quest, Blake kills two [[U.S. Marshal]]s, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn that was killed accidentally by his pursuers. He paints his face with the fawn's blood and rejoins Nobody on their journey. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades (eating one of them) and continued his hunt alone.  At a trading post, a bigoted [[missionary]] identifies Blake and attempts to kill him but is killed by Blake, instead. Shortly after, Blake is shot again; and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody takes him by river to a [[Makah people|Makah]] village and convinces the tribe to give him a canoe for Blake's [[ship burial]].  Delirious, Blake trudges through the village before collapsing from his injuries. He awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake watches Cole sneak up behind Nobody; but he is too weak to cry out and can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other. As he looks up at the sky one last time, Blake dies and his canoe drifts out into the sea.  
Dead Presidents
 In the spring of 1969, Anthony Curtis ([[Larenz Tate]]) is about to [[Alumnus|graduate]] from [[high school]], and decides to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] rather than go to [[college]]. He is sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], leaving behind his [[middle-class]] family, his [[pregnant]] girlfriend Juanita ([[Rose Jackson (actress)|Rose Jackson]]), and small-time crook Kirby ([[Keith David]]), who is like a second father. Anthony's close friend, Skip ([[Chris Tucker]]), later joins Curtis' squad after flunking out of college, and his other friend, Jose ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]), is drafted into the Army. Once in the Marines, Curtis and his squad lose several fellow marines during combat, and commit several atrocities of their own, such as [[summary execution|executing]] enemy prisoners and beheading corpses for war trophies.  When Anthony returns to [[the Bronx]] in 1973, after four years of service, he finds returning to "normal" life is impossible. He finds Skip now an [[Agent Orange]] victim and [[heroin]] addict, Jose is a [[pyromaniac]], and Cleon ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]), a religious yet deadly staff sergeant that was in his squad, is now a devoted [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. After being laid off from his job at a [[butcher shop]], Anthony finds himself unable to support Juanita (who had an affair while he was on duty) or his daughter. After an argument with Juanita, Anthony meets his girlfriend's sister, Delilah ([[N'Bushe Wright]]), who is now a member of the "[[Nat Turner]] Cadre", a revolutionary militant group. Anthony, Kirby, Skip, Jose, Delilah, and Cleon devise a plan to rob an [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] making a stop at the Noble Street [[Federal Reserve Bank]] of the Bronx.  The next day, the group strategically position themselves around the street, armed with weapons and disguised with face paint, ready to ambush the truck. The plan goes awry when Cleon is approached by a beat officer who interferes in the robbery, leading to Kirby getting shot in the arm and Skip killing the officer when Cleon freezes up (a role reversal to what happens to Skip and Cleon earlier). At the same time, Anthony and Jose are spotted by the driver, causing a large shootout with the security guards. Jose (a demolition expert in the army) plants an explosive device on the escaping truck to blow off the door, but instead, destroys the whole vehicle. Delilah saves Anthony's life by killing one of the guards. A second guard appears and gets into a shootout with Delilah, shooting her multiple times and killing her, devastating Anthony. As the group collects what cash they can from the burning wreckage, they flee and split up to escape the police; Jose gets cornered in an alley by an approaching police car. When Jose shoots the driver, he is hit by the car and killed as the police car crashes into a wall, crushing Jose.  Not long after the heist, Kirby hears that Cleon has been giving out $100 bills and has bought himself a new Cadillac that he can barely afford. Anthony drives over to Cleon's church to speak to him, only to find him being led out the front door in handcuffs by two detectives; Cleon gives up the other robbers as part of a plea bargain. [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] officers storm Skip's apartment only to find that he has died of a heroin overdose. As Kirby and Anthony prepare to flee to Mexico, police raid the bar. Kirby tries to distract the officers to allow Anthony to flee to no avail, as multiple officers corner Anthony and arrest him. Anthony is convicted and found guilty of the robbery and the deaths of the security guards and the officer that Skip killed. He is sentenced to 15 years to life in prison by the judge, himself a [[World War II]] veteran. Anthony, furious at his sentence in spite of his years of service for his country, throws a chair at the judge before being escorted away. The films ends with Anthony looking out the window of his prison bus and reflecting on what could've been.  
Dangerous Minds
 LouAnne Johnson ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), a discharged [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]], applies for a teaching job in high school, and is surprised and pleased to be offered the position with immediate effect. Showing up the next day to begin teaching, however, she finds herself confronted with a classroom of tough, sullen teenagers, all from lower-class and underprivileged backgrounds, involved in gang warfare and drug pushing, flatly refusing to engage with anything. They immediately coin the nickname "White Bread" for LouAnne, due to her race and apparent lack of authority, to which LouAnne responds by returning the next day in a leather jacket and teaching them [[karate]]. The students show some interest in such activities, but immediately revert to their former behavior when LouAnne tries to teach the curriculum.  Desperate to reach the students LouAnne devises classroom exercises that teach similar principles to the prescribed work, but using themes and language that appeal to the streetwise students. She also tries to motivate them by giving them all an A grade from the beginning of the year, and arguing that the only thing required of them is that they maintain it. In order to introduce them to [[poetry]], LouAnne uses the lyrics of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" to teach symbolism and metaphor; once this is achieved, she progresses on to [[Dylan Thomas]]'s "[[Do not go gentle into that good night]]". LouAnne rewards the students liberally, using candy bars, reward incentives, and a trip to a [[theme park]]. Her methods attract the anger of the school authorities, George Grandey ([[Courtney B. Vance]]) and Carla Nichols ([[Robin Bartlett]]), who try to force her to remain within the curriculum.  Particular individual students attract LouAnne's attention for their personal problems. Raul Sanchero ([[Renoly Santiago]]) is a well-meaning boy who is frequently involved in gang warfare and street crime. LouAnne tries to encourage him to focus by paying a special visit to his family to congratulate him on his work, and going to dinner with him as a way of instilling confidence and self-respect. Emilio Ramirez ([[Wade Dominguez]]) is her most troublesome personal project, as he believes strongly in a sense of personal honor that prevents him from asking for help. When LouAnne discovers that his life is in danger because of a personal grudge held by a recently released thug, she tries to protect him. She advises him to seek help from Principal Grandey. The next day, Emilio visits Grandey, but Grandey (not realizing that Emilio is in serious danger) instantly dismisses him because he neglected to knock on Grandey's door before entering his office. Feeling rejected, Emilio leaves the school and is subsequently killed by his enemy. Heartbroken by her failure to protect Emilio and angry at the indifferent school system for contributing to his death, LouAnne announces to the class her intention to leave the school at the end of the academic year. The students immediately break down, begging her not to leave. Overwhelmed by their unbridled display of emotion, she decides to stay.

Deadly Sins (film)
 Eleven girls have disappeared from an [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]] Catholic school in the last five years. When one of them, an orphaned outsider named Gwendolyn (Telek), is found dead, hanged from the church bells, Seattleite deputy sheriff Jack Gates (Keith) is assigned to the task to the mystery. When he arrives, he is upset to find out that the unexperienced Doc (Mulligan) has already claimed to have examined the body and that the body has already been removed. Mother Superior (Perry) assigns her secretary and the school's history teacher, nun Cristina Herrera (Milano), to help Jack with the case. Jack is especially interested in a stolen cross that was also reported along with the death. Through one of the students, Beth (Clark) - a popular student who bullies Polly (Collins) - Jack learns that the school keeps the spirit of Mother Bernadette, the former mother superior, alive. Mother Bernadette has her own - locked from the outside - sanctuary and the students are taught that she is always with them.  That night, Beth sneaks out to have sex with delivery boy Eric (Bacic). Meanwhile, student Suzy Carroll (Copping) is being chased and murdered by an unknown person. The following morning, Jack learns from Doc that Gwen did not commit suicide, but was murdered: there was a cross sign carved in her stomach after her death. Doc thinks that Gwen was being punished for being four months pregnant at the time of her death. Jack is next informed that Suzy has disappeared, and that this has happened before at the school. He gets mad at Mother Superior for not having informed him earlier, but she explains that she did not bother, because all the girls were of age, and were probably eloping. Meanwhile, in class, Beth accuses her teacher Gray (Hanlon) of having impregnated Gwen; Headmaster Gray responds by revealing that he knows about her affair with Eric.  The following night, Marie (Lenhart) is chased by an unknown person near the graveyard. She is saved by Jack, and claims that a woman has touched her. She tries to kiss him, but Jack holds his distance, as does he with Rita (Bates), a waitress of a nearby bar whom he befriended. The next day, Cristina shares her doubt in the integrity of some of the staff with Jack: she finds it strange that Father Anthony graduated top of his class at Harvard and is now teaching at the small Catholic school; Mother Superior supposedly killed her husband in the past; and Emily (Warn-Pegg) - the school's cook - gave birth to a stillborn child. She is unable to find out, however, why Headmaster Gray left his previous school eight years earlier. Jack has recently found out that Headmaster Gray, previously known as Marc Anthony, was arrested in [[Webster, Illinois]] for having sex with one of his students; the charges were later dropped.  Meanwhile, the girls fear that they might be the next to disappear. Nevertheless, Beth sneaks out to meet with Eric, but he is stabbed to death by a person dressed in white. Beth is chased as well, but escapes; she later claims to have witnessed the presence of Mother Bernadette. Jack then confronts Gray with his record, and then finds sex tapes of the missing girls and Beth among Gray's stuff. He concludes that Gray is the killer, but Gray kills himself before an arrest can be made. Jack celebrates having solved the case with Cristina, who reveals herself not as a nun, but as a private investigator hired by the church. They end up having sex that night.  The next morning, however, when Marie attends to sacristan duties in the school chapel, she is strangled by the murderer inside the [[confessional]]. When she is reported missing, Jack and Cristina realize that Gray was not the killer. Cristina concludes that all the girls murdered were good girls and that the murderer must have learned of their innocence through the confessional. Cristina finds a secret tunnel behind the confessional, and is knocked unconscious by the murderer. Jack also finds the secret door, and within the tunnel the tied-up Cristina and a secret chamber in which the corpses of the missing girls have been arranged in a gruesome replication of the [[Last Supper]]. There he is assailed and stabbed in the stomach by the murderer, who is revealed to be Emily. Cristina eventually rescues Jack by dropping a cross hanging above the supper table on Emily, which stabs her to death. After they escape the tunnel, they conclude that Gwen killed herself all along, because she was the only girl who had a sin and thus could not have been a victim of Emily.

Demon Knight
  ===Prologue=== A woman, having recently murdered a man, soaks in the bath. The murdered man then reawakens and attempts to murder the woman. Right before the corpse hacks the woman to death, the whole thing turns out to be a film shoot with the [[Tales from the Crypt (comics)#The Crypt-Keeper|Crypt Keeper]] directing. While the angry Crypt Keeper berates the lead actor ([[John Larroquette]]) for his lack of talent, he becomes aware of the viewer and begins to promote his latest project, which he hopes will get him into Hollywood: ''Demon Knight''.  ===Story=== On a desert road in New Mexico, The Collector ([[Billy Zane]]) pursues drifter Frank Brayker ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]). The vehicles crash and Brayker flees. Local drunk Uncle Willy ([[Dick Miller]]) takes him to a decommissioned church converted into a [[boarding house]], where he rents a room and observes the residents: owner Irene ([[C. C. H. Pounder]]), prostitute Cordelia ([[Brenda Bakke]]), postal clerk Wally ([[Charles Fleischer]]), and a convict on [[work release]] named Jeryline ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]). A [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] cook named Roach ([[Thomas Haden Church]]) arrives and informs the group about a theft attempt on his employer's car, unaware it was Brayker, and a suspicious Irene calls the sheriff. Sheriff Tupper ([[John Schuck]]) and his deputy Bob ([[Gary Farmer]]) encounter The Collector at the crash site, who convinces them that Brayker is a dangerous thief. At the boarding house, Tupper and Bob learn that Brayker is in possession of an important artifact and that he is carrying false ID. Tupper also gets word from his base that both cars were stolen and he arrests Brayker as well as The Collector. The Collector kills Tupper by punching through his skull. Driven outside by the key-like artifact Brayker possesses, The Collector draws his own blood on the sand and produces a team of demonic creatures.  Brayker uses blood from the artifact to protect the building and tells the group they must wait out the night. Unable to get in, The Collector uses psychic powers to seduce and possess Cordelia. Cordelia kills Wally and cripples Irene before Brayker kills her. The group attempts to escape through old mine tunnels under the building, where Jeryline finds Danny hiding. The other townsfolk, under demonic possession, drive them back into the church. The residents demand an explanation, and Brayker reluctantly tells them the history of the key artifact. Following [[Genesis creation narrative|the creation of Earth by God]], demons used seven keys to focus the power of the cosmos into their hands. When discovered, God created light, which scattered the demons and the keys across the universe. The artifact that Brayker holds is the last key needed to reclaim power; and to protect it, God had a thief named Sirach fill it with the blood of [[Jesus Christ]]. The guardians of the key, immortal while holding it, have since passed it on, refilling it with their own blood when they die. Brayker received the key from his commanding officer during [[World War I]]. Danny disappears and Jeryline rallies everyone to look for him, during which Roach sneaks the key out of Brayker's satchel.  In the church attic, Irene and Bob discover that Wally was planning to attack the post office with a trunk full of weapons. The Collector soon possesses Uncle Willy, who attacks the others. While battling Willy, Roach makes a deal with The Collector to trade his life for the key, but The Collector betrays and kills him soon after Roach walks away. Brayker retrieves the key in the battle and Irene and Bob sacrifice themselves to stop the remaining minions. In the attic, The Collector brainwashes Danny, who mortally wounds Brayker before Jeryline kills him. As he dies, Brayker initiates Jeryline as a guardian of the key, deactivating all blood seals. Jeryline confronts The Collector and spits blood from the key in his face, causing him to transform into a large demon before being destroyed.  At dawn, Jeryline refills the key with Brayker's blood and boards a bus with her cat, sealing the door behind them. Down the road, the bus stops to pick up a stranger (Mark David Kennerly), who declines to get on stating that he'll catch the next one. Dressed identically to his predecessor and carrying the same suitcase, Jeryline realizes that he is the next Collector. After exchanging a glance in passing, the new Collector begins following on foot, whistling the theme song to the ''Tales from the Crypt'' television series.  ===Epilogue=== While the Collector walks away, the camera shifts to a nearby hole, which leads to the Crypt Keeper's home. He prepares for the premiere of his film with the starlets with him. The Crypt Keeper informs the viewer that Jeryline lives happily ever after and is enjoying traveling the world. Once he arrives at the lavish premiere, the producers reveal their powers of "final cut", snare him in a guillotine, and decapitate him, much to his delight.

One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit ([[Satish Shah]]), who lives in [[Punjab]], [[India]]. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago—to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet ([[Parmeet Sethi]]). Simran is disappointed as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.  One evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer.

Meanwhile, Raj's father agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip.

Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident, but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.  As Raj and his father wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them.

Die Hard with a Vengeance
 In [[New York City]], the [[Bonwit Teller]] department store is destroyed by a bomb during the morning commute. The [[New York City Police Department]] receive a call from "Simon" ordering them that suspended police officer Lt. [[John McClane]] be dropped in [[Harlem]] wearing a [[sandwich board]] that says "I Hate Niggers" and threatening to detonate another bomb if they don't comply. They collect a hung-over McClane and follow Simon's instructions. McClane is saved from an angry group of black men by Zeus Carver, a nearby shop owner. McClane and Carver escape and return to headquarters, where Simon calls again and makes more bomb threats if McClane and Carver do not follow his instructions.  Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles. He tells them to reach the [[Wall Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Wall Street subway station]] 90 blocks south, within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound [[3 (New York City Subway service)|3]] train. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives. Though McClane locates the bomb and throws it off the train, it still detonates, derailing the train and sending it through the station with minimal injuries due to Carver's warnings. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, who reveal Simon is Peter Krieg, a former Colonel in the East German [[Volksarmee|People's Army]] and a mercenary-for-hire. Krieg is after McClane as Krieg's birth name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber whom McClane had killed [[Die Hard|years earlier in Los Angeles]]. Simon calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, to inform them that he has planted a bomb in a NYC-area public school that is rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the police band. Simon tells them that he will give McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game. While McClane and Carver set off on Simon's next task, the police organize all the city's public works to begin searching schools, using [[9-1-1]] to coordinate activities.  As McClane solves Simon's riddles, he recognizes that Simon is using the school bomb distraction to draw the police away from Wall Street. They arrive too late to find that Simon and his agents used the destruction of the subway station to dig into the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] and steal $140 billion of [[Precious metal#Bullion|gold bullion]] in dump trucks. They follow the trucks to an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] in the [[New York City Water Tunnel No. 3]], and McClane has Carver continue on Simon's games. Within the tunnel he kills some of Simon's men, discovering they have a roll of quarters on them. Simon destroys a [[cofferdam]], flooding the tunnel, but McClane escapes through a vent, ending up near Carver. They recognize the roll of quarters would pay for a toll road, and follow the trucks to a tanker vessel in the [[Long Island Sound]]. They sneak aboard, but realize too late it is a trap. They are tied to the real bomb and Simon says he will destroy the tanker, redistributing the bullion across the Sound, which would destroy the economies of the world. McClane convinces Simon to give him a bottle of aspirin. After Simon and his gang depart the vessel, McClane is able to free them from the bomb before it explodes, sinking the tanker.  As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the police, McClane says he "knows" Simon and reports that none of the bullion was on the tanker. McClane finds the bottle of aspirin came from a hotel just inside the [[Quebec]] border. McClane, Carver, and the police launch an attack on a warehouse near the hotel where Simon and his men are in the process of distributing the wealth and planning their escape. The rest of the men are captured, while Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt escape in a helicopter, firing upon McClane. McClane shoots an overhead power line so that it falls onto the helicopter, crashing it and killing all aboard. With the bullion located, Carver convinces McClane to call his wife.  
Devil in a Blue Dress (film)
 In the summer of 1948, Easy Rawlins is recently laid off from his job at [[Champion Aircraft]], and needs money urgently to pay his mortgage. Easy's friend Joppy, who runs a bar, introduces him to a white man named DeWitt Albright. Albright is looking for someone to help him find a missing white woman, Daphne Monet, assumed to be hiding somewhere in the [[African American]] community; he also learns she is the girlfriend of wealthy Todd Carter, who was the favorite in the Los Angeles mayoral race before dropping out. Albright, who says Carter dropped out because he couldn't find Daphne, offers Rawlins $100 to take the job. Easy accepts but is immediately suspicious. Daphne is known to spend time in the [[juke joint]]s along [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]] and Easy begins his search at an illegal club on 89th and Central.  While waiting to enter, he sees a commotion between a white man, Richard McGee, and the club's bouncer, Junior Fornay. He then meets with friends Degan Odell and Dupree Brouchard and girlfriend Coretta James. He learns that Coretta is a confidant of Daphne. After spending the night with her, he discovers Daphne was involved with a South Central gangster named Frank Green.  Easy is called by Albright to set up a meeting at the Malibu pier. While waiting, Easy is accosted by several local white youths after a casual conversation with one of their girlfriends. Easy, trying to calm the situation, is nearly overtaken when Albright appears from the darkness. Albright viciously humiliates and beats one of the punks. Easy, uncomfortable with the situation, gives his information to Albright, who retains him with another payment and demands he continue his search.  When Easy gets home, he is arrested by two [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] homicide detectives. He learns that Coretta was savagely murdered after his night with her. He is released after some rough treatment. While walking home, he is followed by Mathew Terell, the other candidate in the mayoral race. He gets into the car and finds Terell with a young boy, supposedly his adopted son. Terell makes it clear that he is also very interested in finding Daphne. Easy, wary of Terell's motives, asks to be dropped off and walks home.  After a nightmare about Coretta, he receives a call from Daphne. They meet at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]], where she asks for his help. She needs to go into the Hollywood Hills and meet a person with information vital to her and Todd Carter. Easy nervously drives her to her destination. The house has been ransacked and the occupant, Richard McGee, is dead. Easy finds a clue to his murder. Daphne flees in a panic.  The next morning, Easy returns home to find Albright and his goons waiting for him; his connection to the murder of Coretta is now used to force him to resume his search for the girl. Easy enlists the help of his friend, Mouse Alexander. Easy's goal is to uncover why Daphne is so important to so many people and, in the process, keep himself out of jail.  He meets with Todd Carter, securing money to locate Daphne. Upon learning that Albright is not employed by Carter, Easy returns home. He is warned by a neighbor that an ambush awaits. Easy turns around in time to grab Frank Green. The two men fight in the house. Green gets the upper hand, but Mouse comes to the rescue. Easy tries to reason with Frank but Mouse shoots him. Frank manages to escape. Easy and Mouse meet up with Dupree, and find out that Coretta had been in possession of pictures of Terell with naked children. Easy finds the pictures in Coretta's Bible.  Junior Fornay reveals that after Junior's altercation with McGee, he drove him home to the Hills to pick up money. He is cornered when Easy reveals a pack of Mexican Zapata cigarettes smoked only by Junior. Junior pleads with Mouse and Easy that he isn't the killer.  At home, he gets a visit from Daphne. Easy learns that Daphne hid from Carter because of her association with Frank Green, her half-brother. Daphne's mother from New Orleans had given birth to two children by different fathers, and although Daphne's own father was white, her half-brother's father was black. Being the ''fiancée'' of a mayoral favorite with partial African-American heritage would ensure a loss for Carter. Terell's knowledge of this is the reason Carter dropped out of the race.   Daphne says McGee sold the pictures to her, and Easy infers Albright killed McGee while looking for the pictures, then Junior gave them to Coretta, who hid them in her Bible. Daphne reveals that Coretta was killed accidentally by Joppy although Daphne had only asked him to scare her into silence.  Albright and his men burst into Easy's house, subduing Easy and abducting Daphne. When he regains consciousness, Easy calls Mouse and they race to Joppy's to get a fix on Albright's location. At the bar, Easy abducts Joppy at gunpoint. He learns where Albright is, although Mouse nearly shoots them both in the process. Easy only calms Mouse down by telling him they could be rewarded $7,000 that Daphne will pay for photographs that Easy has obtained.  In the Hollywood Hills, they set up an ambush, shooting Albright and his goons while rescuing Daphne. When Easy returns to the car he finds Joppy dead, killed by Mouse.  Easy finds out the money Daphne paid him and Mouse for the photographs came from a large sum originally given to her by Carter's family as a bribe to get out of town. She had only stayed because she believed they would change their minds and allow Carter to marry her if he won. Although Carter is now certain to become mayor, he refuses her pleas, despite saying that he loves her. She leaves in tears.  Easy gives Carter the photographs that prove that Matthew Terell is a pedophile in exchange for the $800 he is owed. Carter promises Easy there will be no more trouble with the police. Easy drops off Daphne at her brother's apartment and notes that she subsequently left town with her brother.  
Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde
  Richard Jacks (Tim Daly) is a perfumer working at a major fragrance company. His projects have failed and the chief executive, Mrs. Unterveldt (Polly Bergen), is thinking of replacing him with a woman. After his great-grandfather dies,  Jacks attends the will reading. He receives nothing but notes from scientific experiments. He discovers that his ancestor was Dr. Henry Jekyll. Jacks attempts to refine Jekyll's formula. He decides to add more estrogen to the mixture in the hope that it will prove less dangerous.  Monitoring his vital stats after ingesting the formula, he gives up and attends a job interview. Although everything appears normal at first, his voice begins to crack, his nails grow longer and the hairs on his arms recede into his skin. Jacks then feels a strange sensation in his groin area and watches in horror as his manhood disappears. Jacks tries to leave, but starts to develop breasts. Embarrassed, Jacks flees back to the lab, leaving his interviewer speechless. Back in his office, the final stages of the transformation into a woman take place.  The new female alter-ego names herself Helen Hyde (Sean Young) and introduces herself as Jacks's new assistant. Helen rewrites his reports, is kind to his secretary, flirts with his superiors, Yves Dubois (Harvey Feinstein) and Oliver Mintz (Stephen Tobolowsky), and rewards herself with a shopping spree. Later, Helen meets and befriends Jacks' fiancee, Sarah (Lysette Anthony), but has Sarah move out of Jacks' apartment so she can have it for herself.  The next day, after several comments from colleagues, Jacks realizes that Helen was real but is unable to access any of her memories. Nonetheless, he feels invigorated and invites Sarah to his place for a romantic meal. Everything appears to be going well until he realizes he is again transforming into Helen, causing Sarah to flee. Hyde becomes resentful at having to share a body. She disfigures one of Richard's colleagues, Pete (Jeremy Piven), and steals his ideas. She even attempts to seduce Oliver. Just when Hyde is about to have sex with Oliver, she starts changing back into Jacks and hides in the bathroom and escapes via a nearby window.  Due to her flirting with Oliver, Hyde is named Jacks' superior at work. To stop her, Jacks handcuffs himself to the bed, only to be horrified as Sarah walks in and finds his closet to be full of lingerie. This leads Sarah to believe that he and Hyde are having an affair. Hyde then has a private meeting with Dubois and Mintz presenting her perfume, where she fondles Dubois' groin and Mintz' crotch with her hosed feet simultaneously under the table, thus persuading them. She then sleeps with Dubois as he confronts her about her false resume.  Hyde then warns Jacks via video of her intentions to take over completely. He then realizes that he is actually starting to spend more time as Hyde than himself and that he has to come up with a plan before he disappears completely. Jacks tries to humiliate Hyde in front of her superiors by stripping naked and writing obscenities all over his body, hoping that they will walk in on her after she takes over. Hyde manages to outsmart him by delaying the change, causing his plan to backfire and Jacks to be fired.  Sarah is finally convinced by seeing CCTV footage from the initial transformation. Jacks comes up with a formula that would effectively destroy the Hyde part of himself, but he must consume it as Hyde within a certain time frame. After he transforms, Sarah attempts to inject her with the formula but fails—injecting only about 20% of it, causing random body parts to spontaneously transform between male and female. A fire breaks out in the apartment and Hyde escapes.  At the launch of "Indulge", the perfume she stole from Richard, (the one that Mintz and Dubois sniffed as she fondled them with her feet),  Hyde steals a guest's dress. As she mingles, the effects of the formula cause her to temporarily grow stubble; her breasts also disappear and reappear. Sarah, who sneaked into the party, hides in a podium and waits until the promotion video starts before injecting the rest of the formula into Hyde, who begins transforming back into Jacks for good. A relieved Jacks realizes it's over but sees that he's now standing in a room full of colleagues wearing a dress. He makes a speech about the only way he could understand a woman was to become one. He then is offered a promotion as well as a vacation, which he accepts. As he removes the undergarments he comments "Helen and her damn thongs".  
Dolores Claiborne (film)
 In 1995, Dolores Claiborne works as a domestic servant on Little Tall Island in [[Maine]]. Dolores has a struggle with her elderly, paralyzed employer, Vera Donovan, in her mansion. Vera falls down the staircase and Dolores ransacks the kitchen. She is caught by a mailman, who sees her standing over Vera with a [[rolling pin]], apparently intending to kill her. Vera dies and the police begin a murder investigation.  Dolores' daughter, Selena St. George, is a successful journalist, living in [[New York City]], who battles depression and substance abuse. Selena arrives in town to support her mother, despite her own doubts about Dolores' innocence. Dolores insists she did not kill her employer. Selena finds little sympathy for Dolores, as the entire town believes she murdered her husband, Joe St. George, almost 20 years earlier. Some of the town's inhabitants harass her by vandalizing her home, taunting her in the street, and driving by her house and screaming at her. Detective John Mackey, who was the chief detective in her husband's murder case, is determined to put Dolores away for life.  Selena also believes Dolores killed her father, and has not spoken to her mother in over a decade. In 1975, Joe was an [[domestic violence|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], and one night Dolores had threatened to kill him if he ever harmed her again. Selena, then 13 years old, was unaware her mother was being abused. Dolores went to work as a housemaid for millionaire Vera Donovan in order to raise enough money to pay for Selena's education. Dolores went to the bank to withdraw her money so she and Selena could flee Joe's abuse. The plan backfired, however, when the bank notified Dolores that Joe stole the money from Selena's savings account.  Dolores says Vera threw herself down the staircase and begged Dolores to [[Assisted suicide|put her out of her misery]]. Mackey refuses to believe her, and reveals that Vera has left her entire fortune to Dolores. Mackey informs them the will is eight years old, which nearly convinces Selena her mother is guilty. Dolores eventually tells Selena that before he died, Dolores realized Joe was sexually abusing Selena when he gave her an heirloom locket. Selena has always furiously denied any abuse, and after a fierce argument, she storms out, leaving Dolores to fend for herself.  Back in 1975, Dolores broke down and confessed Joe's abuses to Vera, who remained characteristically cold until Dolores mentioned that he was molesting Selena. Turning unusually sympathetic, Vera implied she killed her own late, unfaithful husband, Jack, and engineered it to look like an accident. Vera's confession formed a bond between the two women and convinced Dolores to take control of her situation. As a total [[solar eclipse]] approached, Dolores  was pointedly given the rest of the day off by Vera. Dolores and Selena had an argument about Dolores' suspicions regarding Joe's sexual abuse. Selena fled home for the weekend to work at a hotel, where guests had flocked for the eclipse. Joe soon returned from working on a fishing boat, and Dolores offered him a bottle of Scotch to celebrate the eclipse. After Joe got drunk, Dolores revealed she knew he stole from Selena's account and molested his own daughter, then provoked him into attacking her and falling down an old well, leaving him to die as he plunges to the stone bottom.  Selena hears this entire story on a tape left for her by Dolores, who had foreseen her departure. While on the ferry, Selena suddenly uncovers a [[repressed memory]] of her father forcing her to give him a [[handjob]]. Realizing everything, Selena rushes back to Dolores as she is attending the coroner's inquest. As Mackey makes a case to be sent to a [[grand jury]] in an attempt to indict Dolores for murder, Selena arrives and tells him he has no admissible evidence, he is only doing this because of his personal vendetta against Dolores, and that despite an often stormy relationship, Vera and Dolores loved each other. Realizing that the case would likely end with either a dismissal or acquittal, Mackey reluctantly drops the charges. Dolores and Selena reconcile on the ferry wharf before Selena returns to New York.

 Psychiatrist Jack Mickler ([[Marlon Brando]]) dissuades a would-be suicide - a 21-year-old man who is costumed like [[Zorro]] and claims to be [[Don Juan]] ([[Johnny Depp]]), who is then held for a ten-day review in a [[mental institution]]. Mickler, who is about to retire, insists on doing the evaluation and conducts it without medicating the youth. "Don Juan" tells his story - born in [[Mexico]], the death of his father, a year in a harem, and finding true love (and being rejected) on a remote island. Listening enlivens Mickler's relationship with his own wife, Marilyn ([[Faye Dunaway]]). As the ten days tick down, and pressure mounts on Mickler to support the youth's indefinite confinement, finding reality within the romantic imagination becomes Jack's last professional challenge.    
The Doom Generation
 Teenage lovers Jordan White and Amy Blue pick up a handsome drifter named Xavier Red while driving home from a club. Jordan gives Xavier the nickname "X". A late-night stop at a convenience store leaves the three on the run when X accidentally kills the store's owner, forcing the trio to hide in a motel to avoid arrest. While Jordan and Amy have sex in the bathtub, X learns from the local television news program that the store owner's wife [[Disembowelment|disemboweled]] her children with a machete before committing suicide, thus, he concludes, removing any possibility of the trio being caught by the police.  Later that evening, Amy has sex with X, even though they do not get along. Eventually Jordan finds out, and things become tense as the two men develop a lingering sexual attraction for one another. As the trio journeys around the city of Los Angeles, they continue to get into violent situations due to people either claiming to be Amy's previous lovers or mistaking her for such. The [[FBI]] has a meeting and declares it will find Amy and kill her (exactly the same sentiment is voiced by several other parties in the film). She is mistakenly identified by a fast food window clerk as "Sunshine" and later by a character played by [[Parker Posey]] as "Kitten".  Jordan, Amy and X spend the night in an abandoned warehouse, where they engage in a [[threesome]]. While Amy goes to urinate, Jordan and X are attacked by a trio of [[neo-Nazi]]s, one of whom had previously mistaken Amy for his ex-girlfriend "Bambi". The gang proceeds to beat up X and then hold Jordan down as the aforementioned neo-Nazi ties up and [[rape]]s Amy on top of an American flag. The group finally severs Jordan's penis with pruning shears and forces it into his mouth. After Amy breaks free, she kills the neo-Nazis with the shears and escapes with X, leaving Jordan for dead. The film ends with Amy and X driving aimlessly on the road with no communication as the film fades.  
Down to Earth (1995 film)
 The film tells a story of Mariana, a [[nurse]] who leaves [[Lisbon]] to accompany an [[immigrant]] worker in a [[coma]]tose sleep on his trip home to [[Cape Verde]]. The devoted Portuguese nurse took a journey only to find herself lost in abstract drama. There she finds that "she brought a living man among the dead."<ref>[http://gemini-films.com/catalogue/casadelava_us.htm Quoted from the distributor's official synopsis]</ref> Costa made the film in a densely [[minimalist#Minimalism in Film|minimalist]] style. Cryptic ellipses, cinematographic precision, narrative abstraction and lingering imagery of people and place, notably [[Mount Fogo]], the highest [[active volcano]] of Cape Verde, are features in this melancholic meditation on love and loneliness.  
Don't Forget You're Going to Die
  The film tells the story of an [[HIV positive people|HIV positive man]] who travels to Italy.  
Don't Cry, Nanking
 The story focuses on a family, a Chinese doctor, his pregnant Japanese wife and their two children, who escaped the [[Battle of Shanghai]] hoping to seek refuge in the capital where the doctor was born.  Being Japanese, the wife must hide her origins to the Chinese citizens, but soon upon their arrival, the city is invaded by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and this time, it is the father who tries to hide his identity as the family tries to reach the safety zone established by the [[The International Committee for Nanking Safety Zone|International Committee for Nanking Safety Zone]].  Among historical characters such as [[John Rabe]] and [[Minnie Vautrin]] (whose names have been curiously changed to John Robbins and Whitney Craft in the English translation), the film also features an out-of-context excerpt of the infamous [[Contest to kill 100 people using a sword]] between Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyochi Noda.  There are some painful and brutal scenes such as the execution, by machine gun, of thousands of Chinese [[prisoners of war]].  Being produced before the publishing of such books like [[Iris Chang]]'s ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'' and [[Herbert Bix]]'s ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', the movie shows General [[Iwane Matsui]] giving the order to "kill all the captives" and omits any reference to [[Prince Asaka]].

Dracula: Dead and Loving It
 Solicitor [[Renfield|Thomas Renfield]] travels all the way from [[London]] to "Castle Dracula" in [[Transylvania]] to finalize Count Dracula's purchase of Carfax Abbey in England. As the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further, Renfield continues on foot.  Renfield meets [[Count Dracula]], a charming but rather strange man who is a vampire. He then casts a hypnotic spell on the highly suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. During the voyage, Dracula dines upon the ship's crew. When the ship arrives and Renfield, (by this time raving mad in the style of [[Dwight Frye]]), is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a [[lunatic asylum]].  Meanwhile, Dracula visits an [[opera house]], where he introduces himself to his new neighbors: [[John Seward|Doctor Seward]], (the lunatic asylum's [[Administrator (business)|administrator]] and head [[psychiatrist]], who is obsessed with prescribing his [[patient]]s [[enema]]s), [[Mina Harker|Mina]] (Seward's nubile daughter), [[Jonathan Harker]] (Seward's assistant and Mina's [[fiance]]), and [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy]] (Seward's equally nubile [[Ward (law)|ward]]). Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, enters her bedroom and feeds on her blood.  Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]]. Van Helsing informs the skeptical Dr. Seward that Lucy has been attacked by a vampire. After some hesitation, Seward and Harker allow garlic to be placed in Lucy's bedroom to repel the vampire. After a failed attempt by Renfield to remove the garlic, Dracula uses mind-control to make Lucy leave her room, and kills her. Despite Van Helsing's warnings, Seward refuses to believe him.  Van Helsing meets Dracula and begins to suspect him of being the local vampire after the two trade words, phrases and insults in Moldavian, each attempting to have the last word in the foreign language 'discussion'. Lucy, now a vampire herself, rises from her crypt, drains the blood from her guard, and tries to attack and seduce Harker, who had come to watch over her grave to be sure if Van Helsing was indeed right.  Dracula's next victim is Mina, but he has bigger plans for her; he wants her to be his undead bride throughout eternity. He spirits her away to Carfax Abbey, where they dance, and he sucks her blood. The following morning, she is unusually frisky, and tries to seduce the prudish Jonathan. Dr Seward mistakenly assumes Jonathan to be seducing Mina and orders him to leave. However, Van Helsing becomes suspicious at this strange behavior. Noticing a scarf around Mina's neck, he removes it, revealing two puncture marks. Though she lies about how she got them, Van Hesling confirms she has been attacked by a vampire by placing a cross on her hand, which burns a mark into it.  Van Helsing devises a plan to reveal the vampire's secret identity. Both Dracula and Renfield are invited to a [[Ball (dance)|ball]], where Van Helsing has placed a huge mirror, covered with a curtain, on one of the walls. While Dracula and Mina perform an excellent dance routine the curtain over the mirror is dropped, and guests are stunned to see that Dracula has no reflection. Dracula grabs Mina and escapes out of a window.  Van Helsing deduces that Renfield is Dracula's slave, and thus might know where he has taken his coffin after a search of Carfax turns up empty. He locks himself in a room to finish making Mina his bride. His pursuers break down the door, and they fight. Van Helsing, noticing sunlight creeping into the room, starts opening the blinds. As his body begins to burn, Dracula then attempts to flee, but is inadvertently killed by Renfield.  With Dracula dead, Renfield falls into despair with no master to serve and scrapes Dracula's ashes into the coffin. Seward tells him "You are free, now", and he realizes this to be true with Dracula gone, and seems relieved. But the instant Dr. Seward calls for Renfield to follow him out of the church, he follows with "Yes, Master". Van Helsing dusts himself off, opens Dracula's coffin and yells something in Moldavian to ensure that he has the final word between himself and the count. However after the end credits roll, Dracula responds in Moldavian despite being dead, giving him the 'true' final word.  
Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn
 In the [[Afterlife|Other World]], a teenage "oni" guarding a spirit cleansing machine turns the volume of his walkman up so loud that he fails to change the evil essence tank when necessary. Due to the overload of evil essence, the machine explodes and the "oni" is transformed into a huge-childlike monster with power over the laws regarding the worlds of the living and the dead. As a result, [[Multiverse|both worlds]] are thrown into chaos: in the living world, several deceased are brought back to life, while in the other world, beings who were allowed to keep their bodies turn into spirits, and vice versa.  While fighting in the final of another Other World Tournament, [[Goku]] and Pikkon are interrupted by the appearance of a crystal-like substance all over the place, and are sent to see to the disturbance. They find the Check-In Station and most of the Other World encased in crystal-like jelly beans which are immune to their energy attacks. From inside the station, King Yemma directs them to the culprit, sitting on the roof. The monster, who is unable to say anything other than its own name, Janemba, refuses to put the barrier back after Pikkon insists. Goku decides to lure Janemba down to [[Hell]] to fight him while Pikkon tries to free King Yemma.  Earth comes under siege by an array of villains, one of them a comical parody of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Wehrmacht]], as well as an army of deceased past villains led by [[Frieza]]. [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] makes quick work of Frieza, causing the villains to scatter. During the fray, [[Goten]] and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] gather the Dragon Balls, summon [[Shenron]] and ask him to put the barrier between the living and deceased worlds back up, but Shenron claims that he cannot grant the wish, since only King Yemma has that kind of power. In Hell, Goku and Janemba engage in a game-like fight, with Janemba taking the upper hand against Goku. Goku realises that despite Janemba likely not meaning any real harm, he is nevertheless a danger to both worlds, and powers up to Super Saiyan 3. In his new form, Goku dominates Janemba and literally smashes his head in, but Janemba merely transforms into a much smaller but more powerful and sinister form and again takes the upper hand, almost killing Goku, but [[Vegeta]], having regained his physical body, arrives in time to help. Both Goku and Vegeta are no match for Janemba and are forced to hide. Goku proposes fusion, but Vegeta refuses to join bodies with Goku, given his pride.  Meanwhile, back on Earth, most of the villains are defeated. Pikkon continues to try to free King Yemma, but to no avail, and in his anger, insults the crystal substance, causing it to crack. But even Pikkon's worst insults cause the crystal to crack only slightly, and he eventually gives up and rushes to aid Goku and Vegeta. After much persuasion, Vegeta agrees to fuse with Goku via the fusion dance, but Vegeta fails to extend his forefinger at the last minute and the fusion fails, resulting in a weak, obese "fighter" named Veku. Janemba beats Veku severely and almost kills him, but the fusion wears off and Goku and Vegeta escape in time. Pikkon arrives to stall Janemba while Goku and Vegeta try the fusion again, this time successfully performing the [[holism|ultimate fusion]] into Gogeta. Gogeta easily pummels Janemba around, but rather than kill him, uses his power to cleanse him of all evil inside him, reverting him to his teenage "oni" form, who runs away from Gogeta in horror.  With Janemba gone, his hold over the Multiverse disappears and the deceased return to the Afterlife. After sharing a good-natured farewell with Goku, Vegeta reverts to spirit form and disappears. While flying home, Goten and Trunks tease Gohan and [[Videl]] after having watched them kissing earlier on. The film comes to an end with the still-summoned Shenron, asking if anyone wants to make a wish.  
Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon
 On a distant planet, a young alien boy frantically searches his surroundings, sword at the ready, but before he can react, he is crushed by a giant foot while someone laughs maniacally in the background.  On Earth, [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] and [[Videl]] (as the Great Saiyaman I and II, respectively) are summoned to the city to rescue an old, alien-like man trying to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. Once they rescue him and take him elsewhere, the man introduces himself as Hoi and presents them with a music box, inside which he claims a hero named Tapion is trapped, and may be the Earth's last chance against an approaching evil. When even [[Goku]] fails to open the music box, the Z Fighters gather the Dragon Balls and ask [[Shenron]] to open it for them. Tapion is released, but expresses anger at Hoi and Goku for freeing him, explaining that inside him is the essence of half of the ferocious monster, Hirudegarn, before fleeing into isolation. [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], however, takes an instant liking to Tapion, and frequently sneaks off to his location to bring him food, despite Tapion angrily telling him to leave him alone.  Shortly afterwards, the lower half of Hirudegarn appears and begins attacking the city. Gohan and Videl rush to the city's aid, but are unable to deal any damage until Tapion appears, playing a mysterious tune on an ocarina which weakens Hirudegarn and causes him to vanish. Later on, however, while Trunks is bringing Tapion some food, Hoi suddenly appears and tries to steal Tapion's ocarina. Hoi claims that Tapion himself is the evil threat to the Earth and that the ocarina must be destroyed for them to stop Tapion. In the ensuing scuffle, Trunks gets hold of the ocarina, but chooses to believe Tapion and returns it to him, while Hoi flees. Tapion accepts Trunks as a friend and is invited to the Capsule Corp. compound. While there, he explains his story to [[Bulma]]: a thousand years ago, an evil race of alien magicians, the Kashvaar, who at sometime proclaimed themselves as the superior race and set out to destroy all life different from their own in the universe by awakening an ancient monster known as Hirudegarn. Their conquest eventually brought them to the planet Konats, Tapion's homeworld. During the ensuing battle, a Konatsian priest discovered a magic sword and two ocarinas capable of stopping Hirudegarn. Tapion and his younger brother Minosha kept Hirudegarn at bay with the ocarinas while the priest cleaved the monster in half with the sword. In the aftermath, in order to ensure Hirudegarn would never again be released, the Konatsian War Council decided to seal Hirudegarn's two halves away inside Tapion and Minosha, magically seal them inside music boxes, and send them to the opposite sides of the universe until the Kashvaar were brought to justice. Hoi, who is the last of the Kashvaar, has already killed Minosha (as seen in the prologue), and now seeks out Tapion in order to complete Hirudegarn and conquer the universe. Bulma offers to build Tapion a bedroom using the components of the music box so that Tapion can sleep without Hirudegarn escaping from him.  However, while sleeping, a nightmare causes Tapion to accidentally destroy the bedroom. Hirudegarn's lower half reappears and starts attacking. In desperation, Tapion begs Goku and the others to kill him in order to destroy Hirudegarn's upper half, but it is too late and the monster is released. A fierce battle between the Z Fighters and Hirudegarn erupts, with none of the fighters able to keep up with the monster's strength and speed. Trunks and [[Goten]] fuse in to Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks and bombard Hirudegarn with energy blasts, apparently burning him to death, but Hirudegarn transforms into a much faster and more powerful form and makes quick work of Gotenks (defusing him in the process) and the rest of the Z Fighters. Tapion appears and seals Hirudegarn inside himself again by playing the ocarina, and asks Trunks to slay him and destroy Hirudegarn forever. Trunks hesitates, and Hirudegarn escapes again, destroying the ocarina. As Hoi watches and gloats over his apparent victory, In an ironic twist, Hoi is stepped on and is crushed (the same way Minosha was killed) by the monster he believed would destroy all life different than his own. By now, the only fighter left standing is Goku, who refuses to surrender. In desperation, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 and starts taunting Hirudegarn, angering the monster further (Earlier, Gohan learnt that intense emotions drain Hirudegarn' energy). As Goku and Hirudegarn battle, Trunks intervenes and cuts Hirudegarn's tail off with Tapion's sword, Goku angers the monster up to a point his defensive armor is useless. With Hirudegarn temporarily weakened, Goku uses his Dragon Fist attack to pierce through the monster, obliterating Hirudegarn once and for all.  In the aftermath, Tapion uses Bulma's time machine to return to Konats. Bulma promises to revive all of Hirudegarn's victims with the Dragon Balls. Before leaving, Tapion presents Trunks with his sword as a farewell gift. In the ending credits, Future Trunks is shown slaying Frieza, King Cold and their men with a sword similar to the one Tapion gave him.

One night, the ghost of her partner, Jake Marley (counterpart to Dickens' [[Jacob Marley]] character, played here by [[Jeffrey DeMunn]]), haunts her. She is soon brought back to a deserted Dobson's, where the [[Ghost of Christmas Past|Ghosts of Christmas Past]] ([[Jennifer Clement (actress)|Jennifer Clement]] and [[Nicole Parker]]) show her the Christmases she has celebrated. They take her to a very significant Christmas when her sister Francine ([[Molly Parker]]) died after nearly miscarrying her niece due to [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia of pregnancy]] (Ebbie believes that Francine would have survived had Ebbie not left her alone to attend a party); it is also the Christmas she met her soon-to-be boyfriend Paul ([[Ron Lea]]).

The [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] ([[Lorena Gale]]) shows her the life of her assistant Roberta Cratchet ([[Wendy Crewson]]), her daughter Martha (Laura Harris) and her son [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] ([[Taran Noah Smith]]). Next, she sees the party that she is invited to every year by her niece (also [[Molly Parker]]), but has always declined; everyone toast Ebbie, but her niece does not drink (the reason being that she is pregnant). She sees Paul and his wife and children, and Ignorance and Poverty in the form of feral homeless children, while the ghost shoves all of her harsh words back at her. Then, the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Ghost of Christmas Future]] shows her many terrible futures, including one where Tiny Tim has died, one where Dobson's is shut down, and one where she herself dies in a hospital flat broke after being hit by a car and nobody comes to see her. After the experience, Ebbie becomes a better person. She is shown the next morning, where she bids good morning to the doorman, and he is surprised. She also orders a large turkey for the Cratchets, donates money for the poor children, buys a coat for a homeless woman (Elan Ross Gibson) and offers her a job, gives Rita a raise (so Rita no longer needs to work her second job), gives a better job to Roberta, and finally attends the party her niece has been inviting her to. The movie ends with Ebbie at the Cratchets' house, eating dinner with them.

Empire Records
 Empire Records is an independent record shop managed by Joe ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]). The store is located in a fictional city in [[Delaware]], and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique. The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but lovable father figure. When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice.   The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas ([[Rory Cochrane]]) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honor. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of ''Music Town'', a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling $9,000 to a casino in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table. Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening manager A.J. ([[Johnny Whitworth]]) and fellow employee Mark ([[Ethan Embry]]). He confides in the pair about the previous night's events before riding away, seemingly for good. Joe arrives to help open the store and quickly receives phone calls from both the bank and the store owner, Mitchell Beck ([[Ben Bodé]]), regarding the previous night's missing deposit.  Joe is distracted from immediately dealing with this crisis due to a scheduled store event: Rex Manning ([[Maxwell Caulfield]]), a former 80's pop idol, is due to arrive at the store for an autograph session to promote his new album. The staff is unenthused by "Rex Manning Day", and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men. The employees secretly tease Rex behind his back about his fading career, and even his assistant Jane ([[Debi Mazar]]) later reveals her distaste for Rex's music.  Lucas returns after the store opens and Joe confronts him about the missing deposit. After telling him of his short misadventure, Lucas is asked to stay in the store until a plan is devised to recoup the lost $9,000. Joe explains that he had intended to use the money to invest and become part-owner of the store, which would allow him the opportunity of saving it from becoming a ''Music Town'' franchise. Next to arrive are cashiers Corey ([[Liv Tyler]]), an overachieving high school student, and her uninhibited best friend and co-worker Gina ([[Renée Zellweger]]), both of whom are informed of the situation. Soon thereafter arrives hostile employee Deb ([[Robin Tunney]]), who is in a particularly bad state of mind; she has survived an apparent suicide attempt and immediately shaves her head in the bathroom upon arriving at work. Deb's boyfriend Berko ([[Coyote Shivers]]) soon arrives as well.  The afternoon continues in a downward spiral. A young belligerent shoplifter who identifies himself only as "[[Warren Beatty]]" ([[Brendan Sexton III]]) is apprehended by Lucas and subsequently arrested, promising to return for revenge. Encouraged by Gina, Corey's school-girl crush on Rex is pushed to its limits—much to the horror of her friends, including A.J., who is infatuated with her. Before arguing with Corey, Gina has sex with Rex Manning, causing the rift between the two friends to intensify and Rex to get kicked out of the store by Joe. This leads to the revelation that Corey is secretly using [[Amphetamine]]s. Deb takes Corey aside and advises her on the questionable choices she is making, choices which may have dire consequences on her bright future. In return, Corey holds a mock funeral for Deb and the whole store attends. Gina then apologizes to Corey. The pugnacious "Warren Beatty" keeps his word and returns to the store with a gun (loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]]) to seek revenge. Lucas reveals that he was once a troubled youth much like "Warren" until he was taken in by Joe, who gave him a home and a job and helped him turn his life around. The staff surmises that "Warren" just needs a similar chance. Joe subsequently offers him a job at the store.  After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests calling Mitchell. However, the employees, Joe, and Jane — who has since quit working for Rex — pool their resources to replace the missing money. Despite their best efforts, they are thousands short. Suddenly inspired, Mark runs out of the store, jumps in front of a news crew covering the holdup, and announces a late night benefit party to "Save the Empire". The store opens its doors and collects donations while selling food, drinks, and merchandise to raise the remaining money. They manage to raise just enough, which they offer to store owner Mitchell. Mitchell in turn offers to sell the store to Joe, admitting that Joe has always loved the place while he himself has always hated it. Joe agrees to become the new owner. Corey meets up with a dejected A.J on the roof and confesses that she does love him. He tells her he has decided to attend art school in [[Boston]] so he can be near her when she goes to [[Harvard]]. They then kiss.  In celebration of maintaining Empire Records' independence and their victory against "the man", the staff ends the long and eventful day with a dance party on the store's roof.

Charlotte is given the choice between staying with her life as she knows it, or becoming a part of the vampire's world. There is also the usual struggle between such opposing entities, as Charlotte sees that not only does she have to choose between her boyfriend and her mysterious night-time visitor, but also between light and dark, and good and evil. In the end, after briefly kissing Milo and being interrupted by Eliza, the campus slut (who was killed by the vampire by banging her head against the wall, then licking the blood from the wall), she ends up having the dream one last time. This time, the vampire is telling her to come to him, as he believes there is nothing left for her here (on earth). After some dream scenes, finally, Charlotte is in the tower with the vampire. Chris (her boyfriend) is there, but the vampire pushes Chris away, and is about to put the bite on her when she utters Chris's name; he at first tells her not to think of Chris and instead think of himself and her as a couple.

Charlotte and Chris wake up in the morning and kiss, and the vampire is destroyed while laying in a sunbeam.

He enters the production studio of the show posing as a tourist, sneaks backstage, and kidnaps the actress [[Marie-Luise Marjan]] (playing herself) at gunpoint. He calls her 'Helga' or 'Frau Beimer', her ''Lindenstraße'' stage-name, and is infatuated with her.  He takes her to an unoccupied castle which belongs to a distant relative of his, and forces her to record a video stating that unless the show ''Lindenstraße'' is renewed, the record of all GEZ TV-licenses will be deleted.  To prove his ability to carry out his threat, he deletes all data pertaining to the town [[Bad Schwartau]].  This however alerts the police to his identity, and after searching his apartment they find a map on which the location of the castle is marked.    Meanwhile, Marie-Luise begins to admire Hase, and is persuaded to support his attempt to save ''Lindenstraße''. They manage to evade capture by the police and drive to the GEZ headquarters, where they lock themselves in the computer room.

In the final scene, set several weeks later, Marie-Luise visits Hase in prison, and offers him an acting role on the show ''Lindenstraße'' after the completion of his custodial sentence.  
Evolver (film)
  Teenage computer whiz Kyle Baxter ([[Ethan Randall]]) participates in a [[Virtuality|virtual reality]] version of [[laser tag]] and is about to win a nationwide tournament, only to be disrupted by another player, a girl named Jamie. Despite his loss, he hacks into the company's system to make himself the winner of the prize: "Evolver" (voiced by [[William H. Macy]]), a robotic opponent armed with a compressed air gun, to compete against in a real-world version of laser tag. Whenever Evolver is defeated, he "evolves", becomes smarter, quicker and harder to beat (to simulate rising game difficulty). Kyle, his friend Zach, Jamie and his sister, Ali begin playing with Evolver, and easily pass the first level. As Evolver evolves, he develops a human-like competitiveness and obsession with winning. He replaces his "ineffective" default ammo - soft [[foam]] balls - with [[ball bearings]] from Kyle's room.  After learning Evolver has recording capabilities, Kyle and Zach send Evolver into the girls locker room at their school. Discovering the robot, the girls push Evolver into the boys locker room. He switches to game mode and enters the boys locker room and sees the only occupant - Dwight, a bullying jock - and makes Dwight another opponent. Dwight throws Evolver against a wall, to which the robot reacts by shooting out one of Dwight's eyes and knocking him down a flight of stairs, killing him.  After getting home, Evolver continues to absorb negativity from his surroundings, for example swearing and hostage-taking from TV. Evolver is defeated again in the second game and "evolves" up to the third round. Zach, wanting to get the disc recording Evolver's adventures in the locker room, takes Evolver to his house and tries to manually remove the disc. Evolver turns on after the disc is removed and begins to attack Zach. Trapping him in his garage, Evolver chases after Zach with a saw blade and ultimately crushes him while Zach hides under a car (raised on a jack). While making his way back to Kyle's house, Evolver wanders into an arcade where two marijuana smoking teens are playing the Evolver virtual game. He electrocutes and kills them both.  Kyle comes to see Zach being loaded into an ambulance. Worried about Evolver's increasing lethality, Kyle looks through its programming and sees a program titled S.W.O.R.D. (acronym for Strategic War-Oriented Robotic Device). He goes to Cybertronix, the company that built Evolver and the virtual reality game, and the creator, Russell Bennett ([[John de Lancie]]), promises to look through the disc Evolver recorded. The disc shows Evolver killing Dwight and the danger becomes clear to Bennett. Meanwhile, Kyle and Jamie sneak into a lab at Cybertronix. Looking into Evolver's past, they learn that he was originally meant to be an AI military robot designed to infiltrate enemy encampments, adapt to the situation and eliminate targets, but the project was terminated.  At home, Ali puts back in Evolver's battery (which was removed by Kyle after learning of Zach's accident) and starts playing with him alone. Evolver loads steak knives into his shooting arm and chases Ali into the backyard swimming pool, attempting to electrocute her while she is trapped. Kyle and Jamie return home and save Ali and Kyle defeats Evolver, only to kick him into the pool, shorting him out. Bennett and two other Cybertronix employees come to Kyle's house and take Evolver back to be dismantled. On the way though, Evolver kills Bennett and the Cybertronix technicians and escapes. He evolves one last time for the final level, charges up at a nearby power plant, and heads back to Kyle's house for one last battle.  Evolver takes Kyle's mother and sister hostage, trapping them inside of a Laser-crafted Cage using a laser-gun, a [[kaleidoscope]], and a super-charged battery. Seeing the wrecked Cybertronix van, Kyle and Jamie return home to find Evolver, now armed with a destructive new laser gun. Evolver plans to execute his hostages if Kyle does not win within 3 minutes. Kyle places a metal pan on his chest, confronts Evolver and feigns death when he is shot by Evolver. Jamie distracts Evolver and Kyle shoots it in the remaining targeting sensor. Defeated, Evolver becomes extremely confused and malfunctions allowing Kyle to beat Evolver with a baseball bat until it shuts down.  After Kyle frees his mother and sister, Evolver re-activates again, now armed with only its arm and brute strength. As he prepares to kill Kyle to avoid losing, Kyle grabs the laser gun with the super-charged battery and shoots Evolver until it explodes. The family and Jamie go to the hospital as Cybertronix's CEO faces the press. The camera pans over to Ali's bedroom, to show Evolver's remains and a single glowing eye. The last scene shows Evolver's HUD screen reading out "KILL NOT CONFIRMED" before fading to static and blacking out.

The freighter, which is owned by criminal Emilio Juantorena ([[Miguel Sandoval]]), is the current base of operations of Ilya Pavel Kazak ([[Steven Berkoff]]), a former KGB agent who has become an international money laundering expert, and has also become the leader of a group of rogue KGB members, including Stefan ([[Gustav Vintas]]), Leonide "Hacker" Volkov ([[Paul Dillon]]), Navigator (Marc Macaulay), Rosa ([[Jenette Goldstein]]) and Zhukov ([[Olek Krupa]]).  When Kate is unintentionally hit by a stray bullet, Miami detective Max Kirkpatrick ([[William Baldwin]]) is assigned to the case. Then an attempt is made on Kate's life by Kazak, who — after killing Juantorena — assembles his team into tracking and killing Kate; Max then becomes her protector.  Kate, Max, and two of his colleagues stay at a hotel. They order pizza, but Volkov traces the order, and Rosa and two henchmen infiltrate the hotel and kill Max's colleagues. Max manages to kill the whole hit squad (except Rosa) and he and Kate then leave. After Max contacts his superior, Lt. Meyerson ([[Christopher McDonald]]), FBI agents are sent to escort them. The "agents" turn out to be henchmen working for Kazak, and Max's partner and long-time friend Detective Louis Aragon ([[John Bedford Lloyd]]) is killed in the process. After killing some of Kazak's men, Max and Kate travel throughout Florida, trying to avoid Kazak and find out why he wants Kate dead.  However, their jeep breaks down on a freeway and they call a tow truck to come pick them up. Volkov and Stefan show up to kill them, while Kazak splits from them to deal with Max's cousin, who has been feeding them information regarding Kazak and his past activities in Cuba. Kate and Max are forced to run with the tow truck while their jeep is still hooked onto it. After a long chase and gunfight, Kate steps hard on the brakes while Max steers the wheel of the truck, unhooking their car and causing it to crash into Volkov's and Stefan's SUV, killing both of them.  One of Kate's clients is the ex-wife of Emilio Juantorena, and she is trying to repossess the boat to pay for her divorce settlement. She stumbled on something about the ship and is the main reason why Kazak and his crew put a target on Kate.  Regardless, Kazak has kidnapped Kate and taken her to the freighter while Rosa and Zhukov are sent to kill Max. They accidentally kill the Navigator and Max shoots both of them. Rosa, however, has a bulletproof vest on, and Max only kills her after a long fight. Max then boards the freighter in an attempt to rescue Kate. Max and Kate blow up the freighter, killing Kazak. They jump off of the boat just in time to watch it blow up and sink. They climb aboard the boat Kirkpatrick used to reach the freighter and start to kiss passionately. As the sun sets they ride off together.  
Falling from the Sky: Flight 174
 Two [[airline pilot]]s experience a sudden loss of power in the two engines of their airliner due to a fuel pump failure and end up crashing shortly afterwards, albeit in a [[flight simulator]]. In complete disbelief that such a scenario could ever happen in real life, they protest to the examiner. He tells them that "It isn't a dream. It happened."()  A few years earlier, on July 23, 1983, at [[Dorval Airport]] in [[Montreal]], the ground crew of Canada World Airways struggles to convert gallons into liters and pounds into kilograms, as they prepare to refuel a brand-new [[Boeing 767]] bound for [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. This is the first aircraft in the fleet to use the [[metric system]] and they are about to make a terrible conversion mistake. Meanwhile, Beth Pearson (Mariette Hartley) drives her husband, Captain Robert Pearson (William Devane), to the airport, unusually anxious about hosting her in-laws later that day. Elsewhere in Montréal, First Officer Maurice Quintal (Scott Hylands) reluctantly agrees to cover for an injured colleague, leaving behind his sick wife.  The two airmen feel uneasy about their 767 having an inoperative fuel gauge, but are somewhat reassured to see the ground crew measuring the quantity of fuel in the tanks: 20,345&nbsp;kg, or so they believe, enough to take them to [[Vancouver]]. Their [[Flight Management Computer]] will constantly indicate the quantity on board. After a delay, the passengers board flight 174, including Rick Dion (Winston Rekert), the airline's chief mechanic, as well as his wife and three-year-old boy.  After takeoff, Dion visits Pearson on the flight deck. Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by a series of beeps indicating a failure with one of the fuel pumps. After activating the cross-feeding valve between the tanks, the alarm stops. Later, another fuel pump fails. Quintal revises the notepad used by the ground crew in Montréal and discovers they loaded 20,345 pounds (instead of kilograms) of fuel, less than half what they should have.   Pearson decides to divert to [[Winnipeg]]. The 767 is still far from that major airport, when suddenly, an alarm sounds, indicating they are out of fuel. It is followed by the failure of the two engines, and the complete shutdown of the [[glass cockpit|instruments]]. Fortunately, a ram air turbine kicks in and provides limited power to the instruments. The aircraft has become a giant [[glider aircraft|glider]]. The passengers face what they believe are their last moments alive.  Luckily, Pearson is a former glider pilot. Quintal suddenly remembers a closer airfield in [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]] and the crew decide to try to land there instead of attempting to reach Winnipeg or land in water. Unknown to them, the airfield's abandoned runway is occupied by race cars and young cyclists, which they have to dodge. The nose [[landing gear]] collapses, yet the aircraft stops within a few meters of the end of the runway. Everyone survives.

They tell her that Hannah was involved in a cult and showed up at their door one day with 3 year old Jennifer/Janie in tow.  Unable to escape the thought that her parents could have kidnapped her, Jennifer/Janie and her friend Reeve (Johnny Green), track down the Sands family and realize she has exactly the same red hair as every member of their family.

Neither Jennifer/Janie nor Stephen are exactly thrilled.  When Jennifer/Janie decides to run away back to the Johnsons, Stephen tracks her down at a bus station and tells her when they were little, they had been at a shoe store with their mother and Jodie, and Stephen was supposed to watch her and hold her hand, but he didn't, which is why Hannah had taken her. Jennifer/Janie says she forgives him.  Jennifer/Janie still decides to return to her adoptive parents. Her father Jonathan, though sad, accepts this while Jodie and Stephen don't. However, Jennifer/Janie tells Jodie they are still and always will be sisters. As Sada and Jennifer/Janie are driving back to the Johnson, she tells her about the day at the shoe store, and Jennifer/Janie says she's sorry she was bad.

Father of the Bride Part II
 The film begins 6 months after the events of the first one, with George Banks telling the audience he is ready for the empty nest he'll shortly receive with all of his children grown up. Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it.  Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. On moving day George and Annie play a game of basketball one last time (what they always did for father and daughter bonding since Annie was a small child). Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the MacKenzies' (Annie's husband Bryan's parents) mansion. The MacKenzies are on vacation in Hawaii, so the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to George's chagrin (still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them).  After a late night between George and Nina, she begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too. Not long after, they have a chance meeting with Franck, Annie's wedding planner, who is elated at both Banks women expecting. George switches gears; now believing he is too old to be a father again. His feelings come to a head when he and Nina go to Annie and Brian's house to announce their news. Nina brings his insensitivity to light and tells him not to come home.  As an apology, George reluctantly hires Franck and his assistant Howard to do the baby shower.  As they are driving home, Nina and George have differing perspectives on the prospect of becoming new parents again. Both express how strange it will be, but begin to welcome the change.  One day when George is out, he notices that the street to their old house is blocked off and sees a demolition crew with a wrecking ball at the house and learns that Mr. Habib plans to demolish it. An upset George runs in and tries to stop them, as the wrecking ball is about to slam into the house. He pleads with Mr. Habib not to tear down the house since he is going to be a father again, as there is great sentimental value to it. He realizes that if he's going to have another child, he wants to raise him/her in the house his family grew up in. When George offers to buy the house back, Habib agrees on the condition that George pay him $100,000 up front. Although reluctant to pay that money, he gives in when Mr Habib is about to send in the wrecking ball. The Banks then move back into their house, right as Bryan is called away to an emergency meeting in Japan.  Meanwhile, Nina and Annie are moving along in their simultaneous pregnancies and need around the clock care from George. Matty takes over when his father George is away at work. Franck turns simple redecoration of Nina and George's new baby's nursery into a full-scale renovation/addition, which he affectionately calls, 'the baby's suite'. Eventually, all the stress and nights of sleep deprivation around Nina and Annie's constant care, and a few times where Annie thought she was going into labor, wear George out. When 'the baby's suite' is revealed, Franck offers George some sleeping pills from his native country called 'Vatsnik ' after George tells him that he has not been getting enough sleep. George unknowingly takes too high of a dosage and suddenly passes out during dinner. The family becomes worried, which is only increased when Annie finally goes into labor.  Franck takes over the role of driving the family to the hospital with a barely coherent George in tow. After being mistaken for a patient in need of a prostate exam, George finally regains full consciousness and goes to see Nina and Annie when Nina goes into labor. George is initially cynical about Dr. Eisenberg, a young female obstetrician, who fills in because the intended physician had to tend to his child who had fractured her arm during camp in Maine. Despite wanting his grandchild to be delivered by the same doctor who delivered his children, George comes to terms with the arrangement. Bryan soon returns to be with Annie, who gives birth to a baby boy, while Nina gives birth to a baby girl, named George and Megan respectively. George finishes telling the story about Nina and Annie's pregnancies. Bryan and Annie then move to Boston with baby George, since Annie took a job there. The film concludes with George standing on the road in front of his house, admiring it with Megan by his side. As he completes the story, he beings walking up the driveway, telling Megan about all the basketball tricks George will teach her.  
Farewell to Nostradamus
  [[Lupin the Third]] and [[Daisuke Jigen]] steal a diamond and hide it in a doll. Though [[Inspector Zenigata]] attempts to catch the two, he fails and they escape on an airplane. While on the plane, a little girl named Julia steals Lupin's doll. Lupin chases her and she leads him to [[Fujiko Mine]], who is chaperoning her. Lupin tries to bargain with Fujiko in an effort to get the doll back, but their conversation is interrupted when the plane is hijacked.  The hijackers land the plane at a nearby airport and request transportation and a million dollar ransom in exchange for the women and children, as well as the [[Brazil National Football Team]] who also boarded the plane. While Fujiko and Julia are allowed to get off the plane, Lupin and Jigen must stay on with the hijackers. Meanwhile, a man named Chris watches the commotion from a distance and activates the bomb the hijackers have using his watch. When the bomb starts counting down, the hijackers become startled and Lupin, Jigen, and the rest of the passengers use this opportunity to fight back and escape from the plane.  During the commotion, Zenigata arrives and makes another attempt to arrest Lupin and Jigen, but he becomes sidetracked when he tries to disarm the bomb. As Lupin and Jigen escape, Julia (still holding the doll) is kidnapped by Chris and his henchmen via helicopter. Fujiko then explains to Lupin and Jigen that Julia is the daughter of Douglas, a nominee for President of the United States and is worth $50,000,000. Meanwhile, a man named Rhisley, the head of a cult known as the Nostradamus Sect, speaks to a crowd of followers. He claims to have a book filled with the lost prophecies of Nostradamus and recites one of the verses which predicted the plane's hijacking.  In actuality, his book is a fake. The real one is in the safe on the top floor of the Earth Building, which belongs to Douglas. Fujiko reveals that she took the job of looking after Julia in order to break into the safe and steal the lost prophecies of Nostradamus. The three travel to the Earth Building and Fujiko meets with Douglas and his wife, Mary, to tell them that Julia has been kidnapped while Lupin and Jigen try to break into the vault. During all of this, Chris makes an appearance on TV and demands that Douglas drop out of the presidential race in exchange for Julia. Douglas refuses, saying that the kidnapping will lead to sympathy for his campaign.  Meanwhile, Lupin and Jigen fail to open the vault and Fujiko is kidnapped by Chris. While driving through the city searching for Fujiko, Lupin and Jigen come across [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] and convince him to join them. Goemon agrees because he is also searching for the lost prophecies. Lupin then makes a plan to get himself arrested and sent to Execution Island, a prison where Lupin's Uncle Philip is kept in. He does this because Philip was the only person who managed to get inside the vault. During Lupin's stay, Chris and the Nostradamus Sect take Uncle Philip and use a machine to get inside his brain and extract the information on how to get into the vault. However, during the process, Philip dies. Lupin takes Philips body and discovers that one of his eyes is fake. He takes it out and keeps it as something to remember him by.  After the mishap, Jigen and Goemon arrive in a helicopter and try to help Lupin escape, but Lupin is shot in the arm by Chris and falls into the ocean. The next day, Lupin wakes up on an island and is being nursed back to health by a boy named Sergio and his grandmother. While on the island, he discovers that Fujiko is there as well, but Sergio's grandmother says that she's really a handmaiden of the Nostradamus Sect named Tanya. Lupin follows Fujiko to a cathedral where the sect is located. When he sneaks in, he finds out that Julia is being kept prisoner there and Fujiko has lost her memory. Before he can find out anything else, Lupin is discovered by the sect and they throw them in a cell.  Meanwhile, Jigen and Goemon believe that Lupin is dead and stake out a black market weapons shop, waiting for Chris. He shows up with some henchmen and they partake in a short battle. Jigen attempts to kill Chris, but he gets away. After the fight, Lupin contacts Jigen with a device hidden in his tooth. He informs Jigen that the Nostradamus Sect is connected to the kidnapping and that he is being held prisoner by them. While this is taking place, Julia cuts off a wrist band that Fujiko is wearing and her memories return. Chris then meets with Rhisley as their plan is revealed. As more people join the Nostradamus Sect, and their lies become the only truths, they plan to gain enough power to have the entire world bow down to them. Rhisley tells Chris that since Douglas won't back down, that Julia isn't of any use to them anymore.  An attempt on Julia's life is made, but Lupin, Fujiko, and Sergio help her escape. As the sect closes in on them, Jigen and Goemon arrive and get them all out of there via helicopter, but Julia is kidnapped once again. They make their way back to the States and try to come up with a plan to get into the vault. Lupin then recalls the fake eye he got from Uncle Philip and thinks that since the security system only recognizes the eyes of Douglas' immediate family, Philip must have used the eye to get into the vault. Meanwhile, the Brazilian Soccer Team is staying in the Earth Building when Chris uses his watch to activate the same wrist bands they're wearing that Fujiko had on earlier. The bands hypnotize them and they place several bombs throughout the building. Goemon discovers what's going on and informs the others about it.  The next day, Rhisley speaks to a crowd of people in front of the Earth Building and informs them that one of the verses states that the skyscraper will explode, leading to the many people inside to evacuate. During the commotion, Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, and Goemon make another attempt to break into the vault. However, Chris goes against Rhisley's plan and enter the building to steal the lost prophecies of Nostradamus for himself. Rhisley chases him with a helicopter to stop him. Chris gets to the vault first and uses Julia to get inside, but the inside of the vault has a defense mechanism which creates the illusion that Chris is falling into an endless abyss. When Lupin and Jigen arrive, Julia gives them the prophecies of Nostradamus, but Rhisley meets them and threatens to kill them if they don't give him the prophecies.  While Chris is still affected by the vault's illusion, he panics and activates the bombs with his watch. The building is severely damaged, but is still able to stand. Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko are separated from Lupin and Julia, but Douglas gets parachutes to all of them and they plan to meet up at the bottom. However, the vault's illusion is disrupted and Chris comes to his senses and attacks Lupin and Julia. As the Earth Building continues to break apart, the vault collapses onto Chris, killing him. Lupin and Julia make their escape and Rhisley falls to his death.  When the disaster is over, Julia is reunited with her family. As Lupin and the others make plans to sell the book of lost prophecies, Goemon discovers that Julia had doodled on several of the pages in the past, so no one would ever buy it. Realizing, that it's now useless, they destroy the book, but Julia returns the diamond to Lupin and they all watch as the Earth Building collapses.  
Feast of July
  The movie opens with Isabella Ford ([[Embeth Davidtz]]) in a pathetic state, traveling alone from Selmouth to Addisford on foot although she will be having a baby in a short while. In a deserted cabin on the way, she gives birth to a stillborn baby. She buries it and continues her journey to Addisford. She arrives there late in the evening and meets Ben Wainwright ([[Tom Bell (actor)|Tom Bell]]), the [[lamplighter]] at Addisford. He asks her about herself and if she has any relatives in Addisford. Bella replies that she does not have any and she came looking for a man by the name of Arch Wilson ([[Greg Wise]]). Ben does not know him and seeing her plight, takes her to his house. He tells his wife ([[Gemma Jones]]) to get Bella washed up. Bella, now clean and dry, sits at the dinner table while Ben introduces his family. Ben has three children. Matty ([[Kenneth Anderson (actor)|Kenneth Anderson]]), Con ([[Ben Chaplin]]) and Jedd ([[James Purefoy]]). Matty, the youngest, is a shoemaker, Jedd is a soldier ([[cavalry]]) and Con does not have a specific profession. He does the household chores and helps his parents around. Throughout the movie, Con is shown to be reserved and introverted with a violent temper, although kind at heart. Bella is unable to eat anything during the dinner, starts crying, and faints when she stands up to go to bed.  Mrs. Wainwright puts Bella to bed and feeds her some [[soup]] after a while. Bella refuses to have more and falls asleep. She wakes up in the midnight and remembers the intimate moments with her lover, Arch. She falls asleep again and wakes up in the morning. From the window, she sees Mr and Mrs. Wainwright seeing off Jedd, who is going back to work. Jedd sees Bella at the window and winks at her. Jedd had already been smitten by Bella during the previous night's dinner. After Jedd is gone, Bella prepares to leave. Mrs. Wainwright gives Bella her daughter's coat and tells her that she died of [[rheumatic fever]], 3 years ago. She asks about Bella's family and learns that she has nowhere to go. She tells her that she can stay and she will have to do her share of household work, if she chooses to stay. She also suggests she fetch [[leather]] from the factory for the shoes. Bella agrees to stay.  That evening, Bella takes some shoes (a present from Arch) to Matty in order to have a sock put in them since they are large for her feet. Matty tells her that it can't be done as the shoes are "cheap Yankee ones" and machine made. Bella is slightly surprised on hearing that the shoes are cheap. Matty tells her that he will make her a new pair. Matty is ambitious and wants to go to [[London]] where handmade shoes fetch a lot of money. The next day, Bella leaves for Aylesburgh to fetch [[leather]]. Con secretly follows Bella and when confronted by her, asks her if she would like to come out with him sometimes. Bella tells him that she has no mind to go out with anyone. Con asks her to forget that he asked her out and leaves.  One day, Jedd arrives and is received at the station by his parents and Bella. Jedd and Bella go for a walk into the woods where Jedd flirts with her and she rejects his advances tactfully. That evening, Jedd and Ben get drunk at the [[pub]]. Arch is also seen at the pub but they don't know him. Late in the evening, Arch drops off Jedd and Ben at their house and drives away before Bella could see him. Jedd continues to flirt will Bella even at the house and Con does not like it. The next day, crop harvest begins and the entire family goes to work in the fields. During the break from work in the afternoon, Jedd insists that Bella (who is sitting under a tree) is not comfortable and takes her to a more shady spot by carrying her in his hands in spite of Bella's polite protests. Jedd also forcefully offers her water and Con, who can't take it anymore, attacks Jedd with a [[scythe]]. Jedd retaliates with a [[Rake (tool)|rake]].  Mrs. Wainwright intervenes and disperses them.  She also scolds Bella as she was the reason for the fight. That night, the squire arranges a dinner party for all the villagers and Bella dances with each of the brothers in turn. During Con's turn, he steps on her foot as he is not a good dancer, hurting her. They get away from the crowd and Bella asks him why he fought Jedd. He tells her that Jedd did not listen to her and continued to offer her water, which made him angry. She requests Con to watch his temper as she does not want any troubles in the family which took her in.  The next day, Bella sees Jedd off at the station and also finds Arch there. She follows him to his house and learns that he is married and has a child. She returns home dejected. She decides to leave Addisford, and Mrs. Wainwright does not protest. When Con arrives home, his mother tells him that Bella is gone. He runs to the station and tries to convince Bella to stay. Bella tells him that she had been with another man and tells about the baby. Con replies that he loves her and her past does not matter. Bella returns home and Mrs. Wainwright receives her coldly. The next day, as they are sitting for breakfast, Mrs. Wainwright announces that Matty had left for [[London]]. During the breakfast, Con suddenly proposes to Bella before his parents. Ben is surprised but Mrs. Wainwright isn't. That day, Con and Bella attend a party where she runs into Arch. He tries to talk to her but she avoids him. The next day, Con takes Bella for boating in the river and there, they meet Arch again. Arch provokes Con by making fun of them and when the bullying gets worse, Con, in a fit of rage, kills Arch in spite of Bella's attempts to stop him.  Both Con and Bella flee Addisford to reach Selmouth. During the night they take refuge in a deserted house far from Addisford. Con is disgusted with himself and scared. Bella comforts him and they make love. The next day, they continue on their way to Selmouth where they will be taking a boat to leave for [[Dublin]]. In Selmouth, Con notices that Bella is acquainted with a lot of men and he becomes suspicious of her. At one point, when he sees Bella taking to the captain of the boat, he has visions of the captain and Bella kissing, laughing at him and he slapping Bella hard on the face. He realizes that he can't live with Bella due to his critical mentality. He tells her that he is going to turn himself in as he can't live with the guilt (the real reason is that he can't live with Bella without hurting her) and asks her to say goodbye. Bella protests violently, but he leaves and turns himself in. On the day of his execution, when Bella comes to visit him, she runs into his family. Mrs. Wainwright tries to attack her, yelling "Damn you! Damn you!!". Bella sees Con for the last time, they don't talk much, but in the end are overcome with emotion and hug each other. Bella bids goodbye to him. Con is hanged as Bella is on the train to Selmouth. In the closing scene, Bella is shown standing on the boat deck, on her way to [[Dublin]]. She touches her stomach and smiles slightly to herself which suggests that she is pregnant with Con's child.  
Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog
 Fifteen-year-old Angus McCormick (Jesse Bradford) lives near a small town in British Columbia, Canada with his parents and eight-year-old brother Silas. Nowadays, he either runs his paper route to earn his savings, learns wilderness survival skills from his father, or spends time with his friends David and Sara (Margot Finley). One afternoon, while gathering up firewood near the house, Angus finds a stray [[Labrador Retriever|Yellow Labrador Retriever]] and begs his parents to let him care of him. Angus' parents, John and Katherine McCormick agree that Angus can keep the stray on the condition that he takes full responsibility in taking care of the dog, whom Angus later names him Yellow.   Several days later, while Angus, his father, and Yellow Dog were traveling along the coast of [[British Columbia]], turbulent waters capsized their boat. John McCormick was rescued by helicopter and transported to a hospital for minor injuries, but Angus and Yellow soon found themselves stranded on the coast far from civilization. While Angus's parents relentlessly badger rescue teams, Angus, schooled by his father in wilderness survival skills, and assisted by the intelligent Yellow Dog, tries to attract rescuers.   Angus sets up a shelter on the rocky shores with his lifeboat and several branches before checking on the supplies he manages to retrieve from his father's capsized boat. The only supplies he has include a box of matches, some fishing hooks and tackle, and a box of cookies that his girlfriend Sara had made for him. Angus catches a fish for supper and digs for clams on the shoreline with his dog Yellow. But after spending nine days on the shores without much luck attracting rescue teams and with little food left to sustain themselves, Angus realizes that he and Yellow must move on to reach civilization on their own. With the nearest lighthouse located about twenty miles south through the rugged wilderness of British Columbia, Angus decides to take the challenge and begins his journey across one of the largest wildernesses in Canada.  While spending a cold, rainy night in a makeshift shelter, Angus and his dog Yellow find themselves under attack by a pack of wolves. While Yellow chases off one wolf and engages in a fight with a second wolf, Angus finds himself confronted by a third wolf. He fends off the wolf for a moment before crawling away to safety, but the wolf turns and goes after Angus again. Before the wolf reaches Angus, Yellow appears and chases the wolf off. Yellow then leads a relieved Angus away to safety through the rainstorm.  Over the next several days, Angus struggles to find food to sustain himself and Yellow. In addition to the box of Sara's homemade cookies, Angus gathers grubs, berries, wild edible plants, and roots to eat. He even catches a small [[deer mouse]] in a makeshift trap and shares it with Yellow, but it's not enough to stave off their hunger. Besides starvation, other dangers test Angus' and Yellow's ability to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Rainstorms and cold temperatures tear at them day and night, forcing Angus to build a fire to keep himself and Yellow warm. One day, Angus slips and tumbles down a cliff, breaking his left wrist in the process. Later that same day, Angus finds himself at the edge of a large lake and spots the lighthouse positioned on a hill on the other side. He builds a raft out of branches, logs, and sticks, and with the aid of his dog is able to paddle across to the opposite shore.  Angus and Yellow eventually reach the lighthouse, but find it deserted and with no additional food or supplies to sustain them. Angus soon discovers a logging road running down the side of another hill several miles away and decides to head over there in the hopes of finding someone to help them. The following day, Yellow brings back a [[snowshoe hare]] to Angus, who kills it with a stick and cooks it for their supper. After a good meal and a rest, Angus and Yellow continue on their journey but soon find themselves looking down a narrow gorge with a running river below them. Angus soon finds a fallen tree across the top of the gorge and decides to cross it, but he and Yellow soon discover that the other side is blocked off by other fallen trees.  Just as Angus and Yellow begin to give up hope, a plane flies overhead and soon spots them on the tree. The pilot informs the rescue teams of his discovery, and a rescue helicopter is dispatched to pick up the boy and dog. Angus is relieved when the helicopter arrives to pick him and Yellow up. One of the rescue members is lowered down and manages to grab hold of Angus, who tells him to get his dog. The man promises to return for the dog, but unbeknownst to him and Angus, Yellow attacks the man by biting down on his leg. As Angus and the man are lifted back up to the helicopter, Yellow is accidentally knocked off the tree and falls down the gorge into the river below. The team promises Angus that they will return for his dog, but with the winds picking up speed, the helicopter is forced to transport Angus over to a nearby hospital and leave Yellow behind. Yellow eventually survives the fall and manages to swim to shore with only an injured hind leg, but he is left behind to fend for himself.  Though Angus was happily reunited with his family, he was disappointed for leaving Yellow behind. The rescue teams spend the next few days afterwards searching for Yellow, but were unsuccessful in finding any trace of the dog. Because of the tight budget issues they were facing after searching for more than three weeks, the search teams decided to call off the search. Saddened and betrayed, Angus blames himself for losing Yellow but refuses to give up hope that his dog is still alive. His family pitches in to help him find Yellow, putting up posters all over town and even searching different areas of the wilderness around their property for Yellow. One afternoon, while walking home from school, Angus' girlfriend Sara eventually cheers him up a little by kissing him. Later that day, Angus blows his [[dog whistle]] one last time and an exhausted Yellow appears in the middle of the field behind the house. He and his family all rejoice over the return of Yellow, who has finally returned home.

First Knight
 The film's opening text establishes that King Arthur (Sean Connery) of Camelot, victorious from his wars, has dedicated his reign to promoting justice and peace and now wishes to marry. However, Malagant (Ben Cross), a [[Knights of the Round Table|Knight of the Round Table]], desires the throne for himself and rebels.  The film opens with Lancelot (Richard Gere) a vagabond and skilled swordsman, dueling in small villages for money. Lancelot attributes his skill to his lack of concern whether he lives or dies. Guinevere (Julia Ormond) the ruler of Lyonesse, decides to marry Arthur partly out of admiration and partly for security against Malagant, who is shown raiding a village. While traveling, Lancelot chances by Guinevere's carriage on the way to Camelot, and helps spoil Malagant's ambush meant to kidnap her. He falls in love with Guinevere, who refuses his advances. Though Lancelot urges her to follow her heart, Guinevere remains bound by her duty. She is subsequently reunited with her escort.  Later, Lancelot arrives in Camelot and successfully navigates an obstacle course on the prospect of a kiss from Guinevere, though he instead kisses her hand. He also wins an audience with her husband-to-be, Arthur. Impressed by Lancelot's courage and struck by his recklessness and freewheeling, Arthur shows him the Round Table which symbolizes a life of service and brotherhood, and warns Lancelot that a man "who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing".  That night, Malagant's henchmen arrive at Camelot and kidnap Guinevere. She is tied up and carried off to Malagant's headquarters, where she is held hostage. Lancelot poses as a messenger to Malagant only to escape with Guinevere and return her to Camelot. Once again, Lancelot tries to win her heart, but is unsuccessful. On the return journey, it is revealed that Lancelot was orphaned and rendered homeless after bandits attacked his village, and has been wandering ever since.  In gratitude, Arthur offers Lancelot a higher calling in life as a Knight of the Round Table. Amidst the protests of the other Knights (who are suspicious of his station) and of Guinevere (who struggles with her feelings for him) Lancelot accepts and takes Malagant's place at the Table, saying he has found something to care about. Arthur and Guinevere are subsequently wedded. However, a messenger from Lyonesse arrives, with news that Malagant has invaded. Arthur leads his troops to Lyonesse and successfully defeats Malagant's forces. Lancelot wins the respect of the other Knights with his prowess in battle. He also learns to embrace Arthur's philosophy, moved by the plight of villagers.  Lancelot feels guilty about his feelings for the queen and loyalty to Arthur and in private announces his departure to her. She cannot bear the thought of him leaving and asks him for a kiss, which turns into a passionate embrace, just in time for the king to interrupt. Though Guinevere claims to love both Arthur and Lancelot – albeit in different ways – the two are charged with treason. The open trial in the great square of Camelot is interrupted by a surprise invasion by Malagant, ready to burn Camelot and kill Arthur if he does not swear [[fealty]]. Instead Arthur commands his subjects to fight, and Malagant's men shoot him with crossbows. A battle between Malagant's men and Camelot's soldiers and citizens ensues, and Lancelot and Malagant face off. Disarmed, Lancelot seizes Arthur's fallen sword and kills Malagant, who falls dead on that same throne he so desired. The people of Camelot win the battle, but Arthur dies of his wounds. On his deathbed, he asks Lancelot to "''take care of her for me''" – referring to both Camelot and Guinevere. The film closes with a funeral raft carrying Arthur's body floating out to sea, which is set aflame.

 Bob de Rooy is an arrogant, egotistical man who divorces his well-meaning, but very naïve wife Annie, because she's unable to provide him the right amount of sex in their married life. After the divorce is settled, Bob goes to the red light district in Amsterdam to catch up what he has been missing all those years.

Fluke (film)
 Fluke is a mutt puppy (a wrong colored Golden Retriever, played by dog actor Comet, voiced by [[Sam Gifaldi]]), who has flashing memories and dreams of having lived a human life. After being taken to a pound and eventually escaping, he is raised by an elderly homeless woman named Bella ([[Collin Wilcox Paxton]]), who gives him the name Fluke, stating that he is "a fluke by nature, and by name."   After Bella dies of an illness due to poor conditions, Fluke meets a street-wise dog named Rumbo (voiced by [[Samuel L. Jackson]]) who takes him to see a man named Bert ([[Bill Cobbs]]) who feeds Fluke and Rumbo. Fluke matures into an adult dog (now voiced by [[Matthew Modine]]) and eventually realizes that he was once a man named Thomas P. Johnson (also portrayed by Matthew Modine), who died in a [[car crash]].   Fluke is then abducted by a man named Sylvester ([[Ron Perlman]]) to be used in makeup experiments at a [[cosmetics]] company. During his captivity, Rumbo comes to the rescue, and Rumbo is shot by Sylvester, as he and Fluke escape. A dying Rumbo tells Fluke that the black-and-white snapshot of a man in a sailor suit on Bert's wall was him and Bert was his brother and that he wishes to smell the sea again, suggesting that he died in the line of duty.  After Rumbo's death, Fluke seeks out his wife Carol ([[Nancy Travis]]) and son Brian ([[Max Pomeranc]]) and reunites with them by becoming their new family dog.   He suspects that his human death was caused by his former business partner Jeff Newman ([[Eric Stoltz]]) and viciously attacks him when he visits the house, and ends up getting put outside. During his life as a dog, he gets to know his family better and regrets his decisions as a workaholic.  Fluke comes close to killing Jeff by causing him to get into a car accident that ends up with him being injured, but has a flashback and realizes that Jeff wasn't responsible for his death, in fact he was only trying to save him but in vain.  Instead, his death was caused by his own anger and recklessness.   Fluke eventually manages to show his wife who he really is by digging away the snow covering the word "forever" at the bottom of his tombstone, something that in his human life, he would often say to his wife. She is shocked, but understanding, and with a heavy heart, he decides to leave and never return. He realized that life is simply meant to be cherished, regardless of how one lives it.  Far away and sometime later, Fluke is resting under a tree on a farm by himself. To his surprise and happiness, he is reunited with Rumbo, now reincarnated as a [[squirrel]]. Rumbo  tells Fluke about life as a squirrel and about reincarnation.  
The Flower of My Secret
 Leocadia ("Leo") Macías ([[Marisa Paredes]]), a woman writing popular romance novels under the pen name Amanda Gris. Unlike her romantic ("pink") novels, her own love life is troubled.  Leo has a difficult relationship with her husband Paco ([[Imanol Arias]]), a military officer stationed in Brussels and later in Bosnia, who is distant both physically and emotionally. The film starts with Leo writing about the feeling of having lost her lover, a feeling that she compares to the pain of a tight pair of boots that she can't take off. Almodovar took for this first part of the film strong plot elements from [[Dorothy Parker]]'s short story ''[[The Lovely Leave]]''<ref name="about1"></ref>  Leo begins to change the direction of her writing, wanting to focus more on darker themes such as pain and loss, and can no longer write her Amanda Gris novels. However, her publishers demand sentimental happy endings, at least until her contract is up. She begins to re-evaluate her life through her relationship with her publishers, her husband, her best friend Betty ([[Carme Elías]]), her "crab-faced" sister Rosa ([[Rossy de Palma]]) and her bickering elderly mother ([[Chus Lampreave]]).  Only her maid (played by flamenco dancer Manuela Vargas) appears steadfast. She also meets Ángel ([[Juan Echanove]]), a newspaper editor who quickly falls for Leo and her writing.  After having signed a contract with the newspaper [[El País]], Leo tells Ángel that she can't write romances anymore, and that she has written a dark ("black") novel about a young mother whose daughter kills her husband because he tried to rape her. After that, the corpse of the dead man is hidden in a refrigerator. Although Leo throws this story out, she later learns that someone is turning it into a movie. (In fact, Almodóvar himself created a movie based on this same plot, "[[Volver]]", released eleven years later in 2006.)  After the inevitable disintegration of her marriage and then learning that her best friend was her husband's lover, Leo takes and survives an overdose, then goes with her mother to the village of Almagro to rest and recover. There she receives a call from her publishers, who are apparently delighted by the two manuscripts they have received from her — romances Leo never wrote or submitted. She returns to Madrid and learns that Ángel is her ghostwriter. More surprises unfold when she attends a brilliant dance performance featuring her maid, Manuela Vargas, and [[Joaquín Cortés]], who plays the maid's son, Antonio. Antonio soon confesses that he is the one who took her manuscript now being made into a movie. A final surprise for Leo: after a false start, she finds love with the smitten Ángel, and the film ends with the tenuous promise of a "new year".

Forget Paris
 At a restaurant in [[New York City]], Andy prepares to introduce his friends to his fiancée, Liz. As the couple waits for the rest of the party to arrive, Andy tells Liz the story of how his friends Mickey and Ellen came to fall in love. As each of Andy's friends arrive, more of the story is unfolded.  Mickey Gordon is a [[National Basketball Association]] referee who honors his recently deceased father's wishes by burying him at the resting site of his [[World War II]] [[United States Army|Army]] platoon in [[France]], of which he was the sole survivor, but the plans are delayed after the airline misplaces the casket.  Ellen Andrews, an airline employee from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] working in [[Paris]], assists Mickey in locating and retrieving the casket. She surprises Mickey by attending the burial so he won't be alone. Mickey rides back to Paris with Ellen, and the two get to know each other along the way. Mickey decides to delay his return trip to the United States to spend time with Ellen. The two fall in love, but Mickey is forced to return for the beginning of the NBA season.  Mickey's loneliness leads him to lose his temper during a nationally televised game. Mickey is suspended by the NBA for a week. During the suspension, he returns to Paris to see Ellen. Mickey learns Ellen is married but separated, and is unsure if she and her husband will get back together. While Mickey is in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] to referee a game, Ellen arrives to meet him and reveals that she has gotten a divorce. Having quit her job in France, Ellen marries Mickey. After a [[honeymoon]] period spent on the road during the NBA season, the couple settles in the [[San Fernando Valley]] outside Mickey's hometown of [[Los Angeles]].  When the next basketball season begins, Ellen takes an entry-level customer service job with [[American Airlines]], while Mickey travels with the NBA. Hating her new job and only seeing Mickey a few days each month, Ellen becomes lonely and depressed. She asks Mickey to quit his job; he compromises by taking a one-year [[leave of absence]] and briefly working as a car salesman. Ellen  gets promoted and climbs the corporate ladder, leaving Mickey at home to tend to her father, Arthur.  Mickey, unhappy at home with Arthur, decides to return early to the NBA. He comes home from a road trip to find Ellen gone. Before he can read her note, she arrives and explains that she had simply returned to Kansas to deliver Arthur to her siblings so she and Mickey can be alone and repair their marriage.  Ellen approaches Mickey and says she has been offered a transfer to [[Dallas]]. Mickey refuses to move away from California, so Ellen takes the airline's other offer of a transfer to Paris. Now separated, the two are seemingly content in their original arrangements: Mickey traveling with the NBA, and Ellen working for an airline in Paris. It is obvious to all of their friends that they miss each other's company.  At the restaurant, Andy's friends have caught Liz up to date, with the latest development coming four months prior. A basketball fan enters the restaurant and informs the group of an odd occurrence during the traditional singing of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" prior to that night's [[New York Knicks]] game at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Mickey decides to go [[wikt:Special:Search/AWOL|AWOL]] from his job and immediately return to Paris to find Ellen. Before he can make it across the basketball court, he spots Ellen in the arena. The two meet and reconcile at mid-court, and as the arena lights come on after the anthem, the entire crowd sees the two kissing. Mickey and Ellen arrive at the restaurant together and re-tell Liz the story of their relationship.

Flodder 3
 Living in Zonnedael for a while now, the Flodder family continues their usual antisocial behaviour; Ma Flodder regularly gets in trouble with the neighbors, her sons Johnnie and Kees are on welfare and spend their time supplementing their income with [[petty crime]]. Daughter Kees acts rather promiscuously and the youngest children Toet and Henkie commit extreme mischief (bordering on vandalism) around the neighborhood, often involving their older grandpa in their acts. The family's dog Whisky is vicious and aggressive and loud parties keep the neighbors awake.  As celebrations for the 25th anniversary of Zonnedael draw closer, the organisation of the festivities, fearing that the Flodder family will ruin the party, grows more and more desperate and uses every methode they can think of to get rid of them. One of them uses his daughter Mirjam to spy on Sjakie, the civil servant who aids the family on the government's behalf. In doing so they discover that in order for the Flodders to stay in Zonnedael the government has set up some official terms. For example, criminal activities and family expansion are prohibited and upon learning this, chairman Van Brandwijk in particular tries to come up with whatever he can to force the family to leave. In the midst of this all Ma Flodder gets romantically involved with a [[hobo]].  At first they try to frame the Flodders for stealing cars by having a nephew drive one of their cars to the Flodder residence and then calling the police, saying their car was stolen. The plan fails when son Kees Flodder discovers the car in front of his home and decides to take a ride in it. While driving he hears the sound of approaching police sirens and quickly parks the car on the driveway of the closest residence, unbeknownst to him, this residence happens to be owned by the original owner of the car, therefore making it look like the car was never stolen in the first place.  A second plan is set in motion and involves accusing daughter Kees of illegal prostitution. A call is made to Kees, promising a role as a prostitute in an adult movie. The same nephew from the first plan goes to pick her up but drops her off at a [[red light district]] instead of a movie set, where Van Brandwijk is waiting with a videocamera to try and capture incriminating evidence. When daughter Kees tries to hitch a ride home, it would then appear as if she is soliciting. However this plan fails as well when it becomes clear that the person offering her a ride turns out to be the accountant of the festival committee, which they obviously don't want to discredit.  The third plan involves trying to catch the Flodder family on the count of family expansion. The committee tracks down a man who is presumably the father of daughter Kees and promises him to help clean up his criminal past if he agrees to move in with the Flodder family to help frame them. A story is concocted that the man inherited a large fortune, which upon hearing, makes family member Johnnie well receptive to the fact of his long lost stepfather returning. Ma Flodder however, kicks the man out the door because she decided long ago that she never wanted to see the man again, Immediately after, she announces her engagement with the hobo. This announcement turns out favorably for Van Brandwijk's plan.  Meanwhile, Sjakie finds out Mirjam's true intentions and upon learning about the term about the ban on family expansion, tries to stop the marriage between Ma Flodder and the hobo. His efforts are to no avail, since Ma Flodder wants to marry anyway. At the last moment, during the wedding ceremony, it becomes clear that the hobo already has two children who are now at the ceremony protesting the marriage. At this point it's revealed that the man isn't really a hobo but in fact a billionaire. Ma Flodder feels betrayed and dumps her fiancee on the spot.  In all the commotion that follows, Sjakie forgets to arrange the rental payments on the house in time and the Flodders are under threat of being [[Eviction|evicted]]. They gather all their friends and a massive fight ensues between them on one side and the rest of the neighborhood and the police on the other. Sjakie shows up and makes the announcement that the Flodders are not evicted until their house is sold, which eventually ends the fight. On top of that he has managed to arrange [[subsidy]] to bid on the house on behalf of the city council.  When the house is put up for sale in a [[Foreclosure#Foreclosure auction|public auction]], Van Brandwijk desperately tries to outbid Sjakie. This leads to a lot of annoyance among the other members of the festival committee who have grown tired of Van Brandwijk's obsession to drive out the Flodders from the area. Eventually, the house is bought by Ma Flodder's ex-fiancee, who gives the house back to the Flodder family, thereby ensuring that there's no more legal avenue to get the Flodders evicted.  As the Flodders (including Sjakie, who's now romantically involved with Mirjam) celebrate their victory that night, Van Brandwijk is thrown out of the committee. This causes him to engage in more drastic measures and he steals a fuel truck, and tries to drive it directly into the home of the Flodders. At the very last moment the truck collides with grandpa's wheelchair (who turns out to be able to walk afterall and escapes just in time) missing the Flodder residence and hitting the adjacent house. A chain reaction of events is set in motion, partially caused by all the decorations across town in preparation for Zonnedael's anniversary, causing the entire town to burn down. With the exception of the home of the Flodder family, which wasn't decorated for the festival at all.  
French Kiss (1995 film)
 A fastidious and wholesome history teacher named Kate (Ryan) is living in Canada with her fiancé, Charlie ([[Timothy Hutton]]), a dentist. While waiting for her Canadian citizenship to come through, Kate has been busy planning their wedding and the purchase of their first house, complete with a white picket fence. When Charlie urges her to accompany him to [[Paris]] for an upcoming conference, she declines due to her fear of flying and her general intolerance for cheese, secondhand smoke, and the French.  A few days later, Kate's plans for the future are crushed when she receives a phone call from Charlie, who informs her that he has fallen in love with a beautiful French "goddess" named Juliette ([[Susan Anbeh]]) and that he will not be returning. Determined to win him back, Kate boards a flight to Paris and is seated next to a crude Frenchman, Luc Teyssier (Kline), whose every word seems to annoy her. Unknown to Kate, Luc is smuggling a vine cutting and a stolen diamond necklace into France, hoping to use both to start his own vineyard. With the help of a few drinks, Kate is able to tolerate her "rude" and "hygiene-deficient" seating partner long enough to arrive safely in Paris. Before deboarding, Luc sneaks the vine and necklace into Kate's bag, knowing she will not be searched at customs.  At the terminal, Luc is spotted by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon ([[Jean Reno]]), who insists on giving him a ride during which he searches his bag. Jean-Paul knows of Luc's vocation, but feels "protective" of him because Luc once saved his life. Meanwhile, Kate arrives at the [[Four Seasons Hotel George V|Hôtel George V]], where she encounters new levels of French sarcasm and rudeness from the [[concierge]] ([[:fr:Laurent Spielvogel]]). While waiting in the lobby with a petty thief named Bob ([[François Cluzet]]), Kate sees Charlie and Juliette kissing in a descending elevator and faints. Bob steals her bag and leaves just as Luc arrives. After reviving Kate, Luc realizes that Bob now has the necklace, goes with Kate to Bob's apartment, and recovers the bag, absent her money and passport.  Upset with Luc, Kate heads off on her own, and learns that Charlie is traveling south to Cannes to meet Juliette's parents. Luc, meanwhile, realizes that the necklace must still be in Kate's bag. He tracks her down to the train station, offers to help her "win back Charlie", and together they board a train to Cannes. After lactose-intolerant Kate samples some of the 452 [[List of French cheeses|official government cheeses of France]], she becomes sick, and they get off the train at Luc's hometown of La Ravelle in [[Paulhaguet]], where they stay at his family home and vineyard. Kate learns about Luc's past and how he gambled away his vineyard birthright to his brother in a single hand of poker; she also learns that while he may be a schemer, he knows a lot about wine, and dreams of someday buying land for his own winery. As they board the train to Cannes, Kate shows him that she, in fact, has the necklace.  At Cannes, the two check into a room at the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton Hotel]] using a stolen credit card. Following Luc's advice, Kate confronts Charlie in front of Juliette on the beach, pretending to be indifferent to him. To make him jealous, Luc pretends to be Kate's lover, and the deception works. Later that afternoon, Jean-Paul approaches Kate and urges her to convince Luc to return the necklace anonymously to avoid jail. Luc was planning to sell the necklace at [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]], but agrees to Kate's "new plan" to have her sell the necklace, as that would be safer. At dinner, Charlie apologizes to Kate and accompanies her to her room, where he tries to seduce her. Rejecting his advances, Kate realizes she no longer wants him, and that she has fallen in love with Luc. Meanwhile, in an effort to "ensure victory" for her, Luc takes an all-too-willing Juliette to bed, but his plan fails when he calls her "Kate".  The following morning, Kate tells Luc that Charlie wants her back, but quickly leaves the room, saying, "Cartier is waiting". She returns the necklace to Jean-Paul and purchases a Cartier check for $45,782 with her own savings to create the illusion that she sold it. After giving the check to Luc, she leaves for the airport pretending to meet Charlie. Soon after, Jean-Paul approaches Luc and reveals the charade and all that Kate has done for him. Luc rushes to the airport, boards the plane, and confesses that he is in love with her and wants her to stay with him. Sometime later, Kate and he embrace in their beautiful new vineyard.  
Four Rooms
  The film is set on [[New Year's Eve]], and starts with Sam ([[Marc Lawrence]]), the previous [[bellhop]] of the Hotel Mon Signor, briefing his replacement, Ted ([[Tim Roth]]), about the job.  The film's animated [[opening credits]] are inspired by the cartoons of ''[[The Pink Panther Show]]'', and feature the [[scat singing|scat]] song "[[Vertigogo]]" by Combustible Edsion.  ===Honeymoon Suite - "The Missing Ingredient"=== *Written and directed by [[Allison Anders]] Ted assists a number of unusual women with their luggage, which he takes up to the Honeymoon Suite. He learns they are a [[coven]] of witches, attempting to create a potion to reverse a spell cast on their goddess, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ([[Amanda De Cadenet]]) 40 years ago. In order to create it, they each must place an ingredient into a large cauldron in a ritual. However, one ([[Ione Skye]]) has still to retrieve her ingredient - [[semen]] - which she is told she must retrieve in one hour. She manages to seduce an initially reluctant Ted and has sex with him in the cauldron. After he leaves, they complete the ritual and Diana is seen emerging from the cauldron.  ====Ted's phone call with the party guest==== At the end of the segment, a guest from a hotel room party ([[Lawrence Bender]]) calls Ted at the front desk to get some ice. He is unsure about which floor the room is on, but eventually directs Ted to Room 404.  ===Room 404 - "The Wrong Man"=== *Written and directed by [[Alexandre Rockwell]] Upon arriving at Room 404, Ted finds himself in the middle of a fantasy hostage situation between a husband and wife. Sigfried ([[David Proval]]), the husband, maniacally accuses Ted (whom he calls Theodore) of having slept with his wife, Angela ([[Jennifer Beals]]). At gunpoint, Ted is made to participate in the scenario, with uncertainty about what is real and part of the fantasy. At one point, he is stuck in the bathroom window and the party guest from the beginning of the segment appears in the one above, uttering the word "ice" and vomiting. Eventually, Ted escapes just as a different party guest (Paul Skemp) appears, looking for Room 404 and is greeted by Sigfried in the same manner as Ted at the beginning of the segment.  ====Ambiguity of room number==== It is not fully clear if these events take place in Room 404 or 409. The party guests' room is on the above floor, which suggests Sigfried's room is indeed Room 404. Adding to this uncertainty, the door reads "40-", with a faint outline of what appears to be a missing "4" or "9". However, Sigfried answers the phone at one point, which is later revealed to be a call connecting to Room 409.  ===Room 309 - "The Misbehavers"=== *Written and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]]  A husband ([[Antonio Banderas]]) and wife ([[Tamlyn Tomita]]) go out to a New Year's Eve party and leave their two children, Sarah and Juancho (Lana McKissack and Danny Verduzco), in the hotel. Ted is paid $500 to keep an eye on them by their stern father, who orders them not to misbehave. As Ted is responsible for the entire hotel he can't actually stay in the room with them, but instead instructs them to do so and watch television. After he leaves, they soon begin to squabble and proceed to both explore and vandalize the room, and manage to explode a bottle of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] in the process. They call Ted for toothbrushes, at which point he arrives and attempts unsuccessfully to put them to bed by putting ointment on their eyelids. After they wash them and summon him back once more, he arrives at a scene of mass chaos: a painting in the room, which they use to play darts with a syringe, has a target scribbled on it with lipstick, Juancho has a cigarette in his mouth, Sarah has a bottle of liquor in her hand, the television is set to an [[Pornography|adult channel]], and they have found the corpse of a dead prostitute ([[Patricia Vonne]]) stuffed in the box spring. While Ted tries to quell the chaos, Sarah stabs him in the leg with the syringe when he repeatedly uses the word "whore" and Juancho accidentally sets the room on fire with his cigarette. At this point, their father arrives, carrying his passed-out wife, and, looking around the room, asks Ted, "Did they misbehave?"  ====Ted's phone call with Betty==== After the events of Room 309, an unsettled Ted calls his boss, Betty ([[Kathy Griffin]]), to quit. After a prolonged conversation with Margaret ([[Marisa Tomei]]), he gets Betty on the phone and quits, but a call from the penthouse comes in. Betty reasons with him and convinces him to tend to their needs, due to the importance of continued Hollywood business to the hotel.  ===Penthouse - "The Man from Hollywood"=== *Written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]] The penthouse is currently being occupied by the famous director Chester Rush (Tarantino) and a group of his friends, which includes Angela from ''The Wrong Man''. The party requests a block of wood, a doughnut, a ball of twine, three nails, a club sandwich, a bucket of ice, and an extremely sharp hatchet (Rush specifically requests a hatchet "as sharp as the Devil himself"). After getting acquainted with Chester and his friends, Ted is asked to take part in a challenge: Chester's friend, Norman ([[Paul Calderón]]), has bet he can light his [[Zippo]] cigarette lighter ten times in a row. If he succeeds, Norman will win Chester's car, but if he fails, Norman's pinky will be cut off. Ted is asked to "wield the hatchet" and cut off Norman's pinky, should he fail. He initially tries to leave, but Chester persuades him to stay by offering $100 up front and another $1,000 if he performs his assigned role. Norman's lighter fails on the first try, and Ted chops off his pinky, sweeps up all the money, and leaves the penthouse with an energetic step. While the credits are rolling, Chester and company are seen frantically getting ready to take a screaming, agonized Norman to the hospital.

Jesse and his adoptive parents are preparing to go on a family camping trip to the Pacific Northwest. Glen has been trying to teach Jesse to drive their motorboat, but Jesse is more interested in girls. Before they leave town, however, Dwight, Jesse's former social worker, shows up to inform them that they have found Jesse's biological mother, who abandoned him 8 years ago. Jesse's mother has died and left behind another son, Jesse's 8-year old half-brother named Elvis ([[Francis Capra]]).

Elvis spies on the two, but at the same time, forms a bond with Willy's brother Little Spot.  As they continue to enjoy their camping trip, an [[oil tanker]] runs aground and [[oil spill|spills oil]] into the ocean due to an engine failure, trapping the three young killer whales in a small cove. When word gets out that the orcas are trapped and Luna is dying from the oil in her lungs, John Milner, the CEO of the [[petroleum industry|oil company]] ([[Jon Tenney]]), arrives and announces a plan to move the orcas into captivity where they can recover from their injuries.

On Jesse's signal, Willy is able to break the boon and leads his siblings out of the cove. However, an explosion on the tanker results in the crude oil in the water catching fire. Despite the danger, the three whales are able swim under the flaming oil to safety. Having followed the whales to ensure they got safely past the oil, Jesse, Nadine and Elvis fall into danger when they take their boat into another cove to avoid the flaming oil, hitting a rock and beginning to sink while the flames seal off the cove.  At the same time, Glen, Annie and Randolph search for the three in Randolph's boat with Randolph sending a [[distress signal]] that summons the Costal Marine Patrol to the trio's aid. A search and rescue helicopter is able to extract Elvis and Nadine safely, but Jesse slips out of the harness and falls back into the ocean. With smoke choking the helicopter's engine, it is forced to leave Jesse behind. Jesse nearly drowns but is rescued by Willy who returns for his friend.

The Four Corners of Nowhere
 Duncan (Mark McClain Wilson), a philosophical [[nomad]] [[hitchhiking]] across [[United States|America]], grabs a ride to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] from Toad (Eric Vesbit) — a performance artist and purple leisure slacks enthusiast from the suburbs. Toad has recently left his home town to begin a new life in Ann Arbor where his co-dependent, folk-singing sister Jenny (Amy Raasch) lives with her verbally abusive fiancé, a law student named Calvin (Aaron Williams). Jenny currently sees a suicidal therapist (Peter Hawkins) four times a week and armed with her acoustic guitar, drives away patrons from a local coffee house where she slings cappuccinos with her best friend Squeeze (Melissa Zafarana). Squeeze is a closet genius whose easy-going outlook and unconditional support keep her live-in boyfriend Hank (David Wilcox) from the brink. Hank is a painter who cannot paint because he spends his time baking delicious pastries and practicing for The Oprah Winfrey Show. In Ann Arbor, the civilians listen to Julian (Julian Rad), a nihilistic dee-jay whose frustration and lingering optimism goad him to find the truth by cutting through blind idealism, pop culture, and politically correct bumper stickers. Once in Ann Arbor, Duncan encounters these and other eccentric characters, and through his simple outlook and curiosity, he changes their lives forever.  ''Duncan's Letter to Julian in "The Four Corners of Nowhere":  Dear Julian,  I think it all started with the Declaration of Independence — the idea that we had the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That pursuit is what took America from the revolution to the computer age in 200 years. But the progress has come at a price. The obvious being the people that were exploited to make it possible; the not so obvious being us, the first group of people that were given no obvious frontiers to conquer.  We hear stories about the good old days that don't seem to apply anymore. It's a generation gap that leaves us without role models. But the bright side is that without role models, there are no roles. Thirty years ago that girl you talked to probably would have married her fiancé because it would have been expected, but she ended up leaving him. Maybe that's what the 60s were all about — getting rid of the roles.  But what do we replace them with? Without any guidance, the choices become overwhelming. Sometimes it just makes everything feel hopeless.  So we destroy our bodies in the search of an ideal. Try to salvage relationships that don't work. We feel we must do something, instead of doing something that we feel. It is the prison of self-imposed momentum, and the sad part is that we get used to it. It reminds me of a song I heard the other day. It's called "The Going Nowhere Fast."  But the people I have met here have shown me another side of Nowhere. They've pointed out the beautiful irony that stagnation makes it easy to stop and smell the roses, if we just let it.  What would we be if we had nothing to rebel against? Well we could finally be ourselves, the first group of people who stopped looking for the answers long enough to appreciate the questions. And all we have to do is to make our own Declaration of Independence. We can embrace the right to life and liberty by simply realizing that happiness exists — not to pursue, but to accept. After that the only challenge would be to make sure with the rest of our lives that we weren't just another fad.  I don't know, Julian, it's an idea.''

Not having any plans, he hangs out on his front porch with his best friend, Smokey, a carefree, mischievous drug dealer who sells weed for Big Worm, the psychopathic neighborhood supplier.  Throughout the day, Craig and Smokey observe the goings-on in their neighborhood. They encounter Ezail, who supports his drug habit with petty crime; Debbie, an attractive girl Craig has an interest in; Craig's neighbor, Stanley, whose wealth-like supercilious attitude bemuses Craig; Red, Craig's former co-worker and childhood friend whose bike and necklace have been forcibly taken by Deebo, the neighborhood bully and also enlists Smokey's aid in a burglary of Stanley's house; Pastor Clevor, the neighborhood pastor, who is caught sleeping with Mrs. Parker by her husband Mr. Parker; and Felisha, Debbie's sister and Deebo's girlfriend, who irritates everyone in the neighborhood with her constant begging.  Smokey, who has been smoking rather than selling his consignment of marijuana, has a confrontation with Big Worm. In an attempt to explain his money shortage, Smokey incriminates Craig. Big Worm threatens to kill them both if they do not give him $200 by 10:00 P.M. Craig angrily confronts Smokey about his lack of initiative in selling the marijuana before deciding to help Smokey. Craig unsuccessfully attempts to borrow money from his mother Betty; his sister, Dana; and his insanely jealous girlfriend, Joi. Craig's father, Willie, eventually learns of Craig's plan, as well as the fact that Craig is carrying a gun. Willie talks to him, explaining that Craig should use his fists, instead of guns, to resolve his problems, all the while telling Craig the story of how his uncle, who was Willie's brother, lost his life due to gun violence.  Later on, while Craig and Smokey discuss their dilemma, they are interrupted by the arrival of Rita, a girl whom Debbie set Smokey up with earlier. Smokey then discovers she lied about her looks. Instead of resembling [[Janet Jackson]] as she originally claimed, Rita is obese and bald and, in Smokey's words: "looking more like [[Freddie Jackson]]."  Smokey heads to Debbie's house to complain and notices Red's bike on the lawn. He sneaks in and finds Deebo asleep with Felisha. Smokey tries to reclaim the money that he and Deebo stole from Stanley earlier, but is interrupted by Ezail. Both escape without the money before Deebo wakes up. Smokey returns to Craig's house to tell him, and Craig agrees to go back with Smokey to try again, but at that moment, Deebo rides past them. The two notice a black car driving slowly and hide, suspecting a possible drive-by shooting. Scared, they run to Craig's room. Then, after Willie confronts them with the situation with Big Worm, and with 10:00 approaching, they decide step out. Once outside, they notice the van parked in the street with its headlights off. The two flee as men in the van start shooting at them.  The neighbors emerge from their homes upon hearing the gunshots. Debbie then confronts Deebo for assaulting Felisha after Deebo falsely accuses Felisha of Smokey's attempted theft. Deebo eventually assaults Debbie, as Craig and Smokey arrive.  Angered that Deebo has struck Debbie, Craig stands up to him, and threatens him with his gun. Deebo scoffs at the threat and Willie encourages Craig to put down the weapon and fight with his hands. Craig and Deebo fight. After nearly losing, Craig emerges victorious by using various objects as weapons. As Debbie tends to Craig, Smokey steals the money from an unconscious Deebo and flees the scene. Red punches Deebo again to ensure he doesn't wake up and retrieves his chain and bicycle while Ezail steals Deebo's shoes. Craig and Debbie agree to meet up the following day and Craig breaks up with Joi over the phone.  Later, Smokey settles with Big Worm, and ends the feud.

Gamera: Guardian of the Universe

As the anomalous formation approaches Japan, a team of scientists led by Naoya Kusanagi ([[Akira Onodera]]) discover [[orihalcum]] amulets and a stone slab covered in [[Etruscan alphabet|Etrurian runes]] on the atoll. During the investigation, the atoll suddenly quakes, destroying the slab and throwing the scientists into the ocean. One member of the team, Marine Officer Yoshinari Yonemori ([[Tsuyoshi Ihara]]), sees the eye and tusk of a giant [[turtle]].  Meanwhile, [[ornithologist]] Mayumi Nagamine ([[Shinobu Nakayama]]) investigates a village in the Goto Archipelago reportedly attacked by a "giant bird." While Nagamine is initially skeptical of the claims, she is horrified upon discovering human remains in a giant bird pellet. Exploring the nearby forest, her team encounters and then successfully prevents three bird-like creatures from attacking another village. To prevent further attacks, Nagamine agrees to aid the government in capturing the giant birds. The creatures are lured to the [[Fukuoka Dome]] baseball stadium, where two of the three are successfully captured. The last one escapes to the harbor, where it is killed by the giant turtle encountered by Yonemori and the scientists. The remaining birds escape before the turtle reaches the stadium.  After translating the runes, Kusangi explains to Yonemori and his daughter Asagi ([[Ayako Fujitani]]) that the giant turtle is called Gamera and the birds are Gyaos. When Asagi touches one of the stone amulets, she inadvertently forms a spiritual bond with Gamera. Kusanagi also tries to convince the government that the Gyaos are the real threat, but they remain focused on Gamera due to the destruction that he caused.  Now working together to investigate the creatures, Kusanagi, Yonemori and Nagamine witness another Gyaos attack at the Kiso Mountain Range. Nagamine and Yonemori are nearly killed trying to rescue a child, but Gamera arrives in time to save them and kills another Gyaos. The last Gyaos, however, escapes. Meanwhile, Asagi discovers that she suffers the same wounds and fatigue as Gamera due to their shared bond. At Mount Fuji, she witnesses a military strike against Gamera. The attack attracts the final Gyaos to the scene, where it grievously wounds Gamera and forces the turtle to retreat into the ocean. Simultaneously, Asagi suffers a similar wound and passes out from the pain. Kusanagi visits his daughter at the hospital where Asagi falls into a coma after saying that she and Gamera must rest.  After consulting with a biologist, Nagamine and Yonemori learn that the Gyaos are genetically engineered and reproduce asexually. They speculate on the origins and purpose of Gyaos and Gamera. Nagamine suggests that Gyaos were awakened by rampant pollution and Gamera was created to combat Gyaos. They approach Kusanagi with this information, explaining that the incident at Mount Fuji shows that Asagi is spiritually linked with Gamera. Kusanagi dismisses these claims until he witnesses the amulet's power himself.  With Gamera recovering in the ocean, the last Gyaos grows unchecked, becoming a Super Gyaos. The creature attacks Tokyo, causing many civilian casualties and prompting the government to focus on Gyaos instead of Gamera. Attempts to kill Gyaos end in failure and it builds a nest in the ruins of the [[Tokyo Tower]].  Upon awakening from her sleep, Asagi warns the others that Gamera has recovered and will attack Gyaos. Gamera catches Gyaos by surpise, destroying its nest and eggs. A massive air battle ensues and Asagi, Kusanagi, Nagamine, and Yonemori follow closely in a helicopter. Initially, Gyaos overpowers Gamera, but Asagi uses her spiritual energy to revive Gamera, who kills Gyaos. Gamera then releases Asagi from their bond and returns to the sea.

Getting Any?
 In ''Getting any?'', Minoru Iizuka (also known as "[[Dankan]]") portrays Asao, a naive and goofy man who lives with his grandfather in [[Saitama Prefecture]].  Even though Asao is 35 years old, he is very inexperienced with girls, but he absolutely wants to have sex. One day as he watches an erotic TV film, he realizes that all he needs to get girls and sex is a fancy car, so he runs to the closest car dealer.  In the TV film, the male character had a [[Porsche 911|Porsche 911 Cabriolet]], so Asao aims for a [[Luxury vehicles|luxury import car]] dealer. To the seller asking what kind of cars he is looking for, Asao naively answers that he wants "a car for having sex". After trying a [[cabriolet]], with the assistance of a very helpful and somewhat helpless hostess, Asao confesses he is strapped. All he can afford is a used domestic budget-car, so he is forced to buy a [[Honda Today]], a modest [[keicar|K-car]] which is very cheap compared to the [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls Royce]], [[Aston Martin]] and [[Ferrari]] displayed in the show room.  Then, he quickly restages the scene he has seen in the TV film, with the help of a female [[mannequin]], before aiming for street girls. Quickly, Asao realizes that male-female social relations are not as simple as in [[porn]], and that real life girls are not as naive as in fictional works.  After several humiliating and unsuccessful tries, Asao comes to the conclusion that [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] are more efficient. Such cars are expensive but Asao is without money, so he asks his grandfather to help him. After cashing in his grandfather's liver and kidneys, he returns to the car dealer. The seller convinces him to buy an [[Austin-Healey Sprite|Austin Healey Sprite MkI]], a classic British roadster, but once he learns how much money Asao really has, he changes his mind and sells him a Mazda [[Eunos Roadster]] (Mazda Miata), a popular Japanese roadster, claiming it is the same car. When Asao insists, the seller claims the '50s Austin-Healey was old-fashioned and the Eunos is a better model for cruising. The Eunos is driven a few meters and starts falling apart. Asao complains to the seller, but the latter is a con-man and refuses to talk with him any more, so Asao picks up the fallen pieces and attaches them to the back of his car.  The young man tries his luck anyway with girls on the street, but does not succeed, so he finally sells his wrecked car to a local salvage company.  As he walks home, he finds an apparently abandoned, parked, [[RX-7|Mazda RX-7 Series 5 Turbo (FC)]], and he decides to steal it. Asao drives a few miles when he encounters a young woman walking along the road and decides to talk to her, as shown in the erotic film, but the sports car does not brake anymore and he runs over the girl, and crashes the car into a billboard. He is lucky enough to not get hurt and he ditches the coupé.  Asao imagines stewardesses are naked and offer "on-board sex service" to first class [[Boeing 747|747]] customers, so he decides to travel by plane. Since he does not have any money, he will do an armed bank robbery, but first he needs a weapon, so he heads to [[Kawaguchi, Saitama|Kawaguchi City]] (near [[Tokyo]]) where he will be able to make his own revolver in the local iron foundry.  Eventually, he has many adventures such as joining the [[yakuza]], becoming [[Zatoichi]], becoming invisible, and getting transformed into a giant fly-man ''a la'' the film ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]''.  The movie ends with his capture after diving into a large reservoir of feces. After the credits, there is a scene where Asao jumps around Tokyo as the fly-man before landing/getting impaled on [[Tokyo Tower]].  
Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)
  In 2029, with the advance of [[Cyborg|cybernetic]] technology, the human body can be "augmented" or even completely replaced with cybernetic parts. Another significant achievement is the [[World of Ghost in the Shell#Cyberbrains|cyberbrain]], a mechanical casing for the human brain that allows access to the Internet and other networks. An often-mentioned term is "ghost", referring to the consciousness inhabiting the body (the "shell").  Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]] is an assault-team leader for the [[Public Security Section 9]] of "New Port City" in Japan. Following a request from Nakamura, chief of [[World of Ghost in the Shell#Public security bureaus|Section 6]], she successfully assassinates a diplomat of a foreign country to prevent a programmer named Daita from defecting.  The Foreign Minister's interpreter is [[World of Ghost in the Shell#Drawbacks|ghost-hacked]], presumably to assassinate VIPs in an upcoming meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious [[Puppet Master (Ghost in the Shell)|Puppet Master]], Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus. After a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with no clue about the Puppet Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end.  Megatech Body, a "shell" manufacturer with suspected close ties to the government, is hacked and assembles a cybernetic body. The body escapes but is hit by a truck. As Section 9 examines the body, they find a human "ghost" inside its computer brain. Unexpectedly, Nakamura arrives to reclaim the body. He claims that the "ghost" inside the brain is the Puppet Master himself, lured into the body by Section 6. The body reactivates itself, claims to be a sentient being and requests political asylum. After the Puppet Master initiates a brief argument about what constitutes a human, a camouflaged agent accompanying Nakamura starts a diversion and gets away with the body.  Having suspected foul play, Kusanagi's team is prepared and immediately pursues the agent. Meanwhile, Section 9 researches "Project 2501", mentioned earlier by the Puppet Master, and finds a connection with Daita, whom Section 6 tries to keep from defecting the country. Facing the discovered information, Daisuke Aramaki, chief of Section 9, concludes that Section 6 created the Puppet Master itself for various political purposes. This is why Section 6 is desperately trying to reclaim the body.  Kusanagi follows the car carrying the body to an abandoned building. It is protected by a large [[Tachikoma|walking tank]]. Anxious to face the Puppet Master's ghost, Kusanagi engages the tank without backup and is nearly killed. Her partner Batou arrives in time to save her, and helps connect her brain to the Puppet Master's.  The Puppet Master explains to Kusanagi that he was created by Section 6. While wandering various networks, he became sentient and began to contemplate his existence. Deciding the essence of humanity is reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain that will eventually die. As he could not escape Section 6's network, he had to download himself into a cybernetic body. Having interacted with Kusanagi (without her knowledge), he believes she is also questioning her humanity, and they have a lot in common. He proposes merging their ghosts, in return, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities. Kusanagi agrees to the merge.  Snipers from Section 6 approach the building, intending to destroy the Puppet Master's and Kusanagi's brains to cover up Project 2501. The Puppet Master's shell is destroyed, but Batou shields Kusanagi's head in time to save her brain. As Section 9 closes in on the site, the snipers retreat.  "Kusanagi" wakes up in Batou's [[safe house]] with her previous shell's head attached to a new cyborg child body. She tells Batou that the entity within her body is neither Kusanagi nor the Puppet Master, but a combination of both. She promises Batou they will meet again, leaves the house and wonders where to go next.  
Get Shorty (film)
 Chili Palmer, a [[loan shark]] based in Miami, clashes with another mobster, Ray "Bones" Barboni over a leather jacket that "Bones" borrowed from Palmer without permission. They have one brief violent confrontation, which leaves Barboni with a broken nose. But after Palmer's long time mob boss, Momo, dies of a heart attack, he suddenly finds himself working directly for Barboni, whose first order is for Palmer to collect a loan debt owed by Leo Devoe. Devoe was believed by Palmer and the mob to have been killed in a fatal commercial airliner crash, but had actually gotten off the plane, and failed to re-board. After the plane crash, Devoe's wife Fay identifies his personal effects, and the airline offers her a check for $300,000. Chili visits her and discovers Leo is still alive, partying and gambling in Las Vegas with the insurance settlement money.  While in Vegas looking for DeVoe, Palmer picks up a second job from a casino manager to collect a debt from B-movie producer Harry Zimm. Palmer goes to Los Angeles, and locates Zimm at the home of B movie actress Karen Flores, sneaking into her house. Zimm agrees to pay the money he owes in 90 days. Film fan Palmer then pitches a movie script idea: a thinly veiled story of his own life, including the scam by Leo.  Zimm is interested, but he has financial problems: He owes $200,000 to limo service owner and big time drug dealer Bo Catlett, who also wants to be in the movie business. Palmer says he will help Zimm take care of solving the debt issue. Receiving a tip,  Palmer tracks down Leo Devoe in his hotel room and collects the $300,000 in insurance money, leaving a portion for Leo to gamble with.   Palmer then returns to Karen's house, where he asks Karen on a date. Karen is the ex-wife of famed actor Martin Weir, which gives Palmer the idea that Weir should star in his movie. He and Karen go to Weir's home to pitch the story idea, Chili giving the actor tips on how to act like a loan shark.  Catlett comes to Zimm's office for a progress report about the film he is supposedly financing. Waiting for him there instead is Palmer, who tells Catlett that Zimm has a different project he needs to finish first. Catlett and his sidekick Ronnie proceed to threaten Zimm, saying they want their money back, and to get rid of Palmer or else.  Zimm makes a call to Barboni in Miami, telling him Chili has recovered the money from Leo Devoe and speaking to him rudely on the phone. Barboni promptly flies to Los Angeles, confronts Zimm in his office, and beats him mercilessly when Zimm does not reveal the location of Chili and the money. Ronnie walks in and Ray shoots him, then puts the gun in Zimm's hand.  Doris, Zimm's girlfriend, whose late husband wrote ''Mr. Lovejoy'', calls Karen and tells her that Zimm is in the hospital. When he is eventually released, Zimm must wear a neck brace and remains in agonizing pain, even as he endures Weir's arrogant behavior in a brief lunch meeting with Chili and Karen about their movie project. At another restaurant, Zimm claims he doesn't need Chili's money anymore. Catlett's bodyguard, Bear, a movie stuntman on the side, is thrown down a flight of stairs by Chili.  Desperate for money, Catlett kidnaps Karen and demands the money that Chili has gotten back from Devoe. But after Chili gives him the money, Catlett reneges on their deal. Chili cuts a deal with Bear to double-cross Catlett. On a balcony at Catlett's home, where Karen is being held, Bear pretends to give Chili a beating, but it's a set-up. In the struggle, Catlett is pushed over a balcony rail that was previously loosened, falling to his death.  At his hotel, Barboni confronts Palmer, demanding the money. He finds an airport locker key and assumes the money is hidden in the locker. At the airport, upon opening the locker, a shocked Barboni is confronted by DEA agents.  On a Hollywood studio set, a film is being made. [[Harvey Keitel]] is playing Barboni and Martin Weir is playing Palmer. [[Penny Marshall]] is directing, with Zimm as executive producer, Chili and Karen as co-producers. Bear is a technical consultant. Chili and Karen are arguing with Weir's agent about Weir's appropriateness for another role.  
The Gate of Heavenly Peace (film)
 ''The Gate of Heavenly Peace'' is a three-hour documentary film about the 1989 protests at [[Tiananmen Square]], which culminated in the violent government crackdown on June 4. The film uses archival footage and contemporary interviews with a wide range of Chinese citizens, including workers, students, intellectuals, and government officials, to revisit the events of “Beijing Spring.” From the beginning of the protests in mid-April to the night of June 3–4, the film provides a “meticulous day-by-day chronicle of the six-week period… This unglamorous but absorbing film interweaves videotaped scenes of the demonstrations and conversations with leaders and participants with an explanatory narration into an account that is as clear-headed as it is thorough and well-organized.”<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F06EEDB1339F937A25753C1A963958260 “Assessing Both Sides in Tiananmen Square Massacre],” Stephen Holden, ''The New York Times'', October 14, 1995</ref>  Among those interviewed are [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], [[Wuer Kaixi]], [[Han Dongfang]], [[Ding Zilin]], [[Chai Ling]], [[Dai Qing]], Feng Congde, and [[Hou Dejian]].  In addition, ''The Gate of Heavenly Peace'' examines the deeper history behind the demonstrations, providing historical and cultural context for the famous images that the Western media flashed around the world. The film explores the symbolic importance of [[Tiananmen Square]] and also looks at earlier political movements in China from the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 to the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966-76 to the [[Tiananmen Incident]] of 1976. In so doing, the film considers the ways in which the political habits and attitudes that came to inform public life in China over the past century also shaped the events of 1989.  Pauline Chen writes: “''The Gate of Heavenly Peace'' illuminates how images of these movements, filtered and refracted through propaganda, emotion, and imperfect memory, provided inspiration and models for the participants, both students and government, in the 1989 events. The students thought they were emulating the May 4 leaders, forgetting that those students returned to school and worked for more gradual social change after successfully drawing attention to China's political and social problems. To some Communist Party members, however, the 1989 mass student demonstrations may have chillingly recalled the chaos and terror of the Cultural Revolution. Both the Cultural Revolution and the 1976 Tiananmen Incident attest to how extremists have used popular uprisings as excuses to get rid of their moderate rivals; the 'reactionary' Deng Xiaoping, who favored greater economic freedom, was blamed by Mao for the 1976 Tiananmen Incident and forced from his position. Unfortunately, today's hard-liners have also learned the lesson from these events. The moderate reformers [[Zhao Ziyang]] and Yan Mingfu, China's best hope for democratic reform, were ousted from power following the June 4 crisis.”<ref>Pauline Chen, “Screening History:  New Documentaries on the  Tiananmen Events in China,” Cineaste, vol. 22, no. 1 (Winter, 1996)</ref>

GoldenEye
  In 1986, at [[Arkhangelsk]], [[MI6]] agents [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] and [[Alec Trevelyan]] infiltrate a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] chemical weapons facility and plant explosives. Trevelyan is captured and executed by Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, but Bond flees as the facility explodes.  Nine years later, in [[Monte Carlo]], Bond follows [[Xenia Onatopp]], a member of the Janus [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]], who has formed a suspicious relationship with Charles Farrel, a [[Canadian Navy]] admiral. As Onatopp crushes the admiral to death with her thighs during sex, his credentials are stolen by Ourumov, who uses them to board a French Navy destroyer with Onatopp to steal a [[Eurocopter Tiger]] helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp later fly the helicopter to a bunker in Severnaya, [[Siberia]], where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet [[Directed-energy weapon|electromagnetic pulse weapon]] satellites from the [[Cold War]]. They program the first GoldenEye (''Petya'') to destroy the complex and disable incoming [[Russian Air Force]] fighters (while the stolen Tiger survives), and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he betrays her to Janus.  In London, [[M (James Bond)|M]] assigns Bond to investigate the attack. He flies to Saint Petersburg to meet [[CIA]] operative Jack Wade, who suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky, a former [[KGB]] agent and business rival of Janus. Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus. Onatopp surprises Bond at the [[Grand Hotel Europe]] and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her. She takes Bond to Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan; he faked his death at Arkhangelsk but was badly scarred by the explosion. A descendant of the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] clans who [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated with]] the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi forces]] in the Second World War, Trevelyan had vowed revenge against the British after they [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|betrayed the Cossacks]], which drove his father to kill Trevelyan's mother and himself. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquilizer dart.  Bond awakens, tied up with Natalya in the helicopter, which has been programmed to self-destruct. They escape but are captured and transported to the Russian military archives, where [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Minister of Defence]] Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. Just as Natalya reveals the existence of a second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the Siberian massacre, Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin. Intending to frame Bond for the murder, he calls the guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct. As Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch, Natalya triangulates Grishenko's satellite dish to [[Cuba]]. The two escape just before the train explodes.  Bond and Natalya meet Wade in the [[Florida Keys]] and borrow his plane for the trip to Cuba, where the same night, they make love. The next day, while searching for GoldenEye's satellite dish, they are shot down. Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the [[Bank of England]] before erasing all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (''Misha''), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.  Natalya programs the satellite to initiate [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric re-entry]] and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko to save the satellite, Grishenko unwittingly triggers an explosion with Bond's pen grenade (received earlier from [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]), which allows Bond to escape to the antenna cradle. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite. Bond and Trevelyan fight on the antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later the cradle explodes, killing Trevelyan and Grishenko. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where the couple are rescued by Wade and a team of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marines]].  
Godzilla vs. Destoroyah
 [[Miki Saegusa]] of the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center (UNGCC) travels to Birth Island to check on [[Godzilla]] and its [[Godzilla Junior|adopted child]], but finds the entire island destroyed. Godzilla appears in [[Hong Kong]], covered in glowing [[lava]]-like rashes, and goes on a rampage. The [[Japan Self Defense Forces]] (JSDF) hires college student Kenkichi Yamane, the grandson of Dr. Kyohei Yamane, to work at the center in an attempt to unravel the mystery of Godzilla's condition. Yamane suspects that Godzilla's heart, which acts as a [[nuclear reactor]], is undergoing a [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of Godzilla absorbing the energy released from a uranium deposit on Birth Island that had been triggered by a volcanic eruption. Yamane theorizes that, when Godzilla's temperature reaches 1,200&nbsp;°C, he will explode with a force approximately "1,000 times greater than all nuclear weapons put together, a burst of power unseen since time began," which will be hot enough to ignite Earth's atmosphere and reduce the planet's surface to ash.  The JSDF deploys a flying combat vehicle outfitted with anti-nuclear cold weapons, the [[Super X|Super-X III]], in an effort to reverse Godzilla's self-destruction. Meanwhile, scientists discover that Dr. Serizawa's [[Oxygen Destroyer]], which was used against the original Godzilla in 1954, has awoken and mutated a colony of Precambrian organisms lying dormant in Tokyo Bay. The creatures combine into several man-sized crab-like creatures and begin wreaking havoc. After several deadly skirmishes with the JSDF, the creatures, dubbed "[[Destoroyah]]", evolve beyond the military's containment abilities.  Due to his encounter with the Super-X III, Godzilla will not explode, but will instead suffer a bodily meltdown which could potentially destroy the planet. Miki is instructed to telepathically lure Godzilla Junior to Tokyo, hoping that Godzilla will follow and be killed by Destoroyah. Junior arrives and fights Destoroyah, who is seemingly defeated after being blown into an electrical plant. Godzilla arrives at [[Haneda Airport]], where he witnesses a now fully mature Destoroyah kill Junior.  Godzilla tries to revive Godzilla Junior, but fails, accelerating the meltdown through his grief. Destoroyah reappears, and Godzilla seriously injures the monster in the ensuing battle. Destoroyah tries to retreat, but the JSDF shoots it down with a number of freeze weapons designed to work against Godzilla, and it dies upon touching the ground super-heated by Godzilla.  Godzilla begins to die from the meltdown, but the JSDF is able to minimize the damage with the freeze weapons. While successful in preventing Earth's destruction, the JSDF is unable to prevent the massive nuclear fallout from rendering Tokyo uninhabitable. Suddenly, the radiation levels plummet and a familiar roar is heard and the JSDF sees that Godzilla Junior, having absorbed the energy from his father's death, has not only regenerated but grown into an adult form.  
Glory Daze (film)
 [[File:Santa Cruz, California - Boardwalk.jpg|thumb|A scene early in the film was shot at the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]], with the actors riding various attractions.]] 22 year-old Jack Freeman is graduating from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] with a degree in art, and is hurting from a recent breakup with his ex-girlfriend Dina. He shares a house called "El Rancho" with four friends: Rob is also graduating, and preparing to move to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Joanie, though he is worried about settling down and living so close to Joani's mother. Dennis is a [[perpetual student]] with three degrees who, after six years at UCSC, is moving on to an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] program in Michigan. Mickey is a [[cartoonist]] with a year of college still to go, and has feelings for their friend Chelsea but is too shy to reciprocate her affections. Josh, aka "Slosh", had a promising academic future but failed out of college in favor of a life of drinking and working a series of menial jobs.  Art professor Luther criticizes Jack's final sculpture project for expressing an uninteresting, suburban, middle-class worldview, but praises Dennis' thesis—a [[photo-essay]] of Slosh getting drunk and working at dead-end jobs—and offers him an [[apprenticeship]]; Jack suggests that this is only because Luther has a homosexual attraction toward Dennis, a notion Dennis dismisses. Not wanting their college days to end, Jack convinces his friends to postpone their respective plans and stay at El Rancho for another year. They celebrate the decision by throwing a party, at which Chelsea, tired of her feelings for Mickey going unrequited, makes sexual advances toward Jack. He turns her down, and she leaves the party embarrassed. Rob gets into an argument with Joanie, causing her to leave angrily.  After the commencement ceremony the next day, Rob reconciles with Joanie and meets her mother, and they end up getting along. Jack argues with his parents over his future, and they leave abruptly. Jack encourages Mickey to pursue a relationship with Chelsea. Luther makes a pass at Dennis during a faculty luncheon, confirming Jack's suspicion about his ulterior motives. Dennis and Jack vent their frustrations with Luther by cutting down a [[totem pole]] that his sculpture students spent two semesters creating.  At a beach bonfire that night, Slosh tells Jack that it was Jack's carefree attitude that inspired him to give up on college, and that he does not regret his decision because he no longer fears what the future may hold. At Slosh's encouragement, Jack attempts to win back Dina, but she rebuffs him. Back at El Rancho, Mickey admits his feelings to Chelsea, and the two share a kiss. Jack and the others realize that they should not really stay another year, that it is time to move on with their adult lives. To preserve their memories of the house and prevent any future residents from despoiling it, they proceed to smash their furniture and belongings, culminating in the destruction of the [[Bar (establishment)#Bar (counter)|bar counter]] that they had built together.  The next day, the five friends go their separate ways: Rob leaves for Los Angeles with Joanie, Dennis heads off to school in Michigan, and Mickey and Chelsea begin dating. Slosh moves in with a group of new students he has befriended, and hangs the El Rancho sign on their house. As Jack leaves town, he stops at a restaurant where Dina is eating with her new boyfriend, and writes "angst for the memories" on the window as a farewell message to her.  
The Glass Shield
 John "J. J." Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]].  Because of his inexperience and race, he  experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy.  Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship.  While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station.  When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest.  Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him.  Deputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations.  Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder.  Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court.  At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody.  Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this.  While coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race.  Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse.  Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up.  Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better.  At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision.  Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened.  With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey.  As the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability.  Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station.  Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid.  After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows.  Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell.  When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods.  The jury can not reach a verdict.  Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods.  Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts.  Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury.  Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence.  After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.  
Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain
 In June 1980, Beth Easton ([[Christina Ricci]]) and her recently widowed mother, Kate ([[Polly Draper]]) move from [[Los Angeles]] to a small town in northern Washington, where they move into Kate's aunt's farmhouse. At first, Beth misses L.A. and resents their new life in the country. In town, she encounters Jody Salerno ([[Anna Chlumsky]]), a troubled but free-spirited teenager who has a bad reputation in the town. While riding her bike the next day, Beth is forced off the road by a semi-truck, and plummets down a steep ravine, crashing her bicycle into a river, where Jody is fishing.  Kate attempts to ingratiate Beth with two local girls, Tracy ([[Ashleigh Aston Moore]]) and Samantha ([[Jewel Staite]]), and while they are picking berries at the house, Beth encounters Jody, who has been hiding in a tree and throwing cherries at them. Tracy and Samantha warn Beth against associating with Jody, but Beth joins her on a walk through the woods. The next day when they are walking together, Jody tells Beth she has an adventure planned for the following day, and asks Beth to meet her outside the local high school. Jody fails to show, and a local cop, Matt ([[Brian Kerwin]]) offers her a ride to Jody's house. Jody's mother, Lynette ([[Diana Scarwid]]) answers the door, appearing shaken and inebriated, and tells Beth that Jody isn't home.  Matt brings Beth home, and realizes that he is an old acquaintance of her mother's. Beth receives a phone call from Jody, who directs her into the forest outside her house. She explains that she hid from Matt and Beth at the high school because she had broken in and stolen candy from the vending machines; she then tells Beth the story of Molly Morgan, a female miner who purportedly died in a mine collapse in [[Bear Mountain (Washington)|Bear Mountain]] while searching for gold. The girls board a motorized boat which Jody has hidden along the river, and ride downstream and into the mountain, where she has set up a makeshift living space in the cavern entryway. Jody confesses to Beth that her mother and her mom's abusive boyfriend, Ray ([[David Keith]]), had gotten into a fight the night before, and that Jody may have fatally wounded him after he chased her into the woods.  Beth urges Jody to go to the police, and a rainstorm approaches. As the girls try to leave the cave, there is a collapse of boulders, which destroy the boat and pin Beth to the cave floor. Jody swims out of the cave and down the river, making it safely past a grizzly bear and to a road where she crosses paths with a sheriff. Beth is rescued just in time, as the water level has slowly risen inside the cave. At the hospital, Jody is confronted by Ray, who is still alive to the surprise of Jody and Beth.  Kate forbids Beth to spend time with Jody, but she appears at a [[Fourth of July]] picnic and divulges her plan to return to the mountain to get the gold. Kate eventually decides to let Beth see Jody, and they drive to Jody's house the next day. Inside, they find Lynette, beaten and incoherent, and no sign of Ray or Jody. Lynette is taken to the hospital and Beth insists to Matt that they go to the mountain, believing that Ray took Jody there. Beth assists Matt to the caves, but the two are separated inside. Beth finds Jody, who tells her that a drunken Ray beat her and forced her to take him to find the gold.  Beth goes back to find Matt, and Jody is grabbed from behind by whom she believes is Ray— when she turns around, she finds it is an elderly woman, who then recedes into the shadows. Ray appears and attempts to grab Jody, but is hit over the head with a shovel by the elderly woman, who is ostensibly Molly Morgan. Beth returns to find Jody and Ray, unconscious, but Molly has disappeared. Matt finally finds Beth and Jody and Ray is arrested. Lynette recovers in the hospital and Jody accepts her apologies.  In late August, Matt arrives at Beth's house, and brings her, Kate, Jody, and Lynette to the courthouse, where an attorney is representing an anonymous client who has bestowed a gift to the girls. They are given two bags, each containing gold, and are cheered and applauded by the town citizens including Tracy and Samantha.

Despite his son's objections, Goofy plans his own trip, with initially disastrous results, leading to Max hurting his father's feelings after being humiliated at an [[opossum]]-based theme park.  While camping, [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and P.J. join them. Following Pete's advice to keep Max under control, Goofy takes his son fishing and performs the Perfect Cast fishing technique, luring [[Bigfoot]] to their camp, forcing Pete and P.J. to flee, and leaving Goofy and Max to spend the night with Bigfoot. That night, while Goofy is asleep, Max surreptitiously alters the map route to [[Los Angeles]], where the concert is taking place. The next morning, Goofy decides to make Max the navigator of the trip. The two go to several locations that satisfy both of them, and stop by a motel where they meet Pete and P.J. again.

Goofy reveals his believing Mazur's exaggerations to Max and also says that no matter how old Max gets, he will always be his son, and the two reconcile with each other. After learning that Max had promised Roxanne that he would be at the concert, Goofy decides to take him to Los Angeles. The two nearly plummet down a waterfall to their deaths, but Max fortunately saves Goofy, using the Perfect Cast technique.  Goofy and Max get to Los Angeles, and while attempting to sneak backstage, they end up onstage and dance with Powerline, watched by Pete, P.J. and Roxanne on separate televisions. Goofy and Max later return to Roxanne's house in their damaged car, where Max tells the truth to Roxanne; she accepts it and admits she always had feelings for him, ever since he first said, "Ahyuck!", starting a relationship between them. Goofy's car suddenly explodes due to the damage it has sustained, ejecting Goofy in the process, but he safely falls through the porch roof of Roxanne's house, where Max proceeds to introduce him to Roxanne.

Two men arrive in a truck to take Gordy's father, but Gordy is alerted of this by the farm's rooster. Gordy tries to stop his father from leaving by following the truck taking his father, but his father tells him to go home and look after the family. When Gordy returns he finds that his mother and siblings were taken in another truck while he pursued his father. Determined to locate his family and return to the farm, Gordy sets out alone to find them. He eventually ends up in the care of Jinnie Sue MacAllister, a young [[country singer]] who lives in a camper van with her also country singer father, Luke, and their "manager", Cousin Jake. Jinnie Sue, not knowing Gordy's name, calls him Pinky.  They travel to a dinner party, where Luke performs for the governor of Arkansas. Also there is rich businessman, Henry R. Royce; his daughter Jessica; her rather dull but scheming fiancé, Gilbert Sipes; and her lonely young son Hanky. Hanky wanders off on his own and meets Gordy and Jinnie Sue. Hanky falls into a swimming pool, but cannot swim. Just as Jinnie Sue rushes off to get help, Gordy dives into the pool with an inflatable pool toy, and saves Hanky. Due to his bravery, Gordy is given to Hanky as a pet, and Gordy also becomes suddenly famous.  Royce and Sipes have alternate decisions on who the new mascot of the Royce Company should be: Gordy or Jessica. In the end, Gordy wins, due to a switched camera lens used on Jessica's promotion. Sipes is determined to remove Gordy and then take control of the company. Sipes sends his two guards, Dietz and Krugman, to kidnap Gordy, but Gordy and Hanky escape by boarding a school bus, which Dietz and Krugman pursue. On the way, the two men are distracted briefly by a cross-dressing thief, and discover that Gordy and Hanky have escaped onto a feeding truck. Gordy and Hanky unexpectedly meet up with the MacAllisters, who learn from the radio that Hanky has apparently run away. Another bulletin follows, revealing Henry Royce has died of a heart attack. The MacAllisters return Hanky and Gordy to the Royce building in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where an attorney reveals Henry has left his company to Hanky and Gordy.  Cousin Jake, upon learning Gordy's family is missing, organizes a giant country-wide search to locate them and also a country music concert in [[Branson, Missouri]] in Gordy's name. A host of country singers perform, as well as a surprise speech from President [[Bill Clinton]] (just an impersonator), who unveils a new stamp of Gordy. Sipes sends his men to kidnap Gordy, tie him in a sack, and toss him in a river, but the pig is saved by Cousin Jake. Jake returns Gordy to Hanky and Jinnie Sue. Everyone learns from someone who calls into the telethon that Gordy's family is going to be slaughtered at an unidentified slaughterhouse in Nebraska. Sipes tries to hide the fact that the very same slaughterhouse is owned by the Royce family. However, a battle ensues between Sipes and Luke, with Jessica and Luke knocking him out with the suitcase of Brinks, the family attorney. Gordy, Hanky, Jinnie Sue, Jessica, Luke, Cousin Jake, and Brinks race to stop the slaughterhouse from killing Gordy's family, but a train slows them down. Hanky successfully rings the lovestruck supervisor, and the slaughterhouse is shut down just in time. To Gordy's happiness, his family has survived, and he is reunited with his father, who was also about to be killed at the slaughterhouse. The pigs are moved back to the farm, which Luke and Jessica decide to buy with most of the Royce Company profits; the two marry and Hanky, Jinnie Sue, and Cousin Jake move in too. Gordy and his family are finally reunited.

Suraj has a brother (Arun Chauhan), who is a crime reporter for the Indian Times. Home Minister Bhavani Shankar goes to a function held by an adoption center for orphan girls. There he encounters a pretty girl and instantly feels infatuated with her. He asks the DIG to ask the Mayor's wife to bring her to him since the Mayor's wife is the owner of the adoption center. At first, the Mayor's wife resists and says no, but when the DIG threatens to tell the truth about her past endeavours about dealing with prostitutes to her husband, she agrees. That night, when the Mayor's wife brings the girl to Bhavani Shankar, little does he know that Arun is on an assignment for his newspaper. Arun discovers and records a video of Bhavani Shankar raping the same girl from the adoption center. The next night, Arun goes to see the Mayor only to show him the misdeed that Home Minister Bhavani Shankar has committed.

La haine
 The film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French [[housing project]] (a ZUP'''') in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. Vinz ([[Vincent Cassel]]), who is [[Jew]]ish, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a Police man, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police, for instance, is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, even to individual policemen who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert ([[Hubert Koundé]]) is an [[Afro-French]] boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to simply leave this world of violence and hate behind him, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. SaïdSayid in some English subtitles([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]) is an [[Arab]] [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.  A friend of theirs, Abdel Ichaha, has been brutalized by the police shortly before the riot and lies in a coma. Vinz finds a policeman's [[.44 Magnum]] revolver, lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop, and when he hears of Abdel's death he fantasizes carrying out his vengeance.  The three go through an aimless daily routine and struggle to entertain themselves, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After Vinz nearly shoots a riot policeman and the group narrowly escapes, they take a train to Paris but encounter many of the same frustrations, and their responses to interactions with both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to degenerate to dangerous hostility. A run-in with sadistic [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] policemen, during which Saïd and Hubert are humiliated and racially as well as physically abused, results in their missing the last train home and spending the night on the streets. They sleep in a shopping mall and wake to a news broadcast informing them that Abdel is dead. They later travel to a roof-top from which they insult skinheads and policemen, before later encountering the same group of racist anti-immigrant skinheads who begin to beat Saïd and Hubert savagely, now that the balance of power has shifted. Vinz suddenly arrives, and his gun allows him to break up the fight; all the skinheads flee except one (portrayed by Kassovitz himself) whom Vinz is about to execute in cold blood. His dream of revenge is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his true nature is not the heartless gangster he poses as, and he lets the skinhead flee.  Early in the morning, the trio returns to the [[banlieue]] and split up to their separate homes, and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. However, Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes policeman, whom Vinz had insulted earlier in the day whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. The policeman grabs and threatens Vinz, making reference to the earlier incident on the roof. Hubert rushes to their aid, but as the policeman holding Vinz taunts him with a loaded gun held to Vinz's head, the gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz instantly. Hubert and the policeman slowly and deliberately point their guns at each other, and as the film cuts to Saïd closing his eyes and cuts to black, a shot is heard on the soundtrack, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit. This stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines ("''It's about a society in free fall...''"), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, ''jusqu'ici tout va bien'' (so far so good); ''i.e.'' all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.  
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers
 On [[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers|October 31, 1989]], Michael Myers and his niece Jamie Lloyd are abducted from the Haddonfield Police Station. Six years later, on October 30, 1995, Jamie has been impregnated and her baby is born, being taken away by the "Man in Black", the leader of a [[Druid]]-like [[cult]]. Later, a midwife helps Jamie escape with her baby and is soon killed by Michael by impaling the back of her skull into a protruding sharp metal spike high on the wall. Jamie and her baby flee in a stolen pick-up truck, with Michael in pursuit. Stopping briefly at a deserted bus station, Jamie makes a call to a Haddonfield radio station to warn them that Michael is about to return home, only to be ignored by the radio D.J. Barry Simms.  Meanwhile, the retired Dr. Sam Loomis is visited by his friend Dr. Terence Wynn, the chief administrator of Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where Michael had been incarcerated as a boy; Wynn asks Loomis to return to Smith's Grove. They overhear Jamie's plea for help on a local radio station. Michael finds Jamie, and she crashes the truck into an old barn. He kills Jamie by impaling her on a corn [[threshing machine|thresher]] and turning it on, disemboweling her, but finds that her baby is not in the truck.  Back in Haddonfield, Tommy Doyle, whom Laurie Strode [[Halloween (1978 film)|babysat in 1978]], now lives in a [[boarding house]] run by Mrs. Blankenship. The family living in the Myers house across the street are relatives of the Strode family: Kara Strode, her six-year-old son Danny, her teenage brother Tim, caring mother Debra, and abusive father John. Ever since seeing Michael as a child, Tommy has been obsessed with finding the truth behind his motives. He finds Jamie's baby at the bus station, takes him into his care, and names him Steven. Tommy runs into Loomis and tells him about the Strode family living in the Myers house. The two believe Michael has returned to Haddonfield.  Michael enters his home and kills Debra. Later, Tommy, Kara, and Danny go to the boarding house, where Tommy reveals that he believes Michael has been inflicted with ''[[Thorn (letter)|Thorn]]'', an ancient Druid curse. Long ago, one child from each tribe, chosen to bear the curse of Thorn, must sacrifice its next of kin on the night of [[Samhain]], or Halloween. Tommy believes that Steven will be Michael's final sacrifice. While Tommy goes out to look for Loomis, Mrs. Blankenship reveals to Kara that she was babysitting Michael the night he killed his sister, and that Danny is hearing a voice telling him to kill just like Michael did, indicating Danny also possesses the power of Thorn. Meanwhile, Michael kills John, Tim, Tim's girlfriend Beth, and Barry Simms. After Tommy returns home with Loomis, the Man in Black reveals himself to be Wynn. The cult take Kara, Danny, Steven, and Michael to Smith's Grove. There, Loomis confronts Wynn, who reveals he wants to control and study the power of Thorn. Wynn wants Loomis to join in on his conspiracy, and reveals that Jamie's baby represents a new cycle of Michael's evil that he kept secret from most of the cult who were focused on inflicting the curse onto a new child (Danny) to carry out a new trend of family sacrifices. Loomis calls Wynn out on his scheme and is knocked unconscious.  Later, Michael butchers Wynn's team of staff surgeons and Wynn himself during a medical procedure with Danny and Steven sitting in a room next door. Tommy finds and frees Kara, Danny, and Steven; they flee from Michael and hide in a laboratory. Regaining consciousness, Loomis helps Kara and the children escape the hospital. When Michael breaks into the room, Tommy injects him with large quantities of tranquilizers containing a [[corrosive substance|corrosive]] liquid and beats him unconscious with a lead pipe. As Tommy, Kara, Danny, and Steven leave, Loomis refuses to come with them as he has "a little business to attend to”. Back inside the building, Michael's mask is seen lying on the floor of the lab room and Loomis is heard screaming in the background, leaving the fate of both characters unknown.

Hackers (film)
 In 1988, 11-year-old Dade "Zero Cool" Murphy is arrested and charged with crashing 1,507 computer systems in a single day and causing a single-day 7-point drop in the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. His family is fined $45,000 for the events and he is banned from using computers or touch-tone telephones until he is 18 years old. Seven years later, Dade ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), is now living with his divorced mother in [[New York City]]. On Dade's 18th birthday, he receives a computer and uses [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to hack into a local television station's computer network, changing the current TV program to an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. However, Dade's intrusion is countered by another hacker ([[Nickname#Computing|handle]] "Acid Burn") on the same network, and they briefly converse, with Dade identifying himself by a new alias: "Crash Override".  Dade enrolls in a local high school where he meets Kate Libby ([[Angelina Jolie]]) who pranks Dade by claiming that there's a pool on the roof of the school. Ramon "The Phantom Phreak" Sanchez ([[Renoly Santiago]]) observes Dade accessing the school network during computer class to put himself in the same English class as Kate, and invites him to a hacker nightclub, Cyberdelia, where Dade beats Kate's [[high score]] in the ''[[Wipeout (video game)|Wipeout]]'' arcade game. Soon after, Dade exacts revenge for the earlier prank by scheduling a test of the school's sprinkler system the next day. Dade begins integrating himself into Phreak's circle of hacker friends: Emmanuel "Cereal Killer" Goldstein ([[Matthew Lillard]]), Paul "Lord Nikon" Cook ([[Laurence Mason]]) (so named for his [[photographic memory]]), and Joey Pardella ([[Jesse Bradford]]), an aspiring novice hacker without an alias. At a party, Dade learns that Kate is "Acid Burn", the hacker that kicked him out of the TV network earlier.  Meanwhile, Joey, out to prove his skills, successfully breaks into "The Gibson", an Ellingson Mineral Company [[supercomputer]]. He attempts to download a [[Trash (computing)|garbage file]] as proof of his feat, but his mother disconnects his computer so he'll sleep, leaving Joey with a [[fragmentation (computing)|fragmented]] file. However, prior to Joey's disconnection, the company's [[information technology|IT]] employee Hal ([[Penn Jillette]]) detects this unauthorized entry and summons computer security officer Eugene "The Plague" Belford ([[Fisher Stevens]]), a former hacker. While going through the files, Plague realizes the garbage file being downloaded is a [[computer worm|worm]] he inserted to defraud Ellingson. The Plague pretends the hackers are to blame and enlists the [[United States Secret Service|US Secret Service]] to recover the file, claiming it is the code to a [[computer virus]] (named "Da Vinci" for an image of the [[Vitruvian Man]] that accompanies it) that will capsize the company's oil tanker fleet. In fact, The Plague had inserted the virus as a [[red herring]] to cover for his worm.  Soon after, Joey is arrested and his computer is searched, but the Secret Service doesn't find anything, as Joey had hidden the disk containing the files. In response, Dade and Kate decide to settle their disagreements with a bet, with Dade choosing a date with Kate as his prize and Kate electing to have Dade perform menial computing tasks. The hacking duel focuses on harassing Secret Service Agent Richard Gill ([[Wendell Pierce]]), "Hacker enemy number one", who was involved in Joey's arrest. After various pranks including canceling Gill's credit cards, creating a fake embarrassing personal ad in Gill's name, fabricating a criminal record, and changing his payroll status to "deceased", the duel remains in a tie status.  After being released on parole, Joey reveals the disk to Phreak in a public park; but they quickly realize that they are being followed by the Secret Service. The next day, Phreak is arrested and uses his phone call to inform Kate that he hid the disk in a boys' bathroom at school. That evening, Kate and Cereal Killer ask Dade for his help; but he declines, stating he has "a record". Kate then asks Dade to copy the disk so that, if anyone else is arrested, they have the disk as un-tampered evidence. After determining that Dade is not the one who hacked into Ellingson, The Plague attempts to enlist Dade's help to find the one who did. First, he sends Dade a high-powered laptop that displays a video message from The Plague encouraging Dade to join him. Later, he threatens to have Dade's mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate's copy of the disk.  Meanwhile, Kate, Lord Nikon, and Cereal Killer attempt to discern the contents of the disk. Dade joins them; and, after working all night, they learn the purpose of its code—a [[computer worm|worm]] designed to [[Salami slicing|salami-slice]] $25 million from Ellingson transactions. Dade confesses that he knows Plague is behind this scheme, admitting that he gave him the disk and revealing his hacking history as "Zero Cool". Determined to stop the scheme, the assembled hackers plan to hack the Gibson again. Kate and Dade go [[dumpster-diving]] for employee memos with passwords; Cereal Killer installs a [[phone tap]] in the Ellingson offices; and Nikon poses as a delivery boy wandering the Ellingson cubicles, memorizing employee passwords as they enter them into their terminals.  Reading the memos, they discover that the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day, which would provide the perfect cover to distract from the salami-slicing worm. In need of help, Dade and Kate seek out Razor and Blade, the producers of a hacker-themed unlicensed TV show, "Hack the Planet." Razor and Blade are at a club where [[Urban Dance Squad]] is performing and Dade and Kate manage to convince Razor and Blade to join them in disrupting The Gibson enough that the garbage file can be located and copied. Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer learn through their Ellingson phone tap that warrants for their arrest are to be executed at 9AM the next day.  The next morning, after being [[pager|paged]] by Kate, Nikon and Cereal roller-blade from Washington Square Park, evading the Secret Service after exploiting the traffic system and using a payload that reconfigures traffic lights and converge on [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central station]], where they use payphones and [[acoustic coupler]]s to begin their assault on the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to taunt him to escape before he is arrested. However, Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support with virus attacks, hampering the Gibson and distracting Plague long enough for Joey to download the incriminating file to a floppy disk.  Shortly after crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. As they're being led away, Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer, hiding in the crowd, that he's tossed the disk in a trashcan. As Dade and Kate are being interrogated, Razor and Blade jam the local television signals and broadcast live video of Cereal Killer, revealing the plot and Plague's complicity, along with the account number with the stolen funds. Plague is arrested while attempting to flee to Japan under the alias "Mr. Babbage" (itself a reference to [[Charles Babbage]]).  Their names cleared, Dade and Kate go on a date at a swimming pool on the roof of a building, their friends showing off their latest hack—the lights in several adjacent office buildings spelling out "CRASH AND BURN." Confirming that they have had dreams about each other, the two begin to make out.

Haunted (1995 film)
 In 1928 England, David Ash ([[Aidan Quinn]]), an American professor, has spent a majority of his life working in the field of [[parapsychology]] to disprove the existence of [[ghost]]s. He was motivated by the untimely death of his twin sister, Juliet, for which he blames himself. As a professor at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], he receives a series of urgent entreaties from a Ms. Webb, who claims she is being tormented by ghosts, to come and help her. David travels to [[Sussex]], where he is picked up at the railway station by the beautiful Christina Mariell ([[Kate Beckinsale]]). Christina explains that Ms. Webb is in fact their Nanny Tess ([[Anna Massey]]), and that she wrote to David at the urging of the Mariell siblings, Christina, Robert and Simon. The siblings are concerned for her mental health and believe her belief in ghosts is due to her senility. She drives David to the palatial Edbrook House, where he meets Christina's two brothers and the withdrawn Nanny Tess.  David begins to perform forensic examinations of the house, trying to detect evidence of paranormal activity. Complicating the investigation is Christina's continuous flirtation with David, and his own infatuation with her. However, older brother Robert ([[Anthony Andrews]]) is adamantly against their friendship and the two have a suspiciously close relationship. David himself begins having paranormal experiences. Christina, who had originally told David both her parents died in [[India]], admits that in fact her mother drowned herself in the lake and Nanny Tess was the one who discovered the body. David postulates that it is the trauma of this which is causing Nanny Tess to see the ghost of Mrs. Mariell.  When David decides to finally leave Edbrook, he asks Christina to come away with him. Although she refuses, they engage in a passionate kiss and end up in making love in her bed. In the morning when David wakes, the wind is gusting through the house, which is now cloaked in black drapes and littered with fallen leaves. He searches for Christina but instead sees the ghost of his twin sister Juliet, who leads David to a cemetery. Juliet calls his attention to a specific [[tombstone]] which states that Robert, Christina and Simon Mariell all died in a fire at Edbrook House in 1923.  A very confused David seeks out Dr. Doyle ([[John Gielgud]]), the family doctor, only to be told by his sister's ghost that Doyle also had died many years ago. Despite his sister's warning, David leaves with Christina, who has appeared in her car. On the drive home he sees the vision of his sister in the middle of the road and wrenches the wheel to avoid her. The car crashes into a tree and explodes, killing Christina. David escapes, returns to the house, and confronts Nanny Tess. She confirms that the Mariell siblings are indeed dead and that their ghosts will do anything to keep Nanny Tess and David from leaving. Nanny Tess also reveals that the reason Mrs. Mariell drowned herself was because she discovered drunken Simon and Robert in their parent's bed having [[incest|incestuous sex]] with Christina. The siblings appear and force Nanny Tess to confess to their murder (she had locked the siblings in a bedroom and then set fire to the house).  Robert reveals that, with David as the new victim of their torments, they no longer need Nanny Tess. They kill Nanny Tess, and Christina asks David to die for them. He tries to escape, but is blocked by the three siblings and Dr. Doyle. They set the mansion ablaze, but he escapes to the upstairs bedroom. While Robert, Simon and Christina cackle mockingly within the flames at his imminent death, Juliet suddenly appears and walks through the flames, takes David by the hand and rescues him from the inferno. As they walk away from the mansion's ruins, Juliet absolves him of his guilt over her death and departs to the afterlife.  After the harrowing experience, David returns home and is greeted by his assistant, Kate, as he steps off the train. A few steps behind the unsuspecting couple, Christina steps out of the shadows and follows them through the [[fog]] as they leave the platform.

A Man ([[Raymond J. Barry]]) enters and announces a [[stick up|stick-up]]. As the bartender reaches for a gun, the Man shoots and kills him.

Heat (1995 film)
 Neil McCauley, a highly skilled career criminal, and his crew – Chris Shiherlis, Michael Cheritto, and Trejo – hire Waingro to help them rob $1.6 million in [[bearer bonds]] from an armored car. During the heist, Waingro impulsively kills one guard, prompting another to reach for his [[Pocket pistol|concealed pistol]], forcing the crew to kill him as well. McCauley gives the order to kill the third guard so as not to leave an eyewitness, but is furious with Waingro for the unnecessary escalation. The crew attempts to kill Waingro, but he escapes.  McCauley's [[fence (criminal)|fence]], Nate, suggests he sell the stolen bonds back to their original owner, [[money laundering|money launderer]] Roger Van Zant, who could profit by claiming the insurance on the bonds. Van Zant agrees, but instructs his men to ambush McCauley at the meeting. McCauley survives the ambush and vows revenge against Van Zant.  [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Major Crimes Unit Lieutenant Vincent Hanna is called in to investigate the robbery, along with Sergeant Drucker and Detectives Casals, Bosko, and Schwartz. An [[informant]] connects Cheritto to the robbery, and Hanna's team surveils him, leading them to the rest of the crew. When Hanna's team discovers that the crew's next target is a precious metals depository, they set up a stake out, but their presence is detected by McCauley and the crew abandons the job. Hanna opts to let them go so that he can continue gathering evidence against the crew rather than arresting them on a minor breaking and entering charge.  Despite the increased police surveillance, McCauley's crew agrees to one last brazen bank robbery worth $12.2 million to secure their financial futures. Hanna pulls over McCauley on the freeway and invites him to coffee. Face-to-face, the aging professionals realize that they've both prioritized excellence in their fields at the expense of their personal lives. Hanna admits that his third marriage is near failure and the toll this takes on his step-daughter Lauren. McCauley confides that his solitary lifestyle has prevented him from finding a romantic partner, and that he doesn't know how to reconcile this with his feelings for his new girlfriend. Despite their mutual respect for one another's skill, they both acknowledge that they will not hesitate to kill the other if necessary. When he returns to his office, Hanna realizes that McCauley's crew have all slipped their surveillance.  Waingro threatens information out of Trejo, having made a deal with Van Zant to help eliminate McCauley's crew. Acting on a tip from Van Zant's bodyguard Hugh Benny, the LAPD intercept the crew just as they are leaving the bank, resulting in a massive shootout in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. Bosko and other police are killed, while McCauley loses Cheritto and his alternate driver Donald Breeden. McCauley subsequently arrives at Trejo's house to find his wife dead. A dying Trejo reveals Waingro's betrayal, prompting McCauley to kill Van Zant. McCauley's girlfriend, Eady, realizes that he is a criminal but ultimately agrees to flee the country with him. Shiherlis attempts to reconnect with his wife, who is helping the LAPD with a [[sting operation]]. She changes her mind and helps him escape, albeit without a way to keep their son in his life.  Hanna finds his daughter's body in the bathtub after a suicide attempt and rushes her to the hospital. He and his wife, Justine, agree to go their separate ways after learning that she has survived. Meanwhile, McCauley is free to leave the country with Eady, but learns of Waingro's location and abandons his usual caution to seek revenge. The LAPD, acting on information from Benny, learns of McCauley's presence at Waingro's hotel. McCauley kills Waingro, but before he can return to Eady and escape, he is spotted by the arriving Hanna and forced to flee on foot, leaving her behind. Hanna pursues McCauley onto the tarmac at [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] and mortally wounds him. Hanna takes his hand as McCauley succumbs to his injuries.  
Heavy (film)
 The film begins at Pete and Dolly's, a small [[diner|roadside diner]]/[[tavern]] in sleepy [[upstate New York]], where thirty-something Victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is a cook employed by his mother, Dolly (Shelley Winters), the owner of the restaurant. Dolly spends most of her time sitting in a chair in the back of the kitchen, reminiscing about her late husband and antagonizing [[waitress]] Delores (Deborah Harry), a lonely woman who has worked at the restaurant for fifteen years, and also had a meaningless [[affair]] with Dolly's husband.  The routine and rhythm of the restaurant is changed when Dolly hires a new waitress, Callie ([[Liv Tyler]]). She is sweet and soft-spoken, and a [[college]] [[Dropping out|drop out]]. She catches the eye of the painfully shy, [[overweight]] Victor. Callie's presence complicates the lives of the rest of the employees, and even some of the local regulars, such as Leo (Joe Grifasi), an [[alcoholic]] friend of Delores and long-time customer of Dolly's.  Throughout the film, Victor, who is so shy he can hardly communicate with Callie, develops a crush on her, despite her already having a boyfriend. Callie, impressed by Victor's cooking, suggests he attend the "fancy" cooking school across the river—the [[Culinary Institute of America]]—a thought which is considered by Victor but dismissed by both his mother and Delores. Victor subtly vies for Callie's attention, but her feelings for him are of a [[platonic love|platonic]] nature. Nonetheless, she finds companionship in him.  Meanwhile, Dolly depends on Victor greatly, as he still lives at home with her and takes care of the household work and shopping. Eventually Dolly's health begins to decline, and she is hospitalized after suffering a [[heart attack]]. After several weeks, when Callie demands to see Dolly, Victor takes her to the local cemetery where Dolly has been buried. Victor had not told anyone at the restaurant of his mother's death, fearing that it would "change things."  Callie breaks down crying, and doesn't return for her following shift at the restaurant.  Victor's issues of [[self-esteem]], stemming from his weight and the revelation of his mother's death come to surface several nights later at the restaurant, when Callie arrives after closing to collect her check and say goodbye. He asks for her to come and visit occasionally and she agrees—she plans on going back home and returning to college. The film ends with a slightly more confident Victor at the local grocery mart, chatting with a female cashier who appeared throughout the film.  
Heavyweights
 As school ends for the summer, Gerry Garner ([[Aaron Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]]) is sent by his parents to Camp Hope, a [[weight loss]] camp for boys. Despite worrying at first, Gerry makes friends easily at camp and learns that Camp Hope is actually a lot of fun and won't be nearly as bad as he thinks (as one veteran of the camp put it, Gerald is "not the fat kid, everyone's the fat kid"). He also discovers that the other campers have smuggled in enough [[junk food]] to easily stave off the hunger pangs and probably counteract any weight loss that the camp programs cause.  But all is not well at Camp Hope. The first night of the summer brings the revelation that the original owners of Camp Hope ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]) have entered bankruptcy and the camp has been bought by [[Physical fitness|fitness]] entrepreneur Tony Perkis ([[Ben Stiller]]), who announces his plan to make the camp's new exercise regimen into the top [[weight loss]] [[infomercial]] in the country. Tony tries to make himself seem like someone the campers can relate to, saying that he was a fat kid when he was younger too, but his methods of motivating the campers border on [[psychosis|psychotic]].  Tony cleanses the [[cottage#Cottages in North America|cabins]] of the campers' food caches, cuts off their contact with the outside world, and installs an exercise outline of trendy fitness techniques that downplay fun to the point of humiliation.  The campers discover a secret food stash (which is restocked by other people in exchange for money at night) and actually gain weight despite Tony's fitness regimen. Eventually, at the halfway point of summer, Tony decides to weigh the boys and mark their progress. Once he realizes that the boys have been gaining weight instead of losing it, Tony forces them on a 20-mile hike, reasoning that this will not only help the boys work off some of their extra weight, but will also restore discipline. On the hike, the campers trick Tony into falling into a deep pit, severely injuring him. The boys bring Tony back to camp and imprison him in a makeshift cell of [[chicken wire]] electrified with a [[bug zapper]]. They also undo all of Tony's modifications to the camp, and incapacitate his counselors, some of whom eventually turn to their side.  In the celebration of Tony's downfall, the boys throw a bonfire party with a lot of [[binge eating]]. They order in junk food such as pizzas and submarine sandwiches, gorge themselves on chocolate and drench themselves in soda.  The next morning, Pat Finley, a counselor who had come to Camp Hope every summer since he was 10, tells the kids to finally start taking responsibility and start actually losing weight. The boys begin following a more healthy regimen and start to make Camp Hope a fun place again.  On parents' visiting day, the parents are shown a video of Tony's cruelty. While they are watching, Tony escapes his prison and ends up exchanging quips and then blows with Gerry's father. In an attempt to make an impressive exit, Tony attempts a series of [[backflip]]s, stumbles, and [[knock out|incapacitates]] himself. The parents tell Tony his days of terrorizing their kids are over. Tony's own father shows up to take the keys and deed for the camp away from his son to ensure this doesn't happen again. He states that the camp will be closed, and all of the money paid for admission refunded.  But the campers don't want to leave Camp Hope. Despite Tony Perkis, the camp and the friends they have made are still a lot of fun, so Tony's father appoints Pat as the camp leader. Afterwards, Pat starts really putting the campers to work to win an annual competition against some rather athletic, and perhaps somewhat over-competitive campers who are trained to go at this competition with everything they have, which up until Pat took over made the competition rather one-sided. Pat, however, has been training them not to lose hope, and just to have fun, which they do. It turns out that they have just enough ability to win, which they do in the end, to the distress of the counselors at the overly-competitive athletic camp, who have already decided that the trophy belongs to them, and believe that Pat is crazy for being more concerned about having fun than winning. Pat has the trophy thrown into the lake and then kisses Julie, the camp's new nurse whom he'd been developing a relationship with throughout the film, in triumph as Gerry thanks Pat for the greatest summer of his life.  In a brief [[post-credits scene]], Tony is shown as a door-to-door salesman selling healing [[crystals]].  
Heavy Weather (film)
 Though abridged for a 90-minute film, ''Heavy Weather'' follows closely the novel of 1933, the fourth in the Blandings series. Many of the familiar elements of the Blandings books are present: the wish of [[Lord Emsworth]]'s nephew, Ronnie Fish, to marry a chorus girl, Sue Brown; the concern of Emsworth's sisters, the imperious [[Lady Constance Keeble]] and Ronnie's mother Lady Julia Fish, to ensure that the reminiscences of their other brother, the Hon. [[Galahad Threepwood]], were not published; Galahad's protectiveness towards Miss Brown, the daughter of his long lost love Dolly Henderson; the sustained efforts of the publisher [[George Alexander Pyke, Lord Tilbury|Lord Tilbury]] (a character probably based on [[Lord Northcliffe]]) to gain possession of the reminiscences; Lord Emsworth's determination that his prize Berkshire pig, the [[Empress of Blandings]], should win the silver medal in the fat pigs class at the [[Shrewsbury]] agricultural show; Lord Emsworth's employment of a private detective, [[Percy Frobisher Pilbeam|P. Frobisher Pilbeam]], to protect the Empress and his rivalry with his neighbour, [[Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe|Sir Gregory Parsloe]],<ref>Sir Gregory's full surname was Parsloe-Parsloe, though this was never revealed in the television drama and Wodehouse usually wrote the name simply as "Parsloe".</ref> of Matchingham Hall, who had not only his own designs on the fat pigs class, but, as a prospective [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Parliamentary]] candidate, an interest in suppressing Galahad's reminiscences; and the employment as Lord Emsworth's secretary of [[Monty Bodkin]], who, as with most holders of that office, had an ulterior motive (in this instance, the need to hold down paid employment for a year in order to be considered suitable to marry one Gertrude Butterwick).  
Heidi (1995 film)

Higher Learning
   At fictitious Columbus University, students Malik Williams, a black track athlete, Kristen Connor, a white woman, and Remy, a white young man, are starting their freshman year.  Kristen's roommate is Monet, a black student. Malik's roommate is Wayne, a white student. Both sets of roommates generally get along.  Monet and Malik attend a [[Dormitory|dorm]] party hosted by Fudge, an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and militant senior. Remy, Fudge's roommate, is upset at the loud [[Hip hop music|rap music]] being played so late. He flags down an all-white campus security patrol to break up the party. Fudge is upset that lead Officer Bradley comes down hard on the black students, but allows the room down the hall to continue their loud "[[hillbilly]]" music. Kristen, while walking home, meets Taryn, a junior as well as an openly [[lesbian]] student. Taryn warns her about walking alone late at night and invites her to a student group.  Malik and Kristen's introductory [[political science]] class is taught by Professor Maurice Phipps, a conservative black man from the [[West Indies]]. Professor Phipps challenges the class to determine who they are for themselves and not let others categorize them.  Fudge and his friend Dreads play loud music, disrupting Remy's studying. When Remy complains, Fudge mocks and threatens him, causing Remy to move in with a new roommate, Jewish student David. Later, Remy loses at a video game to Malik, who further mocks him.  Frat boy Billy rapes a drunken Kristen. Monet finds Kristen crying on her bed, then fields a racially charged call from Billy. Angered, Monet turns to Fudge, who recruits his friends to confront him at a frat party. Kristen points out Billy to the black students, who pull him outside and force him to apologize to Monet (not knowing that he raped Kristen).  Kristen joins Taryn's student group on harmony between different races and cliques. With time, she eventually opens up to Taryn about her rape, with Taryn encouraging her to report it and attempting to console her. As days pass, Kristen slowly realizes her growing attraction to Taryn.  Remy has become more isolated.  He is invited for a drink by Scott Moss, a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[skinhead]], along with Scott's skinhead friends: Erik, James, and the weight-lifting, hulking Knocko.  Malik confronts Phipps about a paper, arguing for a better grade. When Phipps shows him the various spelling and grammar errors, Malik calls him a sellout for the "white establishment". Phipps angrily responds that the world owes Malik nothing and he must work for his own good to make a difference in the world. When Malik's teammates confront him for a poor performance at a track meet, he responds with Fudge's militant Afrocentric ideology. He walks away and flirts with fellow runner Deja. With time they become a couple, and Deja helps Malik with his essay and spelling errors.  Remy spends more time with Scott and his gang. Scott preaches his racist beliefs, and the troubled Remy is slowly being convinced that "the white man is endangered", agreeing to shave his head and join Scott's group.  After attending a rape awareness rally with Taryn, Kristen asks to spend the night. Taryn rebuffs her, wanting Kristen to be sure. Kristen eventually starts separate relationships with Wayne and Taryn, who are unaware that Kristen is sleeping with both of them.  Remy confronts Malik with racial slurs. Remy later pulls a handgun on Malik and David, hurling racial slurs at them both as he packs his belongings and drops out of the university. Again, Officer Bradley and the all-white campus security assume Malik is at fault, letting Remy escape. Malik decides to move in with Fudge and his like-minded black friends, while Remy moves in with Scott and the neo-Nazi skinheads.  After Malik and his black friends win a fistfight against Remy and his skinhead friends, Scott first tells Remy he should not drop out of school because they do not just need soldiers, but also educated people like lawyers to fight for their cause. However Remy, feeling punked by Malik, just wants to turn to violence. So after Remy insists that he is "for real", Scott sighs and shows Remy the sniper rifle. He challenges Remy to kill for the [[White people|white race]].  Kristen organizes a peace festival with Monet to calm down the students. Malik and Deja attend, and are caught in the frenzy when Remy opens fire from the rooftop of a nearby building. Two students are killed, including Deja, who dies in Malik's arms. Malik runs into the building and attacks Remy, trying to choke him to death when Officer Bradley and his campus guards intervene and beat Malik while letting Remy go. The campus guards finally approach Remy, who apologizes to Bradley and his men for everything that he did and commits suicide.  A few days later, Malik and Phipps discuss his future at the university, with Phipps saying he trusts Malik's judgment. Later, Malik and Kristen are seen talking, for the first time, at an impromptu memorial site. Kristen feels guilty about the deaths because she started the Peace Fest, but Malik assuages her guilt.  As Phipps leaves his office, the final shot shows the United States flag fluttering in the wind as the caption "unlearn" appears over it, fading to the closing credits.

He soon discovers his wife and son are on board the explosives-rigged bus. Kit sends a subordinate to disarm the bomb, but matters are complicated due to the intricate setup of the bomb, which eventually explodes, killing everyone on the bus, including Kit's family.  As a result, he leaves the bomb squad, and for years Kit serves as a stunt double for martial arts action star Frankie Lone.  However, Helen, a tabloid reporter, films one of his stunts and thus discovers Lone's duplicity. She decides to use it to boost her show's ratings.  At a wrap party for Frankie's film, Frankie's father and his manager invite Kit to a jewelry exhibition at the newly opened Hotel Grandeur, but the Doctor also targets the exhibition. At a traffic stop, Kit overhears the Doctor uttering a [[catchphrase]] which he used during the school bus bombing, and realizing the Doctor's identity, he follows the car back to the Hotel Grandeur, but is unable to convince the hotel manager of the impending threat. At a nearby police station, only Detective Kam Chow and a desk sergeant believe him.  The Doctor and his team take over the building, take the guests hostage, and initiate a massacre. Kit and Chow return, only to find themselves ambushed by the Doctor's gang members in a shootout, in which Chow is injured. Frankie manages to escape and runs into Fai, who pretends to be a helpless damsel in distress, leading him right to her partner, Bond. It is revealed that Bond is obsessed with beating Frankie in combat. Frankie runs away after encountering Bond.    Kit and Chow thin out the Doctor's numbers after driving the car out of the freight elevator. Frankie's father wrestles a weapon away from a terrorist and threatens the hacker trying to deactivate the exhibit's security measures. Chow is reunited with his girlfriend Joyce. Kit tries to kill the Doctor in revenge when the villain mocks him, but the attempt tips the scales back in the terrorists' favor. Kit, Helen and Frankie's father barely manage to escape.  Helen runs into a room with an exhibit of poisonous reptiles, places the videotape underneath a display case and hides in the men's washroom. The Doctor's younger brother, Rabbit, comes in, checks himself out in the mirror and leaves, but not before throwing some of the snakes into the bathroom. Kit and the Lones rescue Helen, but not before she has been poisoned. Kit finds an anti-venom serum, and learns that Helen managed to record the Doctor's face in her footage.    Meanwhile, the Doctor warns the police that if they do not meet his impossible demands, he will toss a hostage out the window every ten minutes, with Frankie's manager Charlie Tso as the first victim. Kit goes to retrieve the tape. He is ambushed by Rabbit, but kills him. Kit barely recovers the tape before being blown out of the building with a hand grenade.

The Lones meet Fai and Bond in the midst of an argument that has escalated into a fight. The Lones intervene, unaware of Fai's true colors, until she holds them at gunpoint. Bond pressures Frankie into fighting him. After Frankie kills Bond, Fai is about to murder the rest of them, but Chow shoots her dead.  The Doctor intercepts a police transmission and sends his men to ambush the helicopter. Helen manages to warn Kit, who rams the helicopter into the building.

Kit, however, leaves with Helen, who expresses her gratitude with an announcement of wishing to marry him.  
Hideaway (film)
 After killing two women and ritualistically arranging their bodies as a sacrifice to Satan, a [[Devil]] worshipper (Sisto) invokes a Satanic verse in a room filled with candles and Satanic imagery. He then commits suicide by throwing himself onto an [[athame]] in order to damn his soul.  What follows next is a [[near-death experience]] where the now dead killer flies through tunnels of light, eventually arriving at a gaping, [[tentacle]] like [[Phanuel (angel)|being of light]] who, after flashing through scenes of the recent brutal murders, darkens and casts the killer's soul down into [[Hell]].  Hatch Harrison (Goldblum) is on a drive with his family. Harrison gets into a car accident and is pronounced dead, only to be revived two hours later by specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Molina).  During this time, Hatch experiences visions of the same tunnels of light as the killer from the first scene, but upon arriving for judgement is slowly floated into a surreal setting, where he sees his young daughter who died years before in a car accident.  Hatch then enters [[Heaven]] and is merged into the light of a great [[angel]].  Upon being revived back to life, Hatch wakes up to learn that his wife Lindsay (Lahti), and daughter Regina (Silverstone), were also involved in the car accident but escaped without serious injuries.  He then concludes that his visions of heaven were merely a dream.  After the accident and subsequent revival, Harrison begins to experience other mysterious visions. These involve him seeing murders through the eyes of a killer. Harrison realizes that the murders are actually happening when the women he sees being murdered are announced as missing in news reports. The character Harrison sees committing the murders is later shown to be the same character who committed suicide in the opening sequence. The man, who is identified as "Vassago", talks to Harrison's daughter at a night club, which Harrison sees in his visions.  Harrison attempts to stop Vassago from murdering only to be told that he is experiencing mental problems by his family, his psychiatrist, and the police. Harrison visits a [[psychic]] (Chong) who confirms his beliefs and tells him that Vassago is also having visions in which he can see through Harrison's eyes. It is then revealed that Vassago, whose real name is Jeremy Nyebern, is the son of Dr. Nyebern and he had killed his mother and sister. After his suicide, he had been revived from the dead by his father.  Vassago then kidnaps Regina, taking her to an abandoned [[amusement park]] where he kills his father after being confronted by him. As Harrison and his wife find them, the souls of Vassago and Harrison collide in battle. Harrison (revealing himself to Vassago as "Uriel," Vassago's antithesis) is the victor, killing Vassago and saving Regina. With his family safe, he exits the park with them.  The final scene after the credits shows Vassago being pulled in to be revived again. The operation is a success, but Vassago wakes up, takes a scalpel, and slits a nurse's throat. Hatch wakes up in his bed, realizing he was only dreaming. He then hugs Lindsay and falls back to sleep.

As she is dropping her mother off at the airport, Kitt informs Claudia that she intends to have sex with her boyfriend for the first time while she’s gone. While on the plane, Claudia makes a phone call to Tommy, her younger brother and confidant who she believes won’t be attending the Thanksgiving dinner, telling him that she lost her job, made out with her boss, and knows that her daughter is going to sleep with her boyfriend.  When Claudia arrives at the airport, she is greeted by her parents, who drive her to their home and help her unpack. Claudia remarks that she’s thinking of looking into new careers, and her mother concludes that Claudia lost her job, which she initially denies. That night, Tommy arrives with his new friend Leo Fish, whom Claudia believes to be his boyfriend. Claudia is glad to see her brother but fears that he and Jack, his boyfriend, have broken up.  The next day, more family members arrive, including their eccentric Aunt Glady (Adele’s sister), who once was a very bright Latin teacher now shows signs of dementia.

Joanne says, “If I just met you on the street...if you gave me your phone number, I’d throw it away.” Claudia responds "We don’t have to like each other, we're family".   On the drive home, Leo tells Claudia that Tommy showed him a picture of her, and he came to Thanksgiving to meet her. The two talk for a while in the living room at her parents’ house; but Tommy, who is sleeping on the floor, wakes up and reminds Leo that they have to get an early start in the morning.

The Horseman on the Roof
 In July 1832, [[Italians|Italian]] patriots hiding out in [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], France, are betrayed by one of their own, and [[Austrians|Austrian]] agents are on their trail. One patriot, Giacomo, is dragged away and executed. His wife runs off to warn their friend, Angelo Pardi ([[Olivier Martinez]]), a young Italian nobleman in France raising money for the [[Italian unification|Italian revolution]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. As the agents descend on his apartment, Angelo escapes into the countryside.  At [[Meyrargues]], Angelo looks for his compatriot and childhood friend, Maggionari, and then continues on to another village, where he writes to his mother, "Always fleeing. When can I fight and show what your son can do?" His mother purchased his commission as a colonel in the Piedmont Hussars, and he's never seen battle. Angelo encounters Maggionari, who turns out to be the traitor. When the Austrian agents arrive, Angelo fights them off and escapes.  The next day, Angelo enters a village ravaged by a [[cholera]] epidemic. The sight of the corpses abandoned to the scavenging crows sickens him. He meets a country physician, who shows him how to treat cholera victims by vigorously rubbing alcohol on the skin. Angelo continues north, passing a small village where corpses are being burned. He meets a young woman and two children and accompanies them to the outskirts of [[Manosque]]. The young woman, who is a tutor and lover of books, gives him a copy of ''Rinaldo and Armida'' as a parting gift.  While in Manosque, Angelo is captured by a paranoid mob who accuse him of poisoning the town fountain. He is taken to the authorities, who soon abandon their posts in fear. Angelo searches for a compatriot, but encounters the Austrian agents. Angelo eludes them, and with sword in hand, fights his way through the hysterical mob and escapes across the rooftops. From his refuge above the town, Angelo watches one of the agents chased down and beaten to death, and later watches the piles of corpses being burned in the night.  To escape the rain, Angelo enters a dwelling where he is discovered by Countess Pauline de Théus ([[Juliette Binoche]]). Apologizing for his presence, Angelo reassures her that he is a gentleman. Pauline offers him food and drink, and soon he falls asleep from exhaustion. The following morning, Pauline is gone and Angelo joins the forced evacuation of the town. In the hills outside Manosque, Angelo meets his compatriot, Giuseppe, who possesses money raised for the Italian resistance, but which cannot now be delivered because of the quarantine and roadblocks. Angelo agrees to deliver the money to Milan using backroads. Before leaving, he encounters the traitor, Maggionari, who attempts to kill Angelo before succumbing to cholera.  Angelo and Pauline meet again, and she joins him in a daring river escape. At [[Les Mées, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence|Les Mées]], rather than head east toward the Italian border, Angelo accompanies Pauline north toward her castle near [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]]. Angelo insists it is his duty, so they set off through the countryside, avoiding the plague-ridden towns. Forced to camp out in the open, romantic feelings develop between the two, but Angelo remains gallant. Asked if he comes from a military family, Angelo reveals he never knew his father, saying, "He came to Italy with [[Napoleon]], then left." Everything he learned in life came from his mother.  The next day, they travel to a heavily garrisoned village where they visit a friend of Pauline's husband and learn that he returned to Manosque to search for her. Determined to find her husband, Pauline leaves Angelo and rides off. Angelo follows, only to see her captured by the militia, who take her into quarantine at a convent. Knowing if she stays there she will die, Angelo surrenders to the militia in order to rescue her. Pauline understands he's risked his life again for her. Angelo orchestrates another daring escape by setting fire to the convent. Impressed by Angelo's bravery and intelligence, Pauline promises to trust the young Piedmont Hussard, saying, "I'll obey you like a soldier." Their mutual affection continues to grow as they make their way toward her castle at [[Théus]].  As night descends, they seek shelter from the rain in a small abandoned mansion, where they warm themselves at the fireplace and drink wine. Pauline conveys her feelings for him, but Angelo remains a gentleman. Pauline recounts how she met her husband, forty years her senior. She was a sixteen-year-old country doctor's daughter when she found him near death with a bullet in his chest. Her father saved his life, and she tended to him for days, nursing him back to health. When he recovered, he left without revealing his identity, but six months later, he returned and asked for her hand in marriage—revealing he was a Count with extensive property.  Angelo prepares to leave, but Pauline decides to stay in the mansion for the night. As she climbs the staircase, she collapses showing symptoms of cholera. Angelo rushes her to the fireplace, rips the clothing from her body, and vigorously rubs alcohol on her skin—tending to her throughout the night trying to save her life. In the morning, Angelo is awakened by Pauline's frail but loving touch. Soon they are back on the road, completing the last few miles to Pauline's castle, where they are met by her husband, Count Laurent de Théus. Angelo leaves and returns to Italy to fight in the revolution.   One year later, Pauline returns to Aix where everything appears as it once was—but the cholera has taken a heavy toll. She looks for the house near the Bishop's Palace where Angelo stayed. She writes letters to Angelo, inquiring after his condition. Another year passes, and Pauline finally receives a letter at the castle from Angelo. She walks off alone to read it, while the Count watches from a window, knowing Angelo's memory would not fade. Pauline looks east toward the snow-covered [[Alps]] that separate her from Italy and Colonel Angelo Pardi, the young gallant officer who once saved her life.<ref name="dvd"></ref>  
Houseguest

Twenty-five years later, he drives a rusted [[MG Midget]] and all his ambitions revolve around a series of ill fated [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s. A handshake loan of $5,000 from the [[Organized crime|mob]] grows to $50,000 through interest and penalties, resulting in him trying to skip town at [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].   He overhears a conversation between lawyer Gary Young (Hartman) and his children, who are waiting to pick up his childhood friend, Derek Bond, who is now a successful, straight-laced and [[vegetarian]] [[dentist]]. Upon hearing him say that he hasn't seen Bond in twenty five years and doesn't know what he looks like, Franklin gives his baseball cap to the real Bond to throw off the two dimwitted mobsters chasing him and poses as Bond to the Youngs, who take him to their posh home in [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]].  Although he knows nothing about dentistry, Franklin still manages to convince those around him that he is in fact Derek Bond, and his affable personality makes him popular with Young's otherwise stuffy and rich associates. Young has little time for his children and his wife ([[Kim Greist]]) who runs a chain of successful new [[frozen yogurt]] businesses, which gradually builds a gap between them, largely due to the demands of his bigoted, arrogant boss ([[Mason Adams]]) at the law firm where he works; this leads to Franklin developing a bond with Young's [[Goth subculture|Goth]] daughter, helping her stand up to her cheating boyfriend, and his young son, who has aspirations of playing pro [[basketball]]. Young eventually stands up to his boss with Franklin's support and quits the firm to be with his family.   Meanwhile, the mob thugs threaten Franklin's best friend, Larry ([[Stan Shaw]]), into revealing his whereabouts, and Franklin asks him to pick him up. After he does so reluctantly, he sparks an argument with him over his lack of appreciation of friendship, causing him to realize that Young has been his friend all along. He returns to the Youngs' house only to find that the mobsters have taken them hostage, and his true identity is revealed when the real Derek Bond finally shows up.  After the mobsters take Franklin away, he manages to escape, losing them in a charity [[marathon]], where he meets up with Young, who graciously decides to help him despite his charade, in return for helping bring his family closer together. Franklin reveals that he has an instant [[lottery]] ticket he purchased the previous day for a chance at a $1,000,000 cash prize spin on a Saturday night television show, which he reluctantly gives up to the mobsters in exchange for the forgiveness of his debt.  The film fast forwards to wintertime, Franklin [[parallel parking|parallel park]]s a shiny new red Porsche with Larry in tow, in front of the Youngs' house, appearing for a promotional party for his new [[best-seller]] book, ''Handbook for Houseguests'', based on his experiences with them. The partygoers gather in front of the television to watch the mobsters spin the wheel for the jackpot.   It initially lands on the million dollar jackpot, but then falls and lands on $5,000, much to the mafia don's dismay and Franklin's delight. During the closing credits, Young and Franklin sing a medley of food based parodies of Christmas songs, as they cook a barbecue in Youngs' backyard outside of a Christmas party.  
The Hunted (1995 film)
 Paul Racine (Lambert), a computer chip company executive from New York, is on a business trip to [[Nagoya]]. He meets Kirina (Chen) in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. After they part ways, Kirina is approached by Kinjo (Lone) and two henchmen. Kinjo is the leader of the Makato cult, an organization of [[ninja]] assassins that was hired to kill her. He boasts that no one has seen his face and lived. Kirina shows no fear of dying, so he grants her final wish to show her his face. Racine returns, looking for his room key, and tries to defend Kirina, but he is late. Kinjo decapitates her as his men stab Racine, hit him with a poisoned [[shuriken]] and cut his throat, leaving him for dead.  Racine awakens in a hospital room, but his claims of his encounter with ninjas are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura ([[Masumi Okada|Okada]]) dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a [[yakuza]] syndicate. Racine is approached by Ijuro Takeda (Harada), an expert on the cult and on Kinjo. Takeda claims Racine's life is in danger as he has seen Kinjo's face. Racine also finds out that Takeda is the last in a [[samurai]] line and has a feud with Kinjo. The ninjas attempt to finish Racine off at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but he escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko (Shimada) subsequently take him to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda secretly uses Racine as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko kill the attackers, but discover that Kinjo did not take part in the assault. The ninjas' leader was Junko ([[Mari Natsuki|Natsuki]]), Kinjo's lover; this increases Kinjo's motivation to kill Racine and Takeda.  During the boat ride to the island, Mieko explains the history of the conflict between the two clans and the samurai concepts of courage and honor to Racine. On the island, Racine spends time with the drunken [[bladesmith]] Oshima ([[Takayuki Kubota|Kubota]]), who is constructing a [[katana]] for Takeda. Despite the language barrier, the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Meanwhile, Kinjo decides to find out who hired his clan to murder Kirina. The man he finds, Nemura ([[James Saito|Saito]]), is a powerful yakuza figure who bought Kirina from her pimp uncle, then ordered her death when she left him after years of servitude. Disgusted that he killed an innocent woman over such a petty grievance, Kinjo kills the man.  Three weeks after Kirina's death, Takeda's new sword is ready, and Racine's injuries have healed. Takeda arrives at the island and is dismayed to find that Oshima has been training Racine. He humiliates Racine in a friendly duel. When Racine announces that he wants to leave the island and return home to New York, Takeda has him imprisoned and alerts Kinjo of his whereabouts. Hordes of ninjas arrive, overwhelming Takeda's inexperienced samurai, but Takeda gets the duel with Kinjo he wanted. Kinjo is victorious, stabbing Takeda through the torso; Takeda in turn stabs Kinjo in the leg, but soon dies.  As Kinjo is about to kill a helpless Mieko he is caught off-guard by Racine, whom Oshima had released on Mieko's instructions. Racine stabs Kinjo in the right shoulder, hurting his dominant arm. However, he is armed with only a sword he barely knows how to use. With his newfound skills and assistance from Mieko, Racine manages to decapitate Kinjo. Oshima then arrives in battle gear, and is annoyed to find all the ninjas dead. Racine, Mieko, and Oshima walk up the hill toward the family castle.

He assigns Cane's editor, Linda Styles ([[Julie Carmen]]), to accompany him. Linda explains that Cane's stories have been known to cause disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in "less stable readers". Trent is skeptical, convinced that the disappearance is a publicity stunt. Trent notices red lines on Cane's book's covers which, when aligned properly, form the outline of [[New Hampshire]] and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.  They set out to find the town. Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive, and they inexplicably arrive at Hobb's End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town, encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Cane's novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishing's claim was a stunt to promote Cane's book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobb's End were not part of the plan.  Linda enters a church to confront Cane, who exposes her to his final novel, ''In the Mouth of Madness'', which drives her insane; she begins embracing and kissing Cane passionately. A man ([[Wilhelm von Homburg]]) approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside the bar, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him. Trent drives away from Hobb's End, but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church with Linda, where Cane explains that the public's belief in his stories freed an ancient race of monstrous beings which will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent is merely one of his characters, who must follow Cane's plot and return the manuscript of ''In The Mouth of Madness'' to Arcane Publishing, furthering the end of humanity.  After giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears his face open, creating a portal to the dimension of Cane's monstrous masters. Trent sees a long tunnel that Cane said would take him back to his world, and urges Linda to come with him. She tells him she can't, because she has already read the entire book. Trent races down the hall, with Cane's monsters close on his heels. He trips and falls, then suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript. Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent relates his experience to Harglow. Harglow claims ignorance of Linda; Trent was sent alone to find Cane, and the manuscript was delivered months earlier. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' has been on sale for weeks, with a [[Novel adaptation|film adaptation]] in [[post production]]. Trent is arrested after he murders a reader of the newly released novel, who has altered eyes and a nosebleed; Trent asks if he is enjoying the book, and when the dazed reader nods, Trent tells him he should not be surprised before swinging the axe.  After Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned. He departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, including mutating humans, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent goes to see the ''In the Mouth of Madness'' film and discovers that he is the main character. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, including a scene where he insisted to Linda "This is reality!", Trent begins laughing hysterically before breaking down crying; finally realizing he was a character in the book all along.   
In the Bleak Midwinter (film)
  The story is set in [[Hope, Derbyshire]], England. It's Christmastime, and 'tis the season to put on Shakespeare's most cheery seasonal play: ''Hamlet''. Joe Harper takes the project on as a Final Stand of sorts under the encouragement of his catty agent, advertising in the local newspaper for actors at a low price.

The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love
 It is spring. Randy Dean is a 17-year-old student in her [[twelfth grade|final year]] with poor grades, only one friend - Frank, a [[gay]] [[Latino]] - secret cigarette and [[marijuana]] habits and a cashier’s job at a gas station with fellow worker Regina. Shunned by other students for her [[tomboy]]ish personality and appearance, she spends most of her free time either by herself or in illicit meetings with her [[affair|romantic partner]] Wendy, a married woman who drops by the gas station when it pleases her, even though Randy knows they are in a dead-end relationship. Randy lives with her [[lesbian]] aunt Rebecca and her girlfriend Vicky in their [[mobile home|trailer]], as well as Rebecca's ex-girlfriend Lena, who has no place to stay and is living with them until she finds somewhere else she can go to.  One day Evie Roy stops in a pristine [[Range Rover]], unsure if her tires need air. Randy recognizes her from school and talks to her for the first time. Evie is an only child living with her well-off, cultured mother, Evelyn, who has a difficult relationship with her remarried husband. Randy and Evie start passing notes in school and hanging out with each other, although Evie does not reveal this to her [[clique|cliquish]] friends. During this time, Randy is approached by Wendy's jealous husband Ali at the gas station, who grabs Randy and warns her to stay away from his wife. Randy spends much of her time with Evie hanging out in meadows, trading music ([[opera]] and [[Mozart]] from Evie, [[punk rock]] from Randy) and talking. When Wendy next visits her, Randy rejects her, telling her she has a new girlfriend, Evie.  Evie breaks up with her boyfriend Hayjay after he complains of her distant attitude towards him. Later, apparently on a spur of the moment, she lends Randy a copy of [[Walt Whitman]]’s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', which Randy starts to devour. Inviting Evie to her family’s small house for dinner one evening, Randy reveals to her that she has lived with Rebecca and Vicky since Randy's devoutly religious mother abandoned her to devote all her time to an [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]]-like group. On the front steps of Rebecca's house, they kiss for the first time. Evie records it in her diary later, apparently wondering what it all means.  Randy and Evie experiment with how "[[coming out|out]]" they can be as [[lesbian]]s, nervously holding hands at a local diner. Remembering Randy’s warning of how intolerant the town can be, Evie nevertheless breaks the news to her three closest friends. One girl is supportive (if confused), but the other two are hostile to the idea: one of them says, “God, Evie, if you were gonna turn gay you think you could at least choose someone who’s pretty.” Meanwhile, Randy’s grades continue to plummet and the school warns her she will not graduate; Randy hides this information from Rebecca. When Evie’s mother leaves on a business trip, the girls take the opportunity to cook a huge meal, indulging in [[wine]] and marijuana. That night, they make love, then fall asleep in Evie’s mother’s bed.  The next morning, it is Evie's 18th birthday; Evelyn returns prematurely with presents for her, but is shocked by the mess in the kitchen and the rest of the house. Furiously searching the upstairs, she discovers Evie and Randy, but only realizes Randy is a girl when she runs past her on her way out. Rebecca, who has learned that Randy will not be graduating high school, goes over to go to Frank’s house with Vicky and Lena, where Randy had told them she would be staying the night. Rebecca threatens Frank until, panicked, he turns over Evie’s phone number. She calls, but Evie and Randy have already absconded and she is left talking to a furious Evelyn.  Evie and Randy, crying, scared and accusatory, take refuge in a motel. Randy finally calls Wendy, who comes out, pays for the room and tries to comfort the girls. Ali sees her car in the parking lot, however, and comes bursting in, eventually attracting Evelyn, Rebecca, Vicky, Lena, Frank, and Evie’s three friends, who were driving past reading aloud from [[Rita Mae Brown]]’s ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'' (apparently still processing Evie’s news). The movie ends with Randy and Evie kissing and hugging in the open motel room doorway while everyone else argues in the background at top volume.  </ref>}}  
Ice Cream Man (film)
 In a [[black-and-white]]  prologue, a young boy witnesses the murder of an ice cream man in a small town. Years later, the boy, named Gregory Tudor ([[Clint Howard]]), returns to the town to become an ice cream man himself. He has spent the intervening years in a [[mental hospital]]. He kills some people (and a dog) while doing his duties as ice cream man, leading to suspicion from local kids and the police. The ice cream man even goes so far as to mix parts of people he's killed into his frozen treats, making his customers unwitting cannibals.  
I.D. (1995 film)
 John ([[Reece Dinsdale]]), an ambitious young police officer, is sent undercover to join a violent football [[List of hooligan firms|firm]] associated with the fictitious club Shadwell Town to track down the 'generals' - the shadowy figures who orchestrate the violence. His team of four gradually ingratiates itself into the lives of The Dogs, the nickname that Shadwell's fans give themselves.  The main site for this is The Rock, a public house around which The Dogs' lives revolve.  Gradually, the hard drinking, hard fighting macho culture - where Saturday's match and Saturday's fight are all that matters - proves strangely irresistible to John and he slowly finds himself becoming one of the thugs he has been sent to entrap.  His relationships with his wife, his superiors and even his team become strained, and eventually his wife returns to her parents' house and rebuffs his attempted reconciliation.  The police operation is abruptly wound up for budgeting reasons, just as it seems John is making progress in identifying those who pull the strings. The closing sequence shows a shaven-headed John taking part in a racist march, having become nothing more than a neo-nazi fascist.  One of his team approaches him to try help him, but is rebuffed, John saying that he is, again, working undercover.  There is a degree of ambiguity, and it might be that he is working undercover, though it may also be that he has become deluded and has merely mired himself in an even less pleasant world.  His fascist chanting at the very end makes it clear that whatever the truth, John is unable to prevent himself from sinking into his character.   The film features the fictitious teams of [[Shadwell|Shadwell Town]] and [[Wapping|Wapping FC]]. The locations the teams are based on are real – they are neighbouring areas on the northern bank of the [[River Thames]] in London's traditional [[East End]].  It is believed that [[Millwall F.C]] was the inspiration for one team,<ref></ref> as the clubs' fans had a long standing reputation for violence during the period which the film represents.  A sequel, with the  title of ''[[ID2: Shadwell Army]]'' was released in August 2016. It  was directed by Joel Novoa, and was  written by Vincent O'Connell.  
The Immortals (1995 film)
 A crafty nightclub owner (Jack) brings together a group of small-time hoods and teams them up in unusual pairs (black man and white racist, Ivy Leaguer and simpleton) for a set of multiple heists which turn out to be an elaborate double cross against a notorious gangster (Dominic). During an extended standoff in a nightclub between Jack and his band of thieves and Dominic's henchman, the hoods discover why Jack brought them all together for what amounts to a suicidal mission.  
The Indian in the Cupboard (film)
  On his ninth birthday, Omri  receives an old cupboard from his brother Gillon ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) and a little [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] "Indian" figure made of plastic from his best friend Patrick ([[Rishi Bhat]]). That night, Omri goes through his mom's box of old keys and finds that a gold-colored key with a red ribbon tied to it (given to his mother by her grandmother) actually fits the keyhole of his cupboard. He then looks for an object to lock in the cupboard and settles for the Indian figurine.  The next morning, he hears a small tapping noise coming from the cupboard. Omri opens the cupboard and finds a small living person hiding in the corner. It is actually the Indian figure who has magically come to life in human form. Frightened by his large acquaintance, the Indian pulls out a dagger and points it at Omri. Shortly afterward, Omri's father comes in the room to help Omri get ready for school, forcing Omri to lock the cupboard and keep the Indian a secret.  When Omri arrives home from school, he is upset to discover that the Indian has returned to its original toy form. When he goes to bed, Omri once more hears the tapping noise he heard that morning. He opens the cupboard to find the Indian alive once more. The Indian is again initially frightened of Omri but warms up to him, thinking Omri is a great spirit in a child's form, as the two begin talking, slowly forming a friendship. The Indian reveals himself as an English-speaking, 18th-century [[Onondaga people|Iroquois]] Indian named Little Bear ([[Litefoot]]) who was fighting in the [[French and Indian War]] on the side of the [[Great Britain|British]]. During Little Bear's stay with Omri, Omri learns a lot about the Iroquois. Omri also learns that Little Bear has a deceased wife. Then Omri takes Little Bear outside, but Little Bear gets hurt by a pigeon, forcing Omri to bring to life his brother's First World War British Army medic named Tommy Atkins ([[Steve Coogan]]) to treat Little Bear's wound.  After Omri  gives Little Bear tools, sticks and some paper, Little Bear crafts a longhouse and eagerly talks of hunting and sharing stories with Omri over a fire, as he does with his own people. Omri decides to surprise Little Bear with another Indian figure (resembling a Chieftain), saying Little Bear can have the Chieftain's longbow. Little Bear watches in excitement as Omri brings the figure to life. However, before Omri can send the Chieftain back, he suffers a heart attack out of fear. Omri is frightened as he has never seen someone die. Little Bear is confused as to why a spirit would be frightened at the sight of death, coming to the realization that Omri really ''is'' a child. Little Bear tells Omri to send the man back, but Omri is reluctant, worried that no one will find his body if he was alone when Omri summoned him. Little Bear yells at Omri, saying that he, Little Bear, had been guiding his nephew through the woods to teach him how to be a man when Omri had taken him away and that Omri shouldn't tamper with magic he doesn't even understand. This upsets Omri. Omri locks the dead Chieftain in the cupboard, making him plastic once more, before leaving the angry Little Bear to answer his dad calling him downstairs.  Omri's dad is upset when, after asking Omri where his saw blades went, Omri tells him that he buried them and can't remember where (Omri lied to protect Little Bear's existence). Omri's dad forgives him, saying he can just buy another set. Due to a combination of guilt and wanting to prove his maturity, Omri volunteers to go buy the new set of blades on his own. While Omri goes to the store, Little Bear is preparing the Chieftain's body, presumably still in its plastic form, for burial. As Omri leaves the hardware store, another slightly older kid knocks him into a wall and roughs him up, stealing the change Omri had left. Visibly shaken from the incident, Omri suddenly runs into Patrick, who has a plastic cowboy on a horse to go with the Indian. Patrick's mother is nearby. She notices that Omri is upset, so she and Patrick take Omri home.    Eventually, Omri reveals his secret to Patrick. However, after they find Little Bear, who had been hiding from Omri's older brothers, Little Bear begs Omri to send him home. Ignoring Omri's protests, Patrick brings to life a cowboy from 1879 called "Boohoo" Boone ([[David Keith]]). Boone and Little Bear are initially hostile toward one another, but are forced to behave themselves when Omri reluctantly accepts Patrick's request to bring them to school. Their cover is nearly blown when Patrick almost shows Boone and Little Bear (now friends) to some classmates, and he and Omri began arguing in the hallway.  When Patrick childishly asserts that he could reveal the men and Omri would be powerless to stop him, Omri drives home the point that the time travelers are not living toys that exist for their amusement, but people just like them. As the truth sinks in for Patrick, one of their teachers tries to mediate, and when he realizes that an object in Patrick's fanny pack is the subject of contention, orders him to open it and show him. Boone and Little Bear pretend to be plastic toys thanks to Omri's hints and laying woodenly in Patrick's hand, successfully fool the teacher.  Back home, Omri shows a female Indian figure to Little Bear, which he intends to bring to life to give Little Bear a new wife. Just as he is about to lock the figure in the cupboard, he and Patrick (who is spending the night) are puzzled to find the cupboard is missing. Omri's brother confesses he hid the cupboard in the downstairs crawlspace as means of getting back at Omri for hiding the ball his brother keeps his pet rat in. When Omri retrieves the cupboard, he discovers that the key is gone.  That night, Omri and Patrick, along with Little Bear and Boone, watch a program on TV that shows a relentless slaughter of Indians by cowboys. Boone is enthusiastic at the sight of his "boys" killing the helpless Indians, while Little Bear watches in horror at the sight of his "people" being massacred. Upon hearing Boone fire his revolver into the air with delight, Little Bear becomes confused and fires an arrow into Boone's chest. Making matters worse, Omri's mother warns that Omri's brother's pet rat has escaped and is hidden somewhere under the wooden floors.  Later that night, Omri and Patrick find the key jammed between two floor boards and accidentally push it down out of sight while trying to retrieve it. Little Bear goes under the floor and manages to return the key to Omri just before he is nearly killed by the pet rat. With the key back, Omri brings Tommy Atkins back to life, so he can treat Boone's wounds. While the still unconscious cowboy is being examined, Omri realizes it is time to return Little Bear and Boone to their respective time periods where they belong. Shortly after Omri sends Tommy Atkins back to his own time, Boone awakens and forgives Little Bear. Later that night, as Patrick sleeps, Omri goes to bring the female Indian to life, but Little Bear realizes what Omri is doing, and stops him. Omri says he doesn't want Little Bear to be alone when he goes back, but Little Bear says that the Indian woman probably has people of her own, maybe even her own family, and forcing her to be with Little Bear would sadden her and in turn, sadden him. Omri agrees not to bring her to life. (This is a major difference between the film and the book, as Omri does bring the female Indian to life in the novel.)  The next morning, Omri and Patrick say their goodbyes to their little friends before locking them back in the cupboard and sending them home. Just before saying goodbye, Omri has a vision of a life-sized Little Bear telling him that when he returns to his own time, he will take Omri on as his nephew. The film ends with Omri at school reading a journal entry where he assures everyone that although he will never know where or how Little Bear may be, he does not worry about him anymore.

Iron Eagle on the Attack
  While on a routine patrol on [[United States]] airspace west of [[Alaska]], Doug Masters and his wingman test the [[g-force]]s of their [[F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D|F-16C]] planes. Their antics get them carried away, as they stray over [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] airspace. As they are being escorted back into U.S. airspace, one of the Soviet planes has Doug on missile-lock. Doug requests to break formation and engage the Soviet aircraft, but is denied by flight control. He is immediately shot down, but safely ejects and lands on Soviet land, where he is promptly captured by nearby soldiers.  Several years have passed since that incident and Doug is still haunted by his days as a prisoner. He works as a [[crop duster]], but is shortly recruited by his old friend, retired Gen. Charles "Chappy" Sinclair to be an instructor at his flight school. Chappy needs Doug's help, as his school is overrun by juvenile delinquents who fly his [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texans]] with no regard for safety. These students were taken in by Chappy as a means of rehabilitating them. Doug is not happy to be an instructor to the delinquents, but Chappy assures him that he will see results from them in a week. Still, he shows no interest in training them.  During an exhibition show where the delinquents face off children from the Air Force, Wheeler, one of the female delinquents, cons a drug dealer out of $2,000 by handing him a bag of sugar disguised as cocaine. She attempts to take her training plane and fly out to Mexico, but Doug pursues her and tells her to land on an abandoned Air Force base and stay there until further orders. Upon landing the plane, Wheeler and her co-pilot Rudy Marlowe encounter a platoon that is ordered to kill them. Doug intervenes, allowing the teens to leave the air base. Chappy is told of the incident, and he and Maj. Gen. Brad Kettle head to the base that night to investigate on that platoon's activity on a storage bunker. After they are escorted out of the base by Air Force Intelligence, Doug describes to Chappy his eyewitness account of the soldiers carrying marked canisters, which are revealed to be [[chemical weapons]].  Doug leaves the school, frustrated that his life came apart when he was imprisoned and Chappy was not there to save him at that time. Chappy is given a notice by the State Patrol that his flight program is terminated immediately and his students are returned to [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]]. Wheeler, however, avoids capture and steals a trainer plane, creating a diversion that allows the students to hijack the bus and head back to the school. Chappy and the students relocate their planes to Doug's former job site; Doug meets up with them afterward. Chappy then organizes the students to infiltrate the airbase and acquire enough resources for their operation to stop the convoy carrying the chemical weapons. Upon entering the airbase, Kitty Shaw and Chappy discover Operation Pandora, in which the chemical weapons are to be used on countries with regimes deemed hostile. They print out the data before leaving the premises and handing it to Kettle. Meanwhile, Dana Osborne and Rudy attempt to stop the convoy, but are shot down. As they attempt to escape on foot, Rudy is shot by Major Pierce, but Doug and the others arrive at the scene and capture one of the soldiers. Chappy and his team accompany Kettle to Craig Air Force Base, only to realize that Kettle is part of the entire operation.  Using a swarm of wasps as a means of psychological interrogation, Doug gets the captured soldier to reveal the location of the convoy. He then phones Chappy, but discovers that his team has been apprehended by Kettle. At one of the chemical weapon chambers, Chappy is told by Kettle that the first target of Operation Pandora is Cuba. After Kettle leaves the chamber, Kitty hacks the computer to set off the fire extinguishing units, giving Chappy's team time to escape. A stray shot from one of the soldiers ruptures the canister, contaminating the chamber and killing Dr. Francis Gully and everyone inside. As Kitty and Peter sneak into the cargo plane carrying the chemical weapon, Chappy sends a radio message, warning everyone of a hostile aircraft heading to Cuba. Shortly after recapturing Chappy, Kettle orders his fighter squadron to shoot down the trainer planes. The squadron of two fighters attacks the trainers, only to be confronted by Doug, who has commandeered a fighter plane. Doug and the students shoot down the attackers promptly. He then plays the cassette tape Chappy recorded for him before killing ace pilot Maj. Miles Pierce in a dogfight.  The students approach the cargo plane and attack it. Inside, Peter creates a diversion by opening the cargo door, causing the soldiers aboard to fall out. This leads to a fist fight between Peter and the plane's captain, who is ejected when Kitty assumes the controls. Peter then jettisons all of the canisters into the ocean. Seeing his mission as a failure, Kettle prepares to kill Chappy when Doug suddenly attacks the airbase, giving Chappy time to escape. As police arrive at the scene, Kettle enters the contaminated chamber - his fate unknown.  Days later, Wheeler tells Doug she is heading to Mexico for a new start, but he convinces her to stay. The Iron Eagle Flight School then prepares for a new batch of students fresh out of juvenile hall.  
It's Pat
 Pat Riley is a chubby, whiny, and obnoxious job-hopper who is searching for a steady foundation in life. Pat encounters Chris, whose gender is also unrevealed. The two fall in love, and get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen, develops an unhealthy obsession with unveiling Pat's gender, and begins [[stalker (stalking)|stalking]] Pat. Kyle sends in a tape of Pat performing [[karaoke]] to a TV show called ''America's Creepiest People'', bringing Pat to the attention of the band [[Ween]], who feature Pat in one of their performances; Pat plays the [[tuba]]. When Pat learns that Ween intended to only use Pat for one gig, Pat and Chris break up.   Kyle steals the laptop containing Pat's diary and tries to coerce Pat into revealing the computer's password, so he can access the files. Pat's only answer is that the word is in the [[dictionary attack|dictionary]]. Kyle then begins to type in every single word in the dictionary.   Meanwhile, a gang of thugs intent on discovering Pat's gender begin harassing Pat, and Pat becomes distraught over the thugs' androgynous nature. Pat goes to complain to Kathy, a friend who is a [[Therapy|therapist]] and host of a radio talk show. When Pat gives acerbic reactions to call-in listeners, the station fires Kathy and replaces her with Pat.   Kyle ends up going through the entire dictionary until he reaches the last word, "[[zythum]]" (an Egyptian malt beer), which is the password. After reading through the diary, he discovers no new information in regards to Pat's gender, and finally snaps.  Kyle calls into Pat's radio show, and tells Pat to meet him at the [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!#Museums|Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum]], stating that this is the only chance for Pat to retrieve the laptop. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a [[Ween]] concert. After Kyle corners Pat on a [[catwalk]], Pat falls, and Pat's clothes get caught on a hook. This tears off Pat's pants and lowers Pat in front of the cheering audience, though Pat's genitals are revealed neither to Kyle nor to the moviegoer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an [[epilogue]], Pat and Chris get married.  During the end credits, Kathy is now hosting her radio show again and the first caller is none other than Kyle,  whose obsession with Pat has driven him to cross-dressing.  
Jack and Sarah
 Jack ([[Richard E. Grant]]) and Sarah ([[Imogen Stubbs]]) are expecting a baby together, but a complication during the [[childbirth|birth]] leads to the death of Sarah. Jack, grief-stricken, goes on an alcoholic bender, leaving his daughter to be taken care of by his parents and Sarah's mother, until they decide to take drastic action: they return the baby to Jack whilst he is asleep, leaving him to take care of it. Although he struggles initially, he eventually begins to dote on the child and names her Sarah.  Despite this, he nevertheless finds it increasingly difficult to juggle bringing up the baby with his high-powered job, and though both sets of the child's grandparents lend a hand (along with William ([[Ian McKellen]]), a dried out ex-alcoholic who, once sober, proves to be a remarkably efficient babysitter and housekeeper), he needs more help. Amy ([[Samantha Mathis]]), an American waitress he meets in a restaurant who takes a shine to Sarah, takes up the role as nanny, moving in with Jack after one meeting.  Although clashing with William and the grandparents, especially Jack's mother, Margaret ([[Judi Dench]]), Jack and Amy gradually grow closer—but Jack's boss has also taken an interest in him.  
It Takes Two (1995 film)
 Two unrelated young girls who happen to look identical meet by chance. Amanda Lemmon ([[Mary-Kate Olsen]]) is an orphan, and she is about to be adopted by the Butkises, a family known to "collect" kids. She actually wants her child-loving social worker, Diane Barrows ([[Kirstie Alley]]), to adopt her instead. Diane would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary and unmarried status. Alyssa Callaway ([[Ashley Olsen]]) is coming home from her school piano recital competition, only to find that her wealthy father, Roger ([[Steve Guttenberg]]), is about to marry Clarice Kensington ([[Jane Sibbett]]), an overbearing self-centered gold-digger socialite who plans to send Alyssa off to boarding school in Tibet after marrying Roger.  The identical strangers long for the other's life and decide to switch places. While Amanda enjoys Alyssa's wealthy lifestyle and Alyssa gets to experience being a kid at summer camp, the two get to know the other's parental figure and discover that Roger and Diane would be perfect for each other. Desperate to set them up, the girls arrange many "chance" meetings between Diane and Roger, hoping that they fall in love.   Upon having spied Roger and Diane laughing and swimming together in a lake one afternoon, Clarice manipulates Roger into moving the wedding up from the next month to the next day. Soon after, Alyssa, while posing as Amanda, ends up being adopted by the Butkises without Diane's knowledge, and is taken away by child services. Alyssa discovers the only reason the Butkises had adopted so many kids was to put them to work in their salvage yard.   Roughly two hours before the wedding, Amanda, who poses as Alyssa, proves to the family butler, Vincenzo ([[Philip Bosco]]), that she is not Alyssa. He contacts Diane and summons to have the real Alyssa picked up from the Butkises' salvage yard. In the meantime, Vincenzo and Amanda work to stall the wedding.   Just as Roger is about to say "I do," Diane bursts into the church with the real Alyssa behind her, and Roger falters at the sight of Diane, recalling all the good times they had together. In that moment, he realizes he has fallen in love with Diane and confesses this to Clarice. Furious, she slaps him and tries to do the same to "Alyssa," blaming her for sabotaging their relationship, but is stopped by Vincenzo. As Clarice storms down the aisle, the real Alyssa steps out from behind Diane, and Clarice claims it's a "conspiracy" that there's "two of them." She tries to take this new opportunity to slap Alyssa, but Diane steps forward in time, barking at her to "Back off, Barbie," and calmly informs her that she has something in her teeth. Humiliated, Clarice moves to storm out of the church again, but Alyssa embarrasses her even further by stepping on her wedding gown, causing the skirt to rip off.   An incredulous Roger learns that Alyssa has been with Diane all this time and it becomes apparent to them that Amanda and Alyssa had orchestrated their meet-ups all along, about which the girls are extremely smug. After some encouragement from the girls, Roger and Diane kiss, and the four of them board a horse-drawn carriage, driven by Vincenzo, to take a ride through Central Park.

During their date at a pizza restaurant, the two end up having sex in the bathroom, claiming they were meant for each other.  A few days later, Carrie invites Gene to a party at a bar with her friends, but Gene says no because he doesn't want to "hang out with losers". Carrie goes to the party alone, and she dances with a friend of hers, Scottie, but Gene, who had secretly followed Carrie to the bar, appears and beats up Scottie in a violent rage.

Now realizing her mom was right all along, Carrie tells Gene to leave her alone, and warns him that she can put him in jail for a very long time.  On Sunday, Carrie receives a call from Gene asking her to forgive him, but she lies to Gene, saying that she is seeing somebody else, and that the person is coming over to meet her.

He hears Carrie downstairs on the phone with Scottie, and rushes down to order her upstairs. Jesse and Stevie manage to hide in an air vent downstairs, and find a secret exit from a wooded window.

Washington asks the boys about what happened, so the boys tell her about their sister's boyfriend coming in with a gun threatening to kill everyone. Gene then appears at the door and the police draw their guns, but Gene puts Jenna down and returns inside the house while Jenna walks safely to the police and her uncles.  As night falls, the police try to do everything to get Gene to cooperate with them, even bringing Maggie to the house to talk to him, but nothing works. Walter tries to stop Gene by hiding in the bedroom closet and jumping onto him from behind, but in the ensuing struggle, Gene knocks him out cold with his gun. While Gene grabs Carrie and begins to talk to her, telling her how much he loves her, Peggy sneaks into the basement and talks to Lt. Washington. Washington tells her to try to sneak out the exit her sons did, but Peggy tells her that she won't leave her daughter alone.   She sneaks into her room, grabs Walter's gun and points it at Gene, firing and killing him. As the sun rises, Peggy and Carrie walk out of the house while the police bring out the bodies of Walter and Gene. Lt. Washington then tells Peggy that Walter will be all right, adding that she could have lost her life while in there, to which Peggy replies "When it comes to your kids, you have to do what you have to do". She then returns to her children and granddaughter, and the film ends.

The Jerky Boys: The Movie
 The film opens in a New York police station as a pair of "low-lifes from Queens" named Johnny B. ([[Johnny Brennan]]) and Kamal ([[Kamal Ahmed (comedian)|Kamal Ahmed]]) are taken into police custody and interrogated by an NYPD detective named Robert Worzic ([[Brad Sullivan]]). Worzic demands to know exactly how the pair got into their situation, so Johnny explains that for the past twenty years, he and Kamal frequently entertained themselves by performing prank calls on the telephone. He brings up an early call where he got his neighbor Brett Weir, the local goody-two-shoes kid, in trouble with his mother by impersonating an angry citizen and claiming that Brett has been spitting and cursing.  One day twenty years later (the beginning of the film's present day), Johnny and Kamal are adults and still performing prank calls, but Johnny's mother Mrs. B ([[Suzanne Shepherd]]) demands that they get jobs. Johnny argues that they get fired from everything they try, even though their reason for termination usually stems from their inability to not insult people over radios and intercoms. Mrs. B compares them to Brett Weir ([[James Lorinz]]), who has grown to live a very successful life and now owns his own house, and tells them to get out of the house and job-hunt.  Johnny and Kamal decide to head to Mickey's, their local bar, and knock back a few drinks placed on their sizable tab. They happen to meet Brett, who buys them drinks and brags that he's on his way to a meeting at a fancy restaurant. Curious, Johnny calls Brett's new friends at the restaurant as "Frank Rizzo" and tells the people on the other end (in no polite terms) that "his men" Johnny and Kamal have just gotten in from Chicago and need to be cared for. Unbeknownst to the pair, Brett's friends are actually the local Mafia run by Ernie Lazzaro ([[Alan Arkin]]), who is confused and bewildered at "Rizzo" and his vulgarity but nonetheless gives the boys a limousine ride and a fully comped meal.  Feeling that they have stumbled onto a good job, Johnny calls again as "Rizzo" the next day and demands another good time for him and Kamal. This time, Lazzaro and his right-hand man Tony Scarboni ([[Vincent Pastore]]) introduce the pair to the many Mafia leaders and officials on their payroll. They are given money as an advance on their first assignment: beat up Mickey so the mob can take over his bar and tear it down. At this point, the boys realize what they're in and that they're in deep. As they try (and fail) to convince Mickey ([[Alan North]]) to lay low, Brett recognizes them and reveals to Lazzaro that they're not mobsters at all. Scarboni's men Geno (Brian Tarantina) and Sonny (Peter Appel) later grab Johnny and Kamal and takes them to a hot dog-processing plant so that Scarboni can run them through the grinder as punishment. Using their vocal talents, the boys distract their captors and escape. Johnny and Kamal lead Scarboni and his men through the city, crashing a local concert, stealing a cab, and wrecking a nightclub magic show along the way. They eventually make it back to Johnny's house in Queens, only to get arrested by Worzic for all the trouble they caused.  Returning to the present situation, Johnny and Kamal insist to Worzic that everything was just a big misunderstanding and try to tell him of Lazzaro's many rackets in the city. Worzic, however, only cares about "Frank Rizzo" (who apparently ''is'' an actual Mafia boss that he wants arrested) and throws the boys in a jail cell. They are each given one phone call: Johnny calls his mother, who is threatened by Scarboni to tell them where he is, while Kamal calls a local demolition crew. They are later released on bail and picked up by Scarboni's men so that they can take them to Lazzaro and Scarboni, who are now fitting Mrs. B with cement shoes. Johnny insists that "Frank Rizzo" can set everything straight and calls his house, where he had previously set up a tape-recording of "Rizzo" to play on the answering machine. Though it seems to work well enough to make Lazzaro brag about his operation, Brett sees through the deception and the rest of the mob chase after the boys and Mrs. B.   Barely making it back to Queens, Johnny and Kamal immediately call Worzic and tells them that they have taped evidence to incriminate Lazzaro. Instead, the detective is revealed to be on the take (explaining his prior refusal to help) and joins Lazzaro in chasing the boys, but they are distracted when Lazzaro recognizes the next-door neighbor Uncle Freddie ([[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]) as a Mafia boss from long ago. This gives the boys the chance to escape downtown and call every news outlet they can think of with their evidence that exposes Lazzaro. They credit "Frank Rizzo" as the informant, who in turn credits Johnny and Kamal as "The Jerky Boys".  Lazzaro, Scarboni, Worzic, and all their accomplices are arrested, while Johnny and Kamal are made heroes and given a cushy office job in a high-rise building. Not surprisingly, they start off by prank calling the [[White House]] and demanding to know [[Bill Clinton|who's in charge]]. Meanwhile, Brett Weir has just gotten out of prison after making a deal with prosecutors, only to see his house getting torn down by the demolition crew that the Jerky Boys had called earlier.  
Jeffrey (1995 film)
 The story takes place in [[Manhattan]] during the height of the [[AIDS]] epidemic and revolves around the title character ([[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]]), a [[homosexual|gay]] man who has sworn off sex because of it. Almost immediately thereafter he meets Steve ([[Michael T. Weiss]]), a hunky, charming [[HIV]] positive man. He then experiences an emotional conflict as he must face his fear in order to accept love, often breaking the [[fourth wall]] to do so.  It’s not so much that Jeffrey is afraid of dying himself, but that he’s afraid that he will fall in love with someone who is bound to die; thus, his celibacy is not only about sex, but also about relationships in general. Helping him through this period of his life and advising him is a cast of cameos including [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Nathan Lane]], and [[Sigourney Weaver]].<ref name="alexander2014"></ref>  
Jefferson in Paris
 Set in the period 1784–1789, the film portrays Jefferson when he was US minister to France at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] before the [[French Revolution]]. French liberals and intellectuals hope he will lead them away from the corruption of the court of [[Louis XVI|King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]] and toward a more democratic form of government. Although deploring the poverty of the common people, he embraces the riches of French culture and civilization. It is his first time abroad, and he takes advantage of the opportunity to extend his knowledge of liberal arts and science while absorbing the refinements France has to offer.  A lonely widower, Jefferson develops a close friendship with [[Maria Cosway]], a beautiful (and married) Anglo-Italian painter and musician. Although she becomes increasingly devoted to him, he is attached to his memory of his late wife, whom he promised that he would not remarry, and to his two younger daughters, especially the elder, possessive [[Patsy Jefferson|Patsy]]. He becomes attracted to [[Sally Hemings]], the enslaved maid and companion of his younger daughter Polly. Three-quarters white in ancestry, she is his late wife's half-sister. Their father had taken Sally's slave mother as a [[concubine]] after he was widowed for the third time; Sally is the sixth of their children. Sally's enslaved brother James Hemings is also in [[Paris]], learning to be a French chef for Jefferson at [[Monticello]]. When [[George Washington]] offers Jefferson the post of [[Secretary of State]], he accepts and prepares to sail home with his family. But James, having enjoyed his freedom in Paris, is unwilling to return to the United States and urges Sally to remain with him. It is only when Jefferson promises he will give James and Sally, who is pregnant with Jefferson's child, their freedom that they consent to return with him.  
Jade (film)
 San Francisco [[Assistant District Attorney]] David Corelli (Caruso) is called to the murder scene of prominent businessman Kyle Medford, found bludgeoned to death in his home by an antique hatchet. Police detectives Bob Hargrove and Petey Vesko find photographs in Medford's safe of Governor Lew Edwards (Crenna) having sex with a prostitute, later identified as Patrice Jacinto. During questioning, Patrice reveals that she and other women were paid by Medford to have sex with wealthy men at his beach house in [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]]. She also informs them that the most desired prostitute among the clients was a woman known only as "Jade."  In a private meeting with Governor Edwards and aide Bill Barrett, Corelli is warned not to make the photographs public. Corelli is then almost killed when his brake line is deliberately cut and his vehicle goes out of control while driving down a steep hill.  The detectives find fingerprints on the hatchet belonging to Katrina Gavin, a [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] and former lover of Corelli's who eventually married his close friend, defense attorney Matt Gavin. When interviewed, Katrina explains that Medford gave her a tour of his antique collection on the day in question, but claims to have nothing to do with his death.  At Medford's beach house, Corelli and the detectives find various drugs, alcohol, and sex toys as well as hidden video cameras. They conclude Medford was recording the sex sessions in order to blackmail the men. Corelli is shocked to discover Katrina on one of the tapes; the revelation renews the detectives interest in her as a suspect.  Patrice arranges to meet Corelli at a restaurant to discuss Jade's identity, but she is killed in a hit-and-run accident by an unknown assailant driving a black [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|1993 Ford Thunderbird]]. Corelli, witnessing the murder first-hand, chases the assailants' vehicle in vain. The detectives discover the Gavins own a similar Thunderbird and therefore suspect Katrina of killing Patrice, but when they find the actual vehicle used in the hit-and-run abandoned, it appears someone may be trying to frame Katrina.  Katrina is again brought in for questioning and this time is shown the sex tape. Matt, in his capacity as her attorney, ends the interrogation before she fully explains her involvement. When confronted at their home, Katrina admits to her husband that she did have sex with the man on the tape, due in part to her knowledge of Matt's many affairs.  Katrina visits Corelli at his apartment and tries unsuccessfully to seduce him. She admits having felt sexually liberated by sleeping with several men at the beach house. Meanwhile, the only witness to identify Katrina at the Pacifica beach house, a man named Henderson, is found murdered. Corelli informs the detectives at the crime scene that Katrina couldn't have killed him because she and Corelli were together at the time.  Back at his apartment, Corelli is met by Matt, who holds him at gunpoint and angrily accuses him of having sex with Katrina. He denies it and persuades Matt that his wife's life is in danger. They hurry to the Gavin home, where Det. Hargrove and Governor's aide Barrett have come to search for the incriminating photos of the Governor. Katrina interrupts their search and Hargrove tries to kill her, but Corelli and Matt arrive and Hargrove is shot by Matt.  Corelli goes to the Governor for a guarantee of Katrina's safety by leveraging his possession of the photographs. The Governor denies any knowledge of Hargrove's or Barrett's actions, but insinuates they were both acting on his behalf. As she gets ready for bed at home, Katrina finds photographs laid out in her bathroom of her having sex at the beach house. Matt admits to Katrina that he killed Medford, certain that Medford eventually would blackmail them both. He then tells Katrina to "introduce me to Jade" the next time they "make love".

Johnny Mnemonic (film)
 In 2021, Johnny is a "mnemonic courier" with a data storage device implanted in his brain, allowing him to discreetly carry information too sensitive to transfer across the Net, the virtual-reality equivalent of the Internet. While lucrative, the implant has cost Johnny his childhood memories, and he seeks to have the implant removed to regain his memories back; his handler, Ralfi assigns him one more job that would cover the costs of the operation (which are extremely expensive), sending Johnny to [[Beijing]] to collect the latest information. Johnny is told that the information exceeds his current memory capacity of 80 gigabytes, but he acquires a compression unit that effectively doubles the amount he can hold.  He meets with the client, a group of frantic scientists who tell him that they want him to carry 320 gigabytes of memory; Johnny accepts this, knowing that the overflow data will by uploaded directly into his brain which can cause psychological damage and death if not removed within a few days. Johnny uploads the data to his storage, with the scientists selecting three random images from a television screen to use as an encryption key. Just as the scientists are about to send the key to the data's receiver in Newark, New Jersey, they are massacred by [[Yakuza]]. Johnny manages to escape with a portion of the encryption key.  While returning to Newark, Johnny is pursued by Pharmakom, a global pharmacological company; its executive Takahashi hired the Yakuza to recover it. However, the Yakuza, led by Shinji, want to take the data and claim it for themselves. Takahashi discovered this, and instead hired Karl, the Street Preacher, to recover Johnny's head. Johnny finds Ralfi is in the Yakuza's employ, and prepares to kill Johnny to recover the storage unit, but Johnny is rescued by Jane, a cybernetically-enhanced bodyguard, along with help from the anti-establishment Lo-Teks and their leader J-Bone. Jane takes Johnny to meet Spider, a doctor who installed Jane's implants. Spider reveals he and his allies were the intended recipient of the data Johnny has, which they believe is the cure for "nerve attenuation syndrome" (NAS), a plague ravaging mankind due to over-dependence on technology. Spider claims Pharmakon discovered the cure but refused to publish it, profiting on the costs of mitigating the effects of NAS. Without the full encryption key, Spider cannot recover the data, nor safely remove the implant without killing Johnny or destroying the data, and suggest he see Jones at the Lo-Tek base, Heaven. Karl follows Johnny to the clinic and kills Spider, but Johnny and Jane escape.  At Heaven, they find Jones is a dolphin once used by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for his decryption capabilities. Jones attempts to discover the remainder of the encryption key to the data, but Heaven is soon attacked by the Yakuza, Takahashi's forces, and the Street Preacher. Johnny, Jane, and the Lo-Teks fight off all three groups and emerge victorious, killing Shinji, the Street Preacher, and their agents. Takahashi, who was shot in the crossfire, provides Johnny, in a dying gesture, with a portion of the remaining key. While this helps, Johnny is told by J-Bone that he must "hack his own brain" to find the final portion, unlocking the data so that the Lo-Teks can download it and transmit it across the globe.  Johnny and Jones again start the procedure but find themselves helped by a mysterious [[artificial intelligence]] that operates from Pharmakom's mainframe, providing the last portion of the password to unlock the data. The data for the NAS cure is safely recovered and Johnny discovers he can now recall his memories of his youth, including his mother and family. As Johnny recovers from the process, he, Jane, and the Lo-Teks observe the Pharmakom building on fire, a sign that the cure's transmission was successful.  
Joseph (film)
 Joseph, a [[Hebrew]], is an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] slave to [[Potiphar]], chief of [[Pharaoh]]'s palace guard.  When Joseph is placed under the charge of Ednan, Potiphar's overseer, Ednan torments Joseph for his refusal to show deference for the Egyptian god [[Amun]].  But Joseph eventually earns Ednan's respect when he reveals that he knows how to read, and Ednan starts relying more and more on Joseph.  Joseph is eventually put in charge of Potiphar's home, but his wife begins to desire Joseph and repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, tries to seduce him.  She ultimately becomes so angry at Joseph that she falsely accuses him of raping her and demands his execution.  But Potiphar, knowing Joseph's trustworthiness—and his wife's infidelity—has his doubts.  Potiphar speaks to Joseph in private and demands that Joseph give him some reason to trust him, and Joseph gives Potiphar his life's story from his youth:  Joseph is a son of [[Jacob]] (aka Israel) and the first of two sons to his mother [[Rachel]], who later died giving birth to his younger full-brother [[Benjamin]].  Joseph also had a half-sister, [[Dinah]], and ten half-brothers, Six of which came through his step-mother and aunt [[Leah]], Rachel's older sister.  Jacob and his extended family make a pilgrimage to a fertile plane near the [[Hivite]] town of [[Shechem]], where they are visited by the city's king, Hamor, along with his counselor and his son.  While Jacob and Hamor make arrangements to pay taxes for the land, Hamor's son, also named Shechem, notices Dinah and takes a liking to her.  Hamor invites Jacob and his family to come to a wedding celebration, and asks that Dinah accompany them.  [[Simeon (son of Jacob)|Simeon]], one of Joseph's half-brothers, disliking the way Shechem looked at Dinah, suggests they resist Hamor by force, but Jacob rebukes him.  The night of the wedding celebration, Shechem catches Dinah and rapes her.  The next day Hamor and Shechem attempt to make amends by having Shechem marry Dinah.  Jacob replies that Dinah can only marry a man who is of her faith.  Hamor agrees that all the Shechemite men will convert to Jacob's faith via [[circumcision]].  While Jacob is satisfied, Simeon plots revenge against Shechem.  While the Shechemites are recovering from their circumcisions, the brothers and other members of the tribe attack the fortified village, setting many of their buildings ablaze and killing many Shechemites including Shechem himself.  Jacob is furious with his sons' ruthless actions and announces that now that they have become a stench to the people of the land, they must leave the area.  During this ordeal of moving again, at [[Bethel|Beth-El]], Rachel gives birth to Benjamin, but dies soon afterward from exhaustion.  Nine years later, [[Reuben (biblical person)|Reuben]], Joseph's oldest half-brother, desires [[Bilhah]], one of Jacob's women.  [[Zilpah]], one of Leah's handmaids, sees the couple together and tells Jacob, who angrily declares to Reuben that authority over the family will fall to Joseph instead.  This adds even more fuel to Reuben's (and the other brothers') jealous anger toward Joseph.  For reasons such as these, Joseph has seen the destruction infidelity can bring, and would never do such a thing, he tells Potiphar.  His story continues that while the brothers are out at work in the fields, they decide to kill and eat one of their own lambs, which is expressly forbidden by Jacob.  They later try to tell Jacob that the lamb was killed by a wild animal; Jacob, a lifelong shepherd, is not fooled and he rebukes his sons for disobeying him.  The brothers blame Joseph for Jacob's anger and accuse him of being a spy for Jacob.  Jacob is so pleased with Joseph that he gives him a "[[coat of many colors]]", which increases the jealousy among the brothers.  Further exacerbating their hatred of Joseph is his frequent interpretations of his dreams that one day his brothers and his father will all kneel before him.  Spurred on by Simeon, the brothers discuss killing Joseph, but Reuben doesn't want Joseph's blood on his hands.  Instead, the brothers throw Joseph into a dry well pit, and then sell him into slavery to a group of [[Ishmaelites|Ishmaelite]] traders.  Back at the encampment, the sons then show Jacob the coat (torn and bloodied by the brothers) and tell him that Joseph has been killed by a wild animal.  Jacob is overcome with grief.  After listening to Joseph's life story, Potiphar then demands to know exactly what happened between Joseph and his wife; after he tells Potiphar of his wife's attempts at seduction and his refusal to accede to her demands, Potiphar then calls in the household and announces that Joseph will go to Pharaoh's prison.  When Potiphar's wife complains that he has humiliated her, Potiphar merely responds that one humiliation deserves another.  Seven years later Joseph, now in charge of many of the prisoners, has earned a reputation as a talented interpreter of dreams.  He makes two interpretations of the dreams of the Royal cupbearer and the Royal baker, both imprisoned on suspicion of theft.  He says the cupbearer's dream means that he will soon be acquitted and returned to his post, whereas the baker's dream means that Pharaoh will have him executed.  Both of these interpretations later come to pass just as Joseph prohpesied.  Years later, Pharaoh himself has two disturbing dreams:  The first involved seven fat cows being swallowed by seven sickly cows, the second dream is a similar one involving seven full ears of corn consumed by seven withered ears.  When his vizier and his staff cannot give Pharaoh an answer, the cupbearer and Potiphar inform Pharaoh of Joseph, so Pharaoh summons him from prison.  Joseph's interpretation is that the seven fat cows and the seven full ears of corn mean that there will be seven years of great plenty; the seven sickly cows and the seven thin ears of corn signify that seven years of extreme famine will follow, which could claim many lives.  Calling Joseph's interpretations "madness", but more offended that his dreams are being interpreted by a mere slave, Pharaoh orders Joseph thrown back in prison, but that night Pharaoh is again plagued by the same dreams.  Now realizing the dreams are too important to ignore, Pharaoh again summons Joseph from prison and asks his advice about what can be done to avoid the deaths.  Joseph suggests that Pharaoh should appoint a steward to have all the crop farmers give a fifth of their yield as tribute to Pharaoh for storage for the coming famine, something that has never before been attempted in Egypt.  Impressed with Joseph's suggestion, Pharaoh decides that nobody else, including his own advisers, has the ability to carry out Joseph's plan, so Pharaoh appoints Joseph governor over all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh himself.  He then gives Joseph a new name: "Zaphenath-Paneah" (translated in the film as "the savior"), and also gives Joseph a wife, [[Asenath]], confidant to Pharaoh's wife and daughter of the high priest of On.  Potiphar, who now serves Joseph, gives Ednan into Joseph's charge as his assistant.  After seven years of plenty, the famine begins just as Joseph predicted, by which time Asenath has given Joseph two sons, [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] and [[Ephraim]].  As bad as the famine is in Egypt, it is far worse in [[Canaan]]; when Jacob learns of the abundance of grain in Egypt, he sends all of his sons, except for Benjamin, to Egypt to buy grain.  Joseph recognizes his brothers (though they don't recognize ''him''), but when he notices they haven't changed in the years since they sold him into slavery, Joseph accuses them of espionage and orders them thrown into prison.  Three days later Joseph gives them a chance to prove their innocence by bringing Benjamin with them on their next visit, but to ensure their return Joseph orders Simeon's retention and he is returned to confinement.  Back in Canaan, Jacob refuses to accept the idea, as Benjamin is his only remaining connection to his late wife Rachel, whom Jacob loved more than Leah.  But when their food is again on the verge of running out, Jacob is forced to admit there's no other choice and reluctantly allows Benjamin to accompany the others to Egypt.  On their way back home the second time, Joseph's guards, led by Ednan, arrest Benjamin for theft (on Joseph's order, one of his silver cups was planted in Benjamin's grain sack).  Joseph, still not recognized by his brothers, declares that Benjamin will stay in Egypt but the rest can return to Canaan.  Simeon and several others overpower the guards by grabbing their spears and threaten Joseph, swearing that they would rather die than leave Benjamin behind and be subject to Jacob's wrath.  Joseph confronts them about their willingness to put their lives on the line for another brother, but not for the first (meaning himself).  After sending Ednan and the guards out of the room, Joseph tearfully reveals his true identity to all of them.  Benjamin immediately embraces Joseph, but the others, overwhelmed by shock and shame, drop their spears.  Joseph embraces each of them in turn, assuring them all of his love and forgiveness, especially Simeon, who remorsefully confesses that he is to blame for Joseph having been sold into slavery in the first place.  As he embraces each of them, Joseph explains that God used his brothers' evil intentions for their ultimate good, preparing Joseph for his current position so that he can help and provide for his extended family.  Joseph sends his brothers back to Canaan to bring Jacob and the entire settlement to Egypt where Joseph can provide for them during the remaining five years of the famine.  Jacob and his extended family arrive in Egypt where he is emotionally reunited with Joseph and meets Manasseh and Ephraim for the first time.  
Jury Duty (film)
 Tommy Collins is an unemployed [[erotic dancing|erotic dancer]] living at his mother's home in a [[trailer park]] while he looks for a decent job. He finds out that she and her boyfriend Jed, a [[polystyrene]] collector, are going to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to be married and taking the mobile home with them. Although his mother had arranged for Tommy to stay with the Woodalls, he considers them awful people and decides to look for other living arrangements for him and his [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] Peanut (who loves the game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'').  He rummages through the trash and finds his letter for [[jury duty]] that he had thrown away and decides to enter. Each of the jurors get their own free accommodation plus $5 a day. After several cases he gets chosen to be a juror for a murder case involving a man named Carl Wayne Bishop, a fast food employee who had been fired and is now accused of murdering several other fast food employees. The evidence against him gets stronger when several employees appear as witnesses saying that he threatened to kill them.  All the jurors are staying at the Holiday Suite in the section that is being remodeled. Tommy seems to be enjoying himself, until he finds he is sharing his room with his former high school principal, who puts motivational tapes on at night to full blast. He makes a deal with the manager of the hotel who says that he will get a different room if he advertises their business during news broadcasts. Tommy agrees and ends up staying in a luxurious suite.  Finally the jurors go to the jury room for deliberation and appoint Tommy as their [[Jury foreman|foreman]]. The other jurors immediately think that Bishop is guilty and want to vote straight away. Not wanting to lose his suite and luxurious lifestyle, Tommy votes not guilty and stalls and prolongs the deliberations as well as continuously going over the evidence. After many delays, the other jurors become increasingly angry with Tommy, especially Monica, whom Tommy had fallen in love with, and threaten to throw him out of the jury unless he finds a better way to prove Bishop's innocence.  After reading up on the law and further investigating, both of which activities are prohibited under standard instructions to jurors, Tommy finds some evidence after seeing a picture of Carl Wayne Bishop on the window of a store, finally convincing the jurors that Bishop is not guilty; they celebrate. Unfortunately, later on, Monica finds Peanut and follows him up to Tommy's luxury suite. Even though Tommy tries to explain that he's now a changed person, she is deeply upset on how he used them and walks out in tears.  Later the Judge declares a [[mistrial]] and arranges another hearing at a later date. Back at the trailer park, Tommy goes mining for polystyrene with Jed at the city dump. After seeing many polystyrene containers with fast food logos on them, Tommy realizes that the murderer was an [[environmentalist]]. He calls Monica, who immediately hangs up on him, but he goes looking for Frank, another fellow juror, who was also obsessed with the environment. Later that night someone meets another man named Frank who thanks him for volunteering to do jury duty on his behalf while he was on vacation, only to be killed with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun.]] The killer is revealed to be Frank, the man Tommy was looking for. Tommy arrives at the same house and relays his new evidence to Frank, asking Frank to help find Monica at the library she works at in order to convince her that his evidence is genuine.  When they arrive at the library, Frank reveals to Tommy and Monica that he was the killer. He ties them up and attempts to stab them with a sharp jagged knife. He tells them that he committed these terrible murders and framed Carl Wayne Bishop because he thought there was no way of truth and justice in the world. With Peanut's help, however, they manage to subdue Frank and knock him unconscious.  Tommy is given a check for his contribution in the case and Monica starts dating Tommy. He uses his earnings from erotic dancing towards law school and eventually becomes an [[Attorney at Law|attorney]]. Meanwhile, Peanut is shown accomplishing his lifelong dream of becoming a contestant on ''Jeopardy!''.  
Judge Dredd (film)
 By the 2080s, much of Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland. While some humans manage to survive in the barren "Cursed Earth", the majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities with populations of tens of millions. To combat crime, the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]]s whose role combines those of [[police officer]], [[judge]], [[jury]], and [[executioner]].  In [[Mega-City One]], 2139, [[Judge Dredd|Joseph Dredd]] ([[Sylvester Stallone]]), one of the most dedicated "Street Judges", assists first-year [[Judge Hershey]] ([[Diane Lane]]) in ending a block war. [[Fergee|Herman "Fergee" Ferguson]] ([[Rob Schneider]]), a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] recently released from prison, is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot. Dredd arrests Herman for destruction of property, and sentences him to five years' imprisonment. [[Rico Dredd|Rico]] ([[Armand Assante]]), a former Judge, escapes from prison with the help of [[Judge Griffin]] ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]). He returns to Mega-City One and reclaims his uniform and "[[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|Lawgiver]]" gun. He also finds and reactivates a decommissioned [[ABC Warriors|ABC Warrior]] combat robot.  A news reporter ([[Mitch Ryan|Mitchell Ryan]]) critical of Dredd is murdered, and he becomes the chief suspect. Dredd is taken to a trial before a [[tribunal]] of Council Judges including Griffin and [[Chief Judge Fargo|Chief Justice Fargo]] ([[Max von Sydow]]), his mentor. Dredd is found guilty as his [[DNA]] is found on the bullets used to kill the reporter (a feature of the Lawgiver is imprinting the user's DNA on each bullet, a fact apparently unknown by most Judges). To save Dredd, Fargo steps down as Chief Justice and, for his last request, asks the Council to spare Dredd's life. Dredd is sentenced to life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on the "long walk", in which a retiring Judge ventures into the wasteland "to bring law to the lawless". Griffin, who freed Rico to [[frameup|frame]] Dredd for the murder, becomes Chief Justice and instructs Rico to cause chaos in the city.  Dredd is taken to the [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] penal colony via airship, where he sits next to Herman. En route, the ship is shot down by the [[Angel Gang]], a family of [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] scavengers and bandits. They bring Dredd and Herman back to their cave. A squad of Judges investigate the crashed ship and get to the cave, intent on killing any survivors, not rescuing them. Fargo arrives in time to save Dredd's life, but is mortally wounded by [[Mean Machine Angel]] (Chris Adamson). A dying Fargo reveals that Dredd and Rico are the result of the Janus project, an experiment in [[genetic engineering]] intended to create the perfect Judge using DNA from Council Judges. Dredd deduces Rico framed him for the reporter's murder, using their identical DNA. Believing Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project, Fargo urges Dredd to stop him.  In Mega-City One, Rico terrorizes the city and assassinates Judges in various ways. Griffin uses the situation to convince the Council Judges to unlock the Janus files. He plans to create an army of Judges from his DNA. After the Council Judges unlock the file, Griffin has them killed. Dredd and Herman sneak back into the city and meet with Hershey, who had also discovered the Janus project by herself. They go to the [[Statue of Liberty]] where the Janus laboratories are. They encounter the ABC Warrior, which wounds Herman and captures Dredd and Hershey. Rico uses his own DNA as template for the Janus clones, then commands the ABC Warrior to kill Griffin. Herman, despite his wounds, disables the ABC Warrior as Dredd fights Rico, while Hershey fights his assistant, Dr. Ilsa Hayden. Rico activates his clones prematurely, but they fail to stop Dredd. Dredd pursues Rico to the top of the Statue of Liberty, and a final struggle sends Rico falling to his death.  Central, the city's controlling supercomputer, has recorded the entire event and broadcasts the information, clearing Dredd's name. The remaining Judges ask him to become the new Chief Justice but he refuses preferring to remain a street judge.  
Just Cause (film)
  Paul Armstrong ([[Sean Connery]]), a [[American modern liberalism|liberal]] [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor opposed to [[capital punishment]], is persuaded to go to [[Florida]] to investigate the conviction of Bobby Earl Ferguson ([[Blair Underwood]]) for murder.

Armstrong must save him from being executed in the [[electric chair]]. Ferguson tells Armstrong that he was [[torture]]d by two police detectives to get a confession. As Armstrong digs deeper into the case, he discovers that Tanny Brown ([[Laurence Fishburne]]), the chief detective on the case, did indeed coerce Ferguson's confession.  The plot thickens when Ferguson tells the professor that the murder was actually committed by Blair Sullivan ([[Ed Harris]]), a [[serial killer]] awaiting execution, who later reveals the location of the weapon used to kill the girl. When Armstrong discovers the weapon, Brown tries to threaten him into abandoning the investigation. (It is revealed that the murdered girl was Brown's daughter's best friend.) Ferguson gets a re-trial and is freed from prison. Subsequently, the governor signs Sullivan's death warrant.  Armstrong receives a call from Sullivan, who says he has a final clue to share, but first wants Armstrong to visit his (Sullivan's) parents and tell them he said goodbye. Armstrong is shocked to find their butchered bodies. Back at the prison, Sullivan gloats that he and Ferguson struck a deal: Ferguson would kill Sullivan's parents in exchange for freedom, while Sullivan would claim responsibility for the girl's murder, which Ferguson did in fact commit. Armstrong asks why he was needed for their scheme, and Sullivan replies that was "Bobby Earl's call." Armstrong, in his anger at being played, lies to Sullivan and tells him his parents were alive and that they "forgive him." Sullivan becomes enraged. He resists the guards taking him to the electric chair, where he is executed.  Armstrong and Brown go after Ferguson, whose motive for everything turns out to be a desire for revenge on Armstrong's wife ([[Kate Capshaw]]); she was the prosecutor against him in a previous rape trial which, while thrown out of court on a technicality, resulted in him being brutalized and [[castrated]] in jail, as well as being kicked out of Cornell, robbing him of any chance of a future.

Jumanji
  In 1869, near Brantford, [[New Hampshire]], two brothers bury a chest and hope that no one will ever find it.  A century later in 1969, Alan Parrish escapes a gang of bullies led by Billy Jessup and retreats to a shoe factory owned by his father, Sam. He meets Carl Bentley, an employee, who reveals a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a machine, but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After being attacked by Jessup's group, who also steal his bicycle, Alan follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. He finds the chest containing a [[board game]] called "Jumanji" and brings it home. At home, after an argument with Sam about attending a [[boarding school]], Alan plans to run away. Sarah Whittle, his friend, arrives to return his bicycle, and Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the [[crystal ball]] at the center of the board. Sarah reads the first message on the board and hears an eerie sound. Alan then unintentionally rolls the dice after being startled by the chiming clock; a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a 5 or 8. Alan is sucked into the game, and a colony of [[Hammer-headed bat|bats]] chases Sarah out of the mansion.  Twenty-six years later in 1995, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora, after their parents died in an accident on a ski trip in Canada, the winter before. Soon after, Judy and Peter find Jumanji in the attic and begin playing it. Their rolls release a swarm of big [[mosquito]]es and a troop of [[monkey]]s. The game rules state that everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter's next roll releases a [[lion]] and an adult Alan. As Alan makes his way out, he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy and Peter go to the now derelict shoe factory, where a tramp tells Alan that after his disappearance, Sam and his mother, Carol-Anne abandoned the business and searched for Alan, until their deaths just four years earlier.  Realizing they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate her, now suffering [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] after Alan's disappearance, and they persuade her to join them. Sarah's roll releases fast-growing [[carnivorous plant]]s, and Alan's next roll releases a [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunter]], Van Pelt. Judy's next roll releases a stampede of various animals, and a [[pelican]] steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl. Later, Van Pelt catches up to Alan's friends and steals the game. Peter, Sarah, and Judy follow Van Pelt to a [[department store]], where they fight him, retrieve the game, and reunite with Alan. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. They release numerous calamities, until Van Pelt arrives. When Alan drops the dice, he wins the game, causing everything that had happened as a result of the game to be reversed.  Alan and Sarah return to 1969 as children, but have full memories of the future events. Alan reconciles with his father and admits that he was responsible for the shoe that damaged the factory's machine. Carl is rehired, and Sam tells his son that he does not have to attend boarding school. Alan and Sarah throw Jumanji into a river and then share a kiss.  Twenty-six years later, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan runs the factory after his parents retired (but are still alive). He and Sarah reunite with Judy and Peter (who have no memories of the game), and meet their parents Jim and Martha during a Christmas party. The Parrishes offer Jim a job and convinces the Shepherds to cancel their upcoming ski trip, averting their deaths, before they strike up a friendship with them.  On a beach, two French-speaking girls hear drumbeats as Jumanji lies partially buried in the sand.

The goons arrive and Matt defeats them all and finally is ready to take on Negaal. As the two begin their fight, they go from Negaal's office to the lawn.

Also tagging along with Joseph is the young assistant district collector Anura Mukerji IAS ([[Vani Viswanath]]), whose freecare style conflicts against Joseph's strict behavior because of her tragic childhood.

The next day, Joseph is brought over to a personal hearing with the state minister John Varghese ([[Kollam Thulasi]]), who berates him over his behavior while attempting to stop the riots.

As the investigation heats up, the local Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]) is struggling over the issues over the damaged area. However, it turns out that he is the mastermind behind the massacre, as he planned the communal violence against the slums to plan new real estate business in the area. Also involved in the conspiracy is Varghese himself, Kandanmkuzhi Thankachan (Azeez), and Shankar, who tries hard to topple off the investigation, revealing that he sent up the goons to find and kill Madhu to cover their tracks.  The local police medical surgeon Dr. Vijay ([[Vijay Menon (director)|Vijay Menon]]), who has conducted the autopsy of Madhu, later finds that Madhu was actually murdered.

Joseph, along with Sanjay and Prasad, find out that Dr. Vijay was injected with a powerful drug by the same goons who killed Madhu, which could have contributed to the accident. While Jayakrishnan flies off to Delhi to accept his new job as cabinet minister of Central Ministry, Joseph interrogates Varghese, who then reveals the identity of the leading goon responsible for the murders of Madhu and Dr. Vijay, Ananthashankara Iyer (T.S.

After Sanjay kills Iyer by hanging him on a chain, Joseph takes Vikram into custody, forcing him to reveal the identities of the people behind the conspiracy. On the arrival at the airport after a sworn-in ceremony as the new Cabinet Minister, Jayakrishnan is met by an angry Joseph and several other officers, as they have awaited for his return.

Land and Freedom
 The film's narrative unfolds in a long [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]. David Carr has died at an old age and his granddaughter discovers old letters, newspapers and other documents in his room: what we see in the film is what he had lived.  Carr, a young unemployed worker and member of the Communist Party, leaves [[Liverpool]] and travels to Spain to join the [[International Brigade]]s. He crosses the Spanish border in Catalonia and coincidentally ends up enlisted in a [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] [[militia]] commanded by Lawrence, in the [[Aragon]] front. In this company, as in all POUM militias, men and women – such as the young and enthusiastic Maite – fight together. In the following weeks and months he becomes friends with other foreign volunteers, like the French Bernard and the Irish Coogan, and the latter's girlfriend Blanca – with whom David Carr later falls in love – also a member of POUM, and also the [[ideologue]] of his group.  After being wounded and recovering in a hospital in [[Barcelona]], he finally joins – in accordance with his original plan and against the opinion of Blanca – the government-backed International Brigades, and he encounters the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda and repression against POUM members and [[anarchism|anarchists]]; he then returns to his old company, only to see them rounded up by a government unit requiring their surrender: in a brief clash Blanca is killed. After her funeral he returns to Great Britain with a red [[neckerchief]] full of Spanish earth.  Finally the film comes back to the present, and we see Carr's funeral, in which his granddaughter throws the Spanish earth into his grave after speaking lines from "The Day Is Coming",<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1885/chants/poems/poem1.htm Chants for Socialists by William Morris – 1. The Day is Coming], [[Marxist Internet Archive]]</ref> a poem by [[William Morris]]. <blockquote>''Join in the battle wherein no man can fail,'' <br>''For whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still prevail.''</blockquote> Afterwards she performs a [[raised fist]] salute, honouring his beliefs.  
Kounterfeit
  A counterfeiter of money is attacked by two masked men and threatened to inform them where a certain amount of counterfeited money is. The counterfeiter pleads ignorance and is subsequently killed. Tommy 'Hopscotch' Hopkins, who has the money, learns of the death of the counterfeiter and begins to fear for his own safety. Consequently, he asks his friend, the street smart Frankie (who owns a strip club), to assist him in an exchange of the fake money for real money which he has organised with some acquaintances. Frankie reluctantly agrees to assist his friend.  The two attend the venue of the exchange, which is the house of an undercover police officer, Danny who uses the alias Paco. Danny believes that he is being assisted by two FBI agents in order to arrest Frankie and Hopscotch. Instead the other two men shoot and kill Danny and attempt to kill Frankie and Hopscotch. Frankie manages to shoot the two men after they kill Danny and he and Hopscotch flee the house with the real and the fake money which is contained in three suitcases. Frankie also pulls some paper out of the jacket of one of the two purported FBI agents. The shootout is witnessed by Danny's sister Colleen, who was hiding in the house. Distraught, she mistakenly believes that Frankie killed her brother and provides the police with his description. After fleeing the scene, Frankie escorts Hopscotch to the house of the latter's brother, Marty. Frankie advises Hopscotch to lie low while he conjures up a plan of what to do with the money. Marty seems concerned that his brother is associating with someone like Frankie.   Colleen is comforted by the colleagues of her dead brother Danny, including his boss Captain Evans. He advises her that they will do whatever is necessary to find Danny's killers. The investigation into Danny's death is led by Vic, who is Colleen's former lover. It transpires that Vic had ended his relationship with Colleen acrimoniously years previously. Despite their troubled past, he spends time with Colleen to help her combat her grief. However, struggling to restrain her emotions, Colleen becomes frustrated with the investigation into her brother's death as she begins to believe that little progress is being made. As she persistently approaches Captain Evans, in a vexed mood, he advises her that they believe Danny was a 'dirty' cop, something which, based on her knowledge of her brother's character, she strenuously refutes. As a result, she loses faith with her brother's former colleagues and decides to conduct her own investigations. She manages to track down Frankie and asks to be allowed to perform at his strip club. He admits that she is pretty enough to do the job, but states that she ought to think it over before making any commitment.  Meanwhile, after Frankie is attacked by the two masked men who killed the counterfeiter, he and Hopscotch decide to bury the three suitcases of money in the desert to ensure that they are safe. After burying the money Hopscotch is killed and Frankie is forced to engage in a shootout with the killer. The killer is revealed to be one of the two masked men and Hopscotch's brother, Marty. Frankie persuades Marty to inform him of the identity of the other masked man who he soon learns is Vic. In a show of disloyalty, Vic kills Marty and requests that Frankie tell him of the whereabouts of the money. Frankie declines to do so and returns to his strip club, where in a private performance he watches Colleen audition for a job. Afterwards, Frankie takes Colleen to his apartment where they begin kissing. Suddenly, Colleen pulls out a gun and confronts Frankie about the death of her brother. Frankie is initially confused but then elucidates upon the events of the shoot out. He advises her that Danny appeared to trust the other two men who were in the room at his house when he was killed and that they turned on him. To convince Colleen that he is telling the truth he manipulates the gun so that Colleen only needs to pull the trigger in order to kill him.   Colleen believes Frankie and he escorts her to her car so that she can travel home. Vic sees Frankie and Colleen together and when Colleen is gone he advises Frankie to stay away from her. The next day Frankie visits Colleen and produces the piece of paper that he took from the purported FBI agent. The piece of paper is part of a map with directions on it in red ink. Frankie advises Colleen that he believes that Vic was involved in her brother's killing. He tells her to tell Vic's superiors in the police and take them to the desert. While Colleen travels to the police station, Frankie advises Vic that he has changed his mind and that he will share the money with him. Frankie and Vic drive to the desert where they dig up the cases with the money in. Meanwhile Colleen and Captain Evans arrive at the desert. Evans advises Colleen to wait in the car as he investigates. As he leaves in pursuit of Vic and Frankie, she finds the other half of the map on the dashboard of the car. Evans walks up a hill and sees Frankie and Vic with the cases of money. Vic manages to hit Frankie with a spade in an attempt to take all of the money for himself after which Evans confronts him. At this point Colleen arrives and Evans shoots Vic in an attempt to conceal his guilt in the affair. He then hugs Colleen and tells her that it is all over. Colleen, now aware that both Vic and Evans were responsible for her brother's death then shoots Evans. Afterwards she and Frankie arrange Vic's and Evans' bodies to make it seem as though they had killed each other in a dispute over one of the cases of money. They then walk off with the other two cases of money and with their arms around each other.  
The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving
 One day, a shower of [[meteorite|flying rocks]] impacts near the Great Valley and causes a rock slide in the Mysterious Beyond, which blocks the water supply of the Great Valley. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of the Great Valley, who have lived in relative peace and harmony until this event.  When the inter-species situation becomes worse and worse, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water to keep the peace in the Great Valley. They are pursued by Hyp, a ''[[Hypsilophodon]]''; Mutt, a ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]''; and Nod, a ''[[Nodosaurus]]'', a trio of teenage dinosaurs who constantly bully Littlefoot and his friends. When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the trio emerges and claims the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery. Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies. During the pursuit, the bullies are chased away by a wasp, and the children discover the reason behind the blockage of the Great Valley's water source.  Before they can return and tell the other Valley inhabitants the truth, lightning strikes a tree and ignites a [[wildfire]] that spreads rapidly throughout the dried Valley. The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of the Mysterious Beyond. When the children tell the adults of their discovery, disagreements about what to do erupts among the adults, preventing them from doing anything to utilize this knowledge. Hyp, Nod, and Mutt set out into the Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first.  Anticipating the danger, Hyp and his cohorts have gotten into recognizing commonality with them, Littlefoot and the others follow to help if necessary. It becomes so when Hyp jumps into a [[tar pit]];  after mistaking it for water. He calls for help, but Mutt and Nod do not save him. Instead, they argue about which one of them must save him. But Littlefoot cuts in, and tells Mutt and Nod that Hyp is stuck in the tar pit. Then, he hatches a plan to pull Hyp out. Finally, Littlefoot and the others pull him out of the tar. Soon afterwards, the adults appear in search of their children, and are finally united by the understanding that it was the unity of their children that helped them find water. It is implied during the discussion that Hyp's own experience of harsh treatment by his father is the cause of his harshness toward others.  Before they are able to take further steps, the herd is attacked by a pack of four ''[[Velociraptor]]s''. The pursuit leads to a dam of boulders created by the rock slide that has blocked the Valley's water supply. As the Sharpteeth and the adults battle, the children, including Hyp and his cronies, work together to break the dam. They all watch as the freed water and it washes away the Sharpteeth. The water also puts out the fires which are still burning in the Valley. Finally, they manage to survive and land on the opposite bank. Now the herd is able to return to the Great Valley.   The herd returns to the Valley, which now has enough water for them. However, the fire has destroyed most of their green food. Working together, the dinosaurs wait for the plants to regrow, feeding on the remainder proportionately by moving from one verdant area to another and sharing everything they find. This pattern results in the event being called "The Time of the Great Giving".

When Badri tries to kill Shiva, Adhi breaks free and wrestles with Badri and Adhi kills Badri.  Adhi, who believes that the mission to bring down all the terrorist organizations is more important than his life, orders Shiva to shoot him so that Shiva could continue to be the spy. Shiva shoots and kills Adhi just as the other terrorist members enter the room hearing the commotion inside. Shiva convinces the others that Badri was killed by Adhi and he killed Adhi. He proclaims that as Badri is dead, he, the second in command, will take over the reins of the group.

Last of the Dogmen
 Distraught but skillful bounty hunter Lewis Gates, accompanied by his horse and faithful companion Zip, an [[Australian cattle dog]], tracks three armed escaped convicts into Montana's Oxbow Quadrangle, at the persistence of his unforgiving father-in-law, who blames Gates for his daughter's tragic death.  Gates sees the convicts but hears shots.  Investigating the scene, all Gates finds is a bloody scrap of cloth, "enough blood to paint the sheriff's office," a bloody shotgun shell, and an old-fashioned Indian arrow.  Gates takes the arrow to archaeologist Lillian Sloan, who identifies it as a replica of the arrows used by [[Cheyenne]] [[Dog Soldiers]].  Gates doesn't think it's a replica and, after some library research, develops a long list of people who have disappeared into the Oxbow.  He also finds a story of a "wild child" captured in the woods in the early 20th century.  Now, he's convinced that the fugitives were killed by a tribe of Dog Soldiers, a hardy band of Native Americans who somehow escaped the 1864 [[Sand Creek massacre]] and survived for 128 years, secluded in the Montana Wilderness, killing anyone who threatened to find and expose them.  Gates convinces Sloan to join him in a search for the band.  The two enter the Oxbow and begin to search.  They survive many mishaps and bond throughout their journey, eventually venturing deeper into the wilderness than Gates has ever gone before, around 50 miles in.  After a week and nearing the end of their supplies, Sloan suggests heading back.  As the two are packing their gear, they are suddenly attacked by Cheyenne Indians. Sloan, speaking the Cheyenne language, deescalates the situation, and the two are taken captive by Yellow Wolf.  Taken to the Cheyenne encampment hidden behind a waterfall, the duo meet the village leader Spotted Elk, who tells them of the escape and salvation of the Cheyenne 128 years ago, as well as his own run-in with the "white people" when he was a child.  Gates and Sloan slowly become friendly with the Cheyenne.  However, Yellow Wolf's son is sick, wounded after the gunfight with the convicts.  Despite the elder's concerns, Sloan convinces Yellow Wolf to allow Gates to ride into town to obtain medicine.  In town, Gates robs the pharmacy and is chased by local law enforcement, including Sheriff Deegan, his father-in-law.  After escaping, Gates meets Yellow Wolf in the wilderness, and they return to the Cheyenne camp.  By this time, the sheriff has gathered a posse and sets out to hunt down Gates both for robbing the store and to find Gates' female companion, whom the sheriff believes Gates has hiding in the Oxbow.  Gates and Sloan continue to grow closer to the Cheyenne, and Sloan discloses that they are indeed the last of their kind.  However, Yellow Wolf shows Gates that the sheriff is following his trail and is slowly getting closer to the encampment.  Knowing that if discovered, the Cheyenne will fight and die, Gates proposes a solution; using some leftover TNT the Cheyenne had taken from explorers many years earlier, he'll create a distraction and allow the Cheyenne to flee deeper inside the Oxbow and live in peace, far away from civilization.  Sloan decides to stay with the Cheyenne, which Gates reluctantly agrees to.  The two share a passionate kiss, and Gates begins to set up his plan.  Gates gives himself up to the sheriff and pleads with him to leave the wilderness. However, the sheriff discovers the hidden tunnel and prepares to enter it.  Escaping, Gates attempts to light the TNT with a rifle, but the sheriff stops him and threatens him with a gun to his head.  Yellow Wolf appears, surprising the sheriff, and fires an arrow at the TNT, setting it off.  Gates and the sheriff are propelled out of the tunnel into the waterfall.  Gates saves the sheriff, who is badly wounded.  The deputy tells everyone to clear out, and they all head back to town to treat the wounded sheriff and Gates.  In Gates' holding cell, the sheriff confronts him about what Gates saw.  Gates relents and says some things don't need an explanation; they deserve to remain undiscovered.  This seemingly helps smooth over Gates' and the sheriff's relationship.  Sloan and the Cheyenne are shown to have successfully escaped.  An indeterminate time later, Gates has begun searching for them.  Using hints provided by Sloan, he is able to find them.  The film ends with a passionate embrace between Sloan and Gates.

The Last Good Time
 The film opens showing a small New York City apartment building at night, where a young couple on the top floor are seen arguing. Charlotte (d'Abo) throws a bag out of her window, with some contents landing on the window sill of downstairs neighbor Joseph (Mueller-Stahl). Joseph takes some of the items, which includes a [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]] key, and by the next day, Charlotte and her boyfriend Eddie ([[Adrian Pasdar]]) have apparently vacated the premises.  Focus is then shifted towards Joseph, a widowed German/Jewish violinist who lives a simple yet structured everyday routine that includes writing in a journal about what he will wear, visiting Howard (Stander), an old friend at a [[nursing home]] who is in the final stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]], trying to make arrangements on a tax debt, buying food at a discount [[grocery store]], and then returning home to read books and play his violin.  Charlotte returns to the apartment the following evening to recover missing contents from her bag, but notices her boyfriend's car pull up while doing so and quickly rushes into the building. She asks Joseph for a towel to dry off after the heavy rain, but subsequently collapses on his apartment floor. He gives her a blanket and pillow and lets her sleep there.  After some hesitation, Joseph lets Charlotte stay in his apartment indefinitely. Despite the age difference, the two slowly form a platonic bond; Joseph discusses his past violin career and interest in philosophers; Charlotte reveals that her now former boyfriend Eddie was involved in [[organized crime]] and that the relationship was purely for financial reasons. Charlotte is additionally impressed that Joseph – despite his age – could remember the words of philosophers, whereas her former boyfriend – a one-time musician – could barely remember "words to his own songs."  While the two opposites slowly forge a more intimate relationship, matters begin to change dramatically for Joseph – due to tax collectors, he is forced to withdraw his life savings of $6000 from his bank account; his old friend Howard dies, and upon returning home with Charlotte from a bar one night, he finds his apartment ransacked, his violin smashed and his entire life savings stolen. Frank ([[Kevin Corrigan]]), Eddie's fellow [[gangster]], had been following Charlotte around and traced her to Joseph's apartment. Joseph then gives Charlotte the missing locker key, the item Eddie and Frank were looking for. Charlotte angrily asks Joseph why he had this all along but never gave it to her, and Joseph explains because he didn't want her to leave.  Joseph, back to being the lonely man he was before, slowly reconciles with his elderly neighbor Ida (Stapleton), who he introduced to Charlotte and Howard, but had also been unfriendly towards for being too inquisitive about his life.  Charlotte returns a few days later informing Joseph she sold the locker key to one of Eddie's criminal associates for $7000. She gives Joseph $6000 of that money – the sum Joseph lost – and keeps the remaining $1000 for herself to start her life over, claiming she knows a friend in the city who owes her a favor. The two kiss and say goodbye.  The same morning, Joseph knocks on Ida's door and asks if she would like to accompany him on a NYC ferry the next day. Ida is interested, and Joseph agrees to pick her up the next morning.

Leprechaun 3
 In a Las Vegas pawn shop, a decrepit old man with one leg and hand shows up and pawns the shop owner Gupta with a statue wearing a medallion around its neck. The old man claims the statue is his good luck charm and warns Gupta to never touch the medallion it's wearing. Gupta cannot resist taking the medallion, so he removes it from the statue. Then a Leprechaun (Davis) suddenly springs to life from his statue prison, jumps on Gupta's back, and bites off a part of his ear, accusing him of being a greedy thief. Before he can cause him any more harm, Gupta reveals that he is wearing a medallion that he found on the Leprechaun's then petrified body. The Leprechaun grabs his pot of gold and runs from it and hides in the basement, where Gupta traps him inside. The Leprechaun notices one gold coin is missing.  Gupta then attempts to negotiate with the Leprechaun by allowing him to have half of the gold in exchange for the Leprechaun's freedom. Knowing he is being tricked, Leprechaun tosses the medallion aside. Gupta runs back upstairs to call for help, but is strangled to death by the Leprechaun via the phone cord.  Meanwhile, college student Scott McCoy has just arrived in Las Vegas, but while driving on the streets, he notices a woman with car trouble. He stops and gives her a ride to the Lucky Shamrock Casino, where she works. After she introduces herself as Tammy, Scott becomes immediately infatuated with her. While at the casino, Scott can't resist gambling, so he plays at the tables; but as a result, he loses all of his money at the roulette wheel due to it being rigged, so he goes to the local shop to pawn his watch, where he uncovers Gupta's lifeless body on the floor. While calling for police, Scott unknowingly finds and takes Leprechaun’s coin and is given one wish. The computer on the counter next to him states in folklore that one wish grants the mortal anything he or she desires and that it remains permanent if kept in possession by that mortal. After hearing this, Scott sarcastically wishes that he had a winning streak.  After he leaves the shop (via the coin's magic transporting him back), Scott strikes it rich at the casino, after which he realizes his wish had come true. He is later robbed by Loretta and Fazio, casino employees and then attacked by the Leprechaun. He is able to throw Leprechaun out of the hotel window, but in the process is bitten by the creature, and some of Leprechaun's blood mixes with his. During his stay at the casino, Scott begins to undergo Leprechaun-like tendencies (such as quoting random limericks in an Irish accent) or a were-leprechaun. In the meantime, Loretta and Fazio, along with the Lucky Shamrock's owner Mitch, pass the coin around making wishes. Mitch wishes he could sleep with Tammy, Loretta wishes for her 20-year-old body, and Fazio wishes that he were the greatest magician in the world.  Leprechaun has survived the fall and one by one, he kills them off. When Mitch goes up to have sex with Tammy, Loretta steals the coin, and when it leaves the vicinity of the room, Tammy snaps out of the coin's spell. After she leaves the room, the Leprechaun enters, using magic to turn the television on. There is a very sexy woman who looks just like Tammy on the TV and starts speaking Mitch's name. She comes out of the television and starts kissing Mitch. Mitch hears the Leprechaun on the television and looks up. When he looks back at the woman, she is actually a robot, which proceeds to electrocute him.  Scott and Tammy spot the Leprechaun beside Mitch's body; he asks for the coin to be given back to him. Scott and Tammy subdue the Leprechaun and flee Mitch's room. Two casino workers named Tony and Art walk in but are quickly killed by the Leprechaun. Outside the casino, Scott has begun to turn slowly into a Leprechaun himself from being bitten and must fight off his urges. When Tammy takes him to the nearest hospital, Scott is promptly taken to the examination room. The doctors notice irregularity in both his skin and blood, because of Scott's transformation. Scott, now a tall Leprechaun, stands up from his stretcher, subdues the medical officials observing him, and starts wandering around the hospital sensing that his "brother" is somewhere in the building. Tammy, worried over Scott's condition, ventures into the empty hospital hallways to find him. After she discovers a dead mortician, the Leprechaun captures her at the morgue and threatens to kill her if she doesn't tell him where Scott is. Before he can cause fatal harm to Tammy, Scott immediately appears and a showdown commences between the two.  As they each use magic to subdue one another, Leprechaun warns Scott that his Leprechaun-like tendencies cannot be fought so easily and that he would eventually be drawn to the gold's power. Scott then informs him that Fazio is the one who has the coin, so Leprechaun strolls away in the stretcher.  Meanwhile, back in the casino, Loretta wishes for her 20-year-old body back, and her wish comes true. When confronted by the Leprechaun in Fazio's dressing room, she tells him she doesn't have the coin anymore. The Leprechaun inflates her lips, boobs and butt. The inflated Loretta tries to escape via an open door, but becomes stuck when she tried to squeeze her newly inflated rump through. She continues to grow larger before finally exploding. Shortly after, Fazio wished to be the best magician in the world. During his magic performance, however, Leprechaun shows up, and attempts to saw him in half. Leprechaun possessed an actual chainsaw at the time, and Fazio knew that Leprechaun was going to kill him. Fazio attempts to make another wish on the coin that he would be at Caesar's Palace, but to no avail since the Leprechaun informs him that he already made one wish and that it's pointless because the coin only grants one wish. Everyone in the crowd starts insisting they want the saw trick to be done, not knowing that there would be that much blood and gore. The whole crowd, in disgust, sees Fazio being killed on stage; they all scream in fear.  Tammy and Scott arrive and warn the people to leave for their own safety. The audience immediately leaves, while Scott continues to battle with the Leprechaun. Still in Leprechaun form, Scott can't resist the pot of gold the Leprechaun leaves on the stage floor. Leprechaun promises Scott that if he takes the pot of gold, they'll share it, and Scott will be trapped as a Leprechaun for eternity. After hearing Tammy's pleas to not take it and that the Leprechaun's powers lie in his gold, Scott realizes that Tammy is right, and burns the gold, which in turn incinerates the Leprechaun. Scott morphs back to his regular self, and he and Tammy share a kiss and happily leave the casino together.

A Little Princess (1995 film)
 In the year 1914, Sara Crewe ([[Liesel Matthews]]) is the kind, caring and sweet daughter of Captain Richard Crewe ([[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]]), a wealthy aristocrat living in [[India]]. Sara's mother died when she was very young, and she has to leave her beloved childhood home and friends when her father volunteers to fight for the [[British army|British]] as an officer in [[World War I]]. Captain Crewe enrolls Sara at a girls' boarding school in [[New York (state)|New York]], and instructs the evil headmistress Miss Maria Minchin ([[Eleanor Bron]]) to spare no expense making sure his daughter will be comfortable while he is away. He has reserved her the school's largest suite, and gives Sara a special locket of her mother's picture, and a French doll named Emily, telling her that if she wants to talk to him, just speak to Emily and he will hear it. Though she finds the strict rules and Miss Minchin's harsh attitude stifling, Sara becomes popular among the girls, including the [[scullery maid]] Becky ([[Vanessa Lee Chester]]), for her kindness and strong sense of [[imagination]]. She writes constant letters to her father, which are a great source of happiness for him on the battlefield.  Due to a body being misidentified, Captain Crewe is declared dead when he is actually seriously injured and suffering from amnesia, and the British government seizes his company and assets. When Miss Minchin hears the news, she is in the middle of throwing a lavish birthday party for Sara, hoping to extort more money from her father. When Crewe's solicitor arrives and tells her there will be no more money, Miss Minchin is furious. Since Sara is now penniless and has no known relatives, Miss Minchin decides to move her to the attic with Becky to work as a servant where she will report to Mabel ([[Peggy Miley]]) at 5 a.m.  Meanwhile, the elderly neighbor Charles Randolph ([[Arthur Malet]]) has received word that his son John, who is also fighting in Europe, is [[Missing in Action|missing in action]]. He is asked to identify a soldier suffering from [[amnesia]], but he is discouraged to discover it is not John. His Indian assistant Ram Dass ([[Errol Sitahal]]) encourages him to take in the man anyway, reminding him that he may know what happened to his son.  Though her life is bleak, Sara remains kind to others and continues to hold onto her belief that all girls are princesses. Sara and Becky later play a chimney prank on Miss Minchin after she scolds a young [[chimney sweep]] boy ([[Jonás Cuarón]]). Sara even shows sympathy toward Miss Minchin's sister Amelia ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]). Ram Dass, who lives in the attic of the Randolph house, is brought to notice Sara and Becky by the household's monkey, and hears Sara telling imaginative stories to Becky. He mentions the girls to his employer, saying he would like to make some of their imaginings come true.  When her friends later sneak up to see her and are caught by Miss Minchin, she protects them by saying she invited them. As punishment, Miss Minchin locks Becky in her room and assigns Sara to perform both Becky's and her own chores for the next day without anything to eat for both of them. She even taunts Sara over believing she is still a princess. But when Sarah stands up to Miss Minchin, saying that all girls (including herself) are princesses despite their miserable lives, she angrily threatens to throw her out into the street if she's seen with the girls again. After Miss Minchin storms out, to distract them from their hunger, Sara and Becky imagine a huge banquet, with themselves warmly and attractively dressed, and a pleasant fire burning in the grate. The next day, they wake to find the dream has come true, having secretly been brought over by Ram Dass.  Later that night, Amelia sneaks out of the school and runs off with the milkman. When Miss Minchin notices Sara's locket is missing, she goes to Sara's room and confronts her in a rage. After she discovers all the finery left by Ram Dass, Miss Minchin accuses Sara of stealing everything and summons the police. With Becky's help, Sara narrowly avoids arrest by perilously climbing over to the Randolph house. Having failed to catch Sara, Miss Minchin insists the police arrest Becky for interfering with them. While hiding from the police, Sara comes across the soldier and realizes it is her father. Captain Crewe, though sympathetic to the girl, does not recognize her at all. As she tries to make him remember, Miss Minchin and the police arrive with Ram Dass and Mr. Randolph. Though the headmistress clearly recognizes Crewe, she falsely claims that Sara has no father, and choosing revenge over the truth, commands the police officers to seize her. As the police are about to take Sara away along with Becky, Crewe suddenly regains his memory, with help from Ram Dass, and rescues his daughter. Miss Minchin angrily walks away in defeat.  Some time later, Captain Crewe has cleared things up with Miss Minchin's superiors and the bank. The boarding school is given to Mr. Randolph, and his efforts make it a much happier place for the girls. The Crewe family's wealth is restored to them and they adopt Becky. Captain Crewe tells Mr. Randolph his son died in a gas attack, giving the man closure. As retribution for her cruelty to Sara and Becky, Miss Minchin seemingly loses her current title and high position and is reduced to a chimney sweeper, now working for the chimney sweeper boy she previously mistreated (who appears to be enjoying his revenge on Minchin). The film closes with Sara and Becky waving farewell to their former classmates as their carriage departs from the school and the family begins their return to India.

Living in Oblivion
 The film is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same [[film director|director]], crew and substantially the same cast.  '''Part one''': Director Nick Reve ([[Steve Buscemi]]) is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of [[New York City]].  The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the [[craft service]] table for a week.  The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother ([[Rica Martens]]) for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child.  However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of how the [[Microphone stand|mic boom]] is visible; the [[camera assistant]] fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors.  However, when Nicole ([[Catherine Keener]]) berates herself for acting badly, Cora (Rica Martens) reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother.  Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good.  Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again.  Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; [[cinematographer]] and [[camera operator]] Wolf ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take.  This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors.  Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies.  He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock.  He has dreamed the entire segment.  It is 4.30am; and he is due on set.  '''Part two''': Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino ([[James LeGros]]) is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room.  They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character ''Ellen'' and Chad's character ''Damian'' have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting.  He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by [[Scenic design|scenic light]].  Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's [[egomania]]; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes.  An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship.  Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good.  Nicole overhears this conversation on the [[Production sound mixer|sound mixer]]'s headphones.  Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him.  Chad loses his temper and quits the movie.  Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a "[[Twinkie|Hostess Twinkie]] motherfucker" and a fight breaks out.  Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him.  He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her.  They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the entire segment.  '''Part three''': Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a [[dream sequence]] in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] walks around her holding an apple.  Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, "you just got to roll with things."  Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened.  Nick manages to keep up  his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The [[smoke machine]] fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set.  However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito ([[Peter Dinklage]]) complains that the dream sequence is a cliché ("''I'' don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!") and walks off the set in disgust.  Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is "ready".  The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it.  Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of [[Room Tone|room tone]]. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and during this moment they each daydream about different things. They go on to shooting the next sequence.  
A Little Worm
 In 1929, in Chicago, 12-year-old [[Larry Adler]] was heralded as a prodigy of the harmonica.

In a moment of raw nerves, young Larry is unfazed and as a result, Capone's temper is thwarted and he rewards the boy with a drink at his table and an anecdote of jury bribery that went south. Unfortunately, this was a little above young Larry's head but he lived to tell the tale and won kudos from his peers.  
Little Red Riding Hood (1995 film)
 Little Red Riding Hood, named so because of the red riding [[Hood (headgear)|hood]] she wears, loves her grandmother. She's asked by her kind mother to take a basket of cakes and jam to her ill grandmother, who lives at the other side of the big [[Woodland|woods]]. Her mother warns her to be careful and not to talk to strangers, and to walk straight to her grandmother's house without any distractions; the young girl promises to obey her mother and is on her way. However, Little Red Riding Hood has a hard time obeying her mother when she first hears the crying of a sad [[deer]] in the forest. The small creature had forgotten his mother's birthday and was very disappointed. Little Red Riding Hood gives her new friend a suggestion to make his mother a lovely [[flower bouquet|bouquet]] of [[wild flower]]s, which he does happily. As she continues walking through the forest, the young girl meets another new friend, a pretty bird who is very talented at singing, but whose wing is wounded. Little Red Riding Hood encourages the bird not to be afraid, and when he finds the ability to fly without being scared and thus returns to his family, the grateful bird rewards the girl by teaching her how to [[whistling|whistle]], telling her to do so should she ever be in danger. Finally, Little Red Hood meets a large family of [[beaver]]s that are trying to build a [[dam]] but lack organization skills. Little Red  Hood offers to help, and though she is first turned away, the beavers finally accept. Working together, they learn about [[teamwork]] and their dam is finished in no time. The young girl bids her new friends farewell, and they too promise to return the favor someday. Little Red Riding Hood's friends come to her rescue when upon reaching her grandmother's house, she meets the terrible [[Big Bad Wolf|wolf]] that she had been told was wandering around in the woods. Working together once again, the girl and her animal friends manage to defeat the wolf, and rescue the grandmother, who'd been put away in order to be served as [[dessert]], learning many valuable [[lesson]]s from the experience.

Love Letter (1995 film)
  [[File:Otaru, Hokkaido.jpg|thumb|The street of Otaru where Shunji Iwai shot Love Letter.]] Hiroko Watanabe lives in [[Kobe]] and has lost her fiancé Itsuki Fujii in a mountain climbing accident. On the day of his memorial ceremony, two years after his death, Hiroko looks through his high-school yearbook at his parents' house. Mrs. Fujii explains that they used to live in Otaru, and that their old house is now replaced by a highway. Nevertheless, Hiroko records the address she sees under the name "Itsuki Fujii" in the yearbook, and decides to write him a letter. Surprisingly, she receives a reply from Fujii. Unsure who sent the reply, she keeps writing and finds out it was not from her dead fiancé, but from a woman also named Itsuki Fujii who went to high school with her fiancé and bears a striking resemblance to Hiroko. The movie cuts back and forth between Hiroko and Female Itsuki based on the letters they send to each other.  Female Itsuki works at the public library and is suffering from a cold that doesn't seem to go away, which she refuses to go to the hospital for. It is discovered that her father died of pneumonia when she was in high school. She is bewildered when she receives her first letter from Hiroko, having never heard of her. Nevertheless, she sends a reply saying she is fine and has a cold.  After her first reply from "Itsuki Fujii", Hiroko visits her friend Akiba, who also knew her fiance and was there during his accident. Hiroko shows Akiba the letter and says it's a message from heaven. Akiba tells Hiroko she needs to let Fujii go, proceeding to kiss her and confess the feelings that he has had for her (even when Hiroko and Itsuki were going out). He then promises to "free her". Hiroko, still holding onto her memories of Fujii, continues to write letters to Itsuki.  Female Itsuki suddenly writes back demanding to know who Hiroko is. Hiroko shares this with Akiba, unable to comprehend such a letter from her "fiance". Female Itsuki then receives a reply asking to "prove that you are the real Itsuki Fujii". She mails a copy of her residency card to Hiroko and asks her to not write back anymore. Hiroko is devastated by ID, and it is revealed that Akiba was the one who sent the letter asking for the "proof". He then tells Hiroko that they should visit Otaru to meet the female Itsuki Fujii to fully expose the truth and help her to move on.  On the day of the visit to Otaru, female Itsuki is tricked by her mother into going to the hospital to get her "cold" checked up. She falls asleep and has a dream/flashback of her father being wheeled into the hospital, chasing her mother and grandfather into the emergency. Waking up and having missed her appointment, she leaves the hospital.  While Itsuki is away, Akiba and Hiroko go to her home, passing by the said "highway" that was built over male Itsuki's old house. Upon reaching the house, they discover that female Itsuki is not home and opt to wait outside for her. However, unable to bring herself to meet Itsuki, Hiroko writes a letter for her, explaining she swung by the house and sent the letters thinking Itsuki was her fiance (leaving out the fact that he died 2 years ago). Akiba and Hiroko leave by taxi. The driver then says that he just sent home someone who looked exactly like Hiroko (Female Itsuki coming home from the hospital). A day later when Hiroko is leaving Otaru and Itsuki is out to put her reply letter in the mail, they momentarily spot each other before parting.  When Hiroko returns home, she flips through Itsuki's yearbook again and finds that there were in fact, 2 Itsuki Fujiis, the address she copied belonging to the female one. After she notices her physical similarity to female Itsuki, she begins to wonder if that was the reason why her fiance fell in love with her. She asks female Itsuki to confirm the "double Itsuki" theory, which she does, and requests for Itsuki to share her high school memories of her fiance.  The relationship between the Itsuki-s is told in flashbacks. Male Itsuki was portrayed as a shy young boy who kept to himself and behaved strangely. Male and Female Itsuki suffered teasing from fellow schoolmate as they were often "paired" them together as a couple due to their same names, despite both parties denying any such relationship. In the library, instead of working, Male Itsuki often would to write down his name on the check out cards of books that no one had checked out, thus being the only name on the card. Their relationship is highlighted by other memories like mixed up test papers, Male Itsuki jumping into a 100-meter dash despite having a broken leg, and Female Itsuki failing as a go-between for Oikawa, a disturbed girl with a crush on Itsuki. While away from school during her mourning period for her father, Female Itsuki is visited by Male Itsuki. He asks her to return a book for him, not stating the reason why, and quickly leaves. Female Itsuki returns to school after vacation and is upset to find that Male Itsuki has transferred, making the book exchange the last time she ever saw him.  Switching back to the present, female Itsuki goes to her old school where she meets some school girls in the library who tell her they have found so many cards with her name on it. After she explains that her "friend" wrote the names, the girls quickly assume that her name was written everyone because that friend "loved her very much", embarrassing Itsuki. Before leaving, her old teacher reveals to Female Itsuki that Male Itsuki died in the mountain accident 2 years ago.  On Akiba's suggestion, he and Hiroko go to the mountain where Itsuki died, with Hiroko struggling to come to terms with Itsuki's death. They stay the night in the cabin of Kaji, another friend of Male Itsuki who witnessed his death. The 3 friends share their memories of Itsuki.  Female Itsuki suddenly collapses from a high fever. Her mother realizes that the neglected "cold" has become pneumonia and Itsuki is suffering the same fate as her father. Her mother asks Grandpa to call an ambulance, who say they can only come in 1 hour's time as there is a massive blizzard outside. Grandpa decides to take matters into his own hands and prepares to carry Itsuki to the hospital by foot in the storm. Mother attempts to stop Grandpa by reminding him that it was because Grandpa did the same thing to Itsuki's father that he died. Grandpa reminds her that it wasn't the snow, but the fact they waited for the ambulance too long before deciding to go by foot, thus taking 40 minutes to get to the hospital. Mother decides to take the risk and brave the storm. When they finally reach it, Itsuki, as well as an out of breath Grandpa, are sent to the emergency room, just short of the 40 minute death clock.  In the mountains Akiba wakes up Hiroko and asks her to watch the sun rise with him. He points out a mountain peak and says that is where Itsuki is. He greets Itsuki by yelling to the mountains and jokingly saying he is '"taking Hiroko away from him". Hiroko then runs closer to the mountains and cries to Itsuki, mimicking the first letters between Hiroko and female Itsuki by shouting "Fujii Itsuki, How are you? I'm fine". Miles away, female Itsuki wakes up in the hospital.  Some time later, Hiroko and Itsuki have somewhat become pen pals. Itsuki prepares to write a letter about something that happened recently. The school girls from her high school visited female Itsuki with the book that Male Itsuki gave her before he left. They point to the check out card and as she suspected, his name was on it. However, on the back of the card, Itsuki is deeply moved to find a portrait of herself that Male Itsuki sketched. Instead of writing the letter about the drawing, the film ends with Female Itsuki narrating "Dear Watanabe Hiroko, I am too embarrassed to send this letter".  
Losing Isaiah
 While craving her next hit, Khaila Richards ([[Halle Berry]]), an African-American [[crack cocaine]] [[addiction|addict]], abandons her baby Isaiah in the rubbish. She promises to "come back later", but then passes out from the drug. The next day, the baby narrowly escapes death in the garbage truck. Then, Isaiah is sent to the [[hospital]], where they discover he is also addicted to crack through his mother's addiction. While caring for Isaiah, a white [[social worker]] named Margaret Lewin ([[Jessica Lange]]) grows increasingly fond of him and eventually [[adoption|adopts]] him to live with her and her white husband, Charles ([[David Strathairn]]) and daughter, Hannah. Meanwhile, Khaila is caught [[shoplifting]] and is sent to [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], unaware Isaiah is alive.  Three years later, Khaila successfully completes her treatment and confesses to her case worker that she abandoned Isaiah in the alley. Unknown to Khaila, the case worker investigates and discovers Isaiah's adoption. They hire a lawyer, Kadar Lewis ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) to contest the [[adoption]]. An ugly court battle ensues, with racial issues demonstrating inadequacies on both sides. The judge overturns the adoption, returning Isaiah to Khaila, much to the Lewins' horror and sadness.  Even after weeks pass, a distraught Isaiah does not consider Khaila his mother. Although he becomes increasingly withdrawn, he is also prone to violent public outbursts. Eventually, Khaila is desperate for Isaiah's happiness, and asks Margaret to step back in "for a little while... until he can understand." However, she insists she will also continue to be involved. The two mothers embrace each other, both proclaiming their love for Isaiah. The film ends with them together playing building blocks with their boy in a classroom.

When informed that Nix's followers have murdered Quaid, Dorothea suggests they hire D'Amour to investigate the murder.  D'Amour agrees, and she invites him to Swann's magic show.  Swann performs a new death-defying illusion which goes wrong, and he is killed on stage.  D'Amour goes to [[The Magic Castle]], where he hears Nix being described as a legend, and that Nix was believed to have taught Swann.  After getting into the Repository, a special room in the Magic Castle that supposedly contains every magic secret known to man, he discovers that Swann's "illusions" involved real magic.  Later, at Swann's house, Dorothea reveals that she was the girl that Nix kidnapped, and that she married Swann because of a sense of obligation.  Dorothea and D'Amour make love; afterwards, D'Amour is attacked by a man engulfed in fire. Suspecting a ruse, D'Amour opens Swann's coffin and finds that the body inside is fake.  Valentin, Swann's assistant, explains that he helped Swann fake his death.  D'Amour agrees to allow Valentin and Swann's ruse to continue.  At the funeral, D'Amour follows a suspicious looking man who turns out to be Swann, who, in jealousy, attacks D'Amour with magic.  D'Amour convinces the emotionally hurt Swann to help him put an end to Nix's cult.  Butterfield kidnaps Dorothea, using her as a hostage to force Valentin to recover Nix's body.  After finding Nix's corpse, Butterfield stabs Valentin and takes the corpse back to the old house in the desert.  There, his cultists have returned to witness Nix's resurrection and follow him once again.  Butterfield removes the iron mask and Nix regains consciousness.  Swann and D'Amour, acting on information given by the dying Valentin, arrive.  Swann attacks Butterfield and tells D'Amour to rescue Dorothea.  Nix, instructing his followers to prepare to receive his wisdom, opens a hole in the ground beneath him and Dorothea and turns the earth into quick sand that swallows the cultists, declaring that only Swann is worthy of receiving his knowledge.  D'Amour finds Nix and Dorothea, and as D'Amour steps onto the hardened quicksand, Nix opens his eyes, says "You are not Swann!. . . I know what you want!" (referencing the earlier liaison between D'Amour and Dorthea). Nix then drops her into the hole; D'Amour rescues her as Swann enters the room.  As they flee, D'Amour and Dorothea are attacked by Butterfield, whom D'Amour kills.  Swann agrees to act as Nix's disciple, even answering "Yes" to Nix asserting that Swann would be killed by Nix after they destroyed the world. But when Swann admits to caring for Dorthea, Nix then attacks with magic and breaks some of Swann's bones and apparently kills him by destroying his brain.  Dorothea finds D'Amour's gun and shoots Nix in his third eye after D'Amour points to the center of his forehead.  Nix then begins to transform into a hideous creature.  Swann turns out not to be dead and uses his last life energy and magic to help D'Amour deliver a final blow to Nix, who falls into the hole, which is shown to have no bottom. Dorothea holds Swann in her arms as he succumbs to his injuries.  Dorothea and D'Amour escape the house and walk into the desert.

After he leaves the military, Payne finds life as a civilian unbearable and reaches his breaking point.

When Stone's alcoholic, obnoxious stepfather appears unannounced and harasses Alex, Major Payne orders him away, granting Payne an iota of respect with the cadets.  Payne is asked to return to the Marines to fight in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], but his deployment means he will miss the Military Games and disappoint the boys and Emily. As he waits for his train, he sees a vision of himself barbecuing in a front yard with Emily and Tiger, prompting him to realize that he was falling in love with Emily and developing a closeness to Tiger.  At the games, the boys are holding their own until Dotson, now a Wellington cadet, trips up Alex during the race, spraining his ankle and rendering him unable to lead the drill. This also incites a rumble between the teams that threatens to disqualify Madison after Williams hits Dotson in the face in retribution for Alex's injury. However, Payne gives up his commission and shows up at the last minute, smooths things over with the referees and appoints Tiger to lead the cadence. The group executes an unorthodox but entertaining routine which wins them the trophy.  On the first day of the new school year, Payne resumes being an instructor, having married Emily and adopted Tiger. Stone resumes his role as a squad leader. He has softened quite a bit, telling the new recruits he's not only their commanding officer, but also their friend. When a new, disrespectful blind cadet shows up with his service dog, Payne shaves both him and his dog bald with his "field knife," and laughs.

Man of the House (1995 film)
  Six year old Ben Archer watches silently as his father starts up his car and drives away with his secretary, and they both offer only a wave out the window in parting. His mother, Sandy (Fawcett), can only watch heartbroken from the window of their house as her ex husband leaves them. Ben’s father promised to visit him, yet never comes back.  They are both upset, but they decide to have a fresh start, so they move into a loft apartment in downtown [[Seattle]] to begin a new life with just the two of them. Sandy makes creative efforts to turn it into a home for them. They gradually overcome his father leaving and foster a very close bond with important rituals and routines, including making a collage with beach debris.   Sandy develops an interest in dating, but her suitors never fit well and don’t last long, which allows Ben’s ideal relationship with his mother to resume. Five years later, however, Sandy decides she’s ready for marriage again, and begins seriously dating U.S. Attorney aka federal prosecutor Jack Sturges (Chase).  In Federal Court, Jack successfully prosecutes mobster Frank Renda for drug trafficking. Before being sentenced to fifty years in federal prison at Sheridan, the elderly Frank makes a veiled threat of revenge towards Jack. After court is adjourned, Frank’s son Joey rephrases the threat in a more intimidating manner, but Jack does not back down and then dismisses him entirely.  Sandy and Jack discuss his moving in, of which eleven year old Ben (Thomas) does not approve despite his mother’s reassurance that it is only a trial period. Jack is confident he can win him over, telling Sandy he has read every book on step parenting he could find.   The transition does not go smoothly for Ben, as he resentfully feels he is the one suffering all of the adjustments and that his mother is making the same mistake she made with his father, so he resorts to ensuring Jack is as uncomfortable and unwelcome as possible. Jack tries taking the subterfuge in stride, not realizing it is deliberate, but his efforts to connect with the boy are met with irritation as he only succeeds in disrupting Ben’s customary lifestyle.  After meeting a boy named Norman Bronski at school, Ben feigns interest in joining the Indian Guides – a [[YMCA]] father son program – with Jack to secretly drive a wedge between them and get rid of him. Despite reluctance, Jack goes along with it at Sandy’s insistence, and he and Ben join Norman's "tribe," the Minotauks. Neither of them like the club, but Ben manages to effectively humiliate Jack at meetings.   Once it starts interfering with his job, Jack tells Sandy he can no longer be part of it. Ben fakes distress by this and compares it to his father leaving to turn Sandy against her boyfriend.  Jack goes to apologize, and instead overhears Ben bragging about everything over the phone to his best friend Monroe.   Although he is disheartened by this revelation, Jack doesn’t tell Sandy about it and instead seeks advice from Indian Guides chief and fellow stepfather Chet Bronski ([[George Wendt]]). Chet tells Jack, the reason why Ben is doing this because he is afraid Jack will take his mother away from him. Chet was like Jack himself, Norman and Chet never got along, but the Indian Guides help them have a great relationship. That is what Jack will do. He then redoubles his efforts to bond with Ben by improving the Indian Guides. Meanwhile, Ben starts to connect with Norman and they become close friends after a sleepover.  Just as Jack starts to strengthen his relationship with Ben, Joey’s threat catches up with him: the brakes on his [[Ford Explorer]] are cut, but Jack manages to avoid a more serious crash and ends up in [[Puget Sound]]. This causes him to miss an important canoe trip he promised to attend. Ben, having finally opened up, is genuinely hurt by this perceived betrayal to the point of tears, as it brings up bad memories of his father’s broken promises.  Jack conceals the truth and refuses his boss Bob’s order to transfer to Portland, Oregon so he can redeem himself to Ben in an upcoming camping trip. His initial attempts are unsuccessful, and he feels the situation is hopeless. Joey and his two goons, Murray and Tony, are then discovered in the woods with rifles by Ben planning to kill Jack, and Jack confesses the truth behind his “car trouble” which garners Ben's forgiveness and understanding as he now knows Jack didn't intentionally betray his trust like his father. Jack sends the rest of the Indian Guides to the ranger station while he and Ben (who returned to help him) improvise to distract the criminals.  The pair is eventually cornered in front of an abandoned mine shaft entrance rigged with dynamite, until they’re rescued by the Minotauks and the crooks are disabled. Ben is impressed and finally gives his approval of Jack and consents to Jack proposing to Sandy. The two complete the beach collage, which symbolizes that the three of them are finally whole as a family. Jack and Sandy marry, with the Minotauks in attendance at the wedding, and despite nothing being perfect, all are happy.

The trouble starts when Gartley's niece, Sherry (Pike), accidentally cuts herself on a lever connected to the machine and splashes blood on the Mangler's tread while trying to avoid being crushed by an old ice box some movers are clumsily carrying past. Sparks and light streams occur when both the blood and the ice box come into close contact with the Mangler. Later, Mrs. Frawley, an elderly worker, struggling to open a bottle of antacids, spills them on the moving tread. When she attempts to collect them, the safety shield inexplicably lifts up and traps her hand inside, followed by her entire body getting pulled into the machine, crushed and folded like a sheet.  Police officer John Hunton (Levine), with the help of his demonologist brother-in-law Mark (Matmor), investigates the incident and the ones that soon follow. As the plot progresses, Mark tries to convince Hunton that the machine may be possessed, especially after seeing the possessed ice box, and the only way to stop the deaths is to [[exorcism|exorcise]] the machine to dispel whatever demon is inhabiting it. They also come to learn Gartley and the town elders have all sacrificed their virginal daughters to the machine on their 16th birthdays in exchange for wealth and power, with Gartley planning to do the same to Sherry to complete his end of the bargain.  With the help of Sherry, the two men attempt to exorcise the demon – which also kills Gartley, his lover and protégé Lin Sue and the laundry's foreman Stanner – by reciting a prayer and administering holy water. The machine gives one last groan and shuts down. As the three sigh with relief, Hunton takes some antacids, admitting to Mark that they belonged to Mrs. Frawley. Mark suddenly realises that the key ingredient in the antacids is [[Atropa belladonna|deadly nightshade]], also called "the Hand of Glory" as outlined in his occult book. Since the machine was accidentally fed the same antacids, Mark realises that not only was the exorcism useless, as the demon is still alive, it is now stronger than ever. The machine bursts to life and now appears to have a mind of its own, shedding off pieces of metal and rising up in the manner of a wild beast. The three run through the warehouse as they are chased by the now-mobile Mangler. The Mangler tears Mark apart, killing him, while John and Sherry descend a flight of stairs, where Sherry attempts to give herself to the Mangler to stop it, only to be stopped by John. In their hurry to escape, they fall through a large manhole into the sewer below, the machine struggling to get to them. Suddenly, something falls from the machine into the water and a mechanical wail ensues. The machine draws back and becomes still, and John and Sherry escape.  While waiting to hear news on Sherry, John receives a letter from his departed friend and confidant, photographer J.J.J. Pictureman (Crutchley), who warns him not to trust anyone in the town missing a body part as they are possessed by the Mangler. Time passes and John goes to check up on her. However, to great dismay, he discovers the machine has returned to its place on the floor and resumed its duties as a speed ironer and Sherry, now missing her ring finger from her encounter with the Mangler, has taken her uncle's place as the new tyrannical owner of the Blue Ribbon Laundry. He throws the flowers he brought her away and leaves the factory for good.

They come upon a spaceship graveyard orbiting a giant space station. The crew's two engineers, Heintz and Miguel, enter it to get a closer look.  Once inside, they discover an opulent European interior and several furnished rooms (in varying states of decay), but find no signs of life. They discover that the station belongs to a once famous opera diva named Eva Friedel who disappeared after the murder of her fiancé, Carlo Rambaldi, a fellow singer. Continuing the search for the source of the signal, the engineers split up, with each experiencing paranormal encounters, including strange noises and visions of Eva. Miguel enters the dilapidated underbelly of the station, and in a cavernous chamber he finds a broken piano playing the distress signal. He begins to hallucinate and Eva suddenly runs up to kiss him.  Heintz finds a theater stage and sees Eva, who stabs him when he approaches. Suddenly paralyzed, Heintz relives a memory of his family, with his wife and daughter Emily. The illusion disappears when Eva takes his wife's form and tells him that he "will never leave". Heintz rushes to save Miguel, only to find that he had been seduced by Eva into thinking he is Carlo. Eva reveals to Heintz that she murdered the real Carlo for refusing to marry her and has forced others to look like him. She makes Heintz relive his daughter's death and nearly convinces him to join her. He resists and shoots the massive computer embedded in the ceiling causing the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] hologram of Eva to malfunction.  The Corona has been struggling against a powerful magnetic field coming from the station, pulling the ship towards it. In desperation, they fire a powerful energy cannon, gouging the structure deep enough to reach the cavern. Heintz is ejected into space (along with Eva's past victims), as Eva hauntingly sings to a conjured audience. The Corona is crushed and becomes part of the rose-like shape around the station.

Heintz is last seen drifting in space, still alive.  ===''Stink Bomb''=== This story is based in part on the [[Gloria Ramirez]] incident.

The pills are part of a biological weapon program, reacting to the flu shot already in his body. Tanaka soon develops a deadly body odor and becomes a walking weapon of mass destruction. While taking a nap, the odor he emits kills everyone in the Lab. Horrified, he reports the incident to headquarters, as they instruct  him to deliver the experimental drug to [[Tokyo]]. Meanwhile, the odor he emits grows stronger to where it affects several miles of the surrounding area, killing every living thing that smells his odor, except flowers and plants. The Odor is so potent that [[Gas masks]], and [[NBC suit|NBC Suits]] offer no protection against its effects. His odor kills everything in the [[Yamanashi, Yamanashi|Yamanashi Prefecture]], including all 200,000 inhabitants of [[Kōfu]] city. Nobuo continues on to Tokyo unaware of the death his smell is causing, but the rest of the country is in a complete panic. The head of the research company and the Japanese military deduce that Tanaka is causing the poisonous gas and order him to be killed. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japanese Military]] tries in vain to stop Nobuo, causing immense collateral damage to the Japanese countryside, but to no avail, as the chemicals on Nobuo smell cause interference on the targeting systems of its heat-seeking missiles.  The [[United States Forces Japan|U.S. military]], who have been observing the situation to that point, utilizes [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Japanese policy]] to take over the operation, and calls in a [[NASA]] unit with space suits to try and capture Nobuo alive. Unaware of this operation, the Japanese army collapses part of the bridge to prevent Nobuo from escaping, trapping him in a tunnel. They turn on wind generators loaded with [[liquid nitrogen]] in an attempt to freeze him. Tanaka becomes scared, disabling the machines while leaving the three astronauts unscathed. The soldiers force Tanaka into an exosuit and bring him back to military headquarters in Tokyo. Tanaka makes his way through the headquarters building, unaware that he is the source of the biological contamination. He then opens his exosuit, killing everyone.  ===''Cannon Fodder''=== In a walled city perpetually at war, everyone's livelihood depends upon maintaining and firing the enormous cannons that make up most of the city.

The story is centered on a young boy and his father, who works as a lowly cannon-loader.  The city is surrounded by clouds of smoke and dust provoked by the shots fired by the cannons. Despite news of successful bombardment of the "enemy moving city" by the local media, there is not any visual confirmation that it is true, or even if there is an enemy at all.

Mortal Kombat (film)
 Mortal Kombat is a fighting tournament between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the [[Elder Gods (Mortal Kombat)|Elder Gods]] amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor [[Shao Kahn]] will be able to invade and conquer the Earthrealm.  [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin monk]] [[Liu Kang]] and his comrades, movie star [[Johnny Cage]] and military officer [[Sonya Blade]] were handpicked by [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host [[Shang Tsung]] for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] for murdering a fellow officer; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise.  At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to [[Kitana|Princess Kitana]], Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], whose defense seems untouched because of his freezing abilities until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero.  Prince [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] enters the tournament and mercilessly crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Sonya worries that they may not win against Goro, but Raiden disagrees. He reveals their own fears and egos are preventing them from winning the tournament.  Despite Sonya's warning, Cage comes to Tsung to request a fight with Goro. The sorcerer accepts on the condition that he be allowed to challenge any opponent of his choosing, anytime and anywhere he chooses. Raiden tries to intervene, but the conditions are agreed upon before he can do so. After Shang Tsung leaves, Raiden confronts Cage for what he has done in challenging Goro but is impressed when Cage shows his awareness of the gravity of the tournament. Cage faces Goro and uses guile and the element of surprise to defeat the defending champion. Now desperate, Tsung takes Sonya hostage and takes her to Outworld, intending to fight her as his opponent. Knowing that his powers are ineffective there and that Sonya cannot defeat Tsung by herself, Raiden sends Liu and Cage into Outworld in order to rescue Sonya and challenge Tsung. In Outworld, Liu is attacked by Reptile(under orders from Shang Tsung to prevent him and Cage from rescuing Sonya), but eventually gains the upper hand and defeats him. Afterward, Kitana meets up with Cage and Liu. She reveals to the pair the origins of both herself and Outworld. Kitana allies with them and helps them to infiltrate Tsung's castle while advising Liu Kang about three challenges in the castle: To face his enemy, himself and his worst fear.  Inside the castle tower, Shang Tsung challenges Sonya to fight him, claiming that her refusal to accept will result in the Earth realm forfeiting Mortal Kombat (this is, in fact, a lie on Shang's part). All seems lost for Earth realm until Kitana, Liu, and Cage appear. Kitana berates Tsung for his treachery to the Emperor as Sonya is set free, claiming that his arrogance and greed will cost him the tournament if he doesn't honor his deal. Tsung challenges Cage but is counter-challenged by Liu. During the lengthy battle, Liu faces not only Tsung but the souls that Tsung had forcibly taken in past tournaments. In a last-ditch attempt to take advantage, Tsung morphs into Chan. Seeing through the charade, Liu renews his determination and ultimately fires an energy bolt at the sorcerer, knocking him down and impaling him on a bed of spikes. Tsung's death releases all of the captive souls, including Chan's. Before ascending to the afterlife, Chan tells Liu that he will remain with him in spirit until they are once again reunited.  The Warriors return to Earthrealm, where a victory celebration is taking place at the Shaolin temple. The jubilation abruptly stops, however, when Shao Kahn's giant figure suddenly appears in the skies. When the Emperor declares that he has come for everyone's souls, Raiden declares "I don't think so," and the warriors take up their fighting stances.  
Money Train
  Foster brothers John and Charlie work as transit cops patrolling the New York City subway. On Christmas, they chase a mugger into a subway tunnel. All trains traveling in their direction are halted but transit captain Donald Patterson allows the money train to continue. John and Charlie avoid getting hit by the train and the mugger, a teenage boy, is shot dead at the next station by transit cops guarding the money train. This triggers a brawl between John, Charlie and the other transit cops. Patterson blames the two for causing the money train to arrive late.  Charlie asks John to borrow $300 to buy a Christmas present, but Charlie instead uses the money to pay off some of his gambling debts to the sleazy night club owner Mr. Brown. Brown intends to have Charlie killed by throwing him off a building, but John bursts in and interrupts, telling Brown that he has the money Charlie owes him. Brown reveals to John that Charlie is $15,000 in debt, so John offers to have the money delivered in a few days. Brown accepts and lets Charlie live.  During their night shift, John and Charlie are introduced to Grace Santiago, a decoy transit officer newly assigned to their unit. Both brothers immediately take a liking to her. During their patrol, a serial killer known as the Torch robs a token booth and sets it on fire. John and Charlie rescue the booth worker and put out the fire, but the Torch manages to escape.  At a local bar, Charlie reveals a plan to rob the money train in order to pay off their debts, but John, judging the caper impossible, rejects the idea. Later that night, the two brothers and Grace are assigned to patrol the money train. As Charlie discovers a grate in the floor and a ladder leading to Central Park, a brawl breaks out between John and another officer, quickly involving the entire squad. Patterson again blames the two for the incident and also accuses them of taking some train money, but even after it is found that a collection agent miscounted, Patterson continues to insult them. At the bar, Charlie tells John that the best time to rob the money train would be on New Year's Eve because of looser subway security and because the subway makes the most money on that date: up to $500,000. The plan involves entering the train through the metal grate when the train has stopped, driving it to the maintenance ladder, and escaping into Central Park. John remains reluctant to attempt the theft.  John gives Charlie the $15,000 he needs to pay back Mr. Brown, but on the train, Charlie loses it to a thief. He goes to Brown to explain but is brutally beaten by his men. When Charlie comes back home, he looks at John's house from his window and he sees Grace and John sleeping together. Charlie later tells John that he's happy for him, but he's clearly saddened by Grace's rejection.  To nab Torch, an ambush is arranged for which Grace is disguised as an attendant at a station token booth. Torch notices this and, to distract the police, pushes a man in front of a moving train, killing him. Torch sprays gasoline on Grace, but before he can light it, Charlie alerts the other officers, who shoot at Torch. John pursues him into another station, where they fight. Torch is burned by the gasoline he's carrying and pushed under a moving train, killing him. Patterson fires Charlie for ruining the ambush, and when John tries to defend Charlie, he's fired as well.  John then heads to the strip club of the mobsters who beat up his brother and were threatening him for failing to pay up his gambling debts and, after storming inside, beats them all up utilizing his Kung-Fu skills, including knocking down (and killing) the criminal boss of the organization, Brown, with a [[360 Crescent kick|360-degree kick]].  Charlie decides to go ahead with his robbery plan. John is reluctant to do anything about this, but Grace persuades him to save Charlie from trouble. When the money train stops at one of the stations, Charlie enters the train from beneath and drives it to the maintenance ladder, but he can't escape with the money due to the presence of a group of policemen. Meanwhile, John reaches the train and persuades Charlie to drive further to prevent their arrest. Knowing that Patterson will direct his team to trip the train's brakes, the duo bleeds the brakes. Patterson then orders a steel barricade erected to stop the train, but John increases the speed of the money train to its maximum so that it smashes through the barricade. Transit control officer Kowalski declares the money train a runaway and starts clearing tracks, but Patterson diverts the money train onto a track occupied by a passenger train to keep it from having a clear path, putting innocent people at grave risk. The money train rams into the passenger train and then slows down, but speeds up again because it's in full throttle and rams the train again. It repeatedly keeps ramming the passenger train with the increasing risk of derailing it and killing everyone on board.  Since the money train now had no braking power and the throttle lever is jammed at full power, the brothers decide to throw it into reverse, derailing it and killing both of them but allowing the passengers to live. Charlie comes up with an idea and positions an iron bar in such a way that when the money train rams the other train once more, the bar trips the reverse lever. Both of them climb on top of the train and proceed to the front. When the trains collide one more time, the reverse lever is activated and both brothers jump across to the other train as the money train derails tumbles around several times knocking over several support beams (much to the horror of Patterson who witnesses the whole crash) before finally screeching to a stop on its side just before the station.  The brothers try to escape during the commotion but are spotted by Patterson. They pretend to have come to help him, but Patterson rudely insults them. Fed up with his constant abuse, the brothers punch him in the face. As he shouts out to his team to arrest them for assault, Grace comes rushing in and arrests Patterson for endangering the lives of the people on the passenger train. When the two brothers exit the station, they are in Times Square as the countdown for the New Year begins. During the celebration, John realizes Charlie is carrying a money bag containing over $500,000, much to his dismay. The film ends with John and Charlie walking into the distance arguing over the money.

Mr. Holland's Opus
  In [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1965, Glenn Holland is a talented musician and [[composer (music)|composer]] who has been relatively successful in the exhausting life of a professional musical performer. However, in an attempt to enjoy more free time with his young wife, Iris, and to enable him to compose a piece of [[orchestra|orchestral music]], the 30-year-old Holland accepts a teaching position at John F. Kennedy High School.  Unfortunately for Holland, he is soon forced to realize that his position as a music teacher makes him a [[marginalized]] figure in the faculty's hierarchy. Many of his colleagues, and some in Kennedy High's administration, including the school's vice principal Gene Wolters, resent Holland and question the value and importance of music education given the school's strained budget. However, he quickly begins to win many of his colleagues over. Holland finds success using [[rock and roll]] as a way to make classical music more accessible to his students.  Holland's lack of quality time with Iris becomes problematic when their son Coltrane(Cole), is found to be deaf. Holland reacts with hostility to the news that he can never teach the joys of music to his own child. Iris willingly learns [[American Sign Language]] to communicate with her son, but Holland resists. This causes further estrangement within his family.  As the years progress, Holland grows closer to his students at Kennedy High and more distant from his own son. He addresses a series of challenges created by people who are either hesitant or hostile towards the concept of musical excellence within the walls of the average American high school. He inspires numerous students, but never has private time for himself or his family, delaying the completion of his own orchestral composition. Eventually, he reaches an age when it is too late to have a realistic chance of finding financial backing, or ever having it performed.   In 1995, the adversaries of the Kennedy High music program win a decisive institutional victory. Wolters, now promoted to principal, works with the board of education to eliminate funding for music along with other fine arts programs, thus leading to Holland's early retirement. Holland realizes that his career in music is likely over, thinking that his former students have mostly forgotten him and is dejected at his failure ever to have his composition, which he views as his life's work, performed.  On his final day as a teacher, Holland enters the school auditorium, where his professional life is surprisingly redeemed. Hearing that their beloved teacher is retiring, hundreds of his former students have secretly returned to the school to celebrate his life.  Holland's orchestral piece, never before heard in public, has been put before the musicians by his wife and son. One of his most musically challenged students, Gertrude Lang, now the [[Governor of Oregon]], takes the podium and explains to Holland that the symphony he wrote is not his only legacy... it's the people he has inspired and taught, all of the people he has helped to make a better person, that is his true legacy. Gov. Lang then sits among the musicians with her clarinet, but not before asking Holland to step on up on stage and serve as their [[conducting|conductor]] for the premiere performance of ''Mr. Holland's Opus'' ("The American Symphony"). A proud Iris and Cole look on, appreciating the affection and respect that Holland receives.

Meanwhile, a park ranger named Hendricks is ordered by the park chief to spray gaseous mosquito repellent.  Afterwards, three bank robbers, Earl, Junior, and Rex, stop in the park. Rex walks to an [[outhouse]], where he encounters a giant mosquito. He runs from it, calling for help, and is accidentally shot by Junior. Earl kills the mosquito with a shotgun. Later, two park rangers are fishing when they are attacked by mosquitoes. One of the rangers has his eye gouged out by a mosquito; the other ranger falls off the boat into the water, and after swimming back to land, is killed when a mosquito stabs him with its proboscis.   That night, a couple is having sex in a tent. When the man leaves the tent to urinate, one of the mosquitoes enters the tent and impales the woman through her buttcheek; her lover is then attacked. The next morning, Ray meets a [[meteorologist]] named Parks, who drives Ray and Megan to the park. Parks is searching for a [[meteorite]] that reportedly landed in the park. Parks' [[Radiation monitoring|radiation monitor]] begins detecting radioactivity, and they track the source to the boat containing the dead fishing ranger. They drive to the park to notify the police, where they find the park's rangers and visitors to have all been killed.  They find the carcass of a mosquito, and Megan determines it to be of the species ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''. A surviving Hendricks informs the others that the park's electrical and communication systems were destroyed in the attack. The group plan to drive to a city for help, and they take a nearby RV, escaping a swarm of approaching mosquitoes. After night falls, they stumble across Earl and Junior. The criminals unsuccessfully attempt to hijack the RV, and they are tied up and brought along.  A swarm of mosquitoes proceed to chase the RV. As the mosquitoes attack through the windows, Megan accidentally opens a side door and hangs precariously from it, before being saved by Ray. Earl breaks free from his restraints, uses a hatchet to save Junior from a mosquito, and threatens to kill Megan. She stabs Earl with a severed proboscis as another wave of mosquitoes assault the RV, causing it to crash. As the group crawls through a pipe to evade the swarm, Junior is impaled by a mosquito, causing his eyes to bulge and explode.   The mosquitoes follow them into the pipe, and the group sets some of their clothes on fire to deter the insects. While hiding safely in the pipe system, they conclude that the "meteorite" and the mosquitoes are connected. They return outside the next morning and split up; Ray, Earl, and Hendricks investigate a nearby farmhouse while Megan and Parks search for the "meteorite". After regrouping, they board up the farmhouse. After sunset, Parks reveals that he fought in the [[Vietnam War]], and Hendricks reveals that he did as well. The mosquitoes begin to infiltrate the farmhouse, and Earl defends himself with a chainsaw.  Ray tears off a mosquito's wings to save Hendricks, and Megan sets one of the mosquitoes on fire using a stove. In the house's basement, Parks and Hendricks discover a colossal nest of mosquito eggs. The group rigs the house to explode by breaking its gas line and opening up the windows, and Ray and Megan escape to the roof by taking turns in a [[dumbwaiter]]. Upon Hendricks' turn, the dumbwaiter breaks and falls lethally to the basement. Ray and Megan jump from the roof, and the house explodes with Earl, Parks, and the mosquitoes inside. After sunrise, Ray and Megan find Parks alive, having protected himself from the explosion by hiding in a refrigerator.

Multi-Facial
 Mike, a struggling actor with a tattooed arm, auditions for a role as an Italian man. He delivers a profanity-laced anecdote in an Italian accent, about getting into a fight with another man in a restaurant for looking at his girlfriend. The anecdote ends with Mike saying that he discovered the man was a homosexual, so he beat up his girlfriend instead, and is surprised that she doesn't call him anymore. The casting director expresses interest and has Mike speak Italian before telling him they'll get back to him. When the director asks Mike where the monologue came from, Mike says that it's a true story that happened to his friend. Outside, Mike calls his manager without an Italian accent. He complains about the monologue, which wasn't a true story, saying it was offensive and worries that it will keep him from getting the job. He wipes the fake tattoo off his arm and goes to his next audition.   At an audition for a commercial, Mike meets a black actor in the waiting room and the two of them talk about their careers. Mike tells the actor about the audition he just left, and again complains that he thought his monologue was offensive. The actor tells Mike he has just landed a role in an international commercial, but Mike says he doesn't want to do commercials because no great actors have had to do commercials. Before he can audition, the director tells Mike that his skin is "a little too light" and not to bother auditioning. He suggests Mike audition for a Spanish role in a soap opera instead.  Mike goes to another audition and reads with a Cuban accent alongside a Hispanic actress. The two of them are portraying an argument, but when the actress launches into Spanish, Mike is unable to continue. As they leave the audition, the actress guesses correctly that Mike doesn't speak Spanish. She suggests that he try out for a soap opera which is looking for Hispanic actors, but Mike says he doesn't want to do soaps because no great actors have ever done them. Mike attends another audition, where the woman reading with him tells him that she really thinks he could do well. Mike does the reading with her in a heavy urban accent, but the casting directors cut the audition short, saying they're looking for more of a "[[Wesley Snipes|Wesley]] type".  Mike moves on to another audition, where they are expecting him from a previous audition. The casting director sees on his resume that Mike can rap; Mike launches into a hip-hop routine. Afterwards, Mike sits down and does a monologue about being a young man watching his father on stage in a performance of ''[[Raisin in the Sun]]''. During his father's performance, Mike came to believe that his father wanted him to be a great black actor. After his father died, Mike realized that his father wanted him to be a great actor full stop. When the monologue is finished, the casting director is impressed with Mike's performance, but admits that they are supposed to be casting an actor with [[dreadlocks]]. Mike leaves with a promise that they will contact him if they can cast him instead.  The film cuts to Mike sitting silently and angrily at a booth in a diner. He can overhear an actress talking to another man about how frustrated she is to be typecast as a blonde bimbo. When the waitress comes, the actress orders coffee that's "not too light, not too dark". Mike chuckles to himself and mouths the words "not too light, not too dark".

He travels to Los Angeles to meet a distant relative known as ''El Californio,'' who was born in the city when it was still part of Mexico. They become fast friends and grew a corn farm together. However, after several years, ''El Californio'' nears death. Shortly before dying, ''El Californio'' says he wants the following written on his [[tombstone]]: :When I was born here, this was Mexico, and where I die, this is still Mexico.  José meets and marries the love of his life, María ([[Jennifer Lopez]]), an American [[citizen]]. After María is illegally deported to Mexico by the U.S. [[federal government]] in a [[Operation Wetback|mass roundup]], she makes it back to [[Los Angeles]] via a long and arduous trip two years later, where she returns home with their new son Chucho.

The film begins to gain momentum after the wedding, when a series of events seal Chucho's fate. One night at a dance hall, Chucho is dancing with his girlfriend, when his rival Butch Mejia ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]) starts to bother him. This results in a bloody knife fight between the two, and Chucho accidentally kills him. After this event, Chucho becomes a fugitive of the police. One night when Jimmy is playing ball with his friends, Chucho is shot dead by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] right in front of Jimmy. Other members of the family learn of Chucho's death when they hear gunshots and rush to a nearby street. As an ambulance arrives to take Chucho's lifeless body away, we hear Paco narrate how Chucho's whole life had been on borrowed time.  The third generation, which takes place another twenty years later in the 1970s, faces situations such as [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and past problems of the family.

When they find out that a Salvadoran refugee, Isabel ([[Elpidia Carrillo]]), becomes a target for murder and is being held for deportation back to El Salvador, Toni convinces Jimmy to marry her so that she is able to stay in the U.S.  Jimmy is resistant to the idea of being a married man; however, Isabel slowly makes herself at home and Jimmy has no choice but to let her stay with him. As Jimmy works on his car listening to "[[I'm Your Puppet]]", Isabel comes up to him and changes the music in the cassette-player. She tries to get him to [[dance]] with her on the street. At first he doesn't want to, but she finally succeeds in teaching him some steps. He asks her at the end of the song, "Will you teach me how to salsa?" It is here that Jimmy finally lets Isabel into his heart and where they both understand that although other people don't understand them, they know now who they really are together.  Isabel becomes pregnant, but unfortunately dies after giving birth to their son, Carlitos. Enraged, Jimmy attacks the doctor who he blames for her death, burglarizes a store, and is jailed, leaving his son to be raised by his parents.

Wei is partnered with Darkie, a gang member who formerly worked for a gang leader named Po. Wei and Darkie escape from prison to meet with Po in Hong Kong. Wei is inducted into the gang and participates in an arms deal with foreign criminals.

The recent operation attracts the attention of an off-duty Hong Kong detective Anne Fong, whose boyfriend, Inspector Cheng, was taken hostage. Fong volunteers herself as a hostage exchange and attempts to foil the operation with an attempted suicide, but Wei intervenes in disabling the vehicle and escaping the scene. Utilizing a photo of Wei that was taken before the arms deal, Fong heads to Beijing to discover his true identity.  Back in Beijing, school bullies tease Ku.

Meanwhile, Wei attempts to sneak in Fong's apartment to recover Ku, but is confronted by Fong before receiving his wife's final letter. Wei is reunited with his son at the gang penthouse but fakes Ku's death with a special choke before he is dumped inside a trash bag. Wei covertly informs Fong of Ku's whereabouts as a Plan B in case he fails to save him.  Wei attempts to rescue Ku, only to find out that Po deduced Wei's identity as a cop, since Wei was too skilled compared to the rest of his gang. Wei gets into a losing fight with Po until Fong's intervention. While Fong gives Wei medical care, Ku was recovered by Darkie before Wei's attempted search.  The next day, Po instructs his gang to plant six bombs marked by security cameras at an antique auction attended by rich people.

During the auction, Po attempts to rob the crowd, only to be interrupted by Wei and Ku.  A large melee battle pits the father and son against Po and his men. The pair score a victory against Po's men. Po takes Ku hostage by choking him. Ku uses his breathing exercise to delay the choke until Fong intervenes by shooting Po aboard a helicopter. Fong and Wei try to evacuate Ku off the boat via the helicopter, but Po arms the timer of the last bomb and pins Wei down with a chain while Fong and an unconscious Ku escape. Wei eventually gets out of the pin and knocks Po out, narrowly escaping the boat's explosion and reuniting with Fong and Ku.

Before she can kill Napoleon, the cat becomes distracted by the penguin, who shouts at her with taunts. Napoleon then knocks the cat off the cliff and into the basket, which sails away in the water.

  The story is set in [[Southern California]] in July 1993. Jack Powell is a businessman with a wife and kids who live in San Diego. He's on his way home, when he pulls over to the side of the road to check out a crime scene. The sheriff tells him a cut-up body has been found stuffed into the trunk of a Chrysler, and advises him not to stop, nor "make any new friends." A policeman slams the trunk, revealing a name has been etched across the top: "Hatchet Man".  Further down the road, Jack comes upon a hitchhiker, but keeps on going. Jack stops at a diner, and runs into the same man, who introduces himself as Adrian. Jack apologizes for not stopping earlier, and offers to buy Adrian lunch. Adrian soon nicknames their waitress, Patsy, "Jingle Bells", because of the silver bracelets she wears on one wrist. Patsy talks excitedly about a briefcase full of $1.25 million in mob money which was stolen from a [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] casino the previous day. Jack looks around nervously and slides his briefcase underneath the table. Adrian tells Jack he's very intuitive about people he meets, and can usually tell all he needs to know about someone within a couple of minutes of meeting them. For example, is the person a loser, or was he a football star, or, perhaps class president. Jack doesn't seem convinced before Adrian asks him what he's got in his briefcase. When Adrian gets up to make a move on Patsy in the kitchen, Jack ditches him and makes his escape.  As Jack drives down the highway, he listens to a radio newscaster recount the story of the stolen briefcase and discusses a string of murders in which all the victims have been dismembered. Jack is forced to turn back because a roadblock has been set up to cordon off a chemical spill. Jack checks into a motel. In the middle of the night, Jack awakes, and walks outside his room to investigate another crime scene, this one located behind the diner where he and Adrian had lunch that day. He sees a severed arm with a silver bracelets placed into a bag and Adrian hiding in the shadows. Adrian joins Jack in his motel room and shoots up in the bathroom. When it seems Adrian is unconscious, Jack tries to leave him again, but despite repeated and increasingly frantic attempts his car won't start. Adrian stumbles out of the motel and reveals he's removed the plugs from Jack's car, and tells Jack in no uncertain terms not to leave again, or "I'll tell on you, Jack. I'll call the police".  The next morning, Jack and Adrian take to the road together. At a gas station, they meet a young [[hippie]] couple named Gerald and Dahlia, who are traveling cross-country in a Dodge van. Adrian wants to hang out with the hippies, but Jack insists they keep going. They stop at a service station so Jack can have a busted water hose on his car replaced. As Jack deals with the attendant, Adrian browses a pet store called the Creepy Crawly Zoo. The owner, Harliss, shows Adrian a [[Gila Monster]], which uses its viselike bite to inject a neurotoxin into the bloodstream. Back in the car, with Jack behind the wheel, Adrian uses the Gila Monster to reassert his power over Jack by throwing the monster onto Jack's lap while he drives. Jack struggles to maintain his composure, and appears frozen by fear and anxiety. To compound matters, Adrian then slams his foot onto the accelerator and the car almost loses control at speed and eventually shudders to a grinding halt before Adrian lets the Gila monster go, and warns Jack on his previous disobedience, and tells Jack  he is "one crazy motherfucker".  Jack and Adrian spend that night at a campsite, where they once again run into Gerald and Dahlia. Adrian gets high with the young couple while Jack broods outside the van.  Adrian accuses Jack of trying to scare the hippies off. Later, Jack finds Adrian having sex with Dahlia in the back of the van while Gerald watches. Jack gets drunk and retires. Adrian shows up later and goads him. After Jack and Adrian drive away in the morning, a shot of the van shows blood smeared down the license plate and the name "Hatchet Man" etched across the back doors. The following night, Jack and Adrian stay at a secluded cabin Jack inherited. For the first time, we see the money was stolen from the Vegas casino, as Jack and Adrian use it to play poker. Adrian prepares to shoot up again, as Jack lectures him about his drug "problem". Adrian slaps Jack around, and accuses him of being an alcoholic and a hypocrite. Adrian releases Jack from his grip and returns to his drugs whilst advising Jack to do the same with his drink. Jack reacts by beating Adrian from behind with his briefcase, taping him to a chair and injecting him with a deadly mixture of alcohol and drugs. Adrian convulses and appears to expire, and Jack buries him in a shallow grave.  Sheriff Gordon and his deputy, Little David show up to check on Jack, and over their shoulders Jack can see Adrian rising from the grave. The policemen are called away on a domestic disturbance and leave without noticing Adrian. Jack attempts to gun him down. After he's unloaded his shotgun, Adrian emerges from the shadows. When Adrian pleads with Jack as to why he cuts up the bodies into tiny little pieces, Jack removes a hatchet from his briefcase, and now in a far more confident baritone than he has displayed at any point in the film announces, "For the fuck of it", and as the screen fades to black the spectator is left only with the sounds of a violent struggle and can only conclude Jack has killed Adrian once and for all.  Jack returns home to San Diego and kisses his wife, Carol. The paperboy greets him and he replies cheerfully, "Say, hey, Billy." As the film fades to black, a quote from the Book of Jeremiah appears on the screen: "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it?" This echoes an earlier statement made by Adrian, who said that human beings are essentially unknowable.  
Nelly and Mr. Arnaud

Nelly has a part-time job at a printing shop but she has fallen six months behind on the rent for the apartment in which she lives with her husband.

After determining Nelly is encumbered with debt, Arnaud spontaneously decides to give Nelly 30,000 francs as a gift. Nelly reluctantly accepts, pays off her overdue rent and moves out of the apartment.  Nelly agrees to type up Arnaud's memoirs, but Arnaud insists this will not be to repay the money he already gave her, he will pay her for this work. Nelly thus learns more about Arnaud's life: he was a judge in a French colony, and later a businessman. Nelly has an affair with Arnaud's editor. Arnaud feels a little jealous.

The Net (1995 film)
 United States Under [[Secretary of Defense]] Michael Bergstrom commits suicide after being informed that he has tested positive for [[HIV]].  Angela Bennett is a [[systems analyst]] from [[Venice, California]] who [[telecommuting|telecommute]]s to Cathedral Software in San Francisco. Her interpersonal relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother, who is institutionalized with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and often forgets who Bennett is. Bennett's co-worker Dale sends her a [[floppy disk]] with a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] labeled "[[Pi|π]]" that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called "Gatekeeper" sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg. Dale and Bennett agree to meet, but the navigation system in Dale's private aircraft malfunctions and it crashes into a tower, killing him.  Bennett travels to [[Cozumel]], on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin. After seducing Bennett, Devlin pays a [[Robber|mugger]] to steal her purse as they walk along the beach. He chases the mugger into the foliage and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting him. He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Bennett's [[dinghy]] collides with rocks, destroying the disk and hospitalizing her. She is unconscious for three days.  When Bennett wakes up, she finds that all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room, her car is no longer at the airport parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett's home is empty and listed for sale. Moreover, because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity. Bennett's [[Social Security number]] is now assigned to a "Ruth Marx", for whom Devlin has entered an arrest record by hacking the police computer system. When Bennett calls her own desk at Cathedral Software, an impostor answers and offers Bennett her old life back in exchange for the disk. She contacts the only other person who knows her by sight, psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion. He checks her into a hotel, offers to contact a friend at the [[FBI]], and arranges to have her mother moved for her safety.  Using her knowledge of the backdoor and a password found in Devlin's wallet, Bennett logs into the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]]'s computers and learns that Under Secretary of Defense Bergstrom, who had opposed Gatekeeper's use by the federal government, was misdiagnosed. Fellow hacker "Cyberbob" identifies π with the "Praetorians", a notorious group of [[cyberterrorist]]s linked to recent computer failures around the country. Bennett and Cyberbob plan to meet, but the Praetorians intercept their online chat. Bennett escapes from Devlin&mdash;a [[contract killer]] for the cyberterrorists, but the Praetorians kill Champion by tampering with pharmacy and hospital computer records. After Bennett is arrested by the [[California Highway Patrol]], a man identifying himself as Champion's FBI friend frees her from jail. She realises he is an impostor and escapes again.  Now wanted for murder, Bennett hitchhikes to Cathedral's office where, using her impostor's computer, she connects the cyberterrorists to Gregg Microsystems and uncovers their scheme; once the Praetorians sabotage an organization's computer system, Gregg sells Gatekeeper to it and gains unlimited access through the backdoor. Bennett [[email]]s evidence of the backdoor to the FBI from the [[Moscone Center]] and tricks Devlin into releasing a virus into Gregg's mainframe, undoing the erasing of her identity. During a battle on the catwalks of a convention center, in which Devlin accidentally kills the impostor (the real Ruth Marx), Bennett ambushes Devlin with a fire extinguisher, causing him to fall to his death. Bennett reunites with her mother, and the conspiracy is exposed, with Jeff Gregg being arrested by the FBI.  
Nick of Time (film)
 The film opens with Gene Watson ([[Johnny Depp]]), a mild-mannered, widowed [[accountant]] arriving with his daughter Lynn at the [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] in [[Los Angeles]]. As Watson makes a pay phone call informing an unidentified person that his train was late, two mysterious strangers in suits, known only as Mr. Smith ([[Christopher Walken]]) and Ms. Jones ([[Roma Maffia]]), survey the station from a catwalk, discussing a yet-to-be-elaborated scheme. Noticing Watson retaliate against a skater who was harassing his daughter, Smith and Jones set their sights on him and swiftly approach the pair. Showing a badge, the two strangers convince Watson that they are police officers and whisk both father and daughter into a van without justification. Once in the vehicle, Watson begins to notice things are not right and gets nervous, but Smith subsequently [[pistol whip]]s him in the leg to get his attention. Smith then informs Watson that they will kill his daughter by 1:30&nbsp;p.m. unless he murders a woman depicted in a photograph. He soon learns that the woman is State [[Governor]] Eleanor Grant and realizes that killing her would be a suicide mission.  Once at the [[Bonaventure Hotel]], where a number of campaign appearances are being held, Watson makes several attempts to warn people about his situation, but Smith consistently follows him around, taunts and viciously beats him whenever he does not make a move. Watson manages to find a young campaign assistant, Krista Brooks, who believes Watson's story and encourages him to report the matter to the governor's husband, Brendan Grant. Once in his suite, however, Brendan and a campaign lobbyist appear to disbelieve the story, and before anything more can be said, Smith shows up in the room and fatally shoots Krista, causing a tense scuffle between Watson and Smith. Watson awakens after unconsciousness and finds nearly everyone on the campaign, including the governor's staff and husband, are involved in the plot, with an unnamed [[right-wing]] [[lobbyist]] masterminding it all in revenge for the governor not carrying out her campaign promises to his interests.  Watson eventually finds disabled war veteran named Huey who polishes people's shoes at the hotel. While at first he does not believe Watson's story, Smith talks to Watson about the plot, believing Huey to be completely deaf according to a sign. Huey reluctantly assists Watson to get to Governor Grant's suite and advise her of the conspiracy. Although skeptical at first of Watson's story, she later notices Brendan act suspiciously about Krista's whereabouts and realizes Watson was telling the truth. Being hastened by her husband to make the last speech, the governor greets supporters in a ballroom when Watson takes out the gun, points it at a projector room where Smith is watching him and shoots at the window. This unleashes a panic in the ballroom, causing a stampede and brief shootout between Watson and the security people. Thinking that his wife is dead, Brendan openly gloats about the plot's success, only to find out in horror that she had heard everything, confirming her suspicions about him.  In the meantime, Huey stalls the armed Jones, who is in the van with Watson's daughter, Lynn, after she cannot get a signal from Smith. He then annoys her with a [[Squeegee man|squeegee man scheme]] to the point of a violent confrontation in which she shoots his wooden leg. Lynn quickly tries to get out of the van when Smith opens the door and begins to shoot at her. Right after she hides under the seat, Watson appears and shoots Smith. Ailing from his wounds, Smith congratulates Watson for becoming a killer just before he's finished off in a [[coup de grace]]. Before Jones can get a clear shot at the father and daughter, Huey beats her unconscious with his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] leg and [[brogues|wing tip]] shoe. The final scene shows the conspiracy mastermind stepping on Watson's broken wristwatch and leaving the hotel in a car.  An alternate TV scene (and on some [[DVD]] versions) also shows the governor thanking Watson and Huey for saving her life.

Night of the Running Man
 Jerry Logan, a cab driver in Las Vegas, picks up a nervous passenger who offers him $100 to get to the airport as quickly as possible.  Unknown to Jerry, the man has stolen $1 million from Al Chambers, a mob-connected casino owner.  Chambers himself skimmed the money from mob boss August Gurino.  Knowing that Gurino will kill him if he notices the missing money, Chambers sends assassins to recover it.  Although they kill the thief, Logan escapes with the cash.  Desperate, Chambers hires an expensive hitman, David Eckhart, who tracks Logan to his house.  Logan escapes with the money and flees the city on a train.  Before he leaves, he confides in a friendly waitress, and Eckhart intimidates her into revealing Logan's destination.  Eckhart kills the waitress and follows Logan.  In Salt Lake City, Eckhart captures but loses Logan at the airport as he boards a flight for Los Angeles.  Eckhart contacts his associate, Derek Mills, who pays off all the cab drivers at the Los Angeles airport.  With no other choices available, Logan chooses Mills' cab.  Mills kidnaps him at gunpoint and, at his house, burns Logan's feet in boiling water to make escape impossible.  However, Mills underestimates Logan, who overpowers him and flees with the money.  When Logan collapses unconscious on the street, he is taken to the hospital, where he meets nurse Chris Altman.  Altman treats his wounds and covers for him when Eckhart comes looking.  Mills, who is in the same hospital, overhears that Altman has taken Logan to a hotel for safety, and he alerts Eckhart.  Although Logan encourages Altman to leave, Eckhart bursts in before she can.  The two escape together and head for Altman's house after depositing the money in a safety deposit box.  At her house, Logan and Altman have sex.  When Logan wakes in the morning, Eckhart is waiting for him in the kitchen.  Logan proposes a deal: he will split the money with Eckhart, and, in return, Eckhart lets both him and Altman survive.  Eckhart accepts the deal and leaves for Las Vegas, where he kills Chambers and his wife on the orders of Gurino.  When Eckhart returns to Los Angeles, Logan attempts to ambush him but fails.  Frustrated by Logan's reluctance to produce the money, Eckhart orders Mills to beat Altman.  Logan reveals that he has hidden it in the basement, and Eckhart kills Mills when Mills offers to retrieve it.  Eckhart and Logan proceed to the basement.  Logan disarms Eckhart, who only becomes more excited by the heightened tension.  Although Eckhart briefly considers killing Altman to flush out Logan, he instead engages Logan in hand-to-hand combat.  Armed with a knife, Eckhart stalks Logan in the dark, taunting him as he scores hits.  Although Logan briefly surprises Eckhart, Eckhart easily overpowers him and goes for a killing blow.  Before Eckhart can finish him, Logan strikes Eckhart with a wooden plank.  Both men are surprised when a nail in the plank impales Eckhart, killing him.  Now more careful, Logan and Altman leave the country under assumed names and pay cash for their tickets.  
Neurosia: 50 Years of Perversity
 Rosa von Praunheim, a controversial German film director, introduces the premiere of his new film before a live audience. A moviegoer leaps to his feet and shoots him. Gesine Ganzman-Seipel, a disdainful TV reporter, is assigned to do a mockumentary series on the victim's debauched existence and his career as a dilettante artist. The mystery surrounding von Praunheim's death is fueled by the disappearance of the corpse.  Gesine begins to investigate upon the dirt of von Praunheim notoriously hedonistic life. She insinuates herself into von Praunheim's private life, duping his mother into providing access to his personal belongings. The mother flips through a photo album commenting: "I've survived two world wars; living with him is the third". The reporter retraces the earliest efforts of an oeuvre encompassing nearly 50 films and recalls the part Rosa von Praunheim played in the birth of the German gay movement in the 1970s. She also interviews von Praunheim's acquaintances and shows short clips from Rosas old movies. Her main aim is to provide sensational and shocking details from Rosa's life. Initially disgusted at the depravity she unearths, the reporter reads his love letters and hate mail, traces clues and anonymous tip-offs, prowls public toilets and other seedy hangouts, talking to the deceased's neighbors, ex-lovers, stars of his films and bizarre family members. Some of the eccentric menagerie refuse to talk. Others are only too willing to divulge personal information, like Evelyn Kunneke, who claims von Praunheim's homosexuality was an attention-seeking device and that he really loved her.  Gesine follows von Praunheim's tracks to New York and meets a former flame; he recalls Rosa's horrifying eating habits and his appalling practice of playing Bavarian folk tunes on his foreskin. Gesine becomes increasingly dedicated to her assignment and possibly even more sympathetic to her subject's cause. However soon after she promises viewers details of von Praunheim's affairs with prominent businessmen and high-ranking government, church and military officials. von Praunheim's diaries containing the evidence vanish and the series is axed due to dismal ratings. Gesine perseveres regardless, eventually discovering the truth. It turns out that nearly everybody had some reason to kill Rosa. Finally Gesine discovers Rosa at a boat where he is kept prisoner by some of his old enemies. She frees him, and the movie ends.  
Nixon (film)
 In 1972 the [[White House Plumbers]] break into [[The Watergate]] and are subsequently arrested.   Eighteen months later in December 1973, [[Richard Nixon]]'s Chief of Staff, [[Alexander Haig]] ([[Powers Boothe]]), brings Nixon ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) audio tapes for Nixon to listen. The two men discuss the [[Watergate scandal]] and the resulting chaos. After discussing the death of [[J. Edgar Hoover]], Nixon uses profanity when discussing [[John Dean]], [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]] and others involved in Watergate. As Haig turns to leave, Nixon asks Haig why he hasn't been given a pistol to commit suicide like an honorable soldier.  Nixon starts the taping system which triggers memories that begin a series of flashbacks within the film. The first begins on June 23, 1972 about one week after the breakin, during a meeting with [[H. R. Haldeman]] ([[James Woods]]), [[John Ehrlichman]] ([[J.T. Walsh]]) and Dean ([[David Hyde Pierce]]). Ehrlichman and Dean leave, and Nixon speaks the "[[Watergate scandal#"Smoking Gun" tape|smoking gun]]" tape to Haldeman.  The film covers most aspects of Nixon's life and political career and implies that Nixon and his wife abused [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] and [[Prescription drug|prescription medications]]. Nixon's health problems, including his bout of [[phlebitis]] and [[pneumonia]] during the Watergate crisis, are also shown, and his various medicants are sometimes attributed to these health issues. The film also hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] through references to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s vice-president spiraled out of control to culminate in [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]] and, eventually, Watergate.  The film ends with [[Watergate scandal#Resignation|Nixon's resignation]] and departure from the lawn of the White House on the helicopter, [[Marine One]]. Real life footage of [[Death and state funeral of Richard Nixon|Nixon's funeral]] in [[Yorba Linda, California]] plays out over the extended end credits, and all living ex-presidents at the time—[[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]], and then-president [[Bill Clinton]]—are shown in attendance.

Now and Then (film)
  In 1991, four childhood friends reunite in their hometown of [[Shelby, Indiana]]. Samantha Albertson, a science-fiction writer, narrates the story. As an adolescent, Samantha was considered the "weird" girl who liked performing [[seances]] and was interested in science fiction and the supernatural. Roberta Martin, a doctor, was a tough tomboy whose mother died when she was four years old. Chrissy DeWitt, who lives in her childhood home, is married and about to give birth to her first child. As a naïve youngster, she was overly sheltered by her mother. Tina "Teeny" Tercell is a successful Hollywood actress; as a child, she had always dreamed of fame. Teeny and Samantha have not visited their hometown in ten years.  The story flashes back to 1970 when the girls had two goals: saving enough money to buy a tree house and avoiding the Wormer brothers. One night, they sneak out to the cemetery to perform a seance. A cracked tombstone convinces them they have resurrected the spirit of a young boy identified only as Dear Johnny, who died in 1945 at the age of twelve. Intrigued, they search for information at the library but find nothing.  Later, while heading for the library in a nearby town, they spy the Wormer brothers skinny dipping in the lake. To retaliate for a prank the boys played on them, the girls steal the boys' clothes, tossing them onto the road while riding off. At the library, Roberta discovers an article about her mother being killed in a car accident, a fact previously unknown to her. Samantha finds a story about Dear Johnny and his mother tragically dying, but a part is missing, leaving the cause of their deaths a mystery. The girls then visit a local psychic Wiladene who determines he was murdered.  Samantha goes home and unexpectedly meets Bud Kent, a man her newly-single mother invited to dinner. Upset, she storms out and flees to Teeny's. They hang out in the tree house display at the store where Samantha confesses her parents are getting divorced. Teeny comforts her, then breaks her favorite necklace in two, giving one half to Samantha as a "best friends for life" bracelet. On their way home during a thunder storm, Samantha loses her half of the bracelet in a storm drain. When she climbs down to retrieve it, the water rises, trapping her. Crazy Pete, an old vagrant, pulls her out. Grateful, the girls now see him differently. At the same time, Roberta is playing basketball in her driveway when Scott Wormer suddenly arrives. They question why they fight all the time before sharing a kiss.    The next day, the girls consult Samantha's grandmother about Dear Johnny's death, and discover from a newspaper article that he and his mother were murdered. Roberta becomes upset and angry that two innocent people were killed and also by the realization that her mother died violently, contrary to what she was told. Samantha announces that her parents are divorcing, and the four make a pact to always be there for one another.  To put Dear Johnny's soul to rest, the girls go to the cemetery to perform another seance. Johnny's tombstone suddenly rises surrounded by bright light. A figure appears from behind, but it is only the groundskeeper who explains that the stone was damaged and is being replaced. The groundskeeper explains he was the one who cracked the tombstone. Realizing they never resurrected Dear Johnny, they agree to stop the seances. While leaving, they notice Crazy Pete, and Samantha follows him back to Dear Johnny's grave. Realizing that he is Dear Johnny's father, she comforts him, while he advises her not to dwell on things. Some time after, the tree house is finally bought, and Samantha narrates, "The tree house was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other."  The film returns to 1991, and Chrissy goes into labor and gives birth to a girl. Later, in their old tree house, it is revealed by Roberta that Crazy Pete had died the previous year. They then discuss how happy they are in life and make another pact to visit more often.

For, as Jack’s friend Cap’n Billau reveals, the coin bears a clue to the treasure’s whereabouts – one of four islands etched by the infamous pirate, Jacques Un-Oeil upon the original [[doubloon]]. At Billau’s urging, Jack tracks down the two beautiful women who unknowingly hold the remaining clues.  Streetwise Sandy Sequoia’s piece of eight came from her murdered drug dealer boyfriend in [[Miami]]. And lonely-heart Portia Pennington inherited her coin from her merchant tycoon grandfather, who died at sea in the “Hundred Years Storm” of 1893, while hunting for the lost gold.  Jack convinces the girls to go in search of the pirate treasure with him. But first, the two must learn to crew his 76' schooner; and then, all three adventurers must learn to trust one another, if they expect to navigate the treacheries of love and the unpredictable [[Caribbean]].  As Jack introduces the girls to life at sea, he starts to fall in love with Sandy. All seems to be going well, until Jack discovers Sandy with drugs on his boat – a kilo of her dead boyfriend’s [[cocaine]] (which she has steadily been using since coming aboard). He has Portia dump the coke overboard; and while Sandy wrestles to overcome her [[Substance dependence|addiction]], Jack turns his attentions to Portia.  When Sandy and Portia realize that Jack has seduced each of them in turn and convinced each to reveal to him the name of the island on her coin, they turn on him. Feeling betrayed and realizing that they no longer need Jack in order to sail the boat or find the gold, they maroon him on a small island and go after the sunken treasure themselves.  Jack is rescued by a local fisherman whose radio alerts him of [[Hurricane Andrew]]. The building gale is expected to be an infamous once-in-a-hundred-years storm. And it is headed straight toward the girls. Jack and the fisherman catch up with Sandy and Portia. But they refuse to abandon their sailboat, so Jack joins them. He soon learns why – the girls were able to recover the gold, and it is still in the inflatable dinghy tied to the stern of the [[schooner]]. The problem is, the dinghy has sunk, with the gold still in it; and it is preventing them from sailing anywhere.  Jack tells Portia and Sandy about [[Hurricane Andrew]] and insists they must choose reason over greed, if they want to outrun the storm. The only way they can hope to survive, is to cut the dinghy loose and sail out of the path of the approaching storm. They reluctantly agree to cut the priceless dinghy loose and run with the wind for their lives.  Sailing out of the path of the “Hundred Years Storm” and its deadly winds and waves, Jack and the girls manage to avoid the brunt of [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]]’s wrath.  Adrift in a dead calm after the terrible blow, the three weary shipmates are rescued by Jack’s old buddy, Cap’n Billau. But their “rescuer” turns into their enemy when he demands, at gunpoint, that Jack turn over the gold. Jack tells Billau that they abandoned the treasure in order to outrun the storm. But Billau doesn’t believe him. They struggle over a flair gun, and the treacherous Billau is killed.  Portia and Sandy move to [[South Beach]] to start a new life together, believing the gold, and Jack, to be lost from their lives forever. But Jack had secretly marked the gold’s location on a military [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], and he goes back for the treasure on his own. But with the hard-won pirate hoard finally in hand, Jack realizes that it is worthless to him without the two women he fell in love with while searching for it.  To prove his love to the women he earlier betrayed, Jack surprises them with a gift of the gold they had thought was once more lost to the sea. The three sail off into the sunset together – wealthier, a little wiser, and with a chance, perhaps, for happiness together.

 During the Vietnam War in 1968, [[Captain Sam Cahill]] ([[Danny Glover]]) has been working hard to create good relations between the United States and [[Degar|Montagnard Vietnamese]] in the village of Dak Nhe. The U.S. Army is looking to monitor enemy operations on a clandestine weapons supply route which passes near the village. Cahill is coming close to his discharge, and explains to his successor [[Captain T.C. Doyle]] ([[Ray Liotta]]) the delicate nature of Vietnamese customs as well as the counter intelligence involving covert enemy activity. In a lapse of judgment with surrounding village children, a child steals a [[Nestlé Crunch]] bar from Doyle's backpack; the wrapper, when found, lets the [[People's Army of Vietnam|NVA]] know of the local villagers' cooperation with the Americans. As punishment, Brigadier Nguyen ([[Hoang Ly]]) of the NVA, orders his subordinate, Captain Quang ([[Vo Trung Anh]]), to kill the villagers' elephant right before a spiritual festival. To aid the villagers, Cahill promises to replace the slain elephant before their upcoming ceremony while Doyle (whom the villagers blame for the elephant's death) reluctantly agrees to help.  At camp, Major Pederson ([[Marshall Bell]]), assigns Cahill and Doyle, with Doyle in command, to secure and deliver a new elephant to the villagers, as well as two soldiers, Specialist 4 Harvey Ashford ([[Doug E. Doug]]) and Specialist 5 Lawrence Farley ([[Corin Nemec]]). Cahill blackmails Chief Warrant Officer 3 Davis Poole ([[Denis Leary]]) into helping as well. They purchase an elephant known as Bo Tat from a local Vietnamese trader ([[James Hong]]). They also agree to take along Bo Tat's handler, Linh ([[Dinh Thien Le]]), who has experience with verbal commands in guiding the elephant. Along the way, NVA soldiers attempt to stop them. Following a failed air transport, the soldiers use a combination of methods to reach [[Pleiku Air Base]] before the final stage of their journey to Dak Nhe.  At Pleiku Air Base, Major Pederson notifies the captains that the mission has been cancelled. The enemy supply route has changed direction, and they no longer need the support of the local village. Against regulations, they commandeer a cargo aircraft. The aircraft comes under enemy fire, forcing them and Bo Tat to parachute out early. They land unharmed in and around the village, except for Ashford, who gets stuck in a tree and becomes separated from the rest. NVA forces suddenly appear, threatening to take the remaining soldiers hostage and kill the elephant. Ashford, however, is able to free himself and create a diversion long enough to distract and incapacitate the NVA troops. They complete their mission and, to the delight of the U.S. Army, capture high-ranking enemy officers in the process.

Outbreak (film)
   In 1967, a virus called Motaba, which causes a [[viral hemorrhagic fever|deadly fever]], is discovered in the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|African]] jungle. To keep the virus a secret, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected. Twenty-eight years later, Colonel Sam Daniels, a [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]] virologist, is sent to investigate an outbreak in [[Zaire]]. He and his crew—Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt—gather information and return to the United States. Ford, now a brigadier general and Daniels' superior officer, dismisses the latter's fears that the virus will spread.  Betsy, a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey that is host to the virus, is smuggled into the country. James "Jimbo" Scott, a worker at an [[animal testing]] laboratory, is infected when he steals Betsy to sell on the [[black market]]. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez, a pet-store owner in the [[California]] town of Cedar Creek. After releasing the monkey in the woods of [[Palisades (California Sierra)|Palisades]], he develops symptoms on a flight to [[Boston]] and infects his girlfriend, Alice. Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] scientist and Daniels' ex-wife. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected.  A hospital technician in Cedar Creek is infected when he accidentally breaks the vial of Rudy's blood. The virus mutates into a strain capable of spreading like [[influenza]], allowing a number of people to be infected in a movie theater. Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the monkey, the Army quarantines the town and imposes [[martial law]]. Schuler is infected when his suit tears, and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle.  When Ford provides an experimental serum, Daniels realizes that he was aware of the virus before the outbreak. He confronts Ford, who admits that the original Motaba strain was actually a military [[biological agent|bioweapon]]; the 1967 outbreak in Africa had in fact been a test-run of the virus, which subsequently infected the local monkey population despite Ford's and McClintock's attempt to halt its spread and cover up their actions. Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep, a plan for the military to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek. McClintock, now a major general, plans to use the operation to conceal the virus's existence.   To prevent Daniels from finding a cure, McClintock has him arrested for carrying the virus. Daniels escapes, and he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship which carried Betsy. Daniels obtains a picture of Betsy and releases it to the media; a Palisades resident, Mrs. Jeffries, realizes that her daughter Kate has been playing with Betsy in their yard and calls the CDC. Daniels and Salt arrive at the Jeffries' house, and Salt tranquilizes Betsy after Kate coaxes her out of hiding. When he learns from Daniels about Betsy's capture, Ford delays the bombing.  On their return flight, Daniels and Salt are chased by McClintock in another helicopter, and Salt fires two [[Air-to-surface missile|missiles]] into the trees to deceive him into thinking that they crashed. In Cedar Creek, Salt mixes Betsy's [[antibody|antibodies]] with Ford's serum to create an [[antiserum]]; although Schuler has died, they save Keough. McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep, refusing to listen to Ford. Daniels and Salt fly a helicopter in the path of the bomber. With Ford's help, Daniels persuades the bomber's flight crew to detonate the bomb over water and spare the town. Before McClintock can order another bombing, Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest. Daniels and Keough reconcile, and Cedar Creek's residents are cured.

Panther (film)
 The film focuses on the rise and decline of the [[Black Panther Party for Self-Defense]], known as the Black Panthers, during the [[Black Power movement]] and disenchantment with [[nonviolent resistance]] as a tool in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. It explores the [[COINTELPRO]] program of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), which was an effort to track and disrupt African-American political movements.  The drama alleges, without providing evidence, that various Mob networks cooperated directly with the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (FBI/[[CIA]]) representatives to "flood" [[inner-city]] [[ghetto]]s, which contained majority [[African-American|black]] populations, with [[hard drugs]] such as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. The ending's structure and concluding voice-over alleges that [[Organized crime|The Mob]] (possibly Italian) in the [[United States]] agreed to produce and distribute quantities of these types of drugs on an unprecedentedly large scale. Purportedly, only agreed-upon "problem areas" of Black Panthers' potential support would be targeted, so as to "pacify" those populations.  The film further suggests that the huge quantities of drugs quickly spilled out of the "problem areas" and became the drug epidemic in the United States of the 1980s and 1990s. The final lines shown in the film's closing note that in the 1970s, there were hundreds of thousands of hard-drug addicts, a number that had increased to the "3 million" of "yesterday". It is dedicated to the Black Panther Party's main figures, the communities that supported them, and those who might continue the "struggle" today.

His grandparents are wealthy and live in a vast residence that serves as the center that reunites a large family and many visitors. The house is dominated by the frequent howls of the boy's ancient great-grandmother, who is senile and is taken care by Adoración, a strict nurse, who endures the old woman's endlessly repeated recollection of the four bandoleros who killed each other for her love.  Pampered on his arrival by the women in the house, Felipe is ordered to stay in bed by the family's doctor. He is installed in the bedroom of his absent uncle Ramón and spends his time reading [[Little Women]]. Felipe quickly strikes a close friendship with Mari, the talkative and meddlesome maid. She keeps four lovers on a string, but refuses to let go of her virginity. An expert on men's matters, Mari shamelessly flirts with the boy even when she has the impression that he might be gay. In secrecy, she shows Felipe some items that she has found in uncle Ramón's bedroom: a suggesting photograph of Ramón in swimming wear revealing his anatomy and a postcard from 1936 signed by someone named Federico that depicts a dog looking at a dove with what Mari describes a lovesick face. The message in the postcard and its image imply that there was a homoerotic relationship between Ramón and Federico. Felipe points out that the picture was taken in the terrace of the bedroom and both Mari and the boy are fascinated by Ramón's revealing attire in the photograph.  Felipe also befriends Uncle Ricardo, the eccentric brother of the boy's grandfather, who trains pigeons and dreams of finding a treasure at sea with his boat. Felipe tells him of Mari's believe that lame doves are queers and then inquires his great uncle if he might be queer. Although Ricardo denies it, he does not do so when the boy ask the same question regarding uncle Ramón, evasively responding that he does not longer remembers.  Peace in the house is frequently disturbed by many visitors like Reglita, a mature spinster, and there is general commotion with the arrival of Felipe's cosmopolitan Aunt Victoria, a singer who sweeps into town with Luigi, her muscle-bound Italian "secretary" in tow.  A liberal free thinker who has travelled Europe extensively, Victoria scandalizes Felipe's conservative grandmother with her recitation of erotic and anti-Franco poetry that makes the neighbors blushed but fascinates Reglita.  With her free way of living and her expertise on men, Victoria draws the attention of Mari who asks her about her lovers and Victoria shows her a valuable ring that one of them gave her.  The uncertainty of Felipe's blossoming sexuality is subjected to further confusion with the surprising arrival of the charismatic Communist uncle Ramón, who takes back possession of his bedroom. Both Felipe and Mari are fascinated by him. Felipe asks Ramón which tastes better, a man, a lady, or a young gal? to which the worldly Uncle Ramón responds, Ladies and young gal taste great, and I once met a man who tasted like Manchego cheese. Felipe immediately identifies this man as Federico. The boy then compliments his uncle on having gorgeous eyes.  There is new commotion in the house with the elopement of Luigi with one of Mari's lovers, stealing Victoria's valuable ring, and with the death of Felipe's senile great grandmother. Mari tells Felipe that he can spy from his bedroom uncle Ramón naked at night, but instead she shows up dancing naked by his window and with Victoria's ring in her hand. The next day Felipe accuses Mari of having stealing the ring and she is fired by the grandfather after Felipe reveals where she hides the ring. Felipe goes to Mari's room before her departure to reconcile. To Felipe's sadness uncle Ramón has left as sudden as he arrived. Victoria, Felipe and Uncle Ricardo set out to sea on a treasure seeking adventure.

One night, Hubie and Marina manage to confirm how they feel for each other, but Hubie cannot quite find a perfect pebble to propose to Marina with. He wishes on a star to make his dream come true and he receives a beautiful [[emerald]] cube (whom he mistook it for a pebble) from the sky. Ecstatic, Hubie rushes to find Marina but is stopped by Drake. When Drake demands Hubie to give him the emerald, Hubie refuses and Drake throws him into the water.

The Phantom Lover
 The film is loosely based on real life "Phantom Lover" Dan Cheung, known as such due to the ghostlike (that is, not real) nature of the women he romances. The film is set in [[China]] in the 1940s. Song Dan Ping (Leslie Cheung) was an ambitious theatre actor and owner who built his dream magnificent playhouse from where he entertained and dazzled the theatre-loving populace with his adaptation of classics such as [[Romeo and Juliet]] and other tragic love stories.   His passionate and devoted performances drew the attention of To Wan-Yin (Jacqueline Wu), the beautiful daughter of a corrupt and despotic official. To Wan-Yin would sneak out of her house with her personal maid in the night to watch Dan Ping's play (he was acting as Romeo in Shakespeare's play--'Romeo and Juliet'). During the patriarchal era, romance between an actor (considered useless and without a bright future) and a rich man's daughter was definitely a taboo (it was an irony that the couple were 're-enacting' Romeo and Juliet in the movie). Hence after each performance, Dan Ping and Wan-Yin would have a rendezvous at the theatre and their love deepened to the extent that they vowed to run away from the city and to get married elsewhere.   However, Wan-Yin was betrothed to a man she did not love who was reputed to be cruel and sadistic; this persuaded her to throw caution to the wind and run away from home with Song. It also turned out that Wan-Yin's father arranged the marriage (as was the custom of [[China]] at that time) to benefit himself as he sought to become allies with another official of great influence, whose friendship would help to improve his social standing.  As fate dictated, the eloping couple was caught before the plan came to fruition and Wan-Yin's maid, who had assisted the eloping couple in their attempt to escape, was brutally beaten until she was crippled. Meanwhile, Wan-Yin was locked up in the house by her father to prevent her from eloping.   This did not end the couple's tragic fate. Wan-Yin's fiance had arranged his men to harm Dan Ping. After disfiguring Dan Ping's face with burning acid, they set the theatre ablaze with Dan Ping and many other innocent people in it. After Wan-Yin came to know about the fire and Dan Ping's disappearance, she resigned to fate and married her fiance.   On her wedding night, Wan-Yin's husband found out that she was not a virgin (he did not 'see red' on their nuptial night). Wan-Yin was then abused and eventually drove out of the house and was forced to lead a wandering life with her crippled maid. Wan-Yin soon lost all her senses as her longing for Dan Ping drove her crazy.  Many years later, a group of performing arts students traveled from [[Beijing]] to perform in the city where Song Dan Ping had performed, eager to adapt his exploits and to improvise on his legendary performances. They came to the theatre hall, with its outer foundations still intact but with the internal sections terribly destroyed, and made their temporary quarters there. Many people believed Song to have perished in the fire but he was indeed still living as the students made their home in his theatre.  Song, however, was badly scarred in the face and was never to reveal his once-handsome face to the outside world and earned the nickname 'The Phantom lover' by his once-loving audience. His personality was also changed as he was severely depressed and morose after the tragic incidents and had lived the life of a hermit ever since. When the students arrived at the theatre, he was slightly encouraged to reveal himself when one of the more talented students tried unsuccessfully to sing his ultimate love serenade whom he dedicated to Wan-Yin. Song later lashed out at the students' incompetence when he could no longer bear such disparaging performances of his efforts and decided to reveal himself and his scarred face to them.  When the officials heard that the students tried to popularise Song in their theatre performances and reenact his glorious days, they came to arrest the students. Little did they know their evil deeds were exposed to the public who came for the performances. One by one, the accomplices to the plot to burn down the theatre were forced to confess in detail, to their crimes.  Justice was finally achieved but only as a hollow victory on Song's part. In the closing moments, Song was seen holding his lover's hands. Wan-Yin had since become an invalid, and she had also become blind as a result of her ex-husband shooting her. She recognized Song, but lamented that she could not see him - a blessing for him, since she couldn't see how ugly his face had become. The two lovers finally departed the town in a coach, together at last. An epilogue reveals that Wan-Yin died a year later—probably due to the shooting injuries—and that Song never loved another woman in his lifetime.

Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]] ([[Ciarán Hinds]])—a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage eight years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary ([[Sophie Thompson]]), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta ([[Victoria Hamilton]]), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove ([[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]] and [[Judy Cornwell]]).  Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary's injured son. The following morning at breakfast, Anne and Mary are suddenly met briefly by Wentworth, the first time he and Anne have seen each other since she rejected him. Anne later hears that Wentworth thought her so altered that he "would not have known [her] again".<ref name=Dearinterview/> Louisa and Henrietta begin to pursue marriage with Wentworth, as the family is unaware of his and Anne's past relationship. Hurt and rejected by Anne's refusal years before, Wentworth appears to court Louisa, much to Anne's chagrin. Later, Wentworth learns Anne also was persuaded by Lady Russell to refuse Charles' offer of marriage, after which Charles instead proposed to Mary.   Anne, Wentworth, and the younger Musgroves go to [[Lyme Regis|Lyme]] and visit two of Wentworth's old naval friends, Captain Harville ([[Robert Glenister]]) and Captain Benwick ([[Richard McCabe]]). While there, Louisa rashly jumps off a staircase in the hopes Wentworth will catch her, sustaining a head injury. Afterwards, Anne goes to Bath to stay with her father and sister. Sir Walter and Elizabeth reveal they have repaired their relationship with a previously disreputable cousin, Mr. Elliot ([[Samuel West]]), the heir to the Elliot baronetcy and estate. Anne is introduced to him, and they realise they briefly saw each other in Lyme. Much to Lady Russell's pleasure, Mr. Elliot begins to court Anne, but she remains uncertain of his true character. Meanwhile, Louisa has recovered and become engaged to Captain Benwick. Wentworth arrives in Bath and encounters Anne on several occasions, though their conversations are brief.    Anne learns from an old friend, Mrs. Smith ([[Helen Schlesinger]]), that Mr. Elliot is bankrupt and only interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne also is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.  
Picture Bride (film)
 The film is set in 1918. Riyo (Kudoh) is a "city girl", who becomes a picture bride to a man who works as a field hand on a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] in Hawaii. The story begins with the death of Riyo's father, which leads Riyo's aunt to make arrangements for Riyo to become a picture bride. As Riyo prepares to be photographed, her aunt shows her a picture of the handsome Matsuji (Takayama), her husband-to-be in Hawaii. The photo intended as introduction and as a means of confirming that each has found the right partner when they meet for the first time on the docks. When Riyo finally arrives in Honolulu, the man who comes to greet her looks nothing like the one in the photo. Matsuji confesses that the photo he sent was old, taken when he was a young man.  Riyo goes through with the wedding (in a mass ceremony with other "picture couples") and travels out to the sugarcane plantation that is her new home. As she walks past the darkened fields to their ramshackle house, Riyo hears a faint sound on the wind of a woman singing. When she asks about it, Matsuji half-jokes that the ghosts of the canefields have come to welcome her. That night, they sleep on the same mat, but Riyo fights off his attempts at sexual intimacy and hides beneath a blanket.  The next day, after she is given an ID tag to wear around her neck, Riyo goes to work in the sugarcane fields for the first time. She is unfamiliar with farm work and slows the other workers down, leading her to be harassed and ridiculed by Antone (James Grant Benton) the ''luna'' (field supervisor). Yayoi (Kati Kuroda) prompts Kana (Tomita) to help Riyo learn. Kana is a picture bride who had arrived several years before. Later, Riyo finds out that Kana's husband, Kanzaki (Tagawa), frequently beats her and goes out gambling. To escape the abuse, at night Kana often brings her baby and sleeps in the fields, singing. One night, after an argument with Matsuji, Riyo runs off into the fields and discovers Kana.  Riyo gains Kana's trust and agrees to help her with her side business doing laundry for the workers.  Riyo begins industriously doing laundry work and saving her earnings in a tin can, determined to earn her passage back to Japan. Matsuji begins drinking and gambling, saying that he intends to win enough money to get another bride. Kana advises Matsuji to become romantic and to take [[Rudolf Valentino]] as a role model to win Riyo's heart.  Antone the luna starts to drive the workers to do more work to meet the harvest in time. The women's leader, Yayoi, leaves with her family to [[Honolulu]]. As she leaves, she asks Kana to take care of the other women caneworkers.  In the fields, Kana and the other mothers are constantly worried about their children, who must be left under a sunshade in the field when the parents are working. Kana tries to stand up against Antone to get the kids moved closer when the workers go to a new field. He threatens to use his whip on the workers, as he had done 'in the old days.'  Before harvesting, cane fields are set on fire to burn off the leaves. Antone, in a hurry to get the job done, orders the fire to be set before the women can retrieve their children. Kana's baby daughter, Kei, has wandered into the fields. Kana rushes into the burning field to find her daughter and both are lost.  The workers talk about waging a strike. Meanwhile, Riyo continues to hear the sound of a woman singing in the canefields. One night, she leaves the house to follow the sound, and Matsuji follows her. He accuses her of having a secret lover and a chase ensues. Riyo admits that her parents had died of tuberculosis, which at that time carried tremendous social stigma. Although Riyo was healthy, the matchmaker had lied to Matsuji about his bride-to-be's status. That night, when Riyo tentatively reaches out to him as they lie in bed, he brusquely turns away.  Betrayed, the next day Riyo gathers her savings and a few belongings and runs away, eventually finding herself at the ocean. Riyo falls asleep there. She is awakened by the sound of singing and glimpses a woman walking among the shoreline rocks. She runs after the vision and encounters Kana, who says she is leaving for Japan. When Riyo asks to go with her, Kana criticizes her, not unkindly, "Who waiting for you there?" Then, as Yayoi had done when she left the plantation, Kana hands her neck tag to Riyo and tells her "Take care of the girls." Kana turns to walk toward the sea, fading out of sight.  Riyo awakes and finds Kana's neck tag in her hand. She returns to the plantation and to her house, where she finds Matsuji drunk. She puts him to bed, and he looks at her, saying "I thought I was all alone again." Later that night, she hesitantly reaches out to touch his hand, and he reaches back; they embrace.  The next day, Riyo surprises the other workers when she begins singing in the fields, as had Kana and Yayoi. Antone tries to make fun of her. She continues singing more strongly, and he realizes that she has picked up the mantle of leadership. Matsuji makes a gift to Riyo of a Buddhist altar, so she can honor her parents. She is touched at his acceptance of her past.  The film ends as Riyo, Matsuji, and the other workers dance in a circle at a lively [[Obon Festival]]. In a closing voiceover (by [[Nobu McCarthy]]), an older Riyo describes how she imagines at times that she hears a woman's voice singing and realizes it is the voice of Riyo's daughter as she sings to her children.

After all is over at the tail end of Ernie's stay, a lot of pressure builds up about how they are going to get through the contest without fail, let alone avoid getting arrested by whom they assumed is the FBI. George's boss, Amanda, just in time catches him with his pants down in the situation, where he has to give her his covered up lie, even because of the situation being in front of Ernie. George has to make a lie about her to Ernie, to avoid the embarrassment. Just in time, also Vicky's boyfriend, Bob, and Eve show up to intensify the situation, ending with them falling for each other. Just as Ernie dubs them the winners of the contest, the whole clan comes clean, blowing the whole cover to Ernie, who gets upset thinking he has to start all over again, because of how he now knows that they are not a real family. But just as it distresses him, he sees George and Vicky kissing, which convinces him that they finally have made up and are willing to make it work. That leads to a wedding of George and Vicky truly being married in the next and final shot, with Ernie and Marco there.  
Pharaoh's Army
 The story is narrated by an unnamed boy, now an old man, 'as best as he can remember'.  In the spring of 1862, in the Cumberland Mountains 'down near the Tennessee line', war sympathies were strongly divided, neighbors against neighbors.  After the unexplained death of Sarah Anders' (Clarkson) daughter at the hand of Yankees, the body is dug up from the grave and unceremoniously left exposed by Yankees, to add insult to Sarah's loss, as her husband is away fighting for the Confederacy.  Sarah also has a young teen-aged son, the boy. Sarah takes her daughter's body (in coffin) back to her homestead to rebury.  Captain John Hull Abston (Cooper), a Union army officer and a widower Ohio farmer before the war, commands a party of four soldiers scavenging for supplies. All are untested in battle. They arrive at Sarah's small cabin and take what little they can find.  In the process, the youngest soldier is seriously accidentally wounded, and the party has to stay there until the soldier is well enough to travel.  Sarah and the boy suffer the company of the raiding party for several days, but are not seriously harassed by them. In fact, the Captain takes pity on Sarah, and as they wait around, he even assists her in plowing a small patch of land to plant a corn crop, as 'he likes to work with mules'.  The boy sneaks away one night to advise nearby neighbor Preacher (Kristofferson), a minister and Confederate sympathizer, of their situation. The next day, one of the soldiers, disgusted by the situation, rides off to desert, and the captain starts to shoot him. Just then, sniper fire rings out, killing the deserter, and all take refuge in the cabin. Sarah and the boy think it's her husband doing the shooting. The captain eventually kills the sniper, and all discover it is not Sarah's husband. Later, Preacher comes to retrieve the sniper's body, as it is his son.  The captain buries the dead soldier next to Sarah's daughter's grave, which enrages Sarah and she becomes insanely distressed. The raiding party leaves, taking Sarah's wagon, mule and cow, but the captain leaves Sarah a rifle 'for the boy to shoot squirrels'. She attempts to shoot the captain as he rides away, but the rifle is empty. When they are out of sight, Sarah digs up the soldier, as the boy, after fetching a revolver he had earlier stolen from the party, runs after the raiders. The boy catches up to the party and shoots the wounded soldier, lying in the wagon, dead, and then flees; the captain pursues him, firing after him.  The captain returns to the cabin with the body in the wagon, and the mule, looking for the boy. The captain chastises the boy for killing the young soldier, and Sarah and the captain argue. The captain, frustrated, threatens to kill them, and Sarah, frustrated, says "Go ahead. Kill us." The upset captain fires two rounds into the air, asks that the dead soldier be provided a decent Christian burial, then returns to the other two of his party. They ask "What'd you do to 'em?", and he replies, "You heard the shots."  They continue on their way.   Because 'the Civil War was not about 'being decent,' Sarah and the boy throw the first soldier killed into the creek, to wash downstream. They dump the body of the other soldier into a sinkhole near a fallen sycamore, and throw some dirt on it. Sarah's husband never did return.  
The Piano Lesson (film)
 Boy Willie ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) and his friend Lymon ([[Courtney B. Vance]]) travel from [[Mississippi]] to [[Pittsburgh]], where he wishes his sister Berniece ([[Alfre Woodard]]) to give him the family's heirloom piano so that he can sell it to buy land from Mr. Sutter ([[Tim Hartman]]), a descendent of the family that once owned Willie's own ancestors as slaves.  The piano itself had at one time belonged to the wife of the original Sutter, the white former owner of their family... and decades earlier, Berniece and Boy Willie's grandfather had, at the slave master's instructions, carved the black family's African tribal history and American slave history into the piano's surface.    When Boy Willie arrives, his Uncle Doaker ([[Carl Gordon (actor)|Carl Gordon]]) tells Willie that Berniece won't part with the piano.  Berniece's boyfriend Avery ([[Tommy Hollis]]) and her Uncle Wining Boy ([[Lou Myers]]) also attempt for reasons of their own to get Berniece to sell.

On board are Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and the voyage's leader [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]], who seeks gold to bring him wealth and status. Along the way, the ''Susan Constant'' is caught in a [[Nor'easter|North Atlantic storm]], and Smith saves a young, inexperienced crewmate named Thomas from drowning. As they approach the New World, the settlers, including Smith, talk of adventure, finding gold, fighting '[[Indian nation|Injuns]]', and perhaps settling in the new land.  In the [[Powhatan]] tribe in [[Tsenacommacah]], North America, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]], fears being possibly wed to Kocoum, a brave warrior whom she sees as too serious for her own free-spirited personality. Powhatan gives Pocahontas her mother's necklace as a present. Pocahontas, along with her friends, the [[raccoon]] Meeko and [[hummingbird]] Flit, visit Grandmother Willow, a spiritual talking [[willow tree]], and speaks of a dream involving a spinning arrow, and her confusion regarding what her path in life should be. Grandmother Willow then alerts Pocahontas to the arriving English.  Ratcliffe has [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] built in a wooded clearing and immediately has the crewmen dig for gold. Smith departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other's worlds and end up falling in love, despite Powhatan's orders to keep away from the English after Kocoum and other warriors engage them in a fight. Meanwhile, Meeko meets Percy, Ratcliffe's pet [[pug]], and becomes the bane of his existence. Pocahontas introduces Smith to Grandmother Willow and avoids two other crewmen, but Pocahontas's best friend Nakoma discovers her relationship with Smith and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of Smith's encounters and angrily warns Smith against sparing any natives he comes across on pain of death.  Later, Smith and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. Smith and Pocahontas share a kiss, while Kocoum and Thomas, sent by Ratcliffe to spy on Smith, witness from afar. Enraged, Kocoum, screaming a [[battle cry]], attacks and attempts to kill Smith, but Thomas intervenes with his [[musket]] and kills Kocoum, who destroys Pocahontas' necklace in the process. Smith orders Thomas to leave just before the tribesmen come and capture Smith while Kocoum's body is taken away. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan declares war on the English, beginning with Smith's execution at sunrise. Pocahontas tries to convince him otherwise, but Powhatan refuses to listen, as he is furious with her for not listening to his orders to remain in the village.  Thomas reaches Jamestown safely at night and warns the crewmen of Smith's capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their non-existent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow, where Meeko hands her Smith's compass. Pocahontas realizes Smith's compass was the spinning arrow from her real life encounter, which leads to her destiny. Just then morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe forcibly bring Smith to a cliff overlooking a clearing for execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to the cliff to fight Powhatan's warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to kill Smith, Pocahontas stops him and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups. Everyone accepts gracefully, except Ratcliffe, who tries to shoot Powhatan dead in anger, but inadvertently shoots Smith instead when he shields Powhatan. Ratcliffe is then arrested by his crewmen, who turn on him for hurting their comrade. In the end, Smith is forced to return home to receive medical treatment, while Ratcliffe is also sent back to England to face punishment for his crimes. Smith asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe. Meeko and Percy, now friends, give Pocahontas her mother's necklace completely fixed. Smith leaves without Pocahontas but with Powhatan's blessing to return in the future.

Powder (film)
 Jeremy "Powder" Reed is a young [[Albinism|albino]] man who has incredible intellect and is able to sense the thoughts of the people around him. Jeremy's brain possesses a powerful [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] charge, which causes electrical objects to function abnormally when he is around them, particularly when he becomes emotional. The electromagnetic charge also prevents hair from growing on his body.  Jeremy's mother was struck by lightning while pregnant with him; she died shortly after the strike, but Jeremy survived. His father disowned him shortly after his premature birth, and he was raised by his grandparents. Jeremy lived in the basement and worked on their farm, never leaving their property and learning everything he knew from books. He is taken from his home when his grandfather is found dead of natural causes. Jessie Caldwell ([[Mary Steenburgen]]), a child services psychologist, takes him to a [[boys' home]] because he is now effectively a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the state.  Jessie enrolls him in high school, where Jeremy meets [[physics]] teacher Donald Ripley ([[Jeff Goldblum]]). Donald finds out that Jeremy has [[supernatural]] powers as well as the highest [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] in history. While his abilities mark him as special, they also make him an [[Social stigma|outcast]].  On a hunting trip with his schoolmates, Jeremy is threatened with a gun by John Box ([[Bradford Tatum]]), an aggressive student who views him as a freak. Before John can fire, a gun goes off in the distance, and everyone rushes to see that Harley Duncan, a Sheriff's deputy, has shot a doe. Anguished by the animal's death, Jeremy touches the deer and Harley, inducing in Harley what the students assume is a seizure. Harley admits that Jeremy had actually caused him to feel the pain and fear of the dying deer. Because of the experience, Harley removes all of his guns from his house, although Sheriff Doug Barnum allows him to remain as a sheriff's deputy without a sidearm.  Doug enlists Jeremy to help speak to his dying wife through [[telepathy]]. Through Jeremy, the sheriff learns that his wife clings onto life because she didn't want to leave without her wedding ring on her finger and without him reconciling with his estranged son, Steven. She tells him that Steven found the ring and that it has been sitting in a silver box on her nightstand the entire time. Doug then places the ring on his wife's finger and reconciles with Steven, letting his wife die peacefully.  Jeremy meets Lindsey Kelloway ([[Missy Crider]]), a romantic interest, but their relationship is broken by Lindsey's father. Before the interruption, he tells Lindsey that he can see the truth about people: that they are scared and feel disconnected from the rest of the world but in truth are all connected to everything that exists.  Jeremy goes back to the juvenile facility and packs away his belongings, planning to run away to his farm. He pauses in the gym to stare at a male student washing, noticing the latter's luxurious head of hair as well as body hair which he himself lacks, and is caught at it by John Box, who accuses him of homosexuality. John steals Jeremy's hat and taunts him, but Jeremy reveals that John's words mimic what his stepfather said before beating him when he was 12, infuriating him. John and the other boys humiliate Jeremy, stripping him naked and taunting him. His powers begin to manifest by pulling at their metal buttons and any piercings. Eventually, a large spherical electromagnetic pulse erupts throwing Jeremy into a mud puddle and everyone else to the ground. John is found still, with his heart stopped. Jeremy uses an electric shock to revive him.  Jeremy returns to the farm where he grew up, now in [[probate]] with the bank, and finds that all of his possessions have been removed. He is joined by Jessie, Donald, and Doug, who persuade Jeremy to come with them to find a place where he will not be feared and misunderstood. Instead, he runs into a field where a lightning bolt strikes him, and he disappears in a blinding flash of light, possibly transcending earthly limitations and becoming pure energy (as Donald alluded to in an earlier conversation). The electrical jolt hits Jessie, Donald, Doug, and Harley.

The audience is told that Murph (Eric Edwards), one of his classmates, told on him, and the principal called his dad, Ben ([[William Katt]]), prompting him to take him to get help. They meet Sarah Gray (Carolyn Lowery), a [[Therapy|therapist]] who tests him, and decides that he needs some activities to do, such as boy scouts, sports and ballroom dancing. He takes this harshly, and does not approve of these options.  He is taken to a dance school, run by Lila Duvane ([[Ellen Albertini Dow]]), a tyrannical [[débutante]], and hates it at first; then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Ogletree), a pretty little girl recently moved to town, but Murph — who had asked him to dance with his sister, Bertha (Edwards) — informs him that three boys, the Prairie Dogs' Scout Duke Philim ([[Brock Pierce]]), the bad boy and roller hockey team's captain Blade ([[Jake Richardson (actor)|Jake Richardson]]), and the [[flamboyancy|flamboyant]] actor Corky McCullum ([[Blake McIver Ewing]]), have already taken her. Junior tries to proclaim his love to her, but fails miserably. At school, he is given a new teacher, the tyrannical Mr. Burtis (Bruce Ed Morrow), who he traps in the same way he did to Miss Hicks at the beginning. He bites an apple and feels pain. He and Ben go to a dentist's office where it is discovered by the infamous Igor Peabody ([[Gilbert Gottfried]]) that he needs braces. Ben asks his father, Big Ben ([[Jack Warden]]), for a $5,000 loan, which leads to disappointing results.  After meeting the trio and Tiffany, he decides to start with scouting under Scoutmaster Eugene Phlim ([[Sherman Howard]]) who is Duke's father. Afterwards he decides to enter hockey which Blade is in. He gets beaten by Blade's team (a scene shows his gear flying up into the air after a critical hit, an obvious parody of [[Problem Child (film)|the first film]]). After his rough encounters, he decides to "get even" and take part in a "Peter Pan" play, where he is stuck playing a weed. Ben meets Sarah at Big Ben's, and it is discovered that she was with Scoutmaster Phlim, and subsequently broken up with him.  When Junior comes back to get his braces tightened, he gets his revenge for his humiliation he received from them by releasing [[Nitrous oxide|laughing gas]] that knocks Dr. Peabody and Nurse Kiki unconscious. They later wake up wearing braces, with her tied to the patient chair and him hanging from the ceiling fan by his.  During the hockey tournament, Junior beats everyone of the opposing team players, and strikes Blade with a puck (quickly after sticking superglue on his mask). After this, he is banned for life, and then, in the Peter Pan play, he traps Corky by distracting the janitor ([[Rance Howard]]), and pulling the rope attached to the suspension harness and crashing it down, severely injuring Corky and Lila Duvane.  After these two schemes, Junior and Ben are challenged by Duke and Scoutmaster Philm to a relay race which consists of a sack race, a tire run, a monkey bar cross, a rope climb, and a canoe race. Junior sabotages every obstacle on their side, and they win.  Duke, Blade, and Corky are all seriously injured and now scared of Junior who finally tries to spend some time with Tiffany. However, she turns out to be a rich, spoiled brat. He pranks her by tying the sash ribbon on her dress to a statue, and as she walks forward, it rips off.  In her underwear, embarrassed and laughed at, she runs out crying, and Murph's sister, Bertha, blames Junior and chases after Tiffany.  Afterward, he meets a nicer girl; dressed as a witch who is also wearing braces.  Like the beginning, he depicts everyone in a coloring book, and signs off by saying "So long, suckers!" as the words "The End" pop up in the book.  
The Prophecy
 Thomas Dagget, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Usiel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased [[Korean War]] veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary.  Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, [[Arizona]], Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body.  The medical examiner informs Thomas that Usiel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, [[hermaphroditism]], and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the [[Book of Revelation]] that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a "dark soul" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.  Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of [[limbo]]. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Usiel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Usiel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine.  After finding Usiel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it. Should the rebellious angels win, Heaven will become like Hell with Earth in its thrall. Simon refuses to reveal its location, and Gabriel kills him, ripping out his heart.  Mary shows signs of possession by the evil soul; she suddenly recounts an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. During the battle of the Chosin Reservoir, Hawthorne's regiment had massacred a huge number of Chinese soldiers and had ritually sacrificed many others, staking their bodies out. They had also engaged in cannibalism. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel.  He is beginning to understand the nature of the jealous angels who hate humans because God loves them most.  At school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas there. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. Inside, they find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. They rush back to Mary's home, only to find Gabriel and Jerry there. Thomas kills Jerry, who thanks him for the release.  Katherine stops Gabriel temporarily when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. The three protagonists flee to a Native American site where Mary can be exorcised.  In a hospital [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] ward, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachael, just as she dies of a terminal illness.  He needs her because he doesn't know how to drive.  That night, Lucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that "other angels" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows of Gabriel's plot to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels. He also knows that if Gabriel wins the war under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another [[Hell]], which Lucifer considers "one Hell too many". The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual. Thomas kills Rachel, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel.  Lucifer appears first encouraging the tribe to complete the exorcism.  Then he confronts Gabriel telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Gabriel taunts Lucifer about his past when he fell from grace; Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul, a rancid cloud of evil.  The "enemy ghost" starts to attack the people but a bright light from Heaven immediately destroys it.  With the threat to his evil kingdom eliminated, Lucifer tells Thomas and Katherine to "come home" with him.  They staunchly refuse. "I have my soul...and my faith," declares Thomas.  Lucifer drags Gabriel to Hell.  As morning comes, Thomas comments on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.  
The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)
 In 1881 an unnamed gunslinger known only as The Lady arrives at the Old West town of Redemption, where she enters a [[bracket (tournament)|single elimination]] gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. She encounters the Blind Shoeshine Boy and the repulsive escaped convict named Scars, whose proposition she harshly rebuffs. That night in the saloon it is made clear that all contestants are free to indulge in whatever they want in town and the rules of the competition are explained: if a contestant is challenged they cannot refuse, each contestant must fight once a day, and the fight ends when a contestant yields or is dead. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting through the rope Herod's men had used to hang him. She drunkenly spends the night with "The Kid", a brash young man who runs a gun store and hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest.  In the first round of duels, The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the Kid's store. Herod buys Cort a cheap rusty gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town.  Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort draws his gun and wins his first round fight.   During a rainstorm, Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything. During a rainstorm that evening The Lady faces off with Eugene Dred after he rapes the saloon owner's young daughter. She shoots him in the genitals but spares his life and returns to the bar, but Dred ambushes her and she is ultimately forced to kill him.    The next day, Cort is slated to fight Spotted Horse, a Native American who claims he "cannot be killed by a bullet". The Lady, still upset over killing Dred the night before, saddles up and rides out of town before Cort's fight. Cort narrowly beats Spotted Horse after having to beg for a second bullet. The Lady is found at a nearby cemetery by Doc Wallace, who tells her that he recognizes her and knows why she is there. During flashbacks, it is revealed that the Lady's real name is Ellen, and father used to be the Marshal in Redemption until Herod invaded, killed all the deputies and had him strung up. Herod gave Ellen a pistol and three shots to try and break the rope her father was hanging from, but she accidentally killed him. Doc Wallace tells her that Herod's men dug up her father's body and burned it. He hands Ellen her father's old badge and begs her to come back and help rid the town of Herod, as she and Cort are now Redemption's only hope.   Ellen rides back to town and directly challenges Herod but is sickened to hear that he has already accepted a fight against The Kid. Ellen and Cort are the only other fighters left and are ordered by Herod to face off. They both proclaim they won't fight each other, but Herod tells them he will have them gunned down by his men if they refuse. Herod takes The Kid aside and asks him to withdraw from the contest, telling him his time will come. The Kid refuses and they fight, with The Kid wounding Herod in the neck while Herod delivers a fatal bullet to The Kid who dies in Ellen's arms. Ellen and Cort then face each other, but both refuse to draw their weapons. Herod begins a countdown from ten, declaring that if neither draws by the time he gets to zero he will have them both killed. Cort begs Ellen to kill him but she still refuses. When Herod reaches one Cort draws and fires. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead, and Cort angrily storms up to Herod and demands they fight immediately. Herod refuses, telling Cort they will meet at dawn. Later that night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, chains Cort to a table and beats him severely before smashing Cort's gunfighting hand and breaking it.  The next morning, Herod sees Cort's busted hand and gives Ratsy twenty seconds to leave town. He offers to face Cort left-handed, which Herod is equally fast at drawing with. Herod kills Ratsy with a rifle and then squares off to fight Cort. Herod then secretly tells his guards to kill Cort if he is the winner. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death with the help of Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed around town. Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she is when she throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots him in the eye, finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before saddling up and riding out of the town.

Red Cherry
 The film begins in the early summer of 1941, at the [[Ivanov International School]] in Moscow.  Luo Xiaoman and Chuchu were two new students who had come to Russia after the brutal [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] in China killed their parents (as Chuchu described in front of her class how her father, a communist revolutionary, being executed in front of her by the Kuomintang).  Chuchu and Luo quickly learned to fit in with the other international students and they also learned to speak Russian fluently.  When summer came, several students, including Chuchu, left for the summer camp in Belarus accompanied by their teacher, Miss Vera.  Xiaoman remained behind in Moscow.  During this time the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union.  Moscow was left unoccupied after the invasion, and Xiaoman was soon left to survive on his own in a land that he knew little of.  For a time he was a homeless child begging and stealing on the streets, forced to sell blood so he could get money for food (only to be robbed by others later).  He eventually found a job delivering condolence letters to families of fallen soldiers.  At one apartment, he found an orphaned girl (whose mother died silently due to starvation and illness) and took her in as though she was his own daughter.     Things were very different for the students at the summer camp.  Captured by the invading Germans, Chuchu and her classmates were kept as slaves, and were alone and in great danger.  Miss Vera was soon ruthlessly murdered in front of the students for defying the Germans by teaching her class.  One of the students, Carl, who was half-German himself and liked Chuchu deeply, managed to help the other students escape by using his Aryan descent to trick a German soldier's trust, but he was soon injured, cornered and machinegunned to death in a forest pit.  The others were quickly recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging.  One girl was executed with a brutal shot to the head, but Chuchu and several other students were spared when a high-ranking German officer, [[General Von Dietrich]] arrived and sent them to work as servants at Nazi headquarters in the Yakovliv Monastery.  General Von Dietrich was not only a military general, but also a doctor who took tattooing as a hobby — he enjoyed tattooing the bodies of young girls and showing them to his guests at parties.  He decided to use Chuchu for his greatest "masterpiece".  This was what saved her life because when the General learned that the Third Reich was doomed, instead of having Chuchu executed with the rest of the prisoners, he had her dumped in a field so that his "masterpiece" would live on.  The large tattoo (a Nazi eagle) on her back become a shame to her for the rest of her life.  Luo Xiaoman tried to enlist in the expeditionary Soviet Red Army, but was rejected due to his young age.  Out of his deep, vengeful hatred towards the Nazi invaders, he decided to "punish" the German POWs (who were now forced to work in labour camps) by sniping them with a home-made slingshot.  When the German POWs rioted, Xiaoman lured them into an empty, ruined apartment building and set the oil tanks on fire.  He himself was killed in the explosion together with the German rioters.  At the end of the movie Chuchu was reunited with the orphan girl Luo Xiaoman adopted, and after hearing the same speech Xiaoman gave for his Russian class, Chuchu understood, embraced the young girl and broke down.  At the end of the movie Chuchu was seen taking a shower, and the tattoo on her back could be seen along with the scar caused by her attempt to burn off the tattoo with a firewood. Later credits appear telling that a skin graft operation to remove the tattoo was not successful, and about the real Chuchu and what she did with her life.  The movie then ends.

Merivel finds himself enjoying a life of debauched pleasure and popularity at [[noble court|court]], until the King informs him that he has arranged for Merivel to wed Celia, the King's favorite [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The purpose of the [[arranged marriage]] is to fool another of the King's mistresses. Merivel is given an estate named Bidnold in [[Suffolk]], and Celia is installed in a house in [[Kew]] where the king can visit her secretly. Merivel lives a life of debauchery there, but also finds pleasure in [[Building restoration|restoring]] the house to its former beauty with the support of Will Gates, the man who runs the estate. However, things become complicated when Merivel breaks the King's cardinal rule by falling in love with Celia. Elias Finn, a painter commissioned by the King to paint a portrait of Celia, tricks Merivel into revealing his romantic feelings for Celia, who does not return Merivel's affections. After finding out about Merivel's romantic feelings toward Celia, the King [[Exile|banishes]] him from court back to his life as a physician.  Merivel rejoins his old friend, John Pearce, who has opened a [[Quaker]] [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]]. There, Merivel meets Katherine, a troubled young woman whose husband walked out on her after their daughter drowned in the river. Merivel and Katherine become lovers. Pearce falls fatally ill with [[tuberculosis|consumption]], and while Merivel is tending to his dying friend, they discover that Katherine is pregnant with Merivel's child. After the death of Pearce, Merivel and Katherine leave.  The pair returns to London just as the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] has hit. Katherine gives birth to a daughter, Margaret, via [[Caesarean section]], but dies in the process as there is no way to ward off [[infection]] once the body has been cut open. In her dying moments, Merivel promises Katherine that he will care for Margaret, and that he loves Katherine.  As the plague continues to kill the people of London, Merivel feels compelled to do what he can as a physician. He leaves Margaret with a wet nurse who promises to care for her in his absence, and goes out into the city, separating the sick from the well, who have all been [[quarantine]]d together, and does what he can to ease the suffering of the dying. When someone asks for Merivel's name, he says he is John Pearce, as a tribute to his friend. Under this misnomer and in disguise, Merivel is once again summoned to the palace. The King fears that Celia has contracted the plague. Merivel soon assures him that she does not have the plague, but rather has a treatable fever and is with child. With this, Merivel realizes the life he has now is more rewarding and fulfilling than the life and loves at the court he left behind.  Suddenly, the court is notified that the [[Great Fire of London|city is ablaze]], and Merivel races back to the city to retrieve his infant daughter from the flames. He is unable to find her, and falling through burning wood, Merivel lands in a small [[Watercraft rowing|row boat]], unconscious, and is floated by the river current away from the city. When he awakens, he is being cared for by Will Gates back at Bidnold. As Merivel recovers from his fall, he cannot recover from his failure to protect his young daughter from harm, when suddenly the King arrives at the house with his entourage. He informs Merivel that he has discovered the doctor's true identity, and that he was impressed with the man Merivel had become. With that, the King steps aside to reveal a nurse holding Margaret safely in her arms. For his courage and good work done in treating the victims of the plague, the King once again gives Bidnold to Merivel, stating that this time it will never be taken away. The film ends with Merivel returning to London, to set up a new hospital with help from the King.

Richard's elder brother [[Edward IV of England|Edward York]] becomes King, while the Lancastrian heir, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Richmond]], flees to France.   Richard is determined to take the crown, and pits King Edward against his brother, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Clarence]], who is imprisoned under a sentence of death. Meanwhile, Richard deceives and marries Prince Edward's widow [[Anne Neville|Lady Anne Neville]].   [[Elizabeth Woodville|Queen Elizabeth]] intercedes on Clarence's behalf and persuades Edward to spare his life. However, Richard destroys the [[Royal prerogative of mercy|royal pardon]] and commissions [[James Tyrrell]] to execute Clarence, ostensibly in compliance with Clarence's death sentence.  Richard informs Edward of Clarence's death at a meeting with Prime Minister [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William Hastings]], and the King dies from a stroke. As Edward's sons are underage, Richard becomes Regent, taking the title of [[Lord Protector]] with the support of the ambitious and corrupt [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Henry Buckingham]].    In order to undermine his rivals for the throne, Richard has Rivers, the Queen's brother, assassinated and uses the sordid circumstances of his death to damage the Queen's reputation and cast doubt on her sons' legitimacy. Hastings' reluctance to support Richard's claim to the crown so enrages Richard that he manufactures false charges of treason against Hastings, who is sentenced to death by hanging. Having made an example of his only vocal opponent, Richard persuades the [[Lord Mayor of London]] and members of the [[House of Lords]] to acknowledge his claim to the throne and crown him King.  Following his coronation Richard, now King Richard III, seeks to make his throne secure. He employs Tyrrell to murder the princes after failing to convince Buckingham to do so. Aware that Richmond intends to marry [[Elizabeth of York|Elizabeth]], he instructs Sir William Catesby to spread rumours that Lady Anne is ill and likely to die, intending to marry Elizabeth himself. Lady Anne is found dead sometime later from an apparent drug overdose.  Impatient for the promised reward for his loyalty, Buckingham demands the [[Marquess of Hertford|Earldom of Hereford]]. Richard dismisses this in a high-handed manner, with the line "I am not in the giving vein". Buckingham, also disturbed by the murders of the princes and Hastings, flees to meet Richmond, but is later captured and killed by Tyrrell under Richard's orders.  Meanwhile, Richmond gathers supporters, among them the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and Richard's mother, the [[Cecily Neville, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]]. They are joined by [[Air marshal]] Thomas Stanley. Richmond marries Elizabeth and unites both Houses and political factions against Richard.  With the army's loyalty slipping and the legitimacy of his claims to the crown weakened, Richard prepares for the final battle against the Lancastrians, who plan a seaborne invasion and an advance on London. Richard's remaining loyal troops, assembling in a marshalling yard, are attacked from the air, revealing Stanley's defection to the Lancastrian cause.<ref></ref>  The two armies meet soon after at a ruined [[Battersea Power Station|military base]]. Richard and Richmond seek each other out, but when his vehicle stalls Richard flees into the structure. Pursued by Richmond, Richard is forced to exit onto exposed metal beams high above the burning battlefield. Cornered by Richmond and refusing to surrender, Richard falls into the inferno with a maniacal grin.

Providing the Lowland gentry with protection against [[cattle rustling]], he barely manages to feed his people. Hoping to alleviate their poverty, MacGregor borrows £1,000 from [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|James Graham, Marquess of Montrose]] in order to trade cattle.  London aristocrat Archibald Cunningham has been sent to stay with Montrose, who it is implied is related to him. Cunningham learns about MacGregor's loan from Montrose's [[Factor (Scotland)|factor]] Killearn, and murders MacGregor's retainer, Alan MacDonald, to steal the money. MacGregor requests time from Montrose to find MacDonald and the money. Montrose offers to waive the debt if MacGregor will testify falsely that Montrose's rival [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll]] is a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]. MacGregor refuses and Montrose vows to imprison him in the [[tolbooth]] until the debt is repaid. MacGregor flees, briefly taking Cunningham hostage. Montrose seizes MacGregor's land to cover the debt, declaring him an outlaw and orders Cunningham to bring him in "broken, but not dead". With MacGregor in hiding, [[redcoat (British army)|redcoats]] slaughter MacGregor's cattle, burn his croft, and Cunningham rapes his wife Mary.  Mary understands that Cunningham's intent is to flush her husband out of hiding and makes his brother Alasdair, who arrives too late to save her, swear to conceal knowledge of the rape from him. Unaware of the assault on his wife, but the damage to his property being evident, MacGregor refuses to permit his outraged clan to wage war on Montrose. Instead, he decrees, "The tenderest part of the Marquess is his purse. We'll hurt him there. Thieve his cattle, steal his rents." Betty, a maidservant at Montrose's estate, has become pregnant with Cunningham's child. When Killearn tells Montrose, Betty is dismissed from service and rejected by Cunningham. Betty seeks refuge with the MacGregors, revealing that she had overheard Killearn and Cunningham plot to steal the money. To build a case against Cunningham, MacGregor abducts Killearn and imprisons him. Mary promises Killearn that he will be spared if he testifies against Cunningham, but Killearn taunts her with her rape. Realizing that Mary is pregnant, he threatens to tell MacGregor that Cunningham may be the father if she does not release him. Enraged, Mary draws a [[sgian dubh]] and stabs Killearn in the neck. Alasdair finishes him off and then drowns him in the [[loch]].  Montrose tells Cunningham that he suspects who really stole the money but that he doesn't care. Complaining that the ongoing thefts of his cattle and rents will impoverish him and mystified by the disappearance of Killearn, he orders Cunningham to pursue MacGregor to prevent further humiliation. Cunningham and the redcoats burn the Clan's crofts. MacGregor refuses to take the bait, but Alasdair attempts to snipe Cunningham and hits a redcoat, revealing their hiding place. The redcoats shoot both Alasdair and another Clan member, Coll. Alasdair finally tells MacGregor about Mary's rape. Taken prisoner, MacGregor accuses Cunningham of murder, robbery and rape. Cunningham confirms the charges. The following morning, Montrose, despite hearing MacGregor confirm his suspicions as to who stole his money, orders MacGregor to be hanged from a nearby bridge. MacGregor loops the rope binding his hands around Cunningham's throat and then jumps off the bridge. To save Cunningham, Montrose orders the rope cut, freeing MacGregor. MacGregor is chased downstream by the redcoats, but he evades them by hiding inside the rotting corpse of a cow. Cunningham survives his strangulation.  Mary gains an audience with the Duke of Argyll and exposes Montrose's plan to frame him. Moved by MacGregor's integrity, he grants the family asylum at [[Glen Shira]]. MacGregor arrives, at first upset by Mary's unwillingness to inform him of her rape or her pregnancy. The Duke, though skeptical of MacGregor's likelihood of survival, arranges a duel between MacGregor and Cunningham, wagering Montrose that if MacGregor lives, his debt will be forgiven and that if he dies, the Duke will pay his debt. Montrose agrees and Cunningham and MacGregor vow that [[no quarter]] will be asked or given. Armed with a [[rapier]], Cunningham skillfully attacks and repeatedly wounds MacGregor, who appears to swiftly exhaust himself swinging a heavy [[Basket-hilted sword|broadsword]]. Montrose signals Cunningham to finish him, but MacGregor grabs his enemy's sword-point with his left hand. As Cunningham struggles to free his blade, MacGregor delivers a fatal strike.

Asami, meanwhile, must try to enter the Diet by forming his own party that represents the younger people of Japan.

Screamers (1995 film)
 In the year 2078, the planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a war between the mining company, known as the New Economic Bloc (NEB), and the Alliance, a group of former mining and science personnel.  Five years into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous Mobile Swords (AMS) — [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[self-replicating machine]]s that hunt down and kill NEB soldiers on their own.  They are nicknamed "screamers" because of a high-pitched noise they emit as they attack.  Screamers track targets by their heartbeats, so Alliance soldiers wear "tabs" which broadcast a signal canceling out the wearer's heartbeat and rendering them "invisible" to the machines.  A fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly supplied, and undermanned armies.  The Alliance recovers an invitation guaranteeing safe passage through NEB territory to discuss a truce from a dead NEB soldier, killed by screamers as he approached the Alliance compound.  When Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson (Weller) reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, he is told that such a meeting will not be necessary; peace negotiations are already underway on Earth.  Not true, says Private "Ace" Jefferson ([[Andrew Lauer]]), newly arrived from Earth. Hendricksson is not surprised, as he suspects that both sides have simply written off Sirius 6B and abandoned their armies.  Hendricksson decides that the only realistic chance of survival for himself and his soldiers is to accept the NEB truce offer.  He sets out for a meeting with the NEB commander, accompanied by Jefferson. While traveling through a destroyed city they come upon a war orphan, a young boy named David ([[Michael Caloz]]), clutching a teddy bear.  Unwilling to abandon a defenseless civilian, they bring the boy along.  The following night they are attacked by a reptilian screamer that they have never before encountered.  Hendricksson is alarmed that their Alliance tabs did not protect them.  As the group nears the NEB compound, two enemy soldiers, Becker (Dupuis) and Ross (Charles Powell), open fire on David, whose chest explodes in a shower of gears, bolts, and wires.  They explain to the astonished Alliance men that David was a new "type 3" screamer impersonating a human.  Most of the NEB contingent has been wiped out by another "David" screamer that a patrol unwittingly brought into the base; Becker, Ross, and a black marketeer named Jessica (Rubin) are the only survivors.  The group heads to the NEB command center but finds only an empty building and large pools of blood. Locating the mainframe computer, Hendricksson learns that the NEB truce offer was just as false as the Alliance message from Earth. The group retreats to the NEB bunker, pursued by "Davids".  The discovery that the screamers have "evolved" new versions on their own that are  indistinguishable from humans, and immune to Alliance tabs, leads to paranoia and distrust.  Becker becomes convinced that Ross is a screamer and kills him, only to discover that he was human.  The three survivors retreat to the Alliance base, only to find that the "Davids" have gained entrance to that compound as well, with equally devastating results.  As dozens of "Davids" pour out of the bunker's entrance, Hendricksson fires a micro-nuclear missile into the bunker.  Jefferson rushes to the aid of Becker, who was apparently injured in the blast, but Becker's cries of distress are a ruse; he is a "type 2" screamer, and he kills Jefferson.  After Hendricksson destroys Becker, only he and Jessica remain.  Now quite paranoid, Hendricksson worries that Jessica could be a screamer as well.  He slashes her hand, and is relieved to see blood dripping from the wound. They locate an emergency escape shuttle, but it can carry only one person. Hendricksson offers the shuttle to Jessica; but a second "Jessica" arrives, confirming that she is a screamer after all, and even more human-like.  Hendricksson resigns himself to death; but to his surprise, Jessica shields him, then sacrifices herself in battle with her lookalike.  With her last breath, Jessica confesses her love for Hendricksson.    Hendricksson departs for Earth on the escape shuttle with a single souvenir, the teddy bear carried by the original "David".  As the screen fades to black, the bear slowly begins to move on its own.

As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders, but only under specific terms, or he will [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]]. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees.  The detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location. Within minutes, a delivery van approaches.

Shallow Grave
  Chartered accountant David Stephens, physician Juliet Miller, and journalist Alex Law share a flat in Edinburgh. Needing a new flatmate, they interview several applicants in a calculatedly cruel manner, amusing themselves at the applicants' expense before finally offering the room to the mysterious Hugo. Shortly after Hugo moves in, the trio find him dead from an apparent overdose in his room, with a large suitcase full of money. They agree to keep the death a secret and the money for themselves, and to bury the body in the woods after removing the hands and feet to prevent identification. They draw lots, and David is given the gruesome and traumatising task of dismembering the corpse, while Juliet disposes of the hands and feet in her hospital's incinerator.  Unknown to the three friends, Hugo is being sought by a pair of violent men, who are torturing and murdering informants as they follow Hugo's trail. The flat below theirs is broken into making them anxious. The break-in also draws the attention of the police, who are surprised when the three deny that they ever had a fourth flatmate. While Juliet and Alex spend part of the money to 'feel better', David's fears turn into full-blown paranoia. He hides the suitcase of money in the attic and begins living there, drilling holes in the attic floor to watch the living space below. The relationship between the three becomes increasingly strained and distrustful.  The men trailing Hugo break into the trio's flat, coercing Alex and Juliet to reveal where the money is. As the men enter the dark attic, David, who has been lying there in wait, kills both of them with a hammer. David returns to the woods to dispose of the bodies.

The Seventh Brother
 The story begins in the forest, with the viewer being addressed by Dr. Albert E. Owl, a "famous storyteller". Noting that the viewer is lost in the forest, he decides to recount the tale of Tiny the puppy, the seventh brother (occasionally interspersing his story with various comments of his own).  The doctor's tale begins the previous spring, with Tiny the puppy riding in a car with his owner-a little girl named Angie-and her grandpa after an enjoyable trip to a big city. On the way home, their car breaks down in the middle of a storm and the grandpa goes out to fix it. Angie goes out to help, telling Tiny to stay in the car, but leaving the door open. Spotting a frog outside, Tiny goes after it, but falls down a hill (unbeknownst to his owners, who drive off without him and can't hear his barks over the storm). Heartbroken, he decides to wait out the storm by sleeping in a little hollowed-out area in a bush (sleeping through Angie calling for him, as she noticed his absence soon and told her grandpa to go back to find him).  The next morning, a band of rabbits discover Tiny. Their opinions on him are mixed (most of them believe Tiny to be some form of monster), but the leader of the group-the ruffian of the family, J.C. (his real name is Jerald Cuthbert)-feels that he should be left to survive on his own; luckily, one of his sisters, Joanna, decides that they should help him. She quickly convinces her siblings to join up after putting the matter to a vote with the other rabbits- Rebecca (the eldest sister), Mimi (the sensitive one), Cody (the glutton), Marty (the cautious one) -and Tiny is welcomed into the family as a "bunny-puppy". Tiny accepts, but on one condition- they must come back later to see if Angie came back. The bunnies agree and bring him back to their home following a musical number in which they introduce themselves. However, they teach him to act like a rabbit, such as hopping and keeping his ears up straight. J.C. is frustrated with Tiny because he doesn't act like a rabbit, but when J.C. is caught by a hawk, Tiny scares the hawk away by barking at it, causing it to fly away in a panic. Because of this, the family afterwards decides to accept Tiny as their brother, which makes the puppy very happy, although their parents are afraid at first.  The morning after, Miss Magpie, the nosy leader of the forest, is very scared of the news and tells her friend, Birdie, and the whole forest about it. Most of the forest is scared of Tiny at first, but when they see that he isn't vicious, the animals are relieved. The sole exception for this rule is Miss Magpie, who is still heavily convinced that he is a monster. When Tiny smells the scent of his owners and hears Angie calling for him, he runs up the hill to the road where he first met the bunnies. But when he arrives, he is too late, and thinks that his owners don't want him anymore (luckily, his new family is able to turn his frown upside down). Miss Magpie hires a fox named Mr. Fox to try and intimidate the rabbits, but Tiny teaches them to growl at him, which scares Mr. Fox and sends him running. Human poachers arrive in the forest to try and kill the bunnies, but the puppy teaches the rabbits to howl while hiding in their home, which send the poachers running.   Later that night, a flood reaches the bunnies' home. J.C. and his father stay in their hole trying to dig their way out while the other rabbits climb up a branch, but Cody is caught in the raging waters and Tiny jumps in. The puppy saves Cody, and the rabbits hop onto dry land, but J.C. and their dad are still in their hole trying to dig through as the water rises. Tiny senses them and digs a hole where they escape. Their father applauds Tiny, saying he is proud for him to be their son.  Winter is not far from arrival, and Miss Magpie mocks Tiny for being a dog, not knowing how to prepare for winter. Unfortunately for her, fortunes turn when a ferret tries to kill her because she failed to stop the rabbits. The ferret bites Tiny's leg, but he eventually throws the ferret into a pond. Fearing for his safety, Miss Magpie warns the rabbits. When the rabbits discover that Tiny is alive, they celebrate. But he is sick due to the effects of the bite, and he is taken to see Dr. Owl, who tells the parents that he must be returned to his owners. The rabbits carry Tiny back home, but along the way, they come across a big crease between two hills. J.C. uses a large stick to successfully carry the family over the crease, and they finally reach his owners' home. As Tiny is dragged into his doghouse, the rabbits howl and then disappear, causing Angie to wonder if it's her puppy howling. When Angie sees Tiny, she and her grandpa are very happy to see him again and welcome him home.  
Showgirls
  Nomi Malone is a young drifter who hitchhikes to Las Vegas hoping to make it as a showgirl. After being robbed by her driver, Nomi meets Molly Abrams, a seamstress and costume designer who takes her in as a roommate. Molly invites Nomi backstage at ''Goddess'', the [[Stardust Resort & Casino|Stardust Casino]] show where she works, to meet Cristal Connors, the diva star of the topless dance revue. When Nomi tells Cristal she dances at [[Cheetah's Topless Club]], Cristal derisively tells her that what she does is akin to prostitution. When Nomi is too upset to go to work that night, Molly takes her dancing at The Crave Club. After getting into a fight with James, a bouncer at the club, Nomi is arrested. James bails her out of jail, but she pays him little notice.  Shortly thereafter, Cristal and her boyfriend Zack Carey, the entertainment director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a [[lap dance]] from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she is little more than a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that what she is doing is no different from prostitution.  Cristal arranges for Nomi to audition for the chorus line of ''Goddess''. Tony Moss, the show's director, humiliates Nomi by asking her to put ice on her nipples to make them hard. Furious, Nomi leaves the audition and again runs into James, who says he has written a dance number for her and contends that Nomi is too talented to be a stripper or showgirl. Despite her outburst at the audition, Nomi gets the job and quits Cheetah's. Cristal further humiliates Nomi by suggesting she make a "goodwill appearance" at a boat trade show which turns out to be a thinly disguised form of prostitution. Undeterred, Nomi sets out to get revenge against Cristal and claim her mantle. She seduces Zack, who secures an audition for her to be Cristal's understudy. Nomi wins the role, but when Cristal threatens legal action against the Stardust, the offer is rescinded. After Cristal gloats and taunts Nomi at a performance, Nomi pushes her down a flight of stairs, and Cristal breaks her hip. Unable to perform, Cristal is replaced by Nomi as the show's lead.  Although Nomi has finally secured the fame she sought, she alienates Molly, who realises she pushed Cristal. Later, Molly relents and attends Nomi's opening night celebration at a posh hotel, where she meets her idol, musician Andrew Carver. Carver lures Molly to a room, where he brutally beats her and helps one of his bodyguards rape her. Molly is hospitalized after the assault. Nomi wants to prosecute Carver, but Zack tells her the Stardust will bribe Molly with [[hush money]] to quiet her in order to protect their celebrity client.

Along with coincidentally rescued Naga, they return to present time.  Before going back to the mainland, Lina remembers she has to visit the hidden hot spring promised by Rowdy, but there she discovers it is a magical water that makes things like vegetables growing older, and not growing bigger as she hoped for her breasts.

When Tat comes to rescue his son, both are caught by Mark and tied together in a bathroom stall, where Mark planted a bomb.

A government team led by Xavier Fitch ([[Ben Kingsley]]) goes forward with the genetic experiment attempting to induce a female, under the (later proved to be mistaken) assumption that a female would have "more docile and controllable" traits. One of the hundred experimental ova produces a girl named Sil, who looks like a normal human but develops into a 12-year-old in 3 months.  Sil's violent outbursts during sleep make the scientists consider her a threat. They try to kill her using [[cyanide]] gas but she breaks out of her containment cell and escapes. The government assembles a team composed of [[anthropologist]] Dr. Stephen Arden ([[Alfred Molina]]), [[molecular biologist]] Dr. Laura Baker ([[Marg Helgenberger]]), "[[telepath|empath]]" Dan Smithson ([[Forest Whitaker]]) and mercenary Preston "Press" Lennox ([[Michael Madsen]]) to track and destroy Sil. Sil matures rapidly into an adult ([[Natasha Henstridge]]) in her early twenties and makes her way to Los Angeles. Her body strength, regenerative ability and intelligence make tracking her extremely difficult. The scientists fear she may mate with human males and produce offspring that could eliminate the human race. Sil is intent on producing offspring as soon as possible, and kills several people to prevent them from notifying the authorities or simply to use their clothing.  Sil first tries to mate with a man she meets at a nightclub ([[Anthony Guidera]]), but after sensing that he is [[diabetic]], she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he  tries to rape her, prompting her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue. She then tries to mate with John Carey ([[Whip Hubley]]), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a [[bipedal]] mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.  After cutting and dyeing her hair, Sil takes an attraction to Preston, having dreamt of him the previous night. After the team celebrates their apparent victory, she stalks them in their hotel, and they do not recognize her. Arden, who is upset at being single, walks into his room to find Sil waiting there. She has intercourse with Arden, which results in her instantly getting impregnated by him, then kills him when he realizes who she is. Dan senses that Sil is in the hotel and he alerts Preston, Laura, and the rest of the team. She morphs again and escapes and they follow her into the sewers where Fitch is subsequently killed. Sil gives birth and Dan finds her offspring in a cavern behind the sewers. The child attacks him and he incinerates it, also killing Sil. The trio leaves the area. The last scene shows a rat chewing on one of Sil's severed tentacles; it starts to mutate into a vicious beast and attacks another rat.  
Spadikam
  Thomas Chacko, or "Aadu Thoma" as he is widely known, is a local gangster and a quarry owner, who is notorious for being the undefeated champion in his confronts and the unrivaled contender in the trade. He is feared in the locality for his atypical practices, like drinking the blood of black male goats before fights (an act that is believed to be the source of his strength) and using his [[Mundu]] as a weapon during fights. In spite of his frightening nature, he is known to have a good heart, gambling with his life for just cause. He is the son of the retired school headmaster Chacko (Chacko master), the President's medal winner in mathematics. Thoma is the never-ending headache of his 'respectable' father, both never getting along on any occasion. His mother and sister are caught in the row, left to choose between sides; while Chacko master's brother – Manimala Vakkachan, supports Thoma whatsoever. Pookoya, a local baron, is the newly-made enemy of Thoma, along with his sub-inspector (S.I.) friend Kuttikkadan; for supporting Pookoya's daughter's relationship with a penniless teacher. Due to Thoma's relationship with a prostitute, revealed when the police shame him publicly, the arranged marriage of his sister almost fail, further angering his father. This force him to rat his son out to the police on a later occasion, thrashing him with a cane like he used to do in the early days; surprising even the S.I. with the act.  Chacko master had always been a very strict teacher, who emphasized on memorization and discipline at the expense of analysis and creativity. His achievements made him narcissistic as a father, wanting to make his son as good a mathematician as himself. His pride blinded him to his son's aspirations and talents. Unlike his father Thomas was not good at math, but was a [[child prodigy]] in mechanical and electronic gadgetry like a mechanical timer school bell, something the admirers call "miracle bell" (for its excellence and innovation). He even made an AM radio receiver inside a soap case, at a time when phonographs were the fad of the time. Thomas's talent astonished others, whereas his father saw them as a waste of time, or even as insults showered at him. He destroyed each one of them and was angry at him for converting his mathematical instrument box into a mechanical toolbox. Chacko master, who punished his students ruthlessly, treated his son worse – assuming him to be behind every mischief in school and punishing him until the actual culprit gives in. He always compared his son to the best student in the class – Balu (the son of a 'simple' police constable), adding to his pressure. Thomas worked hard, and did well in his language paper, but his father asked his language teacher Ravunni master to grade his paper so as to fail him, on the belief that only low grades will provoke him to study harder. His language teacher did as asked (regretting it later on). When Thomas found out that even his most beloved language teacher was biased against him, he became outraged and ran away from the village; after stabbing Balu on the palm with a compass. Fourteen years later, he returned as a changed man, no longer a prodigy. His father still hate him and profess to love his sister more, who lived up to the expectations. Thomas's only regret is that he could not get a chance to apologize to Balu, who died in a bike-accident; for which he feels his father is to blame, as he praised the boy too much so as to bring an early death upon him.  The relationship between the two further decline due to the incident, whereby entering into a fit of rage Thoma cuts off the sleeves of his father's shirts (an act equivalent to cutting his arms). Chacko master on the other hand, repaint his son's lorry with the name "Chekuthan" (meaning devil) and plant a coconut tree in front of the house, calling it his son – further rejecting him. Meanwhile, Ravunni master, who resigned after Thomas ran away from the village, comes back with his daughter Thulasi (Thomas's childhood friend) and see how bad the situation has become. Thulasi as well as the Vicar of the church and Vakkachan, try to mediate between the two by trying to get Thomas invited by his father to his sister's wedding. Thomas who came hoping for the better, gets further insulted by his father by stating that his old student – the current Chief Secretary of the State will come for the wedding, whom he prefers more. This incident finally make Jhansy, Thoma's sister stand against her father, stating she prefers her brother's small necklace to her father's high dowry in marriage. While the necklace was actually a gift from Thulasi given in the name of Thoma, this leads her to be deserted on the day of her wedding. Her mother, who was waiting for the wedding, leave him as well. With his pride struck the worst blow, Chacko master is left all alone to rethink on his actions. He now slowly understand, the pulse of the world is not in mathematics as he always believed.  Not so long after, Thoma gets stabbed by another goon employed by Pookoya, when he helps his daughter elope with her lover. Thoma almost face death and Chacko master regret his actions. The ice slowly melt and he secretly visit his son in the hospital. Coming back to health, Thoma's attempt at revenge is foiled when Thulasi interferes. On learning that she loves him, he try to prevent her. He feels that his end is near and his deeds are soon to ricochet back at him. With her help, he tries to back out from his wrong course of life. Filled with the guilt of ruining his son's life, Chacko master attempts suicide, which Thomas see and foil. He apologize to his son for the first time and the two reconcile. With a newfound joy, they together bring back his mother.  The happiness does not last long, for they were too late for the retreat. Thomas's enemies unite against him. In a tragic turn of events, Chacko master is shot by S.I. Kuttikadan while targeting Thoma, who in turn gets killed by him.

As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a SQUID, an illegal electronic device that records memories and physical sensations directly from the wearer's [[cerebral cortex]] onto a [[MiniDisc]]-like device for playback. Lenny Nero, a former [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, buys the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is a former friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman. Iris escapes on a [[rapid transit|subway car]] but Engleman pulls off her wig, revealing a SQUID recorder headset.   Lenny pines for Faith and relies on emotional support from his two best friends: bodyguard and [[limousine]] driver Lornette "Mace" Mason and private investigator Max Peltiert. Mace has unrequited feelings for Lenny from when he was still a cop and stepped in as a dependable father figure for her son after her boyfriend was arrested on drug charges, but disapproves of his SQUID-dealing business. While Lenny and Max are drinking together at a bar, Iris drops a SQUID disc through the sunroof of Lenny's car before it is towed away. Mace picks Lenny up and takes him to a nightclub where Faith is going to sing. There, Lenny receives a SQUID disc from a contact and unsuccessfully tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, Philo Gant. Gant is a music industry mogul who managed the recently-slain rapper Jeriko One.  While in the car with Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an attacker at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, they take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but they escape in Mace's car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.  Mace takes Lenny to her brother's house and they watch Iris's disc, depicting that Iris was with Jeriko One when Steckler and Engleman pulled him over and murdered him because his anti-police lyrics and activism incited protests against the LAPD. The two return to Tick, whom Max reveals has been rendered brain-dead from forceful exposure to amplified SQUID signals. Lenny fears Iris' attacker covered their tracks by "killing" Tick and will come after Faith. Back at the nightclub, Lenny and Mace confront Faith, who reveals that Philo is afraid Iris' disc would reveal that he kept his artists under surveillance. Lenny and Mace disagree over whether to trade the disc to Philo for Faith's freedom or release it publicly, which could incite a citywide riot. As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private party at the [[Westin Bonaventure Hotel]] that Philo is hosting for the city's wealthy elite. Lenny has a change of heart and tells Mace to give the disc to deputy police commissioner Palmer Strickland.  In Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds Philo brain-dead on the floor and another disc, revealing that Max and Faith are lovers and that Max "killed" Philo with an amplified recording of them having sex. Faith explains to Lenny that Philo hired Max to kill Iris, but when Philo wanted Faith dead as part of the coverup, Max decided to frame Lenny for the murders. Lenny and Max struggle in a fight, which culminates with Lenny throwing Max off the balcony to his death. Meanwhile, on the crowded streets, Mace subdues Streckler and Engelman but other officers take down Mace. Strickland arrives and orders Mace's release and to arrest Streckler and Engelman for murder.

They both drink a large amount of wine, and then Joan announces that because she is infertile, they are looking for a surrogate mother. She then tells Amy that they feel that she is the perfect candidate. Amy is flattered, and next day discusses the situation with her friendly teacher Eric Shaw (Vincent Ventresca). She then agrees when the Quinns propose to pay for her college fees if she helps them out.  When Amy is a few months pregnant, Joan starts to show strange behavior. Amy feels smothered by Joan's overbearing attitude, feeling that she is being treated like a ten-year-old child. Her oil painting being taken away, Amy looks for it in the basement, only to find old baby clothes. Joan catches her, and becomes furious, scaring Amy away. She later tries to explain the situation by saying that she was pregnant four years ago, though had a miscarriage. Amy does not believe her story, though Eric - who was already 'warned' by Joan that Amy might act paranoid - tells her to focus on her painting, not on the Quinns.  Later that day, a strange woman drops by to meet with Joan. Joan, who was not at home by the time, is convinced that the woman is Sandy Gilman (Polly Bergen), and meets with her the next day to tell her not to come at her house ever again. Amy overhears the conversation and is worried when they discuss rumor of Joan being responsible of their biological baby Christopher's death. She is further confused when Sandy reveals herself as Joan's mother. Amy next contacts Janice, who previously lived with the Quinns, and finds out that Joan did not have a miscarriage, and that police were involved when Christopher died. Eric, informed by Amy, tries to talk to Joan, but she threatens to ruin his career if he interferes.  Meanwhile, Amy finds a video tape of Joan with Christopher, and grows convinced that Joan murdered her baby. Joan catches her watching the tape, and when Amy tries to get away, Joan accidentally shoves her off the stairs. Amy has to be rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby girl while unconscious. Joan takes the baby home, and tells Amy that she is not allowed in the home anymore. Amy then turns to the police, but they inform her that she can be arrested for breaking contract if she continues her quest to get the baby girl Christine back.  Instead, Amy and Eric decide to dig into Joan's past and find out that Joan is using a false name. Joan fears that Amy will do anything to get Christine and tells Stuart they might have to 'take care' of her.  When Amy is on her way to the police to inform them about the real Joan and Stuart Quinn, she is run over by Joan before she is able to arrive at the station. Now instead, they turn to the Quinns and kidnap Christine. The Quinns use the help of their guard (Roger R. Cross) to go after her, but Eric steps in-between them, and has to be hospitalized in order for Amy to get away. Amy changes her identity and appearance and goes into hiding and renames her baby Emily. A large police investigation is started, and Amy makes newspaper headlines with the kidnapping. She heads out to Sandy to find help, but the Quinns have already suspected that she might do that and are present as well when Amy arrives. Joan tells Amy that she will not press charges if she gives up Emily, though Stuart interrupts her and admits to the suspicion surrounding the couple about the murder of their infant. He offers to not press charges if she keeps their past a secret, and allows her to take the baby. Joan, infuriated, hits Stuart on the head with an object, takes Emily out off Amy's hands and runs off. Amy follows her and they end up on the edge of a cliff. There, Joan admits that she accidentally smothered Christopher to death when he was crying and reluctantly returns Emily to Amy.  Sometime later, Amy is seen being the legal mother of Emily, and she is now in a loving relationship with Eric.

No one is considered strong or wise enough to confront D'Costa. D'Costa one day notices Ravi and Mohini on the beach, and he immediately falls for her. To keep Ravi away from her, he frames Ravi on the day before his marriage to Mohini by falsely implicating him in a drug deal case in a fake raid. Ravi is sentenced to four years of imprisonment. In prison, Ravi decides to study the law so he can fight injustice. He is helped by hardcore criminals who are in jail because of D'Costa and want him dead.  In Ravi's absence, D'Costa befriends Mohini. She begins to like and respect him as though he were a good man. After two years, Ravi is released from jail because of good behavior and on efforts by the circle inspector made on Mohini’s pleas. Soon Ravi and Mohini are married.

Being a photographer, he captures the cop on camera.  The circle inspector is killed by D'Costa when both of them rescue a group of school children from terrorists holding them captive in a school. This is noted by Ravi, and he makes it known publicly. Soon an enquiry is arranged by the police (on Ravi's request), and Ravi plays the prosecution lawyer. He traps D'Costa in his own words, making him confess his crime. He also provides evidence for the same.  The helpless D'Costa is suspended from service. But Ravi and Mohini know that D'Costa will never leave them in peace. They approach his mistress ([[Archana Puran Singh]]) for help; she says that D'Costa's desires can be used against him. They hatch a plan. Ravi leaves the house before Mohini, pretending to go out of the city. D'Costa learns of this and immediately goes to the couple's house, where he is met by a surprise reception.

The criminals together attack and kill D'Costa.  The film ends with D'Costa's burial, as Ravi sticks a cross with D'Costa's name on the grave.

Tales from the Hood
 ===Welcome to My Mortuary (beginning)=== In [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]], a trio gang of teenage drug dealers, Stack ([[Joe Torry]]), Ball ([[De'Aundre Bonds]]) and Bulldog ([[Samuel Monroe Jr.]]), arrive at Simms' Funeral Home to purchase some drugs from Mr. Simms ([[Clarence Williams III]]), the mortuary's eccentric owner. Mr. Simms claims that he found the drugs in an alley and has them safely stored in the mortuary. He asks the dealers to help him get the drugs and, as the four make their way through the building, relates stories about some of his recent "customers". The first casket contains the body of a man named Clarence.  ===Rogue Cop Revelation=== During his first night on the job, young black [[police officer]] Clarence Smith ([[Anthony Griffith (actor)|Anthony Griffith]]) is taken by his new partner, Newton ([[Michael Massee]]), to the scene of what initially appears to be a routine [[traffic stop]] of a well-dressed black man. When Smith runs the car's license plates, he learns that the man is in fact Martin Moorehouse ([[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]]), a city councilman and [[Civil Rights Movement|black rights activist]] who has recently been on a crusade to eliminate [[police corruption]] in the city. Smith watches in horror as Newton, along with fellow officers Billy ([[Duane Whitaker]]) and Strom ([[Wings Hauser]]), brutally beat Moorehouse with their [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]]s and vandalize his car. When Smith insists that Moorehouse should be taken to a hospital, two of the officers appear to agree.  Smith tells Newton that Billy and Strom should be reported for what they did, but Newton tells Smith that officers are not to break "the code". Strom and Billy drive Moorehouse' car to the docks. Strom shoots the battered Moorehouse up with [[heroin]], plants some in his car, then pushes it into the water with Moorehouse still inside. Moorehouse is posthumously and falsely labeled a hypocrite.  One year later, Smith has left the police force and is now a guilt-consumed drunk. On a walk in his neighborhood, he sees a [[mural]] of Moorehouse. Smith then has a vision of a [[Crucifixion|crucified]] Moorehouse haunting him with the words "Bring them to me!" In response, Smith convinces the three police officers involved in the death to meet him at Moorehouse's grave.  Once there, the officers begin to insult Moorehouse, with Strom urinating on Moorehouse's grave and then ordering Billy to do the same thing. As Newton and Strom prepare to kill Smith, a [[zombie]]-like Moorehouse bursts from the grave to drag Billy beneath the ground by his [[genitals]]. Moorehouse's coffin bursts from the ground, opening to reveal Billy's mutilated corpse with Moorehouse clutching Billy's still-beating heart.  Strom and Newton flee in horror. A lengthy chase ensues, with the two cops fleeing by patrol car. As Newton is driving the vehicle, Moorehouse jumps on top of the vehicle and [[decapitation|decapitates]] Strom. Terrified, Newton exits his vehicle. With Moorehouse still on top of the patrol car and carrying Strom's head, Newton shoots the gas tank, causing the patrol car to explode. Moorehouse then chases Newton into an alley, where he [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] throws used [[hypodermic needle]]s into the cop's body, pinning him to a wall mural. After Newton is killed, his body melts into the mural, becoming a painting of himself crucified.  His vengeance nearly complete, Moorehouse accosts Smith, asking him why he did not help him when he was being beaten. The story ends with Smith in a mental hospital. Two orderlies outside his cell mention that he killed the officers and that he used to be an officer himself. Moorehouse is never mentioned.  Stack, Ball and Bulldog think Mr. Simms is crazy after hearing the story. After they look at the second casket, Mr. Simms tells them about a boy named Walter.  ===Boys Do Get Bruised=== Walter Johnson ([[Brandon Hammond]]) is a quiet and sensitive boy who shows up to school one day with bruises around his cheek and eye. Walter's caring teacher, Richard Garvey ([[Rusty Cundieff]]), notices the bruises and asks what happened; Walter claims that he was attacked by a monster. A few days later he again shows up with a bruised arm. While the other children play, Walter sits inside and draws a boy named Tyrone, one of the school bullies. Walter crumples the drawing up causing Tyrone to suffer spontaneous [[Haitian Vodou#Myths and misconceptions|injuries]].  Later that night Mr. Garvy visits Walter's home and asks Walter's mother, Sissy ([[Paula Jai Parker]]), about the monster. Sissy claims that Walter's injuries are the result of his own clumsiness; she then tells Walter not to reveal anything about the monster to anyone else.  As Mr. Garvy is leaving, Sissy's boyfriend, Carl ([[David Alan Grier]]) comes home: seen through Walter's imagination, the audience learns that Carl in fact is the “monster”. Thinking that Walter has told his teacher about him and called him a monster (a tattoo of the word "Monster" can be seen on Carl's arm), Carl terrorizes Walter and then whips Sissy with a belt when she intervenes.  Mr. Garvy turns around to check on Walter and sees Carl abusing Walter and Sissy: Mr. Garvy bursts into the house and begins to fight Carl. With Carl's attention elsewhere, Walter grabs a drawing he made of the monster and begins to fold and crumple it. Carl becomes mangled, helpless and unable to accept defeat. Sissy stomps on the wadded-up paper to end the threat. Finally Mr. Garvy gives the paper to Walter, who burns it, completely immolating Carl. Sissy and Walter look on as Carl burns alive and appear to be relieved to be free from his brutal abuse.  Later, Carl's burnt and twisted corpse is in the coffin in Simms' Funeral Home (although many broadcast TV versions show Walter in the casket instead of Carl). Mr. Simms shows a doll, instead of a corpse, to Ball, Stack and Bulldog, explaining that it is not any ordinary doll.  ===KKK Comeuppance=== Duke Metger ([[Corbin Bernsen]]) is an obnoxious and [[racism|racist]] [[American South|Southern]] [[United States Senate|senator]], and a former member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The senator is in his office filming a campaign commercial when he sees protesters outside the office: [[Jewish]] and [[African-American]] groups have teamed up to protest against Metger for being a racist, a former [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]], and for setting up his office at an old slave [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. One individual, Eli ([[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]]), tells the reporter that the plantation is haunted by dolls animated by the souls of previously tortured slaves. He warns everyone that it is not a myth.  Meanwhile, Metger and his African-American "image-maker" assistant Rhodie ([[Roger Guenveur Smith]]) notice a large painting of Miss Cobbs, a [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] [[witch]], and her dolls. Metger says racial slurs to Rhodie, who attempts to ignore his rantings. Metger also refers to the dolls as "[[Negro]] dolls". One of the dolls is seen under the floorboard as Rhodie leaves.  While Metger and Rhodie are working on Metger's media skills, Rhodie falls down the stairs to his death (it is later learned that the doll seen under the floorboard earlier was the cause). At the funeral, Eli warns Metger to leave the house before he ends up like his deceased assistant or worse. In the limo after Rhodie's funeral, Metger notices the doll and orders his African-American driver to pull over so he can throw the doll out the window into the street.  Later, after noticing a blank spot on the painting, Metger comes in contact with the doll he threw out on the street and has a fight with it. When Metger throws a vase at the doll, it disappears and attacks Metger out of nowhere, trying to eat him. Metger is injured, but he manages to stop the doll by beating it with an [[American Flag]]. He also damages the painting, which starts to bleed.  Metger takes the doll outside to his porch and ties it to a dart board. He then blasts the doll with his [[shotgun]] and goes back inside to rant at the painting. But in the midst of his rant, Metger realizes more doll images in the painting have faded to white. After Metger begins chasing several small footsteps throughout the house, he finds the previously blasted doll in the hallway, reattaching its head. The doll attacks again and chases Metger into his office. Metger manages to lock the doll outside and tries to figure out a way to help himself. He sees that the painting has all the doll images faded to white. Terrified, Metger turns around to see an army of dolls. He covers himself in the American flag as the dolls converge and devour him. Miss Cobbs then disappears from the painting and manifests herself in the room, holding the first doll in her arms. Satisfied, they both smile as they witness the carnage taking place before them.  By now, the dealers are getting impatient and want the drugs they came for, not wanting to listen to any more of Mr. Simms's strange stories. Ball notices a corpse in another room and alerts the others to come and see it. When Simms asks them if they knew the man, Bulldog says it was just someone they had seen around their neighborhood. Mr. Simms explains the final moments of the man known as Crazy K.  ===Hard-Core Convert=== Jerome "Crazy K" Johns ([[Lamont Bentley]]) is a violent gang member and homicidal psychopath who has killed many people mercilessly. He is driving down the streets of [[Los Angeles]] in his [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]]. Coming to a stoplight, he notices the car of an enemy he's been after for a long time and follows him. Crazy K parks in a neighborhood and has a brief argument with the enemy, then shoots him. In retaliation, three other men attack from a house nearby. The men shoot Crazy K, and just as they are about to kill him, the police arrive at the scene. Due to one of the shooters firing at the police officers, all three gunmen are shot and killed by the officers. Crazy K is badly injured but survives, only to get arrested and sent to prison.  As described by a prison guard Crazy K has received a life sentence for suspicion of murder three times along with other charges. Dr. Cushing ([[Rosalind Cash]] in her final film role before her death) arrives at the prison and transfers Crazy K to another facility. Crazy K meets an inmate (Rick Dean) who is a homicidal [[white supremacist]] and raves about killing black people and the end of days for blacks. This angers Crazy K and causes him to punch him in the face. The man then asks Crazy K the race of the victims he killed, silencing Crazy K because all of his victims were black. The man grows fond of Crazy K and he tells him that there will be a few black people who will be spared as long as they think like him. After speaking to the man, Crazy K is told by Dr. Cushing that she purposely put him there to meet someone who is just like him. She then tells him that she has been hired by the government to administer a rehabilitation process on Crazy K in hopes that he will change his ways.  Crazy K is put through a process of torture to make him learn the consequences of his actions. His hair (with K cut into the front) is shaved off he is put through a slideshow of images involving black KKK members and victims of [[lynching]] along with gory footage of gang violence along with a montage showing all those he has killed. Dr. Cushing goes into the fact that Crazy K killed many innocent African Americans without remorse or second thought.  Crazy K is put through the next stage, in which he is put in a [[sensory deprivation]] chamber. He is confronted by all the souls of his victims, one of whom is an innocent little girl who was killed when a bullet from Crazy K's gun came through her wall and hit her in the chest. Crazy K doesn't accept any responsibility. Dr. Cushing warns him that he won't get another chance for forgiveness. The souls haunt him more and more, but he grows increasingly uncaring of his actions. Having refused a chance for redemption for his sins, he is transported back to the moment when he was shot. Crazy K is brutally shot dead by the three gunmen, and the story ends with his corpse lying abandoned on the street.  ===Welcome to My Mortuary (ending)=== Crazy K's killers are revealed to be the three drug dealers when Simms is threatened by the angry killers that he will be killed unless he reveals how he knew and give them their drugs. Simms leads them deep into the funeral home and tells them their "reward" is in three closed caskets. Each drug dealer finds that the casket he opens contains their corpse. The dealers learn that they are dead. Simms makes their guns glow red hot, and the dealers drop them.  Simms explains that after the murder of Crazy K, retaliation by Crazy K's "boys" caused the dealers' deaths. Bulldog asks Simms how could they be dead if they seemed alive. Simms, growing more eccentric by the second, tells them that the funeral home really is [[Hell]] and transforms into [[Satan]]. The drug dealers scream in horror as the walls of the funeral home shatter to reveal an inferno that consumes them.  
Tank Girl (film)
 In 2022, a comet strikes Earth, causing a drought that is still ongoing in 2033, the year in which the film is set. Most of the little remaining water is controlled by Kesslee ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) and his Water & Power (W&P) corporation, which controls the population by monopolising the water supply. Rebecca Buck – "Tank Girl" ([[Lori Petty]]) – is a member of a commune in the Australian [[outback]] that operates the last [[water well]] not controlled by the corporation. In an attack on the commune, W&P troops kill Tank Girl's boyfriend, Richard ([[Brian Wimmer]]), and capture Tank Girl and her young friend Sam (Stacy Linn Ramsower). Rather than killing her, Kesslee enslaves and tortures the defiant Tank Girl. Jet Girl ([[Naomi Watts]]), a talented but [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] jet mechanic who has given up trying to escape W&P, urges Tank Girl to make less trouble for their captors, though Tank Girl refuses. Among other forms of torture, W&P personnel push her down into a long pipe to induce [[claustrophobia]].  The mysterious Rippers slaughter guards at the W&P compound, then escape. Kesslee uses Tank Girl to lure the Rippers into the open, but they gravely wound him. Tank Girl and Jet Girl escape during the attack. Jet Girl steals a fighter jet from W&P and Tank Girl steals a tank, which she modifies heavily. The girls learn from the eccentric Sub Girl ([[Ann Cusack]]) that Sam is working at a sex club called Liquid Silver. They infiltrate the club, rescue Sam from a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], Rat Face ([[Iggy Pop]]), and then humiliate the club's owner, "The Madame" ([[Ann Magnuson]]), by making her sing [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love|Let's Do It]]" at gunpoint. W&P troops break up the performance and recapture Sam. Tank Girl and Jet Girl wander the desert and find the Rippers' hideout. They learn that the Rippers are [[supersoldier]]s created from human and kangaroo [[DNA]] by a man called Johnny Prophet. Tank Girl befriends a Ripper named Booga ([[Jeff Kober]]), while a Ripper named Donner ([[Scott Coffey]]) shows romantic interest in Jet Girl. Despite the objections of the Ripper T-Saint ([[Ice-T]]), who is suspicious of the girls, the Rippers' leader Deetee ([[Reg E. Cathey]]) sends the pair out to capture a shipment of weapons. The girls bring the weapons crates back, though most of them are empty. After finding Johnny Prophet dead in one of the containers, the girls and the Rippers realize that W&P has tricked them.  The girls and the Rippers sneak into W&P, where they are ambushed. Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai ([[James Hong]]), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been [[Covert listening device|bugged]]. Deetee sacrifices himself damaging the generator, and in the darkness the Rippers turn the tide of the battle. Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small ([[Donald Patrick Harvey|Don Harvey]]), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life endangered by rising water. Tank Girl kills Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.

Tesis
 Ángela, a university student in [[Madrid]], is planning to write a [[thesis]] on audiovisual violence and the family. As she is sitting on a commuter train, it halts and passengers are told to evacuate. A man has committed suicide by jumping on front of the train. While being led out of the station, Ángela moves toward the tracks to see the man's remains. She is warded away at the last instant. At a thesis meeting, she asks her thesis director, Professor Figueroa, to help her find the most violent videos in the school's video library. After class, Ángela seeks out the help of a fellow student, Chema, who is known for his collection of violent and [[Pornographic film|pornographic videos]]. While Ángela watches a violent film with Chema, Figueroa finds a tape hidden in the school's audiovisual archives. The next day, Ángela finds Figueroa dead of an apparent [[asthma]] attack in the university's viewing room. She takes the video tape from the player and leaves for class. A younger professor, Castro, takes over Figueroa's classes and the supervision of Ángela's thesis project. She goes to Chema's house to watch the film she stole. It is a [[snuff film]], a film of a person being murdered. As they watch a woman being tortured, killed, and disemboweled, Chema realizes that she was Vanessa, a girl who attended their university and went missing two years ago. Chema is able to determine that the killer used a Sony XT-500 camera, based on the fact that it had a [[digital zoom]] feature, and that the film was shot in someone's garage.  While at the library working on her thesis, Ángela sees a handsome young man named Bosco using an XT-500 camera. When she leaves the library, he pursues and catches up to her. He notices that she has newspaper clippings about Vanessa's disappearance and states that he has information about Vanessa. Ángela pretends she is filming a report about Vanessa's disappearance and asks to interview Bosco about it. At the interview, he insists that Vanessa must have run away with a boyfriend because she sent a note to her family saying that she was in love. Ángela is willing to accept Bosco's innocence, but Chema tells her that Bosco is a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]. Once home, Ángela realizes that Bosco is inside her house waiting for her. Although she is initially frightened, Bosco charms her family and they invite him to stay for dinner. Once alone, Bosco attempts to seduce Ángela, but she resists his advances. At the school, Chema asks a security guard to see the security tape of the video library on the night of Figueroa's death. That night, Ángela has a dream that Bosco threatens her with a knife, performs [[oral sex]] on her while videotaping it, and then stabs her.  At a thesis meeting, Professor Castro asks Ángela what she knows about Figueroa's death. Ángela denies all knowledge, but Castro plays her a security tape of the viewing room, which shows Ángela finding Figueroa's dead body and taking the videotape. As Ángela is about to admit why she took the tape, Chema calls. Ángela answers the phone in a separate room and Chema tells her to leave Castro's office immediately, saying that Castro is involved in the snuff film. Castro listens in on the call and tries but fails to catch Ángela as she flees his office. Later that day, Bosco's girlfriend, Yolanda, confronts Ángela and explains that she, Vanessa, Bosco, and Chema, who was once a friend of Bosco, had gone to a series of director's workshops two years ago with Professor Castro. Yolanda states that she left when they made Vanessa take off her clothes for a short film, that Chema was obsessed with snuff films, and that she believes he killed Vanessa a week after the workshop ended. Later, Angela asks Chema whether he knew Bosco, and Chema admits that he did, but that he also left the workshop when things got out of hand. At night, Chema shows Ángela a hidden tunnel he discovered in the school's video library. In a room off the tunnel, they find shelves of video tapes like the one of Vanessa, indicating that many other women may have been murdered on camera. Suddenly the door to the tunnel closes and they are locked inside. Fearing they will be killed, Chema and Ángela walk further into the tunnel with only matches to light their way. They find an editing room where they fall asleep in each other's arms.  When Ángela wakes, the lights have come back on and Chema is gone. She walks through a doorway and is [[chloroformed]]. She awakens tied to a chair, facing Professor Castro, who is videotaping her. He tells that he only edited the snuff videos, but that he has to kill her and that her death will be painless and much quicker than Vanessa's. As Castro aims a gun at Ángela's head, Chema appears and wrestles with him. The gun goes off, killing Castro. Ángela and Chema escape. Once at her house, Ángela's father tells her that her sister, Sena, is at a party with Bosco. Terrified, Ángela hurries to the party. Once there, Sena refuses to leave with Ángela, insisting that Bosco is in love with her. In order to persuade her sister to leave, Ángela approaches Bosco and passionately kisses him. The next day, Ángela tells Chema they need to go to the [[police]]. Although first reluctant, Chema agrees but takes a shower before leaving. While Chema is in the bathroom, Angela finds an XT-500 camera among Chema's things. The tape inside the camera reveals footage taken of Ángela from outside her bedroom window. Convinced that Chema has been [[stalking]] her, Ángela flees. She goes back home to advise her sister to remain safe, then takes a [[taxi]] to Bosco's house. She is followed by a figure in a black rain coat.  At Bosco's house, Bosco and Ángela talk about their relationship. Suddenly, the lights go out and Bosco goes downstairs to check on the power. When Ángela follows him, she finds him lying on the floor. Chema has followed her to the house and knocked out Bosco, but Bosco revives and in the struggle that ensues, Bosco beats Chema to the ground. While Bosco goes to get rope to tie up Chema, Chema tells Ángela to look in Bosco's garage. As Bosco binds Chema, Ángela goes to the garage, which she recognizes from the snuff film of Vanessa. Bosco ties up Ángela and explains how he intends to torture and kill her. However, Ángela cuts her bonds with a knife, slashes Bosco, grabs his gun, and shoots him dead. Ángela visits a recovering Chema in the [[hospital]]. On the television in his room, an announcer states that the bodies of six women were found at Bosco's home. Ángela gives Chema a book inscribed with an invitation to have coffee with her and tells him she is going to abandon her thesis. As they leave, the announcer states that footage from a snuff film will be shown on air.  
Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation
  In 1996, four Texan teenagers: Jenny, Sean, Heather, and Barry, attend their Senior Prom. Jenny and Sean take some photos, before they head back to Barry's car to smoke marijuana. Heather storms out of the dance after having discovered Barry cheating on her with another girl. She attempts to drive away in his car with Jenny and Sean, but Barry catches up to them and they leave the dance. The group argue over Barry's recent behavior, such as cheating on Heather and abandoning his friendship with Sean for more popular friends. Heather takes a detour off the highway, which takes them into a remote wooded area where they get into an accident with another vehicle. While the four teens are fine, the other motorist passes out in the ensuing confusion.   Jenny decides to search for help, with Barry and Heather accompanying her, while Sean stays behind to watch over the unconscious motorist. Jenny, Heather, and Barry eventually come to a rural real estate office, occupied by a trashy woman named Darla, who calls her tow trucker boyfriend Vilmer to the sight of the wreck. The three leave the office and begin to make their way back to the sight of the accident, but become separated in the process.   Meanwhile, Vilmer shows up to the site of the wreck and murders the motorist by breaking his neck, before chasing Sean in his truck. Heather and Barry come to a derelict house in the woods and the couple are confronted by W.E. and Leatherface. W.E. holds Barry at gunpoint, while Heather is attacked on the front porch by Leatherface, who chases her inside the house, before stuffing her in a meat locker. Barry locks W.E. out of the house and goes to use the restroom, but discovers human remains and is bludgeoned to death by Leatherface with a sledgehammer. Heather is then impaled on a meat hook by Leatherface.   Jenny, now on her own, makes her way back to the wreck, where she is picked up by Vilmer. He taunts her, before forcing her to look at the corpses of Sean and the injured motorist. Jenny leaps out of the truck and runs for the woods, where Leatherface attacks her with a chainsaw. A chase ensues, and Jenny runs towards the farmhouse, where she locks Leatherface outside. She takes shelter upstairs and discovers the preserved corpse of a Texas Ranger. Jenny takes his pistol and goes to confront Leatherface, who has forced his way into the house. She fires the pistol, frightening Leatherface, who subsequently chases her upstairs. Jenny jumps out of a window and onto the roof to escape him. She  climbs up a television antenna, before leaping onto a clothesline to escape, but Leatherface snaps the cord, sending Jenny plummeting through the roof of the Sawyers' greenhouse.   Leatherface chases Jenny through the woods back to Darla's office, where she seeks refuge. However, W.E. arrives and beats Jenny with an electric cattle prod, before tying her up and putting her in Darla's trunk. Darla goes to pick up some pizzas for dinner, before returning to the house, where Jenny and Heather, who is barely still alive, are tortured by the family.   Eventually, Vilmer knocks Jenny unconscious when she attempts to escape in Darla's car. She later awakens at a dinner table redressed in a skimpy evening gown, surrounded by the Sawyer family, including their supercentenarian grandfather and a transvestite Leatherface. Vilmer reveals that Leatherface plans to use Jenny's face to make a new mask of human flesh. She attempts to leave, but is stopped by Vilmer, who lights Heather on fire, before a mysterious man named Rothman arrives. He angrily berates Vilmer for keeping Jenny alive for so long; Leatherface restrains Jenny, as Rothman reveals an array of scarring and piercings and licks her face. Rothman leaves, and Vilmer crushes Heather's skull with his cybernetic leg, killing her. Vilmer begins to sob and mutilate himself, and the whole family erupts into chaos. Jenny takes the opportunity to escape again, but Vilmer captures and restrains her, while Leatherface attempts to decapitate her with his chainsaw.   Jenny grabs the remote which controls Vilmer's leg brace, distracting him long enough for her to escape the house. Vilmer orders Leatherface to chase after Jenny, who makes it to the road. She attempts to flag down an elderly couple in an RV, while Leatherface appears and attacks again. The elderly couple pull Jenny into the RV, but Vilmer appears in his truck with Leatherface, and they run the RV off the road, causing a turn over. Jenny emerges from the wrecked RV unharmed, and Vilmer and Leatherface chase after her. An airplane swoops down overhead with one of the wheels slicing Vilmer's skull, killing him. Jenny watches as Leatherface screams in agony over Vilmer's death.   A limousine appears to help Jenny and she quickly jumps in the backseat. She discovers Rothman inside and attempts to exit the car, but he assures her that he does not plan to do her any harm, stating that the whole ordeal was meant to be a spiritual experience which went horribly awry. Sometime later, Jenny is left at a hospital, where she is questioned by a police officer. She becomes distracted by the sight of a catatonic patient being wheeled by on a gurney. The film ends as Leatherface dances wildly in the road with his chainsaw in grief and frustration over Vilmer's death.

The Thief and the Cobbler
 The film opens with a narrator describing a prosperous city called the Golden City, ruled by the sleepy King Nod and protected by three golden balls atop its tallest [[minaret]]. According to a prophecy, the city would fall to a race of warlike, one-eyed monsters, known as "One-Eyes", should the balls be removed, and could only be saved by "the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things". Living in the city are the good-hearted [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] Tack, named for the ubiquitous pair of tacks held in his mouth, and a nameless, unsuccessful yet persistent [[thief]].  When the thief sneaks into Tack's house, the two fight and stumble outside, causing Tack's [[Nail (fastener)|tacks]] to fall onto the street. Zigzag, King Nod's [[Grand Vizier]], steps on one of the tacks and orders Tack to be arrested while the thief escapes. Tack is brought before King Nod and his daughter, Princess Yum-Yum. Before Zigzag can convince Nod to have Tack executed by [[Decapitation|beheading]], Yum-Yum saves Tack by breaking one of her shoes and ordering him to fix it. During repairs, Tack and Yum-Yum become increasingly attracted to each other, much to the jealousy of Zigzag, who plots to take over the kingdom by marrying the princess. Meanwhile, the thief notices the golden balls atop the minaret and decides to steal them. After breaking into the palace through a gutter, the thief steals the repaired shoe from Tack, prompting the cobbler to chase him through the palace. Upon retrieving the shoe, Tack bumps into Zigzag, who notices the shoe is fixed and imprisons Tack in a dungeon.  [[File:ThiefChars.PNG|thumb|left|From left to right: Tack the Cobbler, Zigzag the Grand Vizier, King Nod and Princess Yum-Yum. The [[model sheet|character designs]] are a combination of [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] styles,<ref name=Briney/><ref name="Summer"/> and the overall style and flat [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] are inspired by [[Persian miniature painting]]s.<ref name="Summer"/><ref name=AlxWlms/><ref name=doc2/><ref name=doc1></ref>]] The next morning, Nod has a vision of the Golden City's destruction by the One-Eyes. While Zigzag tries to convince Nod of the kingdom's security, the thief steals the balls after several failed attempts, only to lose them to Zigzag's minions; Tack escapes from his cell using his cobbling tools during the ensuing panic. Nod notices the balls' disappearance when a mortally wounded soldier warns them of the invading One-Eyes. Zigzag attempts to use the stolen balls to blackmail the king into letting him marry Yum-Yum. When Nod dismisses him, Zigzag defects to the One-Eyes and gives them the balls instead.  Nod sends Yum-Yum, her nurse, and Tack to ask help from a "mad and holy old witch" in the desert. They are secretly followed by the thief, who hears of treasures on the journey but fails in stealing any. In the desert, they discover a band of dimwitted [[brigands]], led by Chief Roofless, whom Yum-Yum recruits as her bodyguards. The protagonists reach the hand-shaped tower where the witch lives, and, after the witch kills herself, learn that Tack is prophesied to save the Golden City. The witch also presents a riddle: "Attack, attack, attack! A tack, see? But it's what you do with what you've got!" before destroying the entire tower with a storm cloud.  The protagonists return to the Golden City to find the One-Eyes' massive war machine approaching. Remembering the witch's riddle, Tack shoots a single tack into the enemy's midst, sparking a [[Rube Goldberg machine|Goldberg-esque]] chain reaction that destroys the entire One-Eye army. Zigzag tries to escape, but steps on the tack which leads to him falling into a pit where he is eaten alive by alligators and his fat lazy vulture, Phido. The thief, avoiding many deathtraps, steals the golden balls from the collapsing machine, only to have them taken from him by Tack. With peace restored and the prophecy fulfilled, the city celebrates as Tack and Yum-Yum marry. The film ends with the thief stealing the reel of film and running away.   ===Changes made in subsequent versions===  *'''''The Princess and the Cobbler''''' (1993, [[Allied Filmmakers]]) The Allied Filmmakers cut is drastically different from Williams's workprint. Four musical numbers have been added; the film originally had none. Many scenes have been cut: These primarily consist of scenes involving the thief, most notably his attempted theft of an emerald and his subsequent evasion of capital punishment for it (though many of these scenes appear in the credits), and the subplot wherein Zigzag tries to feed Tack to Phido. Also removed are any references to the maiden from Mombassa, whom Zigzag gives to King Nod as a "plaything" in the workprint. Tack, almost mute in the workprint, speaks several times and narrates most scenes in [[past tense]]; the workprint had narration only in the beginning by a voice-over. Some subplots have been added; in one, Yum-Yum is tired of living a life of "regal splendor", and wishes to prove her worth to her father. Another subplot sees the nurse initially disliking Tack, and scolding Yum-Yum for harboring romantic feelings for him, but warming to him later on.  *'''''Arabian Knight''''' (1995, Miramax) The Miramax cut includes all changes made in the Allied Filmmakers cut. In addition, several previously mute characters are given voices, most notably the thief, who narrates over all of his scenes in the form of an [[inner monologue]]. The Golden City is now referred to as [[Baghdad]]. Most scenes featuring the Mighty One-Eye's slave women in detail have been removed, although he can still be seen sitting on them. The sequence featuring the witch has been almost entirely removed, as is most of the climactic battle sequence, which had already been greatly shortened in the Allied cut. One-Eye's death is cut, though he can be heard crying: "My machine!" as the war machine burns, whereupon he presumably burns with it.  *'''''The Recobbled Cut''''' (2006, 2007, 2013) Garrett Gilchrist's fan restorations mostly follow Richard Williams's workprint very closely, at least in their intent, using most of its original audio track and editing structure. In order to present a more complete film, Gilchrist added additional music (some from the released versions) and sound effects, and also included finished footage that does not appear in a finished state in the workprint, whether taken from the released versions or from other rare sources. Most of the story changes made by Fred Calvert and Miramax are not present, but it does include a few minor Calvert-only scenes or alterations, either as a side effect of using Calvert's footage as replacements for unfinished scenes in the workprint or because Gilchrist felt these scenes were useful to the plot. For this reason, Gilchrist does not refer to his edit as a "Director's Cut."<ref name=ocpinterview2></ref>

To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar
 After tying for the win in New York City's "Drag Queen of the Year" contest, Noxeema Jackson ([[Wesley Snipes]]) and Vida Boheme ([[Patrick Swayze]]) win a trip to [[Hollywood]] to take part in the even bigger "Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant". Before they depart, Vida persuades Noxeema to take along the inexperienced "drag princess" Chi-Chi Rodriguez ([[John Leguizamo]]) as their protégé (they initially refer to him simply as a "boy in a dress" rather than as a fully-fledged drag queen). To do this, they trade in their airplane tickets for cash and buy a stylish but old [[Cadillac]] convertible with money given to them by John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt ([[Robin Williams]]). They set off for [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in it, carrying with them an iconic autographed photo of [[Julie Newmar]] (signed, ''"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"'') that Vida purloined from a restaurant wall.  While on the road they are pulled over by the [[racism|racist]], [[homophobia|homophobic]], and [[sexism|sexist]] Sheriff Dollard ([[Chris Penn]]), who tries to rape Vida. He discovers Vida is not a woman and, in the commotion, he falls backwards and is knocked unconscious. They think he is dead, hurry off, and leave him behind. As they recover from the incident at a rest stop, their car breaks down. Bobby Ray ([[Jason London]]), a young man from the nearby small town of Snydersville, happens to pass by and gives them a ride, where they take refuge in a bed and breakfast inn owned by Carol Ann ([[Stockard Channing]]) and her abusive car repairman husband, Virgil ([[Arliss Howard]]).  They become stranded in the town for the weekend as they wait for the replacement part for their car to arrive. Chi-Chi is harassed by a group of roughnecks, but is saved by Bobby Ray. While volunteering to help with the town's Strawberry Social, they decide its small band of women need a day with them, which consists of the following steps: get your hair done, pick out a new outfit, and then just sit in a cafe and talk.  While searching for the new outfits, they are ecstatic to find vintage fashions from the 1960s in the town's clothing store and give the female residents (and themselves) a make-over.  Following their makeover, they are abused by the same roughnecks that attempted to attack Chi-Chi. Fed up, Noxeema handles the situation in a typically New York City manner and teaches their ringleader a lesson in manners. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi do what they can to be positive, and they set out to improve the lives of the townspeople, including offering assistance in organizing the Strawberry Social.  Meanwhile, Sheriff Dollard is ridiculed by his colleagues, who believe he was beat up by a girl. He goes off in search of the drag queens.  Vida, in the meantime, becomes acutely aware of Carol Ann's abuse at the hands of Virgil and, shortly thereafter, they overhear him giving her another beating. Vida decides to intervene and beats him up before throwing him out of the house.  Carol Ann is able to repair their car, but they remain for the Strawberry Social. Carol Ann reveals to Vida that she knew she was a drag queen all along due to her [[Adam's apple]], which is less prominent in women.  Not too far away, Virgil runs into Sheriff Dollard at a bar and they realize that the newcomers are the same people Dollard has been searching for. They head back to Snydersville, and Dollard demands that the townspeople turn them over. The other townspeople, who now realize that their new friends are not women, begin to protect them. One by one they step up and confront Dollard, each one claiming to be a drag queen (in similar fashion to ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''). He is humiliated and flees. The Strawberry Social commences with everyone dressed in vibrant red outfits for it. The townfolk then say goodbye to their new friends as Noxeema, Vida and Chi-Chi prepare to leave. In honor of their friendship, Vida gives Carol Ann the autographed photo of Julie Newmar that has accompanied them on their trip.  They eventually make it to Los Angeles where Chi-Chi, after having received many tips from Vida and Noxeema during their ordeal, wins the title of Drag Queen of the Year. The crown is presented by [[Julie Newmar]] herself.

Chan starts at the back of the field, but muscles his way toward the front, despite a 30-second pit penalty and other distractions caused by Amy. He approaches and battles Cougar for the lead. During the final lap, both cars slide off the track into the gravel pit, facing each other as they struggle to get back on the road. Cougar gets out first, but Chan floors it in reverse before both cars cross the line in a [[photo finish]]. Chan wins the race during the spin back forward when his front end touches the finish line first. Cougar attempts to flee from the police, but Chan chases him around the circuit before sending him crashing violently off the track. Chan pulls Cougar out of the burning wreckage for the police to arrest him, and Cannon reveals that he and his team rescued Sai Mui. He then reconciles with Amy and kisses her.

Tom and Huck
 The movie opens with Injun Joe ([[Eric Schweig]]) accepting a job position from Doctor Jonas Robinson ([[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]]). Tom Sawyer ([[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]) is then seen running away from home. He and his friends ride down the [[Mississippi River]] on a raft, but hit a sharp rock, which throws Tom into the water. His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huck Finn ([[Brad Renfro]]) who carried him to safety. Huck learns of an unusual way to remove warts - by taking a dead cat to the graveyard at night. There they witness Injun Joe and Muff Potter ([[Mike McShane]]), the town drunk, digging up the grave of Vic "One-Eyed" Murrell for Doctor Robinson. A treasure map is discovered and when Doc tries to betray the two men, Injun Joe murders him with Muff's knife.  The next morning, Muff is charged for the murder.  Unfortunately, Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for Injun Joe's treasure map, so they can declare Muff innocent and still keep their oath. The only problem is, the map is in Injun Joe's pocket. After Injun Joe finds the last treasure, he burns the map, leaving no evidence to claim Muff innocent. Joe then discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder. However, at the time, the entire community believed that he was dead, and the friendship between Tom and Huck starts to decline because of the fact that their evidence (the map) to prove Muff innocent, while preserving their oath, is destroyed.  At Muff Potter's trial, Tom decides that his friendship with Muff is more important than his oath with Huck and tells the truth. The court finds Muff innocent of all charges and goes after Injun Joe. As a result, Injun Joe decides to hold up his end of the bargain by killing Tom. When Injun Joe returns to the tavern, he kills his accomplice Emmett ([[Lanny Flaherty]]) for cheating him. Huck becomes angry with Tom for breaking their oath and leaves town. During a festival the next day, a group of children, including Tom and his love interest Becky Thatcher ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), enter the caves, where Tom and Becky become lost. They eventually stumble upon Injun Joe (who was looking for Tom) in McDougal's Cave. He traps them, but Tom and Becky manage to escape. When they find the treasure, Tom tells Becky to go get her father and bring him back.  Just then, Injun Joe finds Tom, and again tries to kill him. But Huck returns to help save Tom, and battles Injun Joe. But Injun Joe easily overpowers Huck; just as he is about to kill him, Tom holds the treasure chest over a chasm. Injun Joe then tries to get the chest from Tom, only to fall into the chasm to his death (with the chest which was empty). The boys reconcile, and are declared heroes by the people. Tom is praised on the front page of the newspaper, and Widow Douglas ([[Marian Seldes]]) decides to adopt Huck Finn.  
Total Eclipse (film)
  The older [[Paul Verlaine]] meets [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s sister, Isabelle, in a café in [[Paris]]. Isabelle and her mother want Verlaine to hand over any copies he may still have of Rimbaud's poems so that they can burn them; they fear the lewdness of his writings. Verlaine reflects on the wild relationship he had had with Rimbaud, beginning when the teenaged Rimbaud had sent his poetry to Verlaine from his home in the provinces in 1871. Verlaine, instantly fascinated, impulsively invites him to his rich father-in-law's home in Paris, where he lives with his young, pregnant wife. The wild, eccentric Rimbaud displays no sense of manners or decency whatsoever, scandalising Verlaine's pretentious, [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in-laws.  Verlaine is seduced by the 16-year-old Rimbaud's physical body as well as by the unique originality of his mind. The staid respectability of married, [[heterosexual]] life and easy, [[middle class]] surroundings had been stifling Verlaine's admittedly [[sybaritic]] literary talent. His taking up with Rimbaud is as much a rebellion and a liberation as it is a giving in to self-indulgence and [[Sadomasochism|masochism]]. Rimbaud acts as [[Sadomasochism|sadistically]] to Verlaine as does Verlaine to his young wife, whom he eventually deserts. A violent, itinerant relationship ensues between the two poets, the sad climax of which arrives in [[Brussels]] when a drunken and enraged Verlaine shoots and wounds Rimbaud and is sentenced a fine and two years in prison for [[sodomy]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].  In prison, Verlaine converts to [[Christianity]], to his erstwhile lover's disgust. Upon release he meets Rimbaud in [[Germany]], vainly and mistakenly seeking to revive the relationship. The two men part, never to meet again. Bitterly renouncing literature in any form, Rimbaud travels the world alone, finally settling in Abyssinia (modern day [[Ethiopia]]) to run a "trading post". There he has a mistress and possibly a young boy-lover. A [[tumour]] in his right knee forces him back to France where his leg is amputated. Nevertheless, the [[cancer]] spreads and he dies at the age of 37. When he dies, the image of one of his most famous poems, ''Le Dormeur du val'', appears.  During her conversation with Verlaine, Isabelle Rimbaud asserts that her brother had accepted [[Confession (religion)|confession]] from a priest right before he died, showing Christian penitence, which is why only the censored versions of his poetry should survive. Verlaine pretends to agree but tears up her card after she leaves. Later, Verlaine, drinking [[absinthe]] (to which he has become addicted), sees a vision of the sixteen-year-old Rimbaud, returned from some transcendent realm to express the love and respect Verlaine has thus posthumously earned. The film ends with the young Rimbaud walking alone on a mountain range, Verlaine proclaiming that they were both happy together, and Rimbaud claiming to have finally found eternity.  
Tommy Boy
 After seven years at college, Thomas R. "Tommy" Callahan III ([[Chris Farley]]) barely graduates from [[Marquette University]] and returns to his hometown of [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. His father, industrialist and widower Thomas R. "Big Tom" Callahan, Jr. ([[Brian Dennehy]]), gives him an executive job at the family's auto parts plant, Callahan Auto. In addition to the new job and office, Big Tom reveals that he plans to marry Beverly Barrish-Burns ([[Bo Derek]]), a woman he had met at a [[fat farm]], and that her son Paul ([[Rob Lowe]]) will become Tommy's new stepbrother. At the wedding, Big Tom suddenly dies of a heart attack. After the funeral, doubting the future of the company without Big Tom, the bank reneges on promises of a loan for a new [[brake pad]] division and seeks immediate payment of Callahan Auto's debts. Ray Zalinsky ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), owner and operator of rival automotive parts company Zalinsky Auto Parts in [[Chicago]], offers to buy them out while the company's shares are high, but Tommy suggests a deal: he will let the bank hold his inherited shares and house in exchange for helping to sell the new brake pads. The bank agrees, but they also want the company to prove it still has viability by selling 500,000 brake pads. If they fail, the bank will foreclose, but if they succeed, the bank will underwrite Big Tom's brake pad venture. Tommy volunteers to go on a cross-country sales trip with his father's sycophantic assistant, Richard Hayden ([[David Spade]]), a childhood acquaintance who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Tommy.   Meanwhile, Beverly and Paul are shown kissing romantically, revealing that they are not mother and son, but rather married [[con artist]]s with criminal records. Paul thinks Big Tom's death is ideal, since their original plan was to eventually divorce Big Tom and take half of his estate, but Beverly thinks they are in trouble, as Big Tom only left her a controlling interest in Callahan Auto, which may evaporate. She authorizes the quick sale to Zalinsky to make a fast buck.  On the road, Tommy's [[social anxiety]] and [[hyperactivity]] alienate numerous potential buyers. The lack of any progress leads to tension between Tommy and Richard. Additionally, the duo encounters a variety of incidents that lead to the near destruction of Richard's car. When all seems lost, Tommy persuades a surly waitress to serve him [[buffalo wing|chicken wings]] after the kitchen closes. Richard realizes that Tommy has the ability to read people, just like his father, and suggests this is how he should sell. The two mend their friendship and start to sell effectively to numerous automotive plants, eventually putting them over the half million mark.  However, Paul sabotages the company's computers, causing sales posted by sales manager Michelle Brock ([[Julie Warner]]) to either be lost or rerouted. With half of the sales now canceled, the bank forecloses. Beverly and Paul approve the sale of Callahan Auto to Zalinsky. Hoping that they can persuade Zalinsky to reconsider, Tommy and Richard travel to Chicago, boarding a plane as [[flight attendant]]s. In Chicago, they get a brief meeting with Zalinsky, but he informs them he only wants Callahan for the [[brand name]], not the employees, and that after the sale he will dissolve the company, leaving the Sandusky workers destitute.  Tommy and Richard are denied entry to the Zalinsky boardroom since Tommy does not have any standing (his shares having been repossessed due to the apparent failure). After briefly wallowing on the curb in [[self-pity]], Michelle arrives with Paul and Beverly's police records. Tommy devises 'a plan': dressed as a [[suicide bomber]] by using [[flare|road flares]], he gains the attention of a live television news crew and then, with Michelle and Richard, forces his way into the boardroom. Back in Sandusky, Callahan workers watch the drama on a [[television]]. In a final move of pure persuasion, Tommy quotes Zalinsky's own advertising slogan, that he is on the side of the "American working man." As the TV audience watches, Zalinsky signs Tommy's purchase order for 500,000 brake pads. Although Zalinsky says that the purchase order is meaningless since he will soon own Callahan Auto, Michelle reveals the police records, which include Paul's [[Warrant (law)|outstanding warrants]] for [[fraud]]. Since Paul is the true husband of Beverly, her marriage to Big Tom was [[bigamy|bigamous]] and therefore illegitimate. Therefore, Beverly's inheritance is voided and Tommy is the next of kin, and thus the rightful heir of Big Tom. Since Tommy refuses to sell the shares, the deal with Zalinsky is off, and since Tommy still holds Zalinsky's purchase order, the company is saved. Paul attempts to escape but is arrested. Zalinsky admits that Tommy outplayed him and honors the large sales order. Later, Tommy assumes the presidency of Callahan Auto Parts, giving a speech to the employees that the door is always open to them and he will work hard to keep the company in the black to keep them employed. The film ends with Tommy drifting in his [[dinghy]] on a lake, telling his father's spirit he will continue his legacy at Callahan and says he must go ashore to have dinner with Michelle's family.

No sooner is he introduced around by Deputy Director Brigadier General Mike Rodgers ([[Carl Weathers]]) than he's in the middle of a crisis: a rogue [[KGB]] unit hijacks three [[Ukrain]]ian based nuclear warheads for sale to the [[Middle East]]. [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Admiral]]  Troy Davis (Brimley) orders Hood and the Op Center to locate the warheads, verify their location and prepare a viable recovery plan.  Hood is initially handicapped by ignorance and naivete; when told about a [[honeypot (computing)|honeytrap]], he asks: "Who are we working for: the United States government or the Mafia?" Nonetheless he quickly demonstrates ability to absorb new information and lead intelligently. The warheads are located and electronically confirmed aboard a KGB front-owned freighter sailing down the [[Bosphorus]], declared destination [[Mombasa]].  But top secret information is leaking to high powered Washington reporter Kate Michaels ([[Deidre Hall]]) and to the Israelis, whose Mossad representative Werkauf ([[Luis Avalos]]) threatens will take unilateral action if the US does not. Hood is further harassed when his unhappy wife Jane (Catrall), who doesn't like Washington or understand the seriousness of his job, leaves town. This gives Pamela Bluestone ([[Lindsay Frost]]), the Center's brilliant psychiatrist "mind-reader and Good Witch of the East," the opening to make a play for Hood.  Before any action can be taken the intelligence-leak must be pinpointed and plugged. To that end the Center plants a bogus intelligence report on Adm. Davis for [[White House]] consumption – only to confirm that the leak leads from the President ([[Ken Howard]]) to the Israelis via Kate Michaels, the President's mistress.  Hood and the Center reveal the deception to Adm. Davis and present the chain of evidence; Davis in turn forces the President to end his liaison with Michaels. Meanwhile, Hood, dispirited by Jane's departure, tries to resign, but Adm. Davis talks him out of it.  With their source blown, the Israelis give Hood the buyer's identity and his file: Abdul Fazawi ([[Kabir Bedi]]), former Mossad agent-turned-arms-dealer. Fazawi must be neutralized before the recovery operation begins, or he will disappear to set up another such deal.  Then wily rogue KGB Col. Stolipin ([[Sherman Howard]]) alters the ship's course towards [[Libya]], reducing the time-frame in which the recovery team, codenamed "Linebacker", can act. Hood sends Pamela Bluestone and Dan McCaskey ([[Bo Hopkins]]), deputy assistant [[FBI]] director and Center' crime/terrorism expert, to New York to arrest Fazawi, who must be in custody before "Linebacker" moves. But Fazawi is late to his rendezvous. When he does show up he is arrested but Werkauf shoots him dead, wounding McCaskey and another FBI agent before being shot dead himself. With hind-sight Bob Herbert ([[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]]), the Center's wheelchair bound Intelligence Officer (Beirut Embassy bombing, 1983), realizes that the Israelis used the Center to flush Fazawi into the open. Meanwhile, "Linebacker" has gone into action; following a short, hard fight they take control of ship, surviving crew and warheads, and disarming the scuttling charge.  At next day's press conference the President announces that contrary to 'irresponsible... unfounded reports', there are no stolen nuclear warheads: the US, Russia and Israel have just concluded a joint exercise ''simulating'' theft and recovery of dummy warheads, and to prove it he introduces the Russian and Israeli ambassadors to answer questions. When asked how she got the Russians and Israelis to cooperate Liz Gorman ([[Mia Korf]]), the Center's long suffering and resourceful Press and Congressional Liaison, replies: "I appealed to their sense of national interest... Well you know: blackmail."  Davis confirms Hood head of the Center for as long as he wants the job. Hood declines being interviewed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and heads home to his two preteen daughters, alone with the housekeeper while their mother is out of town. But when he opens the door his wife is waiting instead: Adm. Davis called Jane to explain why Paul has been so busy. As she takes him into her arms he hesitantly returns the embrace, a wary look on his face.  
Toy Story
  In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody]], organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green [[army men]], led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the results to the others via [[baby monitor]]s. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure, who thinks he is an actual space ranger.  Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares for a family outing at [[Pizza Planet]], his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toys rebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[Claw crane|crane game]], where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.  Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz, finally realizing he is a toy after watching a Buzz Lightyear TV ad, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant toy creations rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him, and he runs into his house screaming in horror. Woody and Buzz then leave Sid's house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.  The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's [[RC car]], but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back, and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy.  On [[Christmas Day]], at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. One of the toys tends to be “Mrs Potato Head” which surprises Mr Potato Head’s delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.

After being punished by his father for playing a trick on his new step-grandmother, San decides to run away from home. Tat ([[Ng Man-tat]]) is a middle-aged High School grounds keeper who has a crush on a blind floral girl ([[Athena Chu]]). He takes advantage of her blindness by pretending to be a rich man who often buys her flowers only to give it back to her as a gift. One day while at the park, Tat is hit with a bat by a women chasing San for stealing candy from a baby. To retaliate, Tat uses the bat to throw at the women but hits a police officer instead. Both Tat and San fled from the officer and were forced to get familiar with each other to rid the officer. San decides to follow Tat after their run-in with the police officer and though Tat tries to get rid of him, San persists to following him home and even to the high school where he works.  At the high school where Tat works at, Mo ([[Takeshi Kaneshiro]]) is the popular school boy who has a crush on Ah Jane ([[Chen Yu (Actress)|Chen Yu]]) and often attempts to get her attention through immature means only to be ignored by her. However, Mo and Jane are in the same class, class 5D, which also happens to be the infamous class full of misfits that Mo is the leader of. The misfits often pull dangerous pranks to scare off teachers. A new teacher arrives, but he falls into the pranks, causing him to pass out, and having to be carried out of the school in an ambulance. San sits outside of Tat's door that night in the rain until Tat decided to take him in, which he finally decides to care for him temporarily. Tat takes San out to the city the next day to do various jobs, even resorting to conning others, to earn some money so that Tat can continue to buy flowers from the blind girl again. He learns that surgery costing HKD 500,000 is required in order for her to see, which she works effortlessly to sell her flowers.  Seeing how class 5D has gone through eight teachers already since the school year started, the school advertises in hiring another teacher while the deaf headmaster  decides to personally teach the class temporarily. He gives them a pop quiz, threatening to expel anyone who fails the quiz. This prompted the class to cheat in which ever way they can to cheat while keeping him blinded and deaf. When this fails, the school decides to offer HKD $500,000 salary to anyone who is able to handle class 5D. Though San encourages Tat to take the job, Tat refuses due to class 5D's reputation with former teachers. San offers the solution of introducing him to someone who can teach him martial arts, but Tat is still skeptical. After school, Jen is being harassed by a biker; Mo jumps into the fight only to get beaten instead and then humiliated. After this event, Mo starts to lose respect from other students. Though Jane continues to ignore him, she acknowledges what he had done for her, after which he spontaneously tells her that he was Bruce Lee in his past life.  That same night, San brings a monk apprentice to personally meet Tat, but Tat shrugs him off, thinking he was a homeless man instead. The monk apprentice then flies away, in which Tat was amazed and finally decided to pursue martial arts. The Head monk then takes him as an apprentice after his persistent presence at the temple's entrance. Through vigorous and somewhat foolish training, the Head monk decides both San and Tat are ready for hypnotism but decides to graduate the two even though the training was insufficient and incomplete.  Tat takes on as the instructor of class 5D and counters all the pranks previously used on the last teacher. The next few days, Tat trains the student similar to boot camp using very severe methods to get the students to study to retake the quiz. Tat then goes to visit the blind girl and offers to pay for the surgery to fix her eyes. One night, Mo tries to convince Tat to hypnotize him to his past life but Tat refuses. Mo continues to be shamed by the biker, who is very persistent in asking Jane out on a date. When Jane continually refuses, he threatens to beat Mo until she changes her answer. When Tat stops the fight, Mo again persuades Tat to hypnotize him, which he then turns into Bruce Lee and finally defeats the biker. Although Jane and Mo ends being closer, Tat is fired from his teaching position by aiding in the fight and he loses the bonus to help the blind girl in her surgery.  Seeing Tat sulking, San and Tat goes to San's previous home at night to get the money. He goes to his father's safe in the bedroom but paused to cry over him. When his father wakes up, San had no choice but to toss the money to Tat and Tat leaves San behind. After giving the stolen money to the blind girl, Tat returns to confess his crimes to San's father and promises to pay them back. Even though he was offered to stay with San, he refuses and takes on various jobs working as an honest homeless man. He happens upon the blind girl's floral shop, but she does not recognize Tat because of his refusal to speak. When he finally speaks, the blind girl is shocked to see his state of living. When her husband approaches them, Tat leaves them. Tat is reunited with San when he ran away from home again.  
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory
 Casey Ryback retires from the [[United States Navy]] and settles in [[Denver, Colorado]], owning and running a restaurant named Mile High Cafe, where he is also an executive chef. Sometime after, his estranged brother, James Ryback, dies in a plane crash. Casey meets James' daughter, Sarah, whom he will accompany to [[Los Angeles]] to attend his funeral. The two board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Onboard, they befriend a porter named Bobby Zachs and the train's chefs.  As the train approaches the [[Rocky Mountains]], it is hijacked by armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker Travis Dane and his right-hand man and mercenary leader Marcus Penn. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane due to his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide.  The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former [[US Department of Defense]] colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley. During the course of events, Zachs becomes Casey's sidekick.  Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane $1 billion to destroy the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located underneath [[the Pentagon]]. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional $100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife.  The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead. As long as the train keeps moving, his location cannot be determined. However, Casey faxes a message to his assistant manager at the Mile High Cafe, who contacts Admiral Bates. Bates reluctantly approves a stealth bomber strike to destroy the train.  Zachs discovers that they are on the wrong tracks and on a [[collision course]] with a [[Southern Pacific]] freight train hauling gasoline tank cars. Since the trains are in [[dark territory]], it was impossible for the [[train dispatcher]]s to communicate with the [[railroad engineer|trains' engineers]] to stop the trains to avoid collision. Dane and Penn plan to abandon most of the mercenaries to certain death with the hostages by leaving via helicopter with some of their elite members.  Casey kills the mercenaries one by one and releases the hostages by uncoupling the last two cars, but Dane uses his computer skills to locate the stealth bombers and re-targets Grazer to knock them out before they can complete their mission. Meanwhile, Penn had previously captured Sarah and uses her as bait for Casey. Casey confronts Penn and breaks his neck after a fight that spills into the kitchen.  Casey finds Dane about to depart in a chopper hovering over the train. When Dane informs Casey that there is no way to stop Grazer from destroying Washington, Casey shoots him. The bullet destroys Dane's computer, cellphone and injures Dane. Pentagon control of the satellite is restored and it is destroyed by remote control one second before it would have fired on the Pentagon.  The Grand Continental and freight train collide on a trestle. Casey races through the exploding train and grabs a rope ladder dangling from the chopper. Dane, who has survived Casey's bullet, catches on to the ladder. He attempts to climb into the helicopter but falls to his death when Casey shuts the helicopter door on his hands. The explosion causes the helicopter to spin out of control, but the pilot regains control.  The only survivors of the incident are Casey, his niece Sarah, the porter Zachs, and the mercenary helicopter pilot (who Zachs has at gunpoint). Casey, having previously detached the last two cars from the rest of the train, informs the Pentagon that the passengers are safe. Later, Sarah and Casey pay their last respects at James' grave.  
Underground (1995 film)
 In the early morning of 6 April 1941 in [[Belgrade]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], two roguish ''[[bon vivant]]s'' Petar Popara, nicknamed Crni (Blacky) and Marko Dren are heading home. They pass through [[Kalemegdan]] and shout salutes to Marko's brother Ivan who's an animal keeper in the [[Belgrade Zoo]]. Marko lets Blacky's pregnant wife Vera know that they enrolled Blacky in the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] (KPJ).  ===Part One: War=== Later, the hungover Blacky is eating breakfast while pregnant Vera complains about his supposed affair with a theatre actress. Suddenly, the roar of the planes is heard, and [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II#German bombing|Nazi bombs begin falling on Belgrade]]. After the air raid is over, Blacky goes out against the wishes of his wife and inspects the devastated city. Encountering building ruins and escaped wild animals from the zoo, he also runs into disconsolate Ivan carrying a baby chimp named Soni. The [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]'s resistance is quickly broken, and Nazis soon occupy and dismember the entire Kingdom. Blacky starts operating clandestinely as a communist activist along with Marko and others. Blacky occasionally visits his mistress Natalija Zovkov who's been assigned to a special actors' labour brigade that's helping the city's rebuilding effort under German occupational control. An acclaimed, pampered, and celebrated actress in the [[National Theatre in Belgrade|National Theatre]], Natalija has caught the eye of a high-ranking German officer named Franz.  Marko has set up weapons storage and hideaway spot in the cellar of his grandfather's house. Following their interception of a large trainload of weapons, Marko and Blacky are identified as dangerous bandits in Nazi radio bulletins. While Blacky is off hiding in the woods as Germans are intensifying door-to-door raids in the city, Marko takes Vera, Ivan and many others into the cellar to hide. Vera is due and gives birth to a baby boy, who she names Jovan before dying.  In 1944, and Blacky is in town to celebrate his son's birthday at a local communist hangout. The two best friends head for the theatre in a jovial mood. They see Natalija performing on stage in front of Franz and other German officers, and Blacky shoots Franz in the chest. With Natalija, Blacky manages to reach the river boat anchored just outside Belgrade. Naturally, Marko is along as well, and all are getting ready for a [[forced marriage|forced wedding]] despite Natalija's protestations.   The party is interrupted by German soldiers surrounding the anchored boat. Suddenly, Franz is seen yelling, demanding Blacky and Marko release Natalija, who runs to Franz. Blacky is captured by Germans and tortured in the city hospital with electric shocks while Franz and Natalija visit her brother Bata at the same hospital. Meanwhile, Marko has found a way to enter the building through an underground sewer passage. Sneaking up on Franz, Marko strangles him to death with a cord in front of Natalija who switches sides once again. Marko then proceeds to free Blacky. They leave with fatigued Blacky hidden in a suitcase, but Blacky is injured by a grenade.  A few days later on Easter 1944, Marko and Natalija, now a couple, are watching a comatose Blacky. In late October, the [[Red Army]] accompanied by Yugoslav Partisans enters Belgrade. Marko gives fiery speeches from the National Theater balcony during the [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste crisis]], socializes with [[Josip Broz Tito]], Ranković and [[Edvard Kardelj]] and he stands next to Tito during military parades through downtown Belgrade.  ===Part Two: Cold War=== In 1961, Marko is one of Tito's closest associates and advisors. The physically recovered Blacky and company are still in the cellar under the impression that the War is still going on above. Marko and Natalija attend a ceremony to open a cultural center and unveil a statue of Petar Popara Blacky, who everyone thinks died, becoming a [[Order of the National Hero|People's Hero]]. With the help of his grandfather who is in on the devious con, Marko oversees the weapons manufacturing and even controls time by adding hours to a day so the people in the cellar think that only 15 years passed since the beginning of World War II instead of 20. They're continuously making weapons, and Marko profits from it enormously.  The filming of an epic state-sponsored motion picture based on Marko's memoirs titled ''Proleće stiže na belom konju'' (''Spring Comes On A White Horse'') begins above ground. Soon, Blacky's 20-year-old son Jovan is getting married to Jelena, a girl he grew up with in the cellar. Marko and Natalija are naturally invited for a celebration. Ivan's chimpanzee Soni has wandered into a tank and fires a round blowing a hole in the wall. Soni wanders off, and Ivan follows.  Blacky, with his son Jovan, emerges from underground for the first time in decades. They encounter the set of ''Spring Comes On A White Horse'' and believing the war is still on, kill two extras and the actor playing Franz. In the manhunt, Jovan drowns but Blacky escapes.  === Part Three: War === In 1992 at the height of the [[Yugoslav Wars]], Ivan re-emerges with Soni, whom he was recently reunited with. He stumbles upon Marko, who is attempting to broker an arms deal in the middle of a conflict zone. The deal falls through and Ivan catches up with and Marko beats him to unconsciousness, then commits suicide. Natalija arrives and rushes to Marko's side, proclaiming her love for him. They are captured by militants and they are ordered to be executed as arms dealers by militants' commander, Blacky.  Blacky moves his people out to the cellar that he lived years ago, taking Soni with him. He sees an image of Jovan in a well, and inadvertently falls in while reaching for him.  In a dreamlike ending sequence, Blacky, Marco, and others are reunited at an outside dinner party, celebrating Jovan's wedding. Ivan gives a few parting words, ending with "Once upon a time, there was a country."   
Ulysses' Gaze
 Successful Greek filmmaker, A (Harvey Keitel), is returning home and sets out on an epic journey across the battered [[Balkans]] in search of three lost reels of film by the [[Manaki brothers]], the pioneering photographers who introduced movies into the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Balkans]] at the beginning of the 20th century.  The search for the reels of film works as a metaphor for a search for the common history of the Balkan countries, before the [[Balkan Wars]] split them along ethnic lines.  The film ends in Sarajevo, where A finds both the lost reels and his true love (Maia Morgensten), who is executed by a death squad. The director laments both the lost love and the impossibility of building a new solidarity in the Balkans.  The filming took place in [[Florina]] and [[Lavrion]], [[Greece]].  
Two Much
  Art Dodge (Antonio Banderas), a former artist, is struggling to make ends meet with his art gallery, ignoring bills and delaying to pay his assistant Gloria (Joan Cusack) and his artist Manny (Gabino Diego). To survive, he is reading the obituaries and trying to convince the widows that the deceased purchased a painting shortly before dying.  Things take an ugly turn when Art is trying this scam with mobster Gene (Danny Aiello) whose father just died. Not only does Gene not fall for it, but he tries to have his henchmen beat Art up. Art barely escapes by hiding in the Rolls Royce of Betty Kerner (Melanie Griffith), Gene's estranged two-time ex-wife and wealthy heiress. Betty is excited about helping the handsome stranger, and the two end up shortly thereafter making love. Betty being very impulsive, she wants to marry Art in two weeks. Because of the heiress fortune the news immediately makes the tabloids. Stuck between Betty who won't change her mind and Gene who still loves his ex-wife, Art doesn't like the idea of getting married with such short notice but decides to play along for now.  One morning, at Betty's mansion, Art seductively enters her shower naked, only to realize it's not Betty who's in there but her sister Liz (Daryl Hannah), an art professor. If Art is attracted to Liz, she stays very cold and distant, seeing him as nothing more than a gigolo who hit the jackpot. Art decides to invent a fake twin brother Bart (who wears glasses and has his hair down instead of wearing a ponytail) who is allegedly a painter who just got back from Italy. Bart and Liz instantly hit it off while Gene still tries to romance Betty. Bart and Liz can't stop talking about everything, he plays with her dog and even invites her to Manny's studio when he's not in, pretending to show her his art. When Liz's favorite painting in the studio turns out to have been actually made by Art (who gave it to Manny as an "advance" on what he owes him), Bart gives her the painting.  Thanks to his imaginary twin brother, Art manages to pursue a romance with both sisters. Because the two "twin brothers" must never be in the same place at the same time, it however involves a lot of running around, coming up with a lot of excuses and enlisting a very reluctant Gloria's help. One evening he needs to go out two separate dates with both Betty and Liz. At the restaurant with Betty, he decides to drug her wine, much to the horror of the sommelier (Vincent Schiavelli). This allows him to cut the date short and put a very sleepy Betty to bed. He then goes out with Liz (who chooses the very same restaurant) and ends up making love to her. The next morning, Art/Bart has to run back and forth between the two sister's bedrooms (whose two bathrooms share a private swimming pool) as he's supposed to be with them both at the same time.  In the evening before the wedding, Art spots Gene's two henchmen around his house and manages to escape them thanks to his dad's help (Eli Wallach). He tries to spend the night at Gloria's but he discovers she started dating Manny. Manny however gives him the keys to his studio where he can spend the night. At the studio, Art starts to paint again when he is interrupted by Gene's henchmen who found him and start beating him up, before Gene shows up. When Art proposes Gene to leave town, Gene tells him to go ahead with the wedding and threatens to break one bone for each tear Betty cries. After they leave, Liz arrives to the studio, thinking Bart got beat up. When Bart tells her he is Art, that he fell in love when he saw her in the shower and tries to kiss her, Liz thinks Art is trying to make a pass at her, not realizing Bart doesn't exist.  On the wedding day, Liz tells Bart his "brother" tried to kiss her, and that the wedding should be called off. Bart needs to "confront" Art in a study alone, with Liz and Gene listening outside -and, unbeknownst to anyone, also by Betty through the phone. When Gene enters the study, he confronts a lonely Art, and again threatens him if he doesn't marry Betty. He tells him that what Art or even himself want is irrelevant, and that the only thing that matters is Betty's happiness. During the wedding ceremony, Betty, shaken by Gene's selfless devotion, calls the wedding off and falls in Gene's arms acknowledging she still love him too. Gene and Betty elope. In the general confusion, Liz sees her dog wanting to play with Art and realizes Art and Bart are the same person. Bart then go see Liz, telling her a fake excuse to "go back to Italy" (which she of course doesn't buy), adding he's not worthy of her.  A few month later, Art's gallery has experienced a dramatic turnaround (Gloria owns and manages it, and Art is the artist) and is now very successful. At the inauguration of his work, Art notices Liz who still has feeling for him but is not sure who he is really. Art manages to convince her he is the one she had feelings for, and the movie ends with the two happily walking in the street, hand in hand.

In the flashback, set six weeks earlier in New York, Verbal and the other four criminals are arrested on a trumped-up truck hijacking charge, and decide to pull a real heist that will get back at the police. Led by Keaton, a former corrupt policeman, they rob a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops, netting millions in emeralds and getting fifty cops arrested. They then go to California to fence the jewels with a criminal named Redfoot, who turns them on to another jewel heist. The heist turns out to be heroin, and the five end up in a deadly (for their three targets) shootout. They learn the heist was actually arranged by a British lawyer named Kobayashi. They meet Kobayashi, who tells them that [[Keyser Söze]], a Turkish crime lord with a legendary reputation from whom all of the thieves have unwittingly stolen, has offered them a job: invade a ship manned by a gang of Argentinian drug dealers with whom Söze is competing and destroy $91 million worth of cocaine onboard.  FBI agent Jack Baer informs Kujan that there was never any cocaine on the ship, and fills him in on Söze's involvement. When Kujan questions him, Verbal tells Kujan a story about Söze: that he had murdered his own family when they were being held hostage by members of a gang of Hungarian criminals, establishing his ruthlessness. He later kills many of the Hungarians, then massacres their families, friends and even people who owed them money. He then went underground, never to be seen again, and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working. He became a fearsome [[urban legend]], "a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night".  After Fenster runs out on the group, Kobayashi gives them a location at which they find Fenster’s corpse. They try to kill Kobayashi, but he strong-arms them into attacking the ship by threatening their loved ones. They stake out the ship and kill several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters, then discover there is no cocaine. McManus, Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship are killed by an unseen person, who also kills Keaton and sets the ship on fire as Verbal looks on from a hiding place on the dock.  Verbal concludes his story, but Kujan does not believe it. He insists that Keaton must be Söze, as the murder victim locked on the boat was Arturo Marquez, a drug dealer who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify Söze — and who was represented by Edie Finneran, Keaton's lawyer and girlfriend. Kujan claims that the Argentinians were selling Marquez to Söze's Hungarian rivals and Keaton used the heist as a distraction to allow him to kill Marquez. Kujan also informs Verbal that Finneran has been murdered. Verbal says that the entire plan was Keaton's idea, but refuses to testify in court. Verbal's bond is posted and he is released.  Moments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal's entire story was a lie, pieced together from details on a crowded bulletin board in the office - prominently, the name "Redfoot" appears on an alias list, and an inscription reading "Kobayashi Porcelain" appears on the bottom of Kujan's coffee cup. Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually dropping his limp and flexing his supposedly withered hand. As Kujan runs after Verbal, Baer looks at a fax that comes in from the hospital where Kovash is being treated for his burns: a police sketch artist's rendering of Söze, dictated by Kovash, that looks exactly like Verbal. He disappears into a car driven by "Kobayashi".

Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a vampire who arrived on the ship, intervenes and kills them. Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, thereby turning Julius into a decaying ghoul, and explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon.  This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, investigate the murders on the ship, Rita begins having visions about a woman who looks like her, and starts asking questions about her mother's past. Rita is completely unaware of her vampire heritage, and believes she is losing her mind like her mother.  Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to pull Rita into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki, making her jealous and angry with him. After saving Rita from being run down by a taxicab, Maximillian takes her to dinner. Rita is taken with Maximillian's suave charm, and while dancing with her, he bites her.  The next day, Justice finds Rita in her apartment, having slept all day with it completely darkened. Justice informs Rita about Nikki's murder, and vows to help understand her visions, as one correctly foretold Nikki's fate. Rita forgives Justice, but she almost bites him in the neck during a passionate kiss before catching her disappearing reflection in a mirror, and realizes she is becoming a vampire. She confronts Max about the changes occurring in her, and deduces he is also responsible for the murders she and Justice are investigating. Rita further finds out that Maximillian was sent to her by her father; his death at the hands of vampire hunters was what drove Rita's mother insane.  Max tries to convince Rita that she will be happier as a vampire instead of remaining in the human world, where he feels she will remain out of place and misunderstood by society. Justice plans to rescue Rita from Max, and seeks advice from Dr. Zeko, a vampire expert they visited earlier in the murder investigation. Zeko explains that he knew Rita's mother while she did her research on the vampires of the Caribbean islands, and she surrendered to evil by falling in love with Rita's father. To avoid becoming a vampire, Rita must refrain from drinking the blood of an innocent human victim; also, Maximillian must die before the next full moon. Zeko gives Justice an ancient dagger with instructions to either kill Maximillian or risk being killed by Rita.  When Justice reaches her, Rita is lying inside Max's coffin, almost completely changed into a vampire, and threatens to bite Justice. Justice and Maximillian fight, during which Justice loses Zeko's dagger on the floor. Maximillian encourages Rita to kill Justice and complete the transformation, but she rejects life as a vampire and drives the dagger through Maximillian's heart, causing him to disintegrate. Rita and Justice then embrace with a passionate kiss.  Meanwhile, Julius, now completely decayed, enters his master's limousine. He finds Maximillian's ring and puts it on, instantly transforming him into a fully intact member of the undead. Overjoyed, he tells Silas, "There's a new vampire in Brooklyn, and his name is Julius Jones!".

The children display eerie [[Psychic ability|psychic abilities]] that can result in violent and deadly consequences whenever they experience pain or provocation.   The children soon "pair off", except for one of the boys, David, whose intended [[Mating|partner]] was the stillborn girl. As a result of this imbalance, David is the [[runt]] of the group.  Although he resembles the other children and retains some degree of psychic power, David is smaller, and is unlike the rest of the children in that he has a capacity for human emotion, and compassion.  He and his mother Jill McGowan (the local school teacher) share a brief conversation about this, displaying empathy and remorse.  The children's leader is Mara, the daughter of a local physician, Dr. Alan Chaffee.  Even as a baby, Mara exhibited vengeful tendencies with regard to the use of her abilities, using her mind to force her mother to boil her arm in hot soup and commit suicide by jumping off the cliff.  The children, who are by now known to have a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], eventually move to the local barn as their classroom and for survival.   Soon it is learned that there are other colonies of blackout children in foreign countries, but due to their inhuman nature they were quickly eliminated, in some cases at the cost of destroying the entire town. The scientific team in Midwich quickly flee the town to escape the growing chaos. Government scientist, Dr. Susan Verner, is forced to show the children the preserved stillborn baby she secretly kept to study, and the preserved corpse is seen to be undeniably alien. The children collectively force her to fatally stab herself. An angry mob gathers to kill the children, but the leader is forced to set herself on fire and burns to death, and later the state police are mentally controlled into shooting each other in a chaotic gun battle.   In order to rid the town of the children, Alan devises a plan: to detonate a briefcase of timed explosives inside the children's classroom. By thinking of a brick wall, he is able to create a mental barrier and keep the presence of the time-bomb a secret from the children. Jill begs him to spare David because he is not like the others. Alan attempts to do this by asking David to leave the classroom to get his notebook from his car. The children begin to suspect that Alan is hiding something, and they slowly "destroy" the wall. Finally, Jill shows up, but the children stop her and attempt to use mind control. David, tired of this, rushes to her defense and knocks Mara over. The children turn on David, but Jill rushes him from the building. As soon as the children discover that Alan is hiding his knowledge of the bomb, it detonates in an enormous explosion, killing Alan and the eight alien children.  Jill and David, however, are safe in a car fleeing the site; she says that they will both move to a place where nobody knows them. David looks off into the distance as they drive away.

Waterworld
 Long after the melting of the polar ice caps in the 21st century, the sea levels have covered every continent on Earth. The remains of human civilization live on ramshackle floating communities known as [[atolls]], having long forgotten about living on land. People believe that there should be a mythological "Dryland" somewhere in the endless ocean.  The Mariner ([[Kevin Costner]]), a lone drifter, arrives on his [[trimaran]] to trade [[soil|dirt]], a rare commodity, for other supplies. The atoll's residents see that the Mariner is a mutant with gills and webbed feet and decide to drown him in the atoll's recycling pit—a kind of liquid compost facility. Just then, the atoll is attacked by the Smokers, a gang of pirates seeking a girl named Enola ([[Tina Majorino]]) who, according to their leader the Deacon ([[Dennis Hopper]]), has a map to Dryland tattooed on her back. Enola's guardian, Helen ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), attempts to escape with Enola on a [[gas balloon]] with Gregor ([[Michael Jeter]]), an inventor, but the balloon is released too early. Helen instead rescues the Mariner and insists that he take the two of them with him.  The three escape to open sea aboard the trimaran. They are pursued by the Smokers, and, though they escape, Helen's naïve actions result in damage to the Mariner's boat and he angrily cuts her hair, followed by Enola's hair for talking back at him. Helen explains that she believes humans once lived on land and demands to know where the Mariner collected his dirt. He provides her with a [[diving bell]] and dives with her underwater, showing the remains of a city and the dirt on the ocean's floor, affirming Helen's belief. When they surface, they find that the Smokers have caught up to them, threatening to kill them if they do not reveal Enola, who is hiding aboard the boat. The Mariner takes Helen, and they dive underwater to avoid capture, with the gilled Mariner helping Helen to breathe. When they surface, they find that Enola has been abducted and the boat destroyed. Gregor manages to catch up to and rescue them, taking them to a new makeshift atoll inhabited by the survivors of the first attack.  The Mariner takes a captured Smoker's [[jet ski]] to chase down the Deacon aboard the [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] of the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]''. With most of the Smokers below deck to row the tanker, the Mariner confronts the Deacon, threatening to ignite the reserves of oil still on the tanker unless he returns Enola. The Deacon calls the Mariner's bluff, knowing that would destroy the ship, but, to his surprise, the Mariner drops a [[flare]] into the oil. The lower decks of the ship are engulfed in flame, and the ship starts to sink. The Mariner rescues Enola and escapes via a rope from Gregor's balloon with Helen and the Atoll Enforcer aboard. As the Mariner brings Enola to Helen, the Deacon manages to grab the rope to escape the sinking ship. He fires upon the balloon, shaking Enola from the balloon and falling back into the ocean where he quickly rejoins his men on jet skis to capture her. The Mariner makes an impromptu [[bungee jump]] from the balloon to grab Enola right before the Deacon and his men collide and die in the explosion.  Sometime later, Gregor has been able to identify the tattoo on Enola's back as coordinates with reversed directions. Following the map, Gregor, the Mariner, the Atoll Enforcer, Helen, and Enola discover Dryland, the top of [[Mount Everest]], filled with vegetation and wildlife. They also find a crude hut with the remains of Enola's parents. Realizing he does not belong on Dryland, the Mariner decides that he cannot stay as the sea calls to him. He finds a new wooden sailboat and departs as Helen and Enola bid their goodbyes to him.

However, Paul remembers one plant that may still have its roots intact, races off to retrieve them, and bring them back to the family. The disaster (as well as Paul's bravery and dedication during it) has brought Alberto to realize his errors, so when Paul returns with the plant, Alberto accepts him, telling him that this is "his family" and "his roots". They set out to replant and rebuild with the help of their newest member.

She has a secret crush on a handsome commuter named Peter Callaghan ([[Peter Gallagher]]), although they are complete strangers. On [[Christmas]] Day, she rescues him from the oncoming [[Chicago "L"]] train after a group of muggers push him onto the tracks. He falls into a coma, and she accompanies him to the hospital, where a nurse overhears her musing aloud, "I was going to marry him." Misinterpreting her, the nurse tells his family that she is his fiancée.  At first she is too caught up in the panic to explain the truth. She winds up keeping the secret for a number of reasons: she is embarrassed, Peter's grandmother Elsie ([[Glynis Johns]]) has a heart condition, and Lucy quickly comes to love being a part of Peter's big, loving family. One night, thinking she is alone while visiting Peter, she confesses about her predicament. Peter's godfather, Saul ([[Jack Warden]]), overhears the truth and later confronts her, but tells her he will keep her secret, because the accident has brought the family closer.

When Jack visits her the day before the wedding, she gives him a chance to change her mind, asking him if he can give her a reason not to marry Peter. He replies that he cannot, leaving her disappointed.  On the day of the wedding, just as the priest begins the ceremony, Lucy finally confesses everything and tells the family she loves Jack rather than Peter. At this point, Peter's real fiancée Ashley Bartlett Bacon ([[Ally Walker]]), who happens to be married herself, arrives and also demands the wedding be stopped. As the family argues, Lucy slips out unnoticed, unsure of her future.  Some time later, while Lucy is at work, Jack places an engagement ring in the token tray of her booth. She lets him into the booth, and with the entire Callaghan family watching, he proposes to her. In the last scenes of the film, they kiss at the end of their wedding, then leave on a CTA train for their honeymoon. She narrates that he fulfilled her dream of going to [[Florence|Florence, Italy]], and explains that, when Peter asked when she fell in love with Jack, she replied, "it was while you were sleeping."  
Welcome to the Dollhouse
 Eleven-and-a-half-year-old Dawn Wiener is a shy, unattractive, unpopular seventh grader living in a middle-class suburban community in [[New Jersey]]. Her seventeen-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, eight-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate sixth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard.  At school, Dawn is ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with [[rape]] by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her. Dawn gets in trouble at school after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field.  He starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her.  Mark's band is joined by Steve Rodgers, a charismatic and handsome aspiring teenage rock musician who agrees to play in the band in exchange for Mark's help in school. Dawn decides to pursue him romantically after he spends time with her, even though one of Steve's former girlfriends tells Dawn she has no chance of being with him.  Dawn and Brandon form an innocent romance, but Brandon is arrested and expelled for suspected drug dealing. Dawn visits his home and meets his father and mentally challenged brother who requires constant supervision. After kissing Dawn, Brandon runs away to avoid being sent to military school.  After angrily rejecting Ralphy, Dawn is left with no friends. When she refuses to tear down her clubhouse to make room for her parents' 20th wedding anniversary party, her mother has Mark and Missy destroy it and gives them her share of a cake. At the party, Dawn intends to proposition Steve, but gets cold feet and is contemptuously rebuffed. Steve plays with Missy, who pushes Dawn into a kiddie pool.

After a full day searching for Missy, Dawn phones home and Mark tells her that Missy was found by police after being abducted by a [[pedophile]] neighbor who lives on their street. Dawn returns home. Later, Dawn's classmates ridicule her as she presents a thank you speech. After the principal tells the unruly students to be quiet, Dawn musters the emotional strength to finish her speech and makes a quick exit.  Summer arrives and Dawn is relieved that school is over for the time-being. Mark tells Dawn that she cannot expect school life to get any better until she starts high school. As Dawn's parents continue mistreating and ignoring her, Dawn signs herself up to attend a summer camp in Florida. On a school trip to [[Walt Disney World]], Dawn sits among other girls from her school and joins them in singing the school anthem. Unnoticed, her voice slowly trails off as she sits looking out a bus window.

 Camille Baker ([[Pascale Bussières]]) is a university literature professor at a religious college in a long-term relationship with fellow professor Martin ([[Henry Czerny]]). When her dog runs away and she finds him dead on the street, she ends up crying in the middle of the laundry mat where she is approached by Petra ([[Rachael Crawford]]), who comforts her. Later on Camille realizes that her laundry was mixed up with Petra's and finds a business card inside the laundry bag. Going to return Petra's clothes she finds that Petra is a circus performer, and when she goes to Petra's trailer to retrieve her clothes Petra tells her that she would like to sleep with her. Confused and uncomfortable, Camille grabs her clothes and leaves. Petra later tracks Camille down and shoots an arrow through her window with a picture of herself and her phone number attached. Camille invites Petra inside and ends up kissing her before running away.  Camille and Martin are being groomed to take over for the university chaplain, with the chaplain hinting heavily that they must marry in order to be promoted. At the interview Camille refuses to denounce homosexuality as a sin, and when asked what she would do if a male student came to her for advice on being attracted to another man, Camille cannot answer the question. Martin believes that Camille is acting unusual on purpose because of her discomfort over their future marriage, and embraces her. They are seen by Petra, who was waiting outside Camille's office. Afterwards Camille goes to see Petra, ostensibly to ask Petra to stop following her, but instead ends up asking her to become her friend after telling her that the kiss was a mistake.  Petra takes Camille hang-gliding, and though Camille is initially reluctant to participate, Petra urges her onward by telling her that night is falling and they will miss their chance if they don't hurry. While hang gliding Camille ends up injuring her knee. Petra takes her home and then massages her, with the massage quickly turning sexual as Petra unbuttons her blouse and takes off Camille's bra. They are interrupted by the university chaplain ([[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]]) visiting Camille. Camille passes Petra off as an acquaintance, and when she refuses to leave, excuses her to the chaplain by saying she is a disturbed street kid. Petra leaves in anger and Camille goes to Martin's house, where she has sex with him. However, when Martin leaves to go to a conference, Camille cannot stop herself from fantasizing about Petra and goes to the circus to see her, where the two have sex.  Camille goes to the chaplain seeking guidance, and he is more understanding than she anticipated. She goes to the circus where Petra and the rest of the performers are celebrating an invitation to Circumstance, a festival for Circus performers. She and Petra begin a relationship and they discuss the possibility of Camille joining Petra in the circus. Meanwhile, Martin, who has returned from his trip, waits for Camille in her home and finds the picture of Petra with her number written on it. He goes to the circus and sees Camille and Petra naked in the trailer. After Camille leaves without seeing him he introduces himself to Petra and then leaves, but not before hitting the outside of her trailer in anger, scaring Petra.  Camille meanwhile heads home to break up with Martin, and is surprised to find him already there. He urges her to think before she speaks, telling her that they have a good relationship and suggesting that her passion for Petra will fade. Thinking things over, Camille heads into the woods to finally bury her dead dog, whom she had kept in the fridge until that point. After burying the dog, she begins drinking and passes out in a snowbank. She is found by the hang gliders who had joined her and Petra on their first outing as friends. They call Petra and she rushes to Camille's side, wrapping her body around her and trying to revive her. Once revived Camille joins Petra and the circus on their way to Circumstance. The director of the circus ([[Tracy Wright]]), who had dreamed of running away, stays in the city where she and Martin spot each other outside a café.  
Weather Report Girl
 The story revolves around Keiko Nakadai, who in the beginning is an [[Office Lady]] working at the perpetually last-place ATV television network. However, she is chosen to fill in for weather reporter Michiko Kawai for one night, and Keiko takes full advantage of her opportunity by blatantly flashing her panties while on live television. The incident causes the evening news ratings to jump, and because of ATV's desperation to escape the ratings cellar, Keiko is subsequently promoted to full-time weather reporter, displacing Michiko in the process. The rest of the series focuses on her rivalries with co-workers jealous of and insulted by the nature of her success.  The humor in ''Weather Report Girl'' is full of sexually oriented sorority style humor, aimed primarily at young men. The protagonist, Keiko, is depicted as being exhibitionistic, first using her sex appeal to rise to the position of weather girl by flashing her bra and panties, and maintaining her position by frequently wearing lingerie while on the air. She is also very resourceful, always one step ahead of her rivals' various revenge schemes. Keiko is also extraordinarily vengeful, humiliating Michiko on the air by spiking her tea with laxatives after Michiko had attempted a similar tactic against her. Keiko proceeds to masturbate in her apartment while watching Michiko embarrass herself on television.  Finally, she is sexually domineering, effectively enslaving Michiko—who due to the on-air incident would have been fired had she not agreed—by making her lick her lingerie and perform cunnilingus on Keiko.  The second episode introduces Kaori Shimamori, a reporter who uses her position as a member of the [[National Diet|Diet]] at Keiko's expense. Kaori conspires to have Keiko demoted after allotting her weather corner during a breaking news report. This effort fails after being flooded with viewer mail protests. Soon after, Keiko and Kaori agree to partner up on a marketing campaign for ATV, though still plotting revenge against Keiko by eavesdropping on her. She soon discovers Keiko's [[dominatrix]] relationship with Michiko and becomes friends with Keiko. The [[Original video animation|OVA]] ends with a stripping and humiliation of Michiko in which Kaori embraces Keiko's lifestyle and then proceeds to entice Michiko into having oral sex with her while Keiko, half asleep, listens with a smirk.  
What a Mess!

Officials proclaim that the sale of the diamond could pay for every Russian citizen to take a three-year-long vacation at the [[Canary Islands]].  When the diamond is being transported to Moscow (by [[Antonov An-124|Antonov An-124 ''Ruslan'']])<ref name="enc"/> it is stolen by the [[crime boss]] Kozulskiy (Armen Dzhigarkhanyan), who is then robbed by professional thief Vasiliy Krolikov (Valeri Garkalin).  For the remainder of the film, the plot revolves around Krolikov and his two other identical [[Multiple birth]] brothers. Krolikov is pursued by Kozulskiy's mafia and two [[Militsiya]] officers - Jean-Paul Piskunov (Igor Ugolnikov) and an unnamed lieutenant (Sergey Batalov). At the end of the film Vasiliy discovers that there is a fourth brother, making all characters played by Garkalin [[quadruplets]].  
Whisper of the Heart
  Shizuku Tsukishima is a 14-year-old student at Mukaihara Junior High School, where she is best friends with Yuko Harada. Living in Tokyo with her parents Asako and Seiya, as well as her older sister Shiho, Shizuku is a bookworm and is keen on writing. During an ordinary evening, she looks through the checkout cards in her library books. She discovers they have been checked out by Seiji Amasawa (天沢 聖司). Over the next few days, Shizuku encounters a young man, later revealed to be Seiji, who often annoys her.  Finding a cat riding a train, Shizuku follows it to discover an [[antique shop]] run by Shiro Nishi. In the shop is a cat statuette, "The Baron".  Later at the antique shop, Shizuku sings "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", a song she has been translating for her school graduation, accompanied by Seiji and Nishi. Seiji is revealed to be the grandson of Nishi, and Shizuku and Seiji befriend each other. Seiji is learning to make violins to follow his dream as a master [[luthier]]. Days after the two meet, Seiji leaves for [[Cremona]], Italy, for a two-month study with a master violin-maker. Firming her resolve, Shizuku decides to test her talents as well. Discussing with Yuko, she decides to pursue her writing seriously during the two months. She asks Nishi if she can write about The Baron, to which Nishi grants his consent on the condition that he will be the first to read the finished story.  Shizuku begins to concoct a fantasy story featuring herself as the female protagonist, the Baron as the male hero who is looking for his lost love, Louise, and the cat she followed from the train (who is, among other names, known as "Moon" and "Muta") as the story's villain who took her from him. Devoting her time to her writing, Shizuku eats snacks, stays up until early in the morning, and her school grades drop. Shizuku argues with her family over her grades, and as she continues to push herself into finishing the story before Seiji returns, she begins to lose heart.  When her story is complete, Shizuku delivers the manuscript to Nishi. After Nishi reads Shizuku's writing and gives her his benevolent assessment, she breaks down in tears as the stress of the last two months finally turns into relief. Consoling her with [[udon]], Nishi reveals to Shizuku that when he studied in Germany in his youth, he found his first love, Louise. They discovered the twin statuettes of the Baron and his female companion in a cafe, but they could only purchase them singly because the female statuette was being repaired at that time. Nishi kept the Baron while Louise would hold onto the Baron's companion, and they and the two cat statuettes would reunite at a later time. However, the two lovers and the statues were subsequently separated during [[World War II]] and were never reunited.  Deciding she wants to attend high school to learn more about writing, Shizuku is returned home by Nishi and announces to her mother that she will return to studying for her entrance exams full-time. The next morning, she encounters Seiji on his bicycle. He has returned a day early, and decided to finish high school before returning to Cremona to become a luthier.  The two ride Seiji's bike to a lookout and watch the sun rise over the city, where Seiji professes his love for Shizuku and proposes future marriage; she happily accepts.  
White Man's Burden (film)
  The movie begins with a dinner engagement at the Thomas residence. Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte), a wealthy CEO, prompts a discussion about White people and claims they are "genetically inferior" because the children grow up without fathers. In this alternative reality, the lower class consists of [[White Americans]] as the large percentage of minorities who live in rundown and crime-infested ghetto communities, and face [[prejudice]] from the broader society; while the comfortable middle to upper class is predominantly made of African Americans. The [[African Americans]] in the film are dominant in employment, business, and entertainment and they often refer condescendingly to how  white children live in poverty and unfortunate conditions. The rich Thomas family are horrified and struggle to be polite in the presence of poor white people.  In an effort to go above and beyond in his position, Louis Pinnock (John Travolta), a struggling factory worker hoping for a promotion in the candy factory, offers to deliver a package after his shift. He delivers the package to successful CEO Thaddeus Thomas, who lives in a wealthy upper-class community predominantly of blacks. Pinnock is let into the property by a white servant at the security gate point in front of the Thomas residence and accidentally views Thaddeus's wife naked while dressing in her bedroom through the window. Thaddeus notices and complains to the VP at the factory, during a dinner engagement at his house, that he would prefer a different delivery man instead of a "Peeping Tom" to visit his house next time. Although Thaddeus doesn't suggest any form of punishment towards Pinnock, the VP "gets the message" and immediately fires Pinnock anyway. Pinnock returns to the Thomas residence in an attempt to discuss the misunderstanding with Thaddeus, but because Thaddeus was in an important business meeting, he refuses and sends a message to Pinnock that he apologizes but there's nothing he can do to help him. Pinnock begs for two minutes of his time, but is abruptly turned away.  Without any education or advanced skills, Pinnock finds difficulty getting a job and is unable to support his family. The Pinnock family are awakened one early morning by the police who is accompanied by the landlord to enforce the eviction from the house; in mid-chaos the family struggle to gather their important belongings as they vacate the premises. Pinnock's mother-in-law scolds and belittles Louis for being a  failure of a man and not taking care of his family; she clearly states there is not enough room for him at her house and his wife and the two children leave to live with her.   As if the situation could not get worse, Louis's truck breaks down and he is forced to walk. Feeling down and lonely in the midst of the night, Louis is aggressively apprehended by the police who mistaken him for a bank robber because "he fit the description."  The people inside the bar come outside and shout at the police, demanding that they leave Pinnock alone. Pinnock is brutally beaten by the police for causing a commotion and the police are chased away, as beer bottles are being thrown by the angry mob.  In a radical quest for justice, Pinnock waits outside the Thomas residence again and  kidnaps Thomas at gun point and demands for a large sum of money that is owed for losing his job. After multiple failed attempts for withdrawing the money, Pinnock holds Thomas hostage for the weekend and takes him through the ghetto where he lives.  Thomas, however, remains unsympathetic to Pinnock and calls him a failure who blames the world for his problems. But Pinnock takes Thomas through the ghetto where he lives, and Thomas alternates between enjoying some of the staples of ghetto life (Pinnock shows him how to use salt to enhance the flavor of ketchup with French fries) and having his eyes open to this world's racism (black cops are hostile to Pinnock, treat him like a criminal when he's done nothing wrong, and eventually beat him up for no good reason). In the end, though mistaken for carrying a weapon, Pinnock is shot and killed by the police in an attempt to call for help for Thomas who is in desperate need for medical attention because of breathing problems. The chastened CEO visits Pinnock's grieving widow and offers her the money Louis lost when he was fired. She refuses it, and when Thomas awkwardly asks if she wants more, she bluntly says "How much would ever be enough?" and closes the door in his face as the movie ends.  
The White Balloon
 It is the eve of the [[Norouz|Iranian New Year]]. The film opens in a [[Teheran]] market where seven-year-old Razieh ([[Aida Mohammadkhani]]) and her mother are shopping. Razieh sees a goldfish in a shop and begins to nag her hurrying mother to buy it for the festivities instead of the skinny ones in her family's pond at home.  Almost all of the film's major characters are briefly seen in this market scene, though they won't be introduced to the viewer until later. On their way home, mother and daughter pass a courtyard where a crowd of men has gathered to watch two snake charmers. Razieh wants to see what is happening but her mother pulls her daughter away, telling her that it is not good for her to watch these things.  Back home, Razieh is upset about her mother's refusal to let her buy a new goldfish, but continues  her campaign of nagging. Her older brother Ali (Mohsen Kalifi) returns from a shopping errand for their father who, although remains unseen has a tangible presence causing tension in the family. He complains that he asked Ali to buy shampoo, not soap, then throws the soap at him. Ali sets off to buy the shampoo and when he returns Razieh enlists his help in changing her mother's mind about the goldfish, bribing him with a balloon. Insisting that she can buy the goldfish in the market for 100 tomans ("You're crazy," Ali tells her, remarking that he can see two films with that money), Razieh finally gets her wish. Her mother gives her the family's last 500-toman banknote and asks her to bring back the change. Razieh sets off with an empty glass jar to the fish shop a few blocks away.  Between their home and the fish store, Razieh manages to lose the money twice, first in an encounter with the [[snake charmer]], and then when she drops the money through the grate at the entrance to a store which has been closed for the New Year celebration.  Razieh and Ali make several attempts to retrieve the money and receive assistance from many people, including the owners of nearby shops and an Iranian soldier. The money, however, is always just out of reach. Finally, the siblings receive help from a young Afghan street vendor selling balloons. He carries all of his balloons on a wooden stick, and has only one balloon, a white one, left. The group attaches a piece of gum to one end of the balloon stick, and with it, they reach down through the grate and pull the money out.  The film ends, not with Ali and Razieh, but with the young Afghan boy, who has become an important character only at the very end of the film.

The Young Poisoner's Handbook
 Graham Young has been obsessed with death and the macabre since childhood. He is highly intelligent, with an aptitude for chemistry; he dreams of poisoning as many people as he can. In his teen years, he actually poisons a schoolmate&mdash;which made him ill rather than killing him&mdash;in order to date a girl his schoolmate was seeing. His conversation with his date involved vivid, graphic descriptions of deadly car accidents. He also reads a comic book account of an event in which the Dutch Resistance killed a whole German army camp in the occupied [[The Netherlands in World War II|Netherlands during the Second World War]] by poisoning their water supply with [[thallium]].  Graham is arrested at the age of 14 outside his home in [[Neasden]] after having poisoned his father and stepmother with [[thallium]], killing his stepmother and making his father seriously ill. During the struggle with police, he drops his "Exit Dose" of thallium, which he intended to use to commit suicide should he be caught. He is hospitalised for nine years in an institution for the criminally insane, during which time a psychiatrist works with him in the hopes of rehabilitating him.  Graham's dishonesty becomes evident to the doctor, who can see that Graham is trying to deceive him. Graham apparently has no dreams to share with the psychiatrist so he "borrows" a fellow prisoner's dreams. This source is shut off to him, however, once the fellow prisoner commits suicide. Despite the initial evidence of deceptiveness on Graham's part, the doctor eventually gets him released.  Graham then goes to work in a camera factory and is shown the secret ingredient used in the company's shutter system&mdash;thallium. It is not long before Graham starts poisoning people again. He kills two of his workmates by poisoning their tea with thallium stolen from the laboratory, and makes many others ill. For months, the source of the "bug" afflicting the workers at the factory remains a mystery until one unforeseen event leads to Graham's being found out. As a hygiene measure, all the personalised teacups are replaced with uniform ones, leaving Graham unable to poison people selectively. His efforts to memorise which cup is going to which person give him away and his workmates finally realise what is going on.  Graham is arrested soon afterwards and he is later sentenced to a lengthy custodial term, this time in an ordinary prison. He commits suicide by poisoning himself with the "Newton's Diamond" he made in the psychiatric hospital.  ===Differences between the film and the real case=== ''The Young Poisoner's Handbook'' is not a strictly factual account of Graham Young's crimes. The film depicts Young committing suicide immediately after his arrest; the real Graham Young died of a heart attack in 1990, at the age of 42. The film insinuates that his ambition in life was to create an untraceable poison based on thallium using his knowledge of chemistry; in reality his ambition was to become an infamous poisoner, an ambition he achieved.  In real life also, his crimes weren't discovered because of what happened with the cups; rather, he gave himself away during a talk given by a local doctor brought in to try and reassure the staff, who understandably were panicking and on the point of leaving.   After the doctor said the most likely cause of the outbreak of illness the factory had been experiencing was a local virus called the Bovingdon Bug, he asked for questions and Young asked him why they hadn't considered heavy metal poisoning instead; he went into detail about the effects of some of these, including hair loss. This concerned both the doctor and the managing director of the factory where Young worked, prompting them to ask the local police to check Young's background—which revealed his having spent nine years at Broadmoor for poisoning his father, his sister and a school friend (though all survived). He was arrested soon afterwards.
