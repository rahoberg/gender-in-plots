Try as he might, he can not identify the cause of his torment or make sense of the fleeting remains of his dreams.  He shrugs them off, but things seem to be getting worse.  Johnnie works as foreman on his uncle Trump's construction crew.  Work tensions run high as the building owners complain about the cost and pace, while the workers constantly find their pay-packets shorted.  Sly as a fox, Uncle Trump always explains everything away.  Even when arrested for indecent exposure in a park frequented by gay men on the prowl for sex, he handily swears he only stopped there to relieve himself and was arrested by mistake.  Openly bisexual, Johnnie's pressures mount when his girlfriend, Maria, and a sex-partner, Christian, begin to pressure him for more commitment.  He fumbles his responses, and no one is satisfied.  Finally, Johnnie catches his Uncle Trump in an act that fractures the dam of memories, and in a short time, they come flooding back into Johnnie's consciousness.  Although shaken to his core, Johnnie finds the answers he needs.  Most importantly, he survives the flood and can finally move forward.  
The 4th Floor (1999 film)
 The film follows Jane (Lewis) who has inherited a rent-controlled brownstone apartment from her late aunt, and, despite her boyfriend Greg's (Hurt) appeals, has decided to move in and live on her own for the first time. She meets Martha Stewart, (Duvall) her neighbor from the first floor, who tells her the names of all the occupants of the building, including the person who lives on the 4th floor, an old woman named Alice who is a hermit. The next morning, she finds a note on her door, warning her against the noise she was making while moving in. Jane quickly dismisses it and continues moving around her furniture. Another note appears and she calls a locksmith after someone tampered with her locks. The locksmith (Bell) is a strange man who lives in the building across from Jane, whom she suspected of harming a woman earlier.   Jane makes a friend out of Mr. Collins (Pendleton) a kindly old man who was also friends with Greg in high-school. After an argument with Greg about her refusal to move in with him, her tiles on her kitchen floor are smashed by her neighbor from downstairs and she calls the police. Furious,  she gets her own back by making more noise. The next morning she falls down the stairs by tripping on a stair smeared with grease. She then tries to make amends by sending her neighbor a sorry note asking for a truce.  However things get worse as Jane's bathtub and apartment are infested with maggots and mice and she calls an exterminator (Costanzo) to handle the problem. She then finds out from a Korean grocer that Alice, the neighbor right beneath her, had suddenly stopped ordering her daily groceries.  When she tries to tell Martha this, Martha turns against her, saying she has no respect for privacy or authority and that she's toeing the line by calling the police and talking to the Koreans. After the exterminator reveals that the mice infestation was no accident and that most likely her neighbor had been putting them through a drilled hole in her floor, Jane becomes terrified. She decides to break into the 4th floor to take pictures and gather evidence. There she finds mice and rats in cages, a typewriter and the ceiling completely mapped out with her furniture, along with word "[[Portcullis]]" written on a wall.  She then receives a call from the buzzer that  a package is waiting for her. She opens the giant parcel to find it full of packing noodles, the same ones she found in the trash bags outside the neighbor's door, along with her sorry note saying "Truce accepted". She panics when she finds pictures of her aunt's dead body and decides to pack the evidence and go to the police. However, she is attacked and knocked out by the unknown neighbor and her evidence is stolen.   When she gets out of hospital, she tries to show Greg and the police the hole the neighbor drilled in her floor, but the hole has mysteriously disappeared. Greg then tries to convince Jane that no one believes her fears and that she should move out of the apartment and stay with him.   Jane goes back to the apartment and furiously bangs on the neighbor's door, yelling for him to come out. She is then comforted by Mr. Collins who takes her back to his place. She then notices strange patterns on Mr. Collins's ceiling and to her horror, sees the word "Portcullis". She is immediately knocked out by Mr. Collins, who drags her upstairs to the 4th floor.  Jane awakens in a room full of flies and she finds a dead body covered with maggots, presumably Alice. She tries to escape the apartment filled with packing noodles and hits Mr. Collins with a crowbar. She goes up to her apartment to call the police, but the line is dead. She then tries to escape through her front door, but her attacker has tied her door knob to the stairway railing. Mr. Collins breaks in through her window and Jane hides behind the fireplace shield. The locksmith appears and tries to fight off Mr. Collins, but he is eventually overwhelmed.  Jane then stomps on the floor until a large decoration hanging over her doorway falls on Mr. Collins. She then runs out the door which had been untied by the locksmith, but is caught again by her attacker. Suddenly, Greg appears and asks Mr. Collins to hand over the knife he is holding against Jane. Mr. Collins then raises up the knife and  Jane lunges at him, pushing him over the stair railing and down five flights of stairs to his death.  A few months later, Jane is seen in Greg's apartment talking to her friend Cheryl (Grdevich) from work on the phone, who tells her that the locksmith had something to show Jane. She replies that it is a good thing as she didn't get a chance to thank him. The final scene reveals that the locksmith has been looking through his window and sketching and painting what he sees. The camera pans through the room at all his paintings and the camera stops on a picture showing Greg and Mr. Collins talking at a table in front of the typewriter used to type threatening messages to Jane.  
The 13th Warrior
 [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] is a court poet to the [[Caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], until his amorous encounter with the wife of an influential noble gets him exiled as an "ambassador" to the Northern Barbarians. Traveling with Melchisidek, his caravan is saved from [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] raiders by the appearance of [[Norsemen]]. Taking refuge at their settlement on the [[Volga]] river, communications are established through Melchisidek and Herger, a Norseman who speaks Latin. Ahmad and Melchisidek are in time to witness a fight, which establishes Buliwyf as [[heir apparent]], followed by the [[Viking]] funeral of their dead king, cremated together with a young woman who agreed to accompany him to [[Valhalla]].  A youth enters the camp requesting Buliwyf's aid: his father's kingdom in the far north is under attack from an ancient evil so frightening that even the bravest warriors dare not name it. The "angel of death", a [[völva]] (wisewoman), determines the mission will be successful if thirteen warriors go to face this danger—but the thirteenth must not be a Norseman. Ahmad is recruited against his will.  Ahmad learns Norse during their journey by listening intently to his companions' conversations. He is looked down upon by the huge Norsemen, who mock his physical weakness and his small [[Arabian horse]], but he earns a measure of respect by his fast learning of their language, his horsemanship, ingenuity, and ability to write.  Reaching King Hrothgar's kingdom, they confirm that their foe is indeed the ancient "[[Grendel|Wendol]]", fiends who come with the mist to kill and eat human flesh. While the group searches through a raided cabin they find a [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]]. On their first night two of their number - Hyglak and Ragnar - are killed. In a string of clashes, Buliwyf's band establishes that the Wendol are humanoid cannibals who appear as, live like, and identify with [[bear]]s.  Their numbers dwindling and their position all but indefensible, an ancient ''völva'' of the village tells them to track the Wendol to their lair and destroy their leaders, the "[[Grendel's mother|Mother of the Wendol]]" and their Warlord who wears "the horns of power". Buliwyf and the remaining warriors infiltrate the Wendol cave-complex and kill the Mother, but not before Buliwyf is scratched deeply across the shoulder by her poisoned "fingernail claw".  The remaining warriors return to the village and prepare for a final battle they do not expect to survive. Buliwyf staggers outside before the fight and inspires the warriors with a Viking prayer for the honored dead who will enter [[Valhalla]]. Buliwyf succeeds in killing the Wendol Warlord, causing their defeat, before succumbing to the poison. Ahmad ibn Fadlan witnesses Buliwyf's royal funeral before returning to his homeland, grateful to the Norsemen for helping him to "become a man, and a useful servant of God". He is shown at the movie's end writing down the tale of his time with them.  
10 Things I Hate About You
 Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the [[Seattle]] area, becomes instantly smitten with popular [[sophomore]] Bianca Stratford. [[Geek]]y Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish Kat, to date. Kat, a [[senior (education)|senior]], is accepted to [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] worrisome of [[teenage pregnancy]], will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.  When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects "bad boy" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.  At the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a [[musical ensemble|band]]. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.  Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the [[prom]] so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the [[marching band]], and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron has not asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter will not allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were [[freshman|freshmen]] and, succumbing to [[peer pressure]], had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.  All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.  The next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 141]], Kat reads aloud a poem titled "10 Things I Hate About You", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a guitar bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and the two reconcile with a kiss.

8mm (film)
 Private investigator Tom Welles is contacted by Daniel Longdale, attorney for wealthy widow Mrs. Christian, whose husband has recently died. While clearing out her late husband's safe, she and Mr. Longdale find an [[Super 8 film|8mm movie]] which appears to depict a real murder, but Mrs. Christian wants to know for certain.  After looking through missing persons files, Welles discovers the girl is Mary Ann Mathews, and visits her mother, Janet Mathews. While searching the house with her permission, he finds Mary Ann's diary, in which she says she went to Hollywood to become a film star. He asks Mrs. Mathews if she wants to know the truth, even if it is the worst. She says that she wants to know what happened to her daughter.  In Hollywood, with the help of an adult video store employee called Max California, Welles delves into the underworld of illegal pornography. Contact with a sleazy talent scout named Eddie Poole leads them to director Dino Velvet, whose violent pornographic films star a masked man known as "Machine." To gain more evidence, Welles pretends to be a client interested in commissioning a hardcore bondage film to be directed by Velvet and starring Machine. Velvet agrees and arranges a meeting in New York City.  At the meeting, attorney Longdale appears and explains that Christian had contracted him to procure a snuff film.  Longdale says that he told Velvet that Welles might come looking for them. Realizing that the snuff film was authentic, Welles knows he is at risk. Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten California, whom they abducted to force Welles to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film. Once he delivers it, they burn it and kill California. As they are about to kill Welles, he tells them that Christian paid $1,000,000 for the film. Velvet, Poole, and Machine received much less and that Longdale kept the major portion. In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Welles wounds Machine and escapes.  He calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees. Arriving at her estate, Welles is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news. She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Welles: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading, "Try to forget us."  Welles decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved. Tracking down Poole, Welles takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him. He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her about her daughter and asks for her permission to punish those responsible. With that, he returns and pistol-whips Poole to death, burning his body and pornography from his car. Welles traces Machine and attacks him at home. Welles unmasks him, revealing a bald, bespectacled man named George. He says, "What did you expect? A monster?" George goes on telling Welles that he has no ulterior motive for his sadistic actions; he does them simply because he enjoys it. They struggle, and Welles kills him.  After returning to his family, Welles receives a letter from Mrs. Mathews, thanking him and suggesting he and she were the only ones to care about Mary Ann.

In order to move on and to forget Rohan, Pooja finds a job as a caretaker/maid  for a rich Indian man Balraj, who is ill and aging, and also bed-ridden most of the time.  Pooja does not know that this is the Balraj - who had selfishly left India years ago, leaving his wife and his son Rohan alone to fend for themselves.

After Pooja explains about the locket to him, he realises that Rohan is his son but does not tell Pooja immediately as he fears that Rohan might not accept him as a father in his hostility (and Karan might get more envious).   After hearing from Pooja that Rohan is struggling to make ends meet, Balraj asks Pooja to call Rohan for an interview to his company for a Manager position, for which Rohan passes and is offered a well-paying job and career at last! Rohan expresses his gratitude for the opportunity and then Balraj continues his generosity from afar by giving Rohan a $5000 bonus, and anything he wishes for.   After a few years, Rohan goes to visit Ranjit's poor abused parents and offers some help because he knows Ranjit is ignoring them all the time. Rohan pays for the parents Nursing home rent charges as well as their ticket to return to India as the parents wished to return to their homeland. After this, Pooja and Rohan continue to live a happy life in USA and plan to return to India after some time.  Just before their departure, Balraj confesses to Rohan that  he is indeed his long-lost son and that he had kept this secret from him fearing a hostile unacceptance of help from his part!  Rohan is stunned to realise that Balraj is his father and reacts in anger. Balraj continues to explain that  after he arrived in America, he went back to India to find his family, but he could not, so he remarried. Balraj insists to speak to his wife to ask for forgiveness. She immediately forgives him and asks them all to come back to India.

Aakasha Ganga
  Years ago, Devan([[Madhupal]]), a member of the 'Maanikesseri' royal family, fell in love with Ganga([[Mayoori (actress)|Mayuri]]), a 'dasi'(servant) girl and gets her pregnant. On hearing this, Devan's family members get outraged and in a fit of rage, his father, Thampuran ([[Spadikam George]]), beats and kicks Ganga, making her unconscious. Panicker, a loyal servant of the family, tries to revive her, but fails. He comes to the conclusion that Ganga may be dead. So Thampuran and Panicker decide to [[cremate]] Ganga, but while doing so, she regains consciousness, asking for water. The merciless Thampuran sets the pyre ablaze and burns her alive.  Later Ganga's soul becomes a '[[Yakshini|yakshi]]' and starts haunting the family members. Devan [[Suicide|kills himself]] too. Ganga gets hold of Thampi and kills him. Fearing her wrath, the Maanikesseri family members hires an exorcist, 'Mepaddan'([[Rajan P.Dev]]), who successfully gets hold of the spirit and imprisons her in a banyan tree. Meppaddan warns the family that the male members of the family should now lead a life of [[celibacy]] and that if the spirit is freed, then nobody, even Meppaddan himself, can't stop her.  Years roll by, the family remains true to their word. But trouble starts brewing when Unnikuttan or 'Unni'(Riyaz), befriends and falls in love with Maya([[Divya Unni]]), a girl whom he met in the sets of a movie shoot. She too reciprocates his feelings and requests his family to get her married to him. After a lot of persuading, the family members arrange for their marriage only in name, provided that the young couple should not consummate the marriage, to which Maya promises.  One day, when the young couple were shopping, a man named James([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]) interrupts them and identifies Maya as Daisy, his missing fianceé, which Maya opposes. Though the family members think James maybe nuts, Panicker sensed something wrong. In the process, Maya kills Panicker, who reveals that she is actually 'Ganga' but in the body of another girl. Things go haywire; Maya begins attacking family members who suspect her identity, seducing Unni and becomes pregnant. When things become unbearable, the family consult Meppaddan along with Father Mikhayel, another priest, about Maya.  Alas, it is revealed that 'Maya' is in fact a 'possessed Daisy'. Meppaddan reveals the reason; Daisy is actually a college girl hailing from a Christian background. During a college excursion, Daisy happened to pass by the very same banyan tree where 'Mayaganga' was imprisoned. Out of curiosity, she frees Ganga and becomes unconscious. After that incident, her habits changed drastically, even in her diet and prayers. Then, one night, she goes missing, which is then revealed that she was on her way to take revenge on the Maanikesseri family. Through Unni, she was successful in her mission. Meppaddan also reveals that since Ganga has now become powerful, it was would be difficult to exorcise her and that she would either take the life of any of the family member or else would kill her host Daisy. Leaving no other choice, Meppaddan proceeds on with an exorcism.  The fiery [[exorcism]] takes place with Meppadan battling the stubborn Ganga, who wouldn't leave Daisy as long as she fulfils her wishes. Then Meppaddan finally exorcises Ganga by deliberately trying to burn her host alive, just like the way she had been burnt years ago, while also taking care that Daisy doesn't burn up. An unconscious Daisy is then hospitalised and on regaining consciousness, does not remember anything when she was possessed, even the Maanikesseri family, but remembers her own family members. Unni accuses both James and his own family for her present condition and leaves, heartbroken. James then reveals to a confused Daisy everything that had happened to her. In the end, James brings Daisy back to the 'Maanikesseri tharavadu'(home), who tells them that his love was nothing as compared to Unni's love for Daisy, who also accepted Unni without any hesitation. He also tells them that Daisy is going to be a mother. Hence, he reunites them, with Daisy now acquiring the name 'Maya' and becomes part of the Maanikesseri family, which leads to a happy ending.  
The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland
 [[Elmo]] is playing with his fuzzy, blue [[Blanket]] in his house. After he bumps his Blanket on a juice cup, he washes and dries his Blanket at the [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].  On the way home, Elmo encounters his friend [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], who is feeling depressed because her father, due to having to work, cannot take her to the [[zoo]], so he decides to cheer Zoe up by imitating zoo animals. When Zoe sees Elmo's Blanket, Elmo refuses to share, resulting in a [[tug of war]] that [[Tearing|rips]] Elmo's Blanket. Upset at this, Elmo declares that Zoe is no longer his friend. Suddenly, [[Telly Monster|Telly]] inadvertently takes away the blanket while rollerskating out of control. They go around Finders Keepers and knock over a tray of glasses that Ruthie is carrying. Telly hits [[Cookie Monster]] at the revolving door of Furry Arms hotel. The blanket accidentally lands in the hands of [[Oscar the Grouch]], who drops it in his [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar the Grouch's Trash Can|trash can]] after [[sneezing]] into it.  Elmo dives into the bottom of Oscar's trash can, where he finds his Blanket snagged on a [[door]]. While attempting to retrieve it, they are both teleported through a colorful, swirling tunnel to the most disgusting place on earth: Grouchland USA, a city filled with [[Grouches]], stinky garbage, and a mean and greedy man named Huxley ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), who steals anything he can grab, including Elmo's Blanket. Wanting his Blanket back, Elmo begins a journey through Grouchland. A kind-hearted Grouch girl named Grizzy tells Elmo that his Blanket is in Huxley's house at the top of the faraway Mount Pickanose, but also warns Elmo that he may never make it there, and Elmo sets out on a quest to get his Blanket back. Meanwhile, the [[Sesame Street (fictional location)|Sesame Street]] residents are informed of Elmo's absence and go to Grouchland to find him, with help from Oscar. When [[Big Bird]] and Zoe find a Grouch [[police officer]] and ask him for help, the entire group ends up arrested and put in jail as the police officer informs them that it is against the law to ask for help in Grouchland.  Meanwhile, Huxley's socially awkward sidekick, Bug, and his army, the Pesties (who are Bug's minions), trap Elmo in a [[tunnel]] using a [[trap door]]. However, Elmo gets out with the help of [[Firefly|fireflies]]. Going further, Elmo meets the Queen of Trash ([[Vanessa Williams]]) in a [[garbage dump]]. At first, when she believes that Elmo might be in league with Huxley, Elmo denies this, but then, he remembers that he refused to share his blanket with Zoe (which is exactly the way Huxley acts), and realizing that he is not so different, feels ashamed. The Queen gives him what she believes is an impossible test by requesting that he [[blowing a raspberry|blow 100 raspberries]] in 30 seconds. Elmo succeeds at this and continues his journey to Huxley's house. Elmo is later confronted by Huxley's humongous [[chicken]] and gets tossed far away. Resting on a rock, he realizes that night has come, and becomes discouraged.  Meanwhile, Grizzy sneaks into the jail and informs Elmo's friends that he went to Huxley's house. Oscar is convinced to help set things right as well as admitting that Elmo is his friend. He then convinces the police officer and all the Grouches of Grouchland that even though Grouches hate cooperation, the only way they can finally stop Huxley from stealing any more of their trash once and for all, is if they swallow their pride and work together just for once. The police officer releases the Sesame Street residents and the Grouches aid them to go to Huxley's house to fight for their trash and rescue Elmo.  A [[caterpillar]] wakes up Elmo the next morning on the rock. He gives Elmo advice to look inside himself and he'll see that he has what it takes be brave. Taking the caterpillar's advice, Elmo makes it to Huxley's before Huxley (who has been calling Elmo's Blanket "his wooby" since he stole it) has the chance to make Elmo's Blanket "his" blanket. However, Huxley foils Elmo's getaway by grabbing Elmo with a remote controlled claw and deciding to [[rubber stamp|stamp]] "MINE" on him. Just as Elmo is about to face the fate of never seeing his friends again, the Sesame Street and Grouchland citizens appear in time to rescue Elmo, and the Pesties flee in a panic. In all the chaos, Huxley takes Elmo's Blanket again, but Bug (having had his redemption) suddenly sucks it up with the [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]] nozzle on the front of Huxley's elaborate [[helicopter]] (which is what Huxley uses to steal things), revealing himself to have [[double agent|been on Elmo's side all along]] as Elmo catapults a basket over Huxley's shoulders, incapacitating him. After telling Huxley off and stating that he and Huxley are not friends at all, Bug gives Elmo his Blanket back. Elmo is hailed a hero by the Sesame Street and Grouchland citizens, while Huxley unanimously tries to apologize to Bug for his greed and selfishness, promising to give back everything that he stole, but Bug is not interested in what Huxley is attempting to say.  Happy to have finally gotten his Blanket back, Elmo and his friends return to Sesame Street, where Elmo apologizes to Zoe for not sharing his Blanket and hurting her feelings. He gives his Blanket to her and she happily accepts his apology for being kind by sharing with her, agreeing that they can permanently resume their friendship. Elmo then says goodbye to the audience and thanks them for helping before going to dance with his friends, while [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] and [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]] (who were not portrayed as actual characters in the film, but have broken in and interrupted throughout the film due to Bert wanting to ask Ernie about certain scenes) congratulate the audience for playing along and head home as the film ends, but Bert briefly stays to look at the credits, only to leave when Ernie persuades him that it is time to feed Bernice.

Adolescence of Utena
 The story centers around Utena, a new student at Ohtori Academy who has a penchant for dressing like a boy. She is shown around by the happy-go-lucky fellow student Wakaba, who declares Utena to be her [[prince]]. As Utena watches over a fencing match between Juri and Miki, she notices her former boyfriend Touga, who is also watching over the match. She follows him to a yard where roses are grown, and after a brief conversation, reveals her motivation for dressing like a boy.  Utena takes notices of Touga wearing a ring and then presumes it's a wedding ring, but Touga corrects her and states that the ring made him seek out the academy. After Touga leaves Utena with a white rose, the rose opens to reveal a ring with the same rose crest as on Touga's. Utena notices roses falling from above and discovers a huge rose garden above.  In the garden she meets Anthy, who introduces herself as the Rose Bride. Shortly after, Anthy's current fiancé Kyoichi Saionji makes an appearance. After seeing Utena's ring, he challenges her to a duel. Anthy just tries to interrupt, but she is slapped by Saionji. Enraged, Utena immediately accepts the duel and fights with a bamboo staff. Utena tries her best to fight with a staff, but she is outmatched by Saoinji who is using a real sword. Things start to look dire for Utena, but Anthy throws herself at Utena and kisses her, which causes Utena to drag the Sword of Dios out of Anthy's chest and use it to defeat Saionji.  Touga has a mysterious encounter with Shiori, where Shiori talks about how her childhood prince was killed by a girl. The girl fell off a boat and the prince drowned trying to save her. At night, Anthy enters Utena's room in order to have sex with her but Utena rejects her advances and questions her about the meaning of the duels and the Rose Bride. Anthy simply responds by saying she will sleep with whom ever wins in a duel.  Touga receives a phone call from a mysterious man who tells Touga about how his sister was a witch. Through her magic, the sister made [[Beelzebub|the lord of the flies]] into a prince, but when her magic faded the prince turned to his true self again. Touga asks the man if he tried to regain that power, but to no avail. A flashback reveals that Touga was sold and raped as a child. Juri and Miki walks through a garage which Juri claims leads to the "end of the world" (the alias of the villain in the anime series).  A car bearing Kozue's name is shown next to Miki, who notices an apparition of the prince. Juri playfully teases Miki, but they are interrupted by Shiori. Shiori emotionally blackmails and manipulates Juri into duelling Utena, specifically bringing up that because of Juri a prince died.  Utena confronts Anthy in the rose garden and blames Anthy for making her relationship with Touga end. Utena thinks Touga is in love with Anthy. Utena begins to break down, but Anthy comforts her by dancing with her. On the next day during art class Utena and Anthy are tasked with drawing each other. Utena starts by drawing Anthy, but Anthy declares that they switch. Anthy then requests that she draw Utena naked, stating that it's the best way to get closer to each other.  A reluctant Utena agrees, but blushes furiously and then asks that she draw Anthy naked as well, for fairness. Anthy obliges and then reveals a huge hole in her body and tells her that the one who possesses the Rose Bride will have the power to revolutionize the world and make miracles happen. Meanwhile, the school's broadcasting club reveals a video tape that eludes that the headmaster Akio has drugged and raped Anthy on several occasions.  Afterwards, Utena agrees to Juri's duel, during which Juri gets the upper hand, but also witnesses Utena seemingly transform into a younger version of the prince. Utena defeats Juri, but Akio's hidden grave is found, showing him to have been dead for some time. A second tape produced by Shiori to frame Anthy for murder shows that Anthy was awake during the rape, possibly even having consented to it. This disturbs Akio, who starts to frantically search for his lost car keys. Akio stabs Anthy in horrific realization and, after panicking, accidentally falls out of the window.  Utena runs to find Anthy and ends up confronting Touga in an elevator. She remembers that Touga was the one who jumped in the river to save a girl, who later turned out to be Juri. After kissing Utena, who tearfully thanks him for really being her prince, Touga descents into a dark, watery void.  Utena ascends the elevator and stairs to meet up with Anthy in the rose garden and claims that the two of them should go "to the outside world". Happily grabbing Anthy's hand to lead her, Utena is then inexplicably swallowed  by a sporadic car wash, and, inside, she is metamorphosed into a pink car. Anthy takes seat in the car and drives towards the promised "outside world". Shiori, now in her car form, berates the viewer for assuming that only Utena could transform into a car and states that she is a car as well. She then attempts attacking them on the highway but fails miserably and crashes.  Though initially in the clear, Anthy is eventually chased by hundreds of black cars. Being close to be crushed by a tank-like car, Anthy is saved by Juri, Miki and Saoinji in their own car, dubbed "Wakabacar". The trio says that they have been inspired by Utena and Anthy to take the same path as them, leaving the academy for the "outside world". After they part, an enormous castle drives into the highway and tries to crush Anthy beneath it but Anthy manages to make it through.  After passing underneath the castle, two giant tankwheels manage to trap Anthy in between them. A large apparition of Akio appears on the road, saying that Anthy and Utena should stay in his world, as princesses. Anthy rebukes his suggestion and, together with her Utena car, drive through him as he explodes into roses. Utena and Anthy emerge naked, riding on the remnants of the Utena car. They kiss as they drive into a grey wasteland, into the unknown "real" world.  
The Admirer
 The father of 13-year-old Lena (Marina Cherepukhina) Oleg ([[Sergei Garmash]]) divorces her stepmother Alexandra ([[Yelena Safonova]]) and goes to his mistress Marina (Maria Poroshina), and Lena is left to live with her stepmother. Wishing to show that they live well together, and prove her independence to the adults, Lena puts into play her ingenuity and charm and gets part-time work as a postman.  In the meantime at the post office the topic of discussion is some serial killer who keeps almost the whole city in fear. His victims are mostly young girls. Some he suffocates and from others cuts out their internal organs. Literally on the very first day of work late in the evening, a stranger (Andrey Andreyev) clad in a trenchcoat and hat, whose face she did not have time to see, protects Lena from hooligans and gives her a handful of chewing gum. Lena gets a liking towards him, and when adults talk about what a real man should be, Lena lists all the identifiers of this stranger: a coat, a hat, a chewing gum and a cigarette (the stranger lit a cigarette before Lena). After some time a strange incident occurs with her: during another evening while delivering post, someone attacks her and takes away her bag with newspapers. Lena is sure that this is the same notorious maniac. However, the very next day, late at night, she sees someone leaving her bag next to the post, and in the bag finds a bunch of chewing gum. Lena conceives the idea that the maniac and that mysterious stranger are one and the same person, although Lena's sympathy for him does not decrease from this. Lena's friend Ira offers to test this admirer's devotion by forcing him to buy her roller skates. On the same day, someone calls Lena home, but says nothing and remains silent in the phone. Lena is sure that this is her admirer and asks him not to scare her so much as then with the bag, and at the same time asks to know how much the roller blades are worth. The next day Lena finds the skates inside the mailbox when picking up newspapers.  Relations with this strange admirer who is ready to fulfill all her instructions, start to seem like an exciting game to Lena. After some time, Marina comes home to Lena and asks the girl not to be angry with her father because he is very worried about her, but Lena does not hold back (especially after she found out earlier that her father can not pay child support due to financial circumstances) and lets out all her rage on her. When she leaves, Lena discovers that the mysterious admirer was a witness of their conversation, and the next day it turns out that Marina is in a hospital in crippled condition. Lena understands who has beaten Marina, and respects this maniac-admirer even more than before. However, she wants him to reveal himself to her, which the admirer does not intend to do and at some point Lena on the phone says that she hates him throws away the beautiful handkerchief she found in the post box. But she still does not understand that the admirer does not like it when people abandon him, and so not only her friends are in danger, but she first of all is under threat.  
Aimée & Jaguar
 The film explores the lives of the characters [[Felice Schragenheim]] ([[Maria Schrader]]), a [[Jew]]ish woman who assumed a false name and who belongs to an [[resistance during World War II|underground organization]], and [[Lilly Wust]] ([[Juliane Köhler]]), a married mother of four children, unsatisfied with her philandering Nazi officer husband.  The film begins in 1997, with an 83-year-old Lilly (played by Inge Keller) taking up residence in a dilapidated flat that once served as an underground hideout. Brought to a retirement home, Lilly encounters her old maid Ilse (played by Johanna Wokalek in the 1940s, by Kyra Mladeck in 1997), who was rounded up during 1945, and is already a tenant.  In 1943, Felice, assuming a false last name and working as a journalist at a Nazi newspaper, meets Lilly via her friend and sometimes lover Ilse, who works as Lilly's housekeeper. Instantly smitten, she takes the initiative in the love affair by sending flagrant letters to Lilly and signing her name as Jaguar, much to Ilse's dismay. One fateful afternoon, Felice, Ilse, and their friends Klara and Lotte are accosted by German soldiers, and all but Lotte manage to escape. Shot down by the soldiers, they find no identification on Lotte's body except for a photograph of her and Felice. Lonely due to the constant absence of her husband, Lilly engages in a series of affairs with other men, but is disillusioned by the callous treatment of her latest tryst with another Nazi officer. She grows closer to Felice, who attempts to kiss her during a New Year's Eve Party in her Berlin apartment after Lilly discovers her philandering husband with Ilse, but rejects her. As her husband tries to make amends with her the following morning, Lilly realizes she has never loved him and reconciles with Felice.  With her husband again away at war, Lilly and Felice begin a shaky but intense relationship. The film features both erotic encounters and sentimental love poems (quoted from the book), and during one love scene Felice proclaims Lilly is an Aimée to Felice as Jaguar. On Lilly's birthday, Felice and her friends throw a party in her apartment that culminates in a lesbian orgy. Lilly is mortified when she sees Ilse and Felice kissing drunkenly, and further disillusioned when Felice rejects her advances for the night. The next morning, Lilly’s husband arrives on special leave for his wife's birthday only to witness the aftermath of the previous night's events. Although enraged, he vows to not punish her for her indiscretion so long that their marriage and life remain intact, but Lilly instead surprises him by asking for a divorce. Afraid that her husband may turn them in, Felice and her friends stop seeing Lilly for the sake of their own survival. Heartbroken, Lilly holes up in her apartment, eventually sending her children away to safety, and erupts in anger when Felice finally visits her after several weeks. Felice reveals the truth that she is Jewish and feared for her life, and the two make up.  After the [[20 July Plot]], Felice and her friends fear for their lives and arrange to flee Germany before they are rounded up. At the last moment, Felice decides to stay in spite of the danger so that she may remain with Lilly. After a day of frolicking in the countryside, the two return to Lilly's apartment where Felice is captured by the [[Gestapo]], using the photograph of her and Lotte to identify her. She is sent to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] from where the two still manage to correspond, but all contact is lost by the end of 1944.  Lilly and Ilse reminisce about times past as the film ends. Lilly, though saddened by the tragedy that she caused her friends and lovers, is unable to imagine how her life could have been any different, given her obsessive live-for-today-for-tomorrow-we-die mentality, common among besieged Berliners. Lilly Wust lived in Berlin until her death on 31 March 2006. The tagline of the film is "Love Transcends Death".

After travelling after her son's heart, Manuela quits her job and journeys to [[Barcelona]], where she hopes to find her son's father, Lola, a [[Transvestism|transvestite]] she kept secret from her son, just as she never told Lola they had a son.  In Barcelona, Manuela reunites with her old friend Agrado, a warm and witty [[transgender]] prostitute. She also meets and becomes deeply involved with several characters: Rosa, a young nun who works in a shelter for battered prostitutes, but is pregnant by Lola and is HIV positive; Huma Rojo, the actress her son had admired; and the drug-addicted Nina Cruz, Huma's co-star and lover. Her life becomes entwined with theirs as she cares for Rosa during her pregnancy and works for Huma as her personal assistant and even acts in the play as an [[understudy]] for Nina during one of her drug abuse crises.  On her way to the hospital, Rosa asks the taxi to stop at a park where she spots her father's dog, Sapic, and then her own father, who suffers from [[Alzheimer's]]; he does not recognize Rosa and asks for her age and height, but Sapic recognizes Rosa.

Manuela introduces Esteban (Rosa's son) to Lola and gives her a picture of their own Esteban. Rosa's mother spots them from the street and then confronts Manuela about letting strangers see the baby. Manuela tells her that Lola is Esteban's father; Rosa's mother is appalled and says: "That is the monster that killed my daughter?!"  Manuela flees back to Madrid with Esteban; she cannot take living at Rosa's house any longer, since the grandmother is afraid that she will contract AIDS from the baby. She writes a letter to Huma and Agrado saying that she is leaving and once again is sorry for not saying goodbye, like she did years before. Two years later, Manuela returns with Esteban to an AIDS convention, telling Huma and Agrado, who now run a stage show together, that Esteban had been a miracle by not inheriting the virus. She then says she is returning to stay with Esteban's grandparents. When Manuela asks Huma about Nina, Huma becomes melancholic and leaves. Agrado tells Manuela that Nina went back to her town, got married, and had a fat, ugly baby boy. Huma then rejoins the conversation briefly before exiting the dressing room to go perform.  
Alien Adventure
 The movie begins with an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[humanoid]] species, the Glegoliths, wandering through space in search of a new world. Encountering an unknown planet (which turns out to be Earth), the Glegolith leader (Cyrillus) sends two "manned" probes to the surface to determine if it is suitable for colonisation.  The scouts in the probes think they have arrived at a great city, but in fact they have arrived at a new [[amusement park]] that is not yet open to the public. They proceed to explore four amusement rides (later made into separate shorts): * Arctic Adventure ([[motion simulator]] ride in a freezing environment); * Magic Carpet (a ride in an [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]-themed dungeon); * Kid Coaster (a roller coaster set in a gigantic simulation of a child's bedroom); and * Aqua Adventure (an underwater-themed [[motion simulator]] ride, complete with [[animatronic]] sharks).  At each ride the Glegolith scouts become variously excited, frightened, frozen or violently ill, but end up having a lot of fun. On seeing this, Cyrillus decides that the new planet "was too much fun" and would destroy the fabric of his society, and orders his scouts to withdraw. The alien visitors depart Earth without actually making contact with humans.

Alien Cargo
 After months of hyper-sleep aboard the cargo transport ship ''Solar System Shipping Vessel No.17'' (SSS-17), two crew members awaken - Christopher 'Chris' McNiel (Jason London) and Theta Kaplan (Missy Crider). They discover that they've been woken from hyper-sleep, by the ship's computer, almost ten months past their scheduled time, as something has gone terribly wrong on board. The ship's internal systems are badly damaged, and they have almost no fuel. They slowly realize that the vessel's first shift probably killed each other and caused the ship's desolation but, as of yet, they don't know why. They calculate that they have only nine hours of life-support power left and then it will fail. With the help of the ship's log they discover a space probe that one of the crew of the first shift brought on board. They then find a strange substance and begin to analyze it.  Soon after the  discovery of the probe and the substance, they try to kill each other in a running struggle throughout the damaged ship. Meanwhile, the crew of a nearby deep-space research ship following a comet evaluate if they can attempt a rescue. Eventually Theta finds a cure for the substance on the space probe. It's a biological contamination which induces violent psychosis, but the substance is countered by cold. Theta needs help to inoculate the crew, so she has to lure Chris in order to administer a potent cure for the substance. She succeeds, and Chris is brought back to his senses. They then have to convince the research ship to try a rescue plan to slingshot the crew over. As they make departure preparations,  they discover that the drug did not work and that they are still infected, and thus cannot risk contaminating the rest of the crew or their rescuers.  They decide to transfer the uninfected sleepers over with minutes to spare before their sleep chambers fail. Chris and Theta decide to remain with ''No.17'' as it hurtles towards the sun, to prevent future contamination. To while away the time left, they dismantle the probe and discover it contains a canister of the blue contaminant. It is discovered that the probe was originally from Earth and they think that it accidentally picked up the virus in space and went on to accidentally contaminate an unknown alien race, who then sent the probe back where it came from, either as retaliation for a perceived attack or as mere vengeance.

Ricky goes to Jane, finding her arguing with Angela about her flirtation with Lester. Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City and tells Angela she is boring and ordinary.

She asks him to tell her she is beautiful; he does, and the pair kiss. However, moments before they are about to have sex, Angela admits her virginity and Lester decides not to go through with the act. Instead, they talk, and bond over their shared frustrations. Angela goes to the bathroom and Lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen before being shot by an unseen intruder. Ricky and Jane find Lester's body, while Carolyn is seen crying in the closet. A bloodied Frank returns home, where a gun is missing from his collection.

American Movie
 In 1996, Mark Borchardt, a blue-collar suburbanite, dreams of being a filmmaker. However, he is also an unemployed, deeply indebted, borderline alcoholic who still lives with his parents and is estranged from his ex-girlfriend, who is threatening to revoke custody of their three children. He acknowledges his various failures but aspires to one day make more of his life.  In an attempt to jump-start his amateur film making career, Mark restarts production on ''Northwestern,'' a feature-length film Mark has been planning for most of his adult life. Initially, the project attracts some interest from the group of amateur actors with whom Mark produces radio plays, but by the fourth production meeting, almost no one shows up and Mark is forced to acknowledge that he currently lacks the resources to ever move ''Northwestern'' past the pre-production phase.  In an attempt to drum up the attention and financial resources needed to film ''Northwestern,'' Mark decides to finally complete ''[[Coven (film)|Coven]]'' (which Borchardt mispronounces with a long 'o'), a horror short that he began shooting on [[16mm film]] in 1994 but ultimately abandoned. Mark receives financing from his uncle Bill, a wise but increasingly senile eighty-two-year-old retiree who lives in a dilapidated trailer despite having nearly $300,000 in his bank account. Bill hesitantly agrees to invest in ''Coven'' with the goal of selling three thousand [[VHS]] tapes, which he hopes will raise enough capital to finance ''Northwestern.''  Mark restarts production on ''Coven'' but suffers numerous mishaps. Although he is hard-working and knowledgeable about film making, he is also poor at planning ahead and inarticulate as a director. Additionally, Mark builds his production crew out of friends and neighbors, many of whom are incompetent at the tasks to which Mark assigns them. Particular attention is given to his best friend (and one of the only adept members of the crew) [[Mike Schank]], a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who is in charge of scoring ''Coven.'' Although the two bonded over their shared alcoholism, Mike has coped with his own addictions by joining [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and by becoming a [[compulsive gambling|compulsive gambler]]; in between work on ''Coven,'' Mike goes to the gas station to buy lottery tickets, sometimes accompanied by his AA sponsor, who then drives them both to Gamblers' Anonymous meetings. It is Mike's hope that by winning money on the lottery, he can help Mark finance his movies.  As production goes forward, Mark faces the skepticism of his family and his own burgeoning alcoholism. At Thanksgiving dinner and, later, a family party to watch [[Super Bowl XXXI]], Mark gets drunk and becomes aggressive to his family and friends, and his girlfriend briefly leaves him. Later, a wistful Mark watches amateur footage he shot of ''Northwestern'' in 1990 and contemplates whether or not he is a failure.  Mark finally wraps production of ''Coven'' and it premieres at a local theater in 1997. Mark's family and friends are happy that the project has finally been completed.  In the final scene, Mark goes to visit Uncle Bill and discusses the prospects of future fame and wealth. Bill responds by advising Mark to focus on spiritual matters and bringing happiness into other people's lives.  The closing text reveals that Bill died shortly after in 1997, and left Mark $50,000 in his will to help finance ''Northwestern.''

The day of the meeting arrives, but Vitti has another panic attack. Jelly interrupts Sobel's wedding, requesting Sobel attend the meeting as Vitti's consigliere. Sobel is initially nervous, but his self-confidence grows to the point that he begins to patronize Primo until Primo finally pulls a gun. Vitti arrives, orders Primo to stand down, and announces he knows a traitor in his own family killed Dominic, but will not seek revenge and instead retire from the Mafia. Outside, a standoff ensues between Vitti's and Primo's men, during which Sobel takes a bullet intended for Vitti. The FBI intervenes, the mobsters are arrested, and Sobel is taken to the hospital.  Sobel visits Vitti in prison and Vitti thanks Sobel for his help before informing him that Primo Sindone was recently found dead.

An American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster
 After the events of the third film, but before the second,Fievel, his friend Tony, and his sister Tanya [[Child labour|all get jobs]] at the local newspaper, where the audience is introduced to Nellie, who wants to be an important reporter, but only gets small assignments, as if she were a secretary to Reed, the newspaper's editor. Throughout the film, Tanya tries to win Reed's heart, while Tony tries to get noticed by Reed and promoted to a reporter. As in the previous movies, where a mouse installation is directly below its human installation counterpart, the newspaper offices the mice work in is directly underneath the newspaper offices the humans work in.  Nellie gets a chance when she is assigned to report on mice who disappear overnight into holes that open up on their floor all over [[New York City]]. Reed makes up a, as Nellie calls it, "so-called monster" that lives under [[Manhattan]] and takes mice away during the night to add more excitement to the otherwise unimportant story, intending to sell more papers. The night monster creates fears among the readers, as could be expected. Fievel begins having nightmares that cause him to lose sleep because of his fear of the monster; the film opens up with Fievel having a dream about being chased by what he thinks the monster looks like (a fiery demonic cat with a mouse trap on its tongue). When, through Tanya, he is assigned the job of following Nellie and drawing up interperatations of what the monster looks like based on witness testimony, this makes his [[insomnia]] all the worse. A particularly suspicious miniature French [[poodle]] named Madame Mousey, who has started living among the mice about this time, appears at every crime scene, claiming to be a fortune teller. The heroes finally decide to investigate her by means of the "[[dog]] council" that meets at [[Central Park]]. They also search down one of the holes, which leads directly to a group of cats known as the infamous Outlaw Cats hiding in the sewers. All the mice that had disappeared are being held in wood cages there, to be sold off to other cats and eaten.  The night monster itself, a mechanic device with ghastly flashing pictures and a [[circular saw]], is revealed in full when it attacks the mice newspaper office and printing press to prevent them from printing the truth, which they had just discovered. A great chase scene takes place throughout both the mouse and the human newspaper offices. Reed reveals that he was in love with Nellie all along, leaving Tanya intensely disheartened. When all the cats seem to be under control, the "dog council" appears just as they're regaining consciousness and chase them all away, taking Madame Mousey with them. The last scene takes place at the beach, where the audience is told that the "dog council" had chosen for the French poodle (who was the mastermind behind the night monster all along) a punishment worse than prison: returning her to her owner, Mrs. Abernathy. Mama Mousekewitz, Fievel's mother, surmises saying that now that the mystery has been cleared up, Fievel may finally go to sleep, only to turn around and find him with Yasha his sister already asleep on the beach towel, to which Papa smiles and says, "You were saying?" The Mousekewitz family, including Tony and Tiger, share a group hug as Mama says, "Sweet dreams, my little Fievel. Sweet dreams.", ending the film, and the series.

Among Giants
 Ray (played by Postlethwaite) is a middle-aged Sheffield father of two, down on his luck. Separated from his wife, his life revolves around his close friendship with his much younger flatmate Steve (Thornton) and a passion for climbing.  One summer, the pair and their loose gang of workers gain illicit, cash-in-hand employment painting the [[electricity pylon]]s of the [[Yorkshire Moors]]. Their deadline is tight and their terms of employment precarious, but both are grateful for money and the opportunity to climb daily.  The pattern of life is interrupted by the arrival of footloose Australian backpacker Gerry (Rachel Griffiths). Attractive, and a talented climber, she and Ray fall in love and become a couple despite Steve's apparent interest.  Ray harbours some reluctance at Gerry's wild ways, but manages to overcome these to propose marriage. Gerry too is doubtful that her wandering days are over, and wonders if she can live the staid existence on offer, despite her love for Ray. Things come to a head when she and Steve, both clearly affected by the backpacking bug, are caught drinking vodka atop a tall pylon.   Abseiling recklessly to face an angry Ray, she and Steve are fired on the spot.  In a confrontation, Gerry tells Ray that she cannot commit to the relationship, nor be tied down. Meanwhile, Ray's friendship with an increasingly jealous Steve is also in trouble, and the younger man moves out of the flat, planning his own travels to [[India]]. He and Gerry have a brief sexual encounter, but back out when they recognise the wrongs of their actions.  Gerry waits on Ray's doorstep, hoping for some form of reconciliation, but is rejected. Upset, and undertaking a solo rock climb, she falls and is hospitalised with serious injuries. As Ray is being told this by an emotional Steve, the pylons are electrified as Ray's gang are still at work, and the crew are lucky to escape without electrocution.   This heralds the end of the summer's work, and their elusive paymaster Derek, the electricity company official, arrives on the scene. He is apologetic at the mistake, but cannot say when the workers will receive their pay.  The film ends on an uncertain note, with Steve departing for India, a recovered Gerry deciding to return to Australia, and Ray left standing on the Moors contemplating his scant options.  
Anna and the King
  [[Anna Leonowens]] ([[Jodie Foster]]) is a British widow who has come to Siam with her son [[Louis T. Leonowens|Louis]] ([[Tom Felton]]) to teach English to the dozens of children of King [[Mongkut]] ([[Chow Yun-fat]]). She is a strong-willed, intelligent, valiant and benevolent woman for her time, and this pleases the King.  Mongkut wants to modernize Siam, thinking this will help his country resist colonialism and protect the ancient traditions that give Siam its identity. Mongkut and Anna discuss differences between Eastern and Western love, but he dismisses the notion that a man can be happy with only one wife. In order to win favors through Britain's ambassadors, Mongkut orders a sumptuous reception and appoints Anna to organize it. During the reception, the King spars graciously and wittily with Sir Mycroft Kincaid ([[Bill Stewart (actor)|Bill Stewart]]), of the [[East India Company]].  The Europeans express their beliefs that Siam is a superstitious, backward nation.  Mongkut dances with Anna at the reception.  Anna is enchanted by the royal children, particularly Princess [[Chandrmondol|Fa-Ying]] (Melissa Campbell). The little girl adores the playful monkeys who live in the royal garden's trees. When Fa-Ying falls sick with [[cholera]], Anna is summoned to her chambers to say goodbye. She gets there just as Fa-Ying dies in King Mongkut's arms, and the two mourn together. Mongkut later finds that one of the monkeys "borrowed" his glasses as his daughter used to do.  He finds comfort for his grief in his belief in [[reincarnation]], with a notion that Fa-ying might be reborn as one of her beloved animals. Lady Tuptim ([[Bai Ling]]), the King's newest concubine, was already engaged to marry another man, Khun Phra Balat ([[Sean Ghazi]]), when she was brought to court. Mongkut is kind to her, but Tuptim yearns for her true love.  She disguises herself as a young man and runs away, joining the monastery where her former fiancé lives. She is tracked down, returned to the palace, and put on trial where she is caned. Anna, unable to bear the sight, tries to prevent the execution and is forcibly removed from the court. Her outburst prevents Mongkut from showing clemency, because he cannot be seen as beholden to her, though he feels ashamed. Tuptim and Balat are beheaded publicly.  Siam is under siege from what appears to be a British-funded coup d'état against King Mongkut, using [[Burma|Burmese]] soldiers. Mongkut sends his brother [[Pinklao|Prince Chaofa]] ([[Kay Siu Lim]]) and military advisor General Alak ([[Randall Duk Kim]]) and their troops to investigate. However, it turns out Alak is really the man behind the coup, and he poisons the regiment and kills Chaofa. Alak then flees into Burma, where he summons and readies troops to invade Siam, kill King Mongkut and all his children as revenge since he blames him for his family's death.  Mongkut's army is too far from the palace to engage the rebels, so he creates a ruse - that a [[White elephant (animal)|white elephant]] has been spotted, and the court must go to see it. This allows him to flee the palace with his children and wives, and give his armies time to reach them.  Anna returns to help Mongkut, since her presence in his entourage will give credence to the tale about the white elephant. Mongkut plans to take his family to a monastery where he spent part of his life.  Halfway through the journey they see Alak's army in the distance and realize they can't outrun him. Mongkut and his soldiers set explosives on a wooden [[bridge]] high above a canyon floor as Alak and his army approach. Mongkut orders his "army" to stay back and rides to the bridge with only two soldiers. Alak, at the head of his army, confronts Mongkut on the bridge.  Anna and Louis create a brilliant deception from their hiding spot in the forest.  Louis uses his [[Horn (acoustic)|horn]] to replicate the sound of a bugle charge, as Anna "attacks" the area with harmless fireworks. The Burmese, believing the King has brought British soldiers, panic and retreat. Alak's attempt to recall and regroup his troops fails. Alak stands alone, but Mongkut refuses to kill him, saying that Alak will have to live with his shame. As Mongkut turns to ride back to Siam, Alak grabs his gun and aims at his back, but one of Mongkut's guards detonates the explosives.  The bridge and Alak are blown to pieces.  At the end of the film, Mongkut has one last dance with Anna before she leaves Siam. He tells her that now he understands why a man can be content with only one woman. A voice-over tells viewers that Chulalongkorn became king after his father's death.  Chulalongkorn abolished slavery and instituted religious freedom with the help of his father's 'vision'.

Animal Farm (1999 film)
   As a bleak scene unfolds, animals are seen struggling through the mud as Jessie ([[Julia Ormond]]), an old [[border collie]] (and the narrator of the story) reflects on the events that led them to their current situation. The film flashes back years earlier.  As the abusive and rarely sober farmer, [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]), struggles with debt to neighbor farmer [[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]] ([[Alan Stanford]]), [[Old Major (Animal Farm)|Old Major]] ([[Peter Ustinov]]), the prize boar at Manor Farm, holds a meeting with all the animals in the barn. Major tells the animals that mankind is their enemy, for they serve and provide for mankind without reward. All the animals then start singing an anthem created by Major.The meeting is interrupted when Jones hears the singing (all he hears is just animal noises), stumbles outside the barn and accidentally fires his shotgun, killing Old Major. Jones later uses Old Major for meat. When Jones neglects to feed the animals, [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] ([[Paul Scofield]]), the [[shire horse]], leads the animals to the food shed, and the pigs lead a revolution against Jones, forcing him off the property.  Under the rule of animals, Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm by [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]). Snowball paints on the barn doors what he calls the Seven Commandments of "Animalism". Napoleon also takes Jessie's puppies from her, claiming that it is best for them to receive an education from him.  Snowball, when questioned about the disappearance of the farm's milk and apples by the other animals, confesses that he and the other pigs have taken the milk and apples for themselves. [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] ([[Ian Holm]]) explains that the pigs' well-being takes priority because they are the brains of the farm. Jessie is the only one who is unconvinced.  Having learned that Jones has lost control of his farm, Pilkington leads an invasion into Animal Farm with other local farm workers. Snowball has planned for such an invasion and leads the animals to victory, causing the humans to retreat. In his defeat, Pilkington considers working with the animals instead.  Snowball proposes that the animals build a [[windmill]] to improve their operations, but Napoleon opposes the plan. When the animals show support for Snowball, Napoleon calls Jessie's puppies, now grown dogs trained as his private army, to chase Snowball out of Animal Farm and leaving his fate unknown. Napoleon declares Snowball a "traitor and a criminal," and Squealer claims that the windmill was Napoleon's plan all along; leaving the animals unaware that Napoleon is evil and is, therefore, the ''real'' traitor, with Squealer secretly working as Napoleon's accomplice.   Napoleon declares that a "special committee of pigs will now decide all aspects of the farm" and the animals began constructing the windmill with Boxer's help. When Pilkington begins to trade with the pigs, Boxer remembers Old Major mentioning that animals were not to engage in trade. Napoleon explains that "Animal Farm cannot exist in isolation". Napoleon has the skull of Old Major placed in front of the barn to oversee the Farm's progress and has a statue of himself erected nearby. Jessie confesses to the other animals that she witnessed the pigs living in the house and sleeping in the beds. Squealer explains that no commandment has been broken. He had, in fact, "altered" the commandment, "No animal shall sleep in a bed", to "No animal shall sleep in a bed ''with sheets''."  Jones and his wife sabotage Animal Farm by blowing up the almost-complete windmill with dynamite. Napoleon frames Snowball for the sabotage. The pigs consume more food, leaving the other animals with little to eat. Napoleon declares that Snowball is causing the food shortage and that the hens will have to surrender their eggs to the market. When the hens oppose, Napoleon declares that the hens are all criminals and that no food will be given to them (and that any animal caught giving food to a hen will be punished by death). The pigs produce propaganda films using Jones' filming equipment. While celebrating Napoleon as a leader, the films show the deaths of animals that have broken Napoleon's rules. It is revealed that the commandment, "No animal shall kill any other animal", has been changed to "No animal shall kill any other animal ''without cause''." The commandment, "No animal shall drink alcohol", is also changed to, "No animal shall drink alcohol ''to excess''" after the pigs begin to buy whiskey from Pilkington.  After Boxer collapses from being overworked, Squealer informs Jessie that Napoleon will be sending Boxer to the hospital. Benjamin notices that the van that comes for Boxer is marked with the words "Horse Slaughterer", but Boxer is taken to his death before the other animals can intervene. As Jessie and Benjamin plan to flee from Animal Farm, Napoleon is paid for selling Boxer to the glue factory, and Squealer's latest propaganda film assures the animals that the van was from the hospital, but had been previously been the property of a horse slaughterer. Pilkington and his wife dine with the pigs in the farmhouse, where Napoleon announces that the farm's name will revert to Manor Farm. Watching through a warped glass window, Jessie sees the faces of Pilkington and Napoleon distorted in such a way that she can't tell the difference between them, and Pilkington is overheard bragging to his wife that he made money selling second-rate farm equipment to Napoleon. Muriel and Benjamin notice that the final commandment, "All animals are equal", has been extended to include "but some animals are more equal than others."   The film returns to the present, where Jessie returns to find Manor Farm unattended and in ruins. Napoleon, Squealer, and all the other animals have died, but Jessie finds some dogs who had survived and realizes they are her own puppies. In response, the puppies recognize her as their mother. Jessie sees Napoleon's statue now collapsed, and remarks that she knew that one day, Napoleon's evil, cruelty, and greed would bring about his ruin. A motorcar arrives with a farmer, his wife and children - the new owners of Manor Farm (although the whereabouts of Jones and his wife are unknown). Jessie remarks she will not let this family "make the same mistakes" of the neglect of Jones or the abuse of Napoleon, and is aware the small remnant of animals will now to have work along their new masters to restore the Farm.

Any Given Sunday
  The Miami Sharks, a once-great [[American football]] team, are struggling to make the 2001 Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) [[playoffs]]. They are coached by thirty-year veteran Tony D'Amato ([[Al Pacino]]), who has fallen out of favor with young team owner Christina Pagniacci ([[Cameron Diaz]]) and [[offensive coordinator]] and D'Amato's expected successor Nick Crozier ([[Aaron Eckhart]]). In the thirteenth game of the season, both [[starting quarterback]] Jack "Cap" Rooney ([[Dennis Quaid]]) and second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini ([[Pat O'Hara]]) are injured and forced to leave the field. The desperate Sharks call upon third-string quarterback Willie Beamen ([[Jamie Foxx]]) to replace them. Beamen played college ball at the University of Houston. While a nervous Beamen makes a number of errors and fails to win the game for the Sharks, he plays well and gains confidence. Rooney vows to make it back by the playoffs, with D'Amato promising to not give up on him.  The next day, D'Amato and Pagniacci argue about the direction of the team. Pagniacci favors Crozier and wants to eventually cut Rooney. D'Amato argues that Pagniacci's father, the previous owner, would never meddle in his coaching plans. During the next game, to D'Amato's chagrin, Beamen disregards the team's conservative [[offense (sports)|offense]] and changes plays in the huddle. As the media hails Beaman as the next model of quarterback, the new-found success feeds his growing [[narcissism]] and leads to tension with teammates and coaches. During a confrontation with Beaman, D'Amato [[demotion|demotes]] him back to the bench. After Beamen gives an interview taking sole credit for the Sharks' winning streak, the other players refuse to perform for Beamen and consequently lose a home game. After Beamen gets into a brawl with Julian "J-Man" Washington ([[LL Cool J]]), an irate D'Amato expresses his embarrassment at his team before leaving. Beamen contemplates and amends his self-centered behavior.  As the playoffs come around, Sharks [[middle linebacker]] Luther Lavay ([[Lawrence Taylor]]) reminds Beaman how lucky he is to be in the league and to find a life outside of football; his words fall on deaf ears. D'Amato worsens his relationship with Pagniacci and berates Rooney for second-guessing his availability. Before the game, D'Amato gives a speech urging team unity that Beaman takes to heart. Rooney returns as starting quarterback, but is injured with a [[concussion]] after scoring a [[touchdown]]. Rooney and Pagniacci urge D'Amato to let Beaman finish the game, which after an argument he allows. Beaman apologizes to his teammates for his actions and leads the team to win. He dedicates the next game to Rooney.  At D'Amato's final press conference as head coach, he is thanked by Pagniacci. D'Amato is expected to announce his retirement, but he instead drops a bombshell and announces that he has been hired as head coach and general manager of an [[expansion team]] in [[New Mexico]]. He further infuriates Pagniacci by adding that he has signed Beamen to be his starting quarterback and [[franchise player]].<ref></ref>  
Anti-hero (film)
 In the series, Beverly is ''Magna-Max'', a super-hero with the ability to wield magnetic forces (possibly a reference to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] of [[X-Men]] fame), and Baldwin is the obligatory side-kick, ''Wonder Boy''. Baldwin is not happy with his second-rate status in the series, nor in his own life, and struggles to overcome his despair. He becomes involved with Zamphir (Arndt) who has stolen the only sample of an experimental and potent type of synthetic heroin from a drug gang. After Arndt is killed by the gang attempting to recover their drug sample, Baldwin takes the sample himself, intending to sell it before the gang catches up with him. In short order he finds that the gang is on his trail. He must quickly find a way to sell the drug and make his escape before the gang's hitmen (Tjersland and Sheppard) can find him.  Baldwin's first clue that the gang has found him, is in a scene is where the hitmen have brought in their star assassin, "Magic Fingers", whose expertise with sniper weapons is legendary. While an episode of Magna-Max is being filmed, the three gang members stake out the location, and, with Baldwin in the crosshairs, just as Magic Fingers squeezes the trigger on his scoped rifle, the director of the show, played by the film's director Jaissle in a cameo, unluckily lunges into the path of the bullet and is killed. This then sets off a chase series where Baldwin and Beverly are running through the forest in costume trying to escape being shot to death. Of course, Beverly is not entirely surprised that somebody is upset with his co-star, but is aghast at the level of anger. His question to Baldwin is a classic: "Just who the Hell did you piss off?!"  Because Baldwin knew he was in trouble, just not how close trouble was to him, he had started carrying a pistol, and is able to return fire as he and Beverly flee through the woods. The three heavily-armed hitmen rush ahead and ambush the costumed pair. Unfortunately, Beverly is killed in the ambush, but the enraged Baldwin manages to somehow take out the three professionals, and in a climactic scene he then hunts down and executes a rough justice on the ganglord (Walt).  
Apocalypse II: Revelation
  The film begins with Thorold Stone, a counterterrorist agent, watching home video tapes of his wife and daughter, both of whom have vanished in the [[Rapture]].  The next morning, Stone and his partner, David Nidd, track down and arrest a mysterious terrorist group known as The Haters. Stone orders that the group be taken to the nearest headquarters of O.N.E. - One Nation Earth, the world government opposed by The Haters. While being carted away, a woman named Selma Davis confronts Stone and slips him a disc she claims will reveal the truth about his wife's disappearance.  As they leave the hideout, Stone and Nidd notice a disturbance in a nearby building. When they check it out, they are confronted by Len Parker, the manager of WNN (World News Network). Parker punishes the agents for disobeying orders by shooting them both, and leaves them for dead - displaying supernatural powers when he walks through the wall; yet, Stone mysteriously wakes up to find he is still alive.  In another cell of the Christian Underground, Helen Hannah informs her group that their initial plan with the disc has failed, and O.N.E's exact goals remain obscure. A member named Cindy worries that the public will fail to rise up against O.N.E, since crowds cheered the execution of Hannah's boyfriend, Bronson Pearl, on national television. The group is also mystified by a pair of Virtual Reality headsets they have received by mail.  Meanwhile, at the O.N.E. Headquarters, various alleged Haters are being thrown into cells, half of which were denounced by their own families and sent for [[brainwashing|reeducation]]. Parker's agents inform him that Stone is alive and in possession of the disc. Furious, Parker orders a complete manhunt for Stone. He then vents his feelings by torturing Selma Davis.  Stone, on the run, turns to his friend Willie Spino (a computer expert) for help. He is able to persuade Spino that O.N.E. is not the benign organization it is widely believed to be, and that the so-called Haters know valuable information. Spino manages to hack into O.N.E.'s security system, but this alerts O.N.E. to their location. Desperate, Spino suggests they flee to his stepsister's house; said stepsister in question is revealed to be Helen Hannah, and her house is also her cell's hideout.  Spino discovers that the disc contains a powerful computer virus. The group quickly realize its use - O.N.E. has been sending VR headsets to everybody on Earth, to be activated on the upcoming 'Day of Wonders' but Stone is skeptical about the Christian Underground - he confronts Hannah about God's cruelty in taking millions hostage; however, the former acknowledges O.N.E. as the greater evil and agrees to help upload the virus. Spino is able to sneak Stone into Headquarters by passing him off as a guard.  At midnight, the Day of Wonders begins. Cindy, tempted by curiosity, tries on the headset - and encounters Franco Macalousso, the Leader of O.N.E in person who presents himself as the Messiah, freeing Cindy from her blindness. Fooled, Cindy accepts the Mark of the Beast. She then persuades Spino, with whom she has begun a relationship, to take the Mark. Possessed, Spino and Cindy attempt to kill Hannah, who manages to flee. Hannah then infiltrates the Headquarters with the help of a secret ally - Ron Spalding, a converted guard.  Stone tries on the headset, so that the virus may enter O.N.E's virtual reality. Encountering Macalousso, Stone is almost fooled when he sees illusions of his wife and daughter. He suddenly has an epiphany and realises that Macalousso is the Antichrist. Furious at being rejected, Macalousso prepares to decapitate Stone on a guillotine - but Hannah and Spalding disable the computer running the headset just in time.  Parker, Spino, and Cindy arrive with a group of agents. Parker takes Helen, Spalding and Stone into a room where they join Davis, her daughter, and a young boy. Parker gives the Christians one last chance to renounce God, but meets refusal. As Parker leaves the room, Stone tells Selma that he's sorry and she forgives him. They all start to sing "[[Amazing Grace]]". Outside, the agents pull down a switch, revealing the room to be a giant furnace; yet, Parker is startled when they don't burn - God is protecting them. Parker decides to go into the furnace and kill them himself but when he opens the door, the fire immolates him and invades the entire building. The O.N.E. Headquarters burn down due to the rampaging furnace, killing many people, including Cindy - but leaving the Christians unharmed.  The O.N.E. is temporarily weakened by the sabotage of Virtual Reality and the destruction of their Headquarters.

Anthropophagous 2000
 Three [[Interpol]] agents meet at a cave where several corpses have been uncovered. While the other agents go for backup, Steven Bauers investigates the cavern, finding a journal under one of the bodies. Bauers skims through the journal, which tells the story of Nikos Karamanlis, beginning with him lost at sea with his daughter and pregnant wife.  The film then shows a couple, Mary and Stuart, camping on a beach, where they are murdered by Nikos. At a train station, Mary and Stuart's friends (Vincent, Marc, Caroll, Rita and Georg) head to a vacation home in [[Borgo San Lorenzo]], where they expect to rendezvous Mary, Stuart and Caroll's husband Stan (who is preoccupied with work). The quintet reach the outskirts of Borgo San Lorenzo, where their RV breaks down. Georg, Rita and Marc go ahead (finding the village full of bodies and abandoned except for an elusive woman in black) while Vincent stays with Caroll, who had twisted her ankle. Nikos kills Vincent, abducts Caroll, moves the RV, and disposes of two nearby campers, Hank and Allan.  Georg, Rita and Marc take shelter in the vacation home, where they find Mary's blind sister, Auriet, hiding in the basement. The next day, the group reach the Karamanlis estate, where Nikos's sister Irena (the woman in black) commits suicide by leaping out a window. Inside the house, Georg finds more bodies and Nikos's journal, which he reads as Marc wanders off, running into Stan. They search for Caroll and Vincent, but Marc falls behind and is impaled on a stake by Nikos. Stan finds Caroll in the cave, and they are confronted by Nikos, who flashes back to accidentally killing his wife (during an argument over whether they should eat their dead daughter) while lost at sea. With his wife dead, Nikos ate her and their daughter to survive. After recollecting, Nikos impales Stan through the head with a machete, and cuts out and eats Caroll's unborn child.  Realizing Marc is gone, Georg, Rita and Auriet look for him, with Auriet being killed by Nikos when she becomes separated from the others. After hours of wandering, Georg and Rita are ambushed by Nikos, who rips Rita's head off. Georg shoots Nikos several times, prompting Nikos to reach into the wounds, rip some of his own innards out, and gnaw on them. Despite the severity of his injuries, Nikos continues to attack Georg and tries to drown him in a pool, but becomes distracted when he hears his wife's voice. Georg gains the upper hand, and beheads Nikos with a shovel, at Nikos's own insistence.  In the present, Bauers ponders how the journal got into the cave, and how it could be so thorough. As he exits the cave, Bauers finds what appears to be Georg's cell phone, and has his head shot off by an unseen assailant.

The Astronaut's Wife
 Spencer Armacost ([[Johnny Depp]]) is a [[NASA]] astronaut and his wife Jillian ([[Charlize Theron]]) is a teacher. While he and Alex Streck ([[Nick Cassavetes]]) are walking in space on a mission there is an explosion that knocks out their communication with the command center.  They land but when their spouses arrive to see them they are in the hospital; both asleep until they recover. Armacost eventually wakes up without problems, but Streck has a medical emergency requiring him to have an electrical [[cardioversion]]. Neither speak about the in-flight emergency. Armacost accepts a position with a New York-based company, McClaren. At a farewell party, Streck's aggressive behavior catches Jillian's attention before he suddenly dies from what NASA attributes to a stroke. At the Streck house Natalie Streck ([[Donna Murphy]]) electrocutes herself in the bath with a radio.   In New York at a party, Jillian asks Spencer to tell her about the space walk incident. He answers while he starts to make love to her. At home he makes aggressive love to her. In the background is a crackling radio noise. She finds out she is pregnant, and at an ultrasound discovers she is having twins. She tells the doctor that earlier in her life, after her parents died, she sought psychiatric care because she started to see her loved ones dead, including herself.   Sherman Reese ([[Joe Morton]]) has been terminated from NASA because he continued to insist that something was wrong with Spencer, though all tests came back normal. Reese confronts Jillian to warn her, and she leaves in fear, wanting to believe he is crazy but knowing he is right about Spencer being different. Jillian calls Reese and he tells her that Natalie was pregnant with twins at the time of her suicide. Jillian asks what the autopsy showed about the twins and Reese tells Jillian that he needs to meet her in person to show her. Spencer intercepts him, and he goes missing. As a backup plan, he has sent her a key to a self storage locker that has a [[VHS]] video cassette that explains that there was a signal in space near Spencer and Streck when they lost contact with NASA. He believes the signal was an alien that wanted to get to Earth, and traveled as a sound wave through space and took over Spencer's body. He believes it will use her twins to pilot the McClaren plane that it is designing that disables warfare machinery. Jillian attempts a medical abortion but is thwarted by Spencer who slaps her. She throws herself down a flight of stairs and wakes up in the hospital. Spencer tells her that the twins survived the fall and intimidates her to keep her mouth shut about what happened.  In a dream, Jillian sees her sister, Nan ([[Clea DuVall]]), killed by Spencer when she questions why he has Reese's briefcase. Jillian leaves the hospital on her own but Spencer follows her because of his connection with the twins inside her. At home, Jillian barricades the door and goes into the room where she dreamed her sister was killed. She sees her body on the floor, but then it is gone, presumably a vision. When Spencer breaks his way into the apartment, she has flooded the kitchen floor with water, with a radio in the sink and an extension cord plugged into the wall. She holds the ends of the cords in each hand and tells Spencer to stay away from her. She notices bloody nail marks on Spencer's hand and she knows that her sister really is dead, as she dreamed. She tells Spencer she doesn't know who he is, that he killed her sister and her husband. He tells her he did, and that he lives inside of her now. Water begins pouring down from the ceiling, as Jillian turned on all of the water in the bathroom upstairs. Spencer is engulfed in the water, Jillian lifts her feet off the wet floor, connects the cords and electrocutes the alien. The alien leaves Spencer's body and transmits into Jillian.  Jillian has remarried and her twin sons are off on their first day of school. Her sons look back before boarding the bus with a look on their face before they smile and are on their way. Jillian assures the stepfather that he is now their father.  
Arlington Road
 Michael Faraday ([[Jeff Bridges]]) is a widower and college history professor at [[George Washington University]] with a son, Grant ([[Spencer Treat Clark]]). While driving he encounters a boy, Brady ([[Mason Gamble]]), staggering in the road with horrific injuries to his hands. Michael takes him to hospital, and meets his parents Oliver ([[Tim Robbins]]) and Cheryl Lang ([[Joan Cusack]]), discovering they are his neighbors. The families soon become friends, and their sons join the Discoverers, a Scouts-style group.  Actions of the Langs arouse latent suspicion in Michael. Michael sees blueprints in the Lang's house which are not for the building project Oliver, a structural engineer, claims, and a wrongly delivered letter suggests he lied about where he attended college. After Michael describes impersonal treatment from the government after his wife, an FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty, Oliver states his belief that the government should be punished for its mistakes. Michael's girlfriend, Brooke ([[Hope Davis]]), and his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver ([[Robert Gossett]]), dismiss Michael's concerns as paranoia.  Michael takes his college class on a field trip to the site of the standoff in which his wife was killed, and passionately excoriates the government for failing to sufficiently investigate the besieged family, and for provoking the standoff. Michael's students appear uneasy.  Oliver tells Michael that Grant wishes someone could be punished for his mother's death, at which Michael is again suspicious. Michael discovers in archives that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he tried to blow up a post office in Kansas at age 16. He is seen by Oliver, who is incensed and later confronts him, condemning his presumption of judgment. Oliver states that he sought revenge on the government for causing his father's suicide, that he was imprisoned, and admits to changing his identity to hide his past from his children.  Michael appears to let the matter drop. However, Brooke later sees Oliver swap cars with a stranger in a parking lot, and follows him to a delivery depot where a number of metal boxes are exchanged. From a payphone, she leaves Michael a message that his suspicions may have been correct, but is discovered by Cheryl.  Michael learns of Brooke's (off-screen) death on the news, where it appears she died in a car crash. He discovers inadvertently that messages left on his answering machine had been erased, and again suspects foul play, telling Whit about Oliver/William and asking him to check FBI records, and records of calls to his home.  Michael visits the father of Dean Scobee, accused of blowing up a federal building in St. Louis, from where the Langs had moved. Dr. Scobee is certain his son was innocent since 10 children died in the bombing. Michael becomes certain Dean was set up and panics when he sees a photo of Dean in a Discoverer troop with Brady, with whom Grant is currently on a field trip, and rushes to retrieve him. Troop leaders tell him that Grant was taken home with Brady. Michael confronts Oliver at his home, where he confirms that his group killed Brooke, and implies that Grant will be killed if Michael tries to involve others.  Whit accosts Michael the following day, stating the FBI discovered nothing suspicious about Oliver/William or his acquaintances, and says that Michael's 'missing' telephone message was from a payphone. The next day, Michael drives to the payphone where he sees a passing delivery vehicle. He follows it to its depot, where he sees men he recognizes from Oliver's house and from Discoverer photographs, loading metal boxes into the van.  Michael follows the van and is shocked to see Grant at the window, and gives chase. Oliver intercepts Michael's car, causing a crash, and beats him, saying Michael will not see Grant again. Oliver expounds on his group's anti-government mission, and their current target the FBI. Michael overpowers Oliver and drives to [[FBI headquarters]], calling Whit to warn him.  Michael sees a delivery van at the gate and illegally pursues it into the secure parking garage, but discovers that the van has a different driver and is empty. Whit tells Michael that he is the only unauthorized person in the building. Michael rushes back to his own car, discovering a bomb in the trunk seconds before it detonates. The blast partially collapses the FBI headquarters, as Oliver watches impassively from a distance.  In a montage of television news clips, Michael is portrayed as a [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lonewolf]] terrorist who had sought revenge on the FBI for his wife's death. Statements from his students (one of whom is a conspirator) support the official story, giving accounts of his erratic and paranoid behavior and inferring that he held a dangerous grudge against the FBI. Grant, now orphaned, moves in with relatives, tragically unaware of his father's innocence.  The final scene implies that the Langs, who successfully misdirected law enforcement, will soon move house in preparation for another attack.  
At First Sight (1999 film)
 Amy Benic ([[Mira Sorvino]]) takes a vacation at a spa outside [[New York City]]. Virgil Adamson ([[Val Kilmer]]) is a masseur at the spa and gives Amy a massage. Amy inexplicably cries and Virgil comforts her. While complimenting Virgil on the massage, Amy realizes that Virgil is blind. Virgil asks her out, and the two eventually begin a relationship.  Virgil lives alone, though his over-protective sister Jennie ([[Kelly McGillis]]) lives next door and takes care of him. Virgil reveals that he went blind when he was three and that the last thing he saw was something fluffy. While researching Virgil's condition, Amy learns of Doctor Charles Aaron, a specialist in eye treatment who suggests to Virgil that, with surgery, he could restore his sight. Virgil angrily refuses. Jennie reveals that their father left the family after putting Virgil through several kinds of treatments in order to restore his sight.   Virgil eventually decides he will give the operation a try. It is a success, but after Virgil regains sight, he becomes confused and disoriented, unable to perceive light and distance. Dr. Aaron suggests that he should visit Phil Webster ([[Nathan Lane]]), a visual physiotherapist. Webster in turn suggests that Virgil needs to learn everything from scratch himself, through experience.   Virgil and Amy begin living in New York City. The pair begin drifting apart, as Virgil finds it hard to decipher the look on Amy's face at times. Amy finds herself constantly having to explain basic things to Virgil. While at a party, Virgil walks into a glass pane due to his poor perception.  Virgil's father sees him on television and arranges a reunion; Virgil goes to his father's workplace, but decides at the last minute that he cannot face him yet.  On one of the regular visits with Webster, they engage in a deep conversation, where Webster notes that instead of just "seeing", Virgil should "look"; there are a lot of things that sight alone cannot solve. Virgil confesses that he and Amy are drifting apart, but insists that Amy is the most important thing in his life.  Upon returning from a work trip to [[Atlanta]], where she and her ex-husband shared a sensual moment, Amy decides to save the relationship. She finds Virgil in a park looking for "the horizon" in the city.  Virgil's sight begins deteriorating. After consulting with Dr. Aaron, Virgil realizes that he is losing his sight yet again. He decides to look for his father. Virgil reveals to him that he is going blind again, and asks him why he left. His father tells him that he felt he was a failure when he did not find a way to help his son regain sight. Virgil states that he should not have left because his mother and sister suffered greatly after his father walked away.  Virgil looks for Amy, who tells him about her plans to travel with him to places like Egypt and Europe. Withholding the fact that he is again going blind, Virgil tells her there is one thing he really wants to see, and brings her to a [[New York Rangers]] game.  At the game, Virgil realizes that the "fluffy cloud" he last remembers seeing was cotton candy. He suffers a lengthened vision blackout and admits to Amy that he is going blind, which Amy refuses to accept. Back home, Virgil and Amy argue. He asks if she wants to spend her life with him if he is going to be blind forever. Amy hesitates, and Virgil decides to return home. Virgil eases back into his old way of life. While losing his sight, Virgil decides to look at as many things as possible, going through magazines and pictorial books in the library. He stays up to watch the sunset, seeing the horizon for the first and last time.  After he has been blind again for some time, Virgil is at a park with a guide dog. Amy approaches and they reconnect. Amy apologizes to Virgil for trying to change him and for moving too fast. She asks if he wants to take a walk and "see what they see". They leave the park together.  
Ashes to Ashes (1999 film)
 ''Ashes to Ashes'' is set in [[London]], [[England]]. The film is a [[Surrealism|surreal]] journey into the dreams and misadventures of Gabriel Darbeaux, a young screenwriter and martial arts enthusiast who supplements his income by [[Male escort|escort]]ing wealthy women. We are introduced to Gabriel’s character as he is chased and cornered by a group of [[Triad society|Triad]]  thugs armed with swords, sticks and [[nunchaku]]. Using his own nunchaku Gabriel manages to fight off the thugs, only to find that the whole episode was an early morning dream. The dream provides inspiration for the opening scene of his latest screenplay entitled "Ashes to Ashes", a thriller involving the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Italian Mafia|Mafia]], [[China|Chinese]] [[Triad society|Triads]] and a generous amount of [[martial arts]] action.  While Gabriel believes that the success of this [[Screenplay|script]] will give him financial independence, his best friend Michael has plans of setting up his own [[escort agency]]. To fund this project, he resorts to making secret recordings of his sexual encounters with a banker’s wife and hopes to earn £100,000 through [[blackmail]]. Gabriel receives a call to meet with one of his regular clients at an exclusive restaurant in the [[West End of London]]. The woman fails to show and instead Gabriel encounters the beautiful Arabella Simone, who draws him into a world which is disturbingly similar to that featured in his screenplay. Arabella is the former mistress to Valentino Tarantola, a possessive [[Italy|Italian]] [[gangster]] who employs "Laundrymen" Muhammed and Nelson to do his dirty work. When Valentino is apparently [[Castration|castrated]] and left for dead at Arabella’s apartment, she runs to Gabriel for help with the "Laundrymen" close on her tail. Michael is called in to drive the two to a main line station from where they plan to take a train to [[France]]. Unfortunately, before the trio get very far, they are captured by the "Laundrymen" and taken to a warehouse where they are introduced to Enrico Tarontola, Valentino's sadistic younger brother. Bound and gagged, they are forced to listen helplessly as Enrico accuses Arabella of castrating and killing his brother Valentino and Michael of blackmailing his financial advisor's wife. All three, including Gabriel are to be put to a violent death. Without warning, [[Henchman|henchmen]] of a rival Triad  boss storm the warehouse. In the ensuing battle, Gabriel is forced to fight for his life against Triad  enforcers and Mafia hitmen. The film ends with Gabriel waking from a violent dream, blurring the distinction between dream, reality and the fictional account that Gabriel is writing.  
Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar
 [[Julius Caesar]] is celebrating his victory over all of Gaul, but Lucius Detritus has kept from him that one village has managed to resist them. Detritus travels to the garrison near the village where Caius Bonus (Crismus Bonus), the garrison's commanding [[Centurion]], explains that the Gauls have a magic potion, which makes them invincible. Detritus decides to capture the potion for himself, and hearing that the clever Asterix and permanently invincible Obelix are the backbone of the Gaulish forces, attempts and fails to eliminate them.  A false soothsayer arrives at the village and predicts the arrival of Romans and treasure; despite Asterix's protests, the village believe him, wherefore when a Roman tax collector arrives, they drive off his forces and take the gold. The "soothsayer" later drugs and hypnotises Asterix to create a diversion while he recaptures the tax money; but news of the theft reaches Caesar, who comes to the garrison himself, demanding the legion attack. Upon witnessing the defeat of his army, he demands Detritus subdue the village or be fed to the lions.  Detritus disguises himself and some men as Druids and kidnaps Panoramix (Getafix) at a Druid conference. Asterix disguises Obelix as a legionary, and they enter the garrison to rescue the Druid, but are separated. Asterix joins Getafix in the dungeon, where the pair resist Detritus' demands to make the magic potion, until he tortures Idefix (Dogmatix). Detritus uses the potion to throw Caesar into a cell (locked in an [[Man in the Iron Mask|iron mask]]), and takes command with an oblivious Obelix as his bodyguard. Obelix later helps Asterix, Getafix, Dogmatix, and Caesar escape.  Caesar co-operates with the Gauls to defeat Detritus, who mounts an attack on the villagers using his own magic potion. To defeat him, Panoramix brews a special version of the potion which creates dozens of duplicates of Asterix and Obelix. Caesar is returned to power, and grants the village its freedom.  ===Differences from the books=== *It is revealed early in the film that the magic potion used by the Gauls only lasts for ten minutes. Such a short time limit is not implied in the original books, wherein the potion's effects can last for several hours, such as disguised legionary Caligula Minus holding a rock up for several hours in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' or crooked adviser Codfix retaining superhuman strength until well into the daytime after drinking a ladleful of potion at night in ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide]]''. *In the book [[Asterix and the Roman Agent]], a character named Detritus (in the original French version) was an agent of Caesar who was a master of manipulating people. In the movie Detritus appears to be more based on Crismus Bonus from [[Asterix the Gaul]] or Felonius Caucus from the book [[Asterix and the Big Fight]]. *The fraudulent fortune-teller Prolix is based on the character of the same name in [[Asterix and the Soothsayer]] - like in the book Asterix is the only villager who doesn't believe his false prophecies. In the film, Prolix manages to escape with stolen gold (which he conned the villagers into stealing from the Romans) and is not seen again, whereas in the book Prolix was ultimately exposed as a phony when the Gauls managed to surprise him (thereby proving he couldn't really see the future). *Getafix's grandfather, who appears in the movie, is not mentioned in any of the books. *In the books, Obelix's affection for Panacea was mostly comedic. In the movie, the romance is played for dramatic effect and is taken much more seriously. *The unnamed wife of village elder Geriatrix is depicted as intensely concerned about her husband getting hurt in the film (she runs after him desperately telling him to not join in when the villagers have a fish fight and later when they attack a Roman legion) - in the books Mrs Geriatrix seems to be casually dominant over her husband, who humbly does everything she tells him to. *Dogmatix appears to be Asterix's dog in the movie, not Obelix's.  
Asukh
 Rohini is found discussing with a person who is slowly revealed as her ex-boyfriend and asks if he remembered her. Although he says yes, she doesn’t believe him and instead asks for the medicine box and takes 3 to 5 sleeping pills. Even after Aniruddha forbids her, she takes them all, saying that it should not affect him. The reason for this bitterness is revealed. Aniruddha had left her for another girl named Mrittika. Rohini was a famous film star and her love for her man was unblemished. She had brought Mrittika into the industry, and suffered Caesar’s wounds when Aniruddha started an affair with her. When Mrittika and Aniruddha started coming close, Rohini had confronted Aniruddha several times to tell the truth but he always tried to hide the fact and that had hurt her more. While she was facing such turbulent times in her life and wanted to be all alone, she comes to know that her mother is hospitalized with high fever. Unaware of the deteriorating relationship among Aniruddha and Rohini, her father often asks help from him despite Rohini showing irritation. Neither she is able to vent out her emotions as she knows her father is also going through tough times, nor is she able to digest the fact that Aniruddha is called off and on. She tries to avoid him, as we see couple of times, she lies to avoid him and even does not pick up any call assuming it to be Aniruddha. On the other hand, on seeing a difference in Rohini’s behavior her father is upset; he even finds her taking frequent sleeping pills and is worried about her. Ghosh neatly brings in the father-daughter relationship –he shows how the father worries about his daughter even after she has grown up. There is a scene in the movie which shows that, when there is a power cut, her father doesn’t allow her daughter to move, going himself to fetch the torch to light up the place, similarly like a father showing light of right path to their children. He didn’t think that he himself can be hurt, but only thought to protect his child from the darkness just like a shield. There are some more scenes where Ghosh brilliantly brought out the pure love of a Father for his daughter. In contrast, he also shows that even though her father is unwilling to take her money, he still has to depend on her, and this constantly bothers him, which is seen when he expresses his views to his wife that they are depending on her money completely. The film also shows how a husband loves his wife; he is not only worried about her but also sad at the same time that she is far from him and suffering from pain. Despite being old himself, he never missed to go to the hospital one single day, buying all the medicines and other necessary itinerary. Due to her daughter’s fame, when he was allowed to stay longer during visiting hours, the happiness in his face explained his love for his wife. Even Rohini quotes several times that even after she got betrayal and disappointment from her relation, she keeps consoling herself when she sees her parents; their relationship makes her feel that love has not vanished from the society, it’s still present. But destiny plays it role and we are unable to predict the future. The same Rohini who thought of her parent’s relation as pure, started doubting her father after her mother is attacked by fever again after the discharge from the hospital. They thought of taking second opinion and the doctor suggested for HIV test as he think this may be due to lack of immunity. The hatred was installed in her mind after getting betrayed by Aniruddha and she was unable to think rationally. She started thinking for the worst, repeatedly asking her father if the needles used were sterilized and on getting same answer from him every time (that he himself bought the disposable injections every time), her mind was shrouded in doubt that her father was the only source for her mother’s illness. Ghosh, may be for the first time, brought in to the Bengali cinemas the awareness for AIDS and at the same time dealt with fear and anxiety in a sensitive manner. The rude behavior of the daughter brings a distance between them but still father’s love for her daughter did not diminish. The blood test result revealed that her mother is not suffering from AIDS. At the end, Rohini realizes her mistake; she realizes that everything is in one’s mind, and people themselves can control that. She vents out all her sorrow to her father, when he comes to know that Aniruddha has left her. Her father consoles her but asks is she the person who said in an interview that there is no more love and trust left in the society. She says nothing but begs pardon from her father.

Audition (1999 film)
 Shigeharu Aoyama ([[Ryo Ishibashi]]), a middle-aged widower, is urged by his 17-year-old son, Shigehiko ([[Tetsu Sawaki]]), to begin dating again. Aoyama's friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa ([[Jun Kunimura]]), a film producer, devises a mock casting audition at which young women audition for the "part" of Aoyama's new wife. Aoyama agrees to the plan and is immediately enchanted by Asami Yamazaki ([[Eihi Shiina]]), attracted to her apparent emotional depth.  Yoshikawa develops misgivings about Asami after he is unable to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.  Aoyama tries to track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, all of the contacts are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling the effects of the drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.  Aoyama collapses from the drug. Asami injects him with a paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like everyone else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.  
Attack the Gas Station
 Having robbed and thoroughly destroyed a gas station, a group of street thugs with their own gripes against society sit in a convenience store and out of sheer boredom, decide to rob the same gas station (as the title card reads, "Why do they attack the gas station?  Just because!"). But, since the manager had the foresight and sense to stash the money away, the four gang members take the manager and the employees hostage and stick around, dispensing gas to all the customers and keeping the money.  A range of characters stop for gas throughout the film, not all with good intentions, but with ludicrous results. A gang of school bullies come by the gas station to harass one of the employees for money (they end up being taken hostages, while the bullied employee ends up being forced into a fist fight with one of the bullies... and wins) The police come by demanding free gasoline (the four thugs refuse, as the police clearly aren't doing their job). A customer refuses to pay for a full tank of gas, only asking for half a tank, and is taken hostage. More school bullies come by the gas station, seeking revenge for the first fight, but then they too are taken hostage. The four titular thugs also order unusually large amounts of food from a Chinese restaurant, and the deliveryman becomes suspicious.  It's not long until they start attracting the wrong kind of attention, which leads to a violent confrontation with the police and further gang members. The fight ends when No Mark sprays everyone in the chaos with gasoline and threatens to throw a lighter at them. The four thugs escape while everyone else remains panicked at the gas station.  During the credits, four scenes show what the characters do after the events in the film: Paint appears to be a successful painter, but he angers a customer when he celebrates by spilling red paint all over one of the paintings. Rockstar restarts his career as a lead singer, and he bosses his members as they prepare for their next performance. Bulldozer becomes a policeman, and he scolds teenagers for smoking. He punishes the kids the same way he dealt with the hostages, and warns them about their futures by alluding to his own past. No Mark joins a baseball team, but accidentally hits the catcher while pitching.

Au Pair (film)
 Jennifer Morgan ([[Heidi Lenhart|Heidi Noelle Lenhart]]) is an [[MBA]] looking for a job as an executive at Oliver Caldwell’s ([[Gregory Harrison]]) company.  Through a series of errors, she is given a job as the ''[[au pair]]'' for his children, Katie ([[Katie Volding]]) and Alex (Jake Dinwiddie).  The kids have been spoiled by Oliver since their mother died, and they have become quite the trouble makers. Oliver is engaged to Vivian Berger ([[Jane Sibbett]]), who dislikes the children and becomes jealous of Jennifer as she bonds with them. The kids, preferring Jennifer (though, in the beginning played pranks on her) to Vivian, play matchmaker, and expose the plotting Vivian for who she really is.  In the ending of this movie, when Oliver arrives at his splendidly beautiful castle, he discovers that his ruthless and corrupt fiancée, Vivian, has already made arrangements for their wedding and that they were going to get married that very evening.  Later on, Jennifer, Alex, and Katie arrive, and Oliver demands to speak with Jennifer. To Alex and Katie's dismay, Jennifer is mercilessly fired by their father (because Vivian told Oliver that Jennifer was plotting against his company) just moments before the ceremony begins. Alex, then, comes up with an idea to spy on Vivian and her clumsy, odd sisters. As the children, Nigel (family chauffeur) ([[John Rhys-Davies]]), and Oliver spy on Vivian in her boudoir, Vivian reveals her evil plots and schemes.  Infuriated, Oliver bursts into the boudoir and breaks up with Vivian. Oliver storms out of the castle with Vivian and her wacky sisters chasing after him. Once they descend upon the bridge, Vivian demands that Oliver hand over her ring. Oliver takes the ring out of his coat pocket, throws it over the bridge, and into the water. Vivian, then, blindly launches herself off the bridge in her silk bridal gown and plummets into the water. Vivian's sisters try to catch their sister as she falls, but they end up falling into the water as well. Vivian emerges from the depths of water and angrily pounds the water's surface with her clenched fists.  Later, Jenny and Oliver share a kiss.  
Baadshah (1999 film)
  Raj ([[Shah Rukh Khan ]]) is a young man living with his mother who wishes to follow in his late father's footsteps by working as a detective named Baadshah. He runs Baadshah Detective Agency out of a [[Mumbai]] office full of cheesy detective gadgetry. In his employ are his loyal and helpful friends, and his chief assistant Ram Lal ([[Johnny Lever]]). Though Baadshah tries hard to pass his agency off as highly sophisticated and constantly busy, he actually receives little business, and is desperate for a big break.  Suraj Singh Thapar ([[Amrish Puri]]) is a business tycoon whose bio-chemical plant is due to be shut down following a preventable industrial accident. It will be shut down by the popular [[Chief Minister of Goa]], Gaytri Bachchan ([[Rakhee Gulzar]]). As a result, he resolves to have her killed. For the job, he has Rani ([[Deepshikha]]), his young henchwoman, hire Shiva, Mumbai's notorious contract-killer. Meanwhile, a man by the name of K. Jhunjhunwala ([[Avtar Gill]]) comes to Baadshah with a strange case. He claims he is dying of a [[brain tumor]] and wants to see his daughter married to the suitable bachelor accompanying him, Nitin, before he dies. The young woman, Seema ([[Twinkle Khanna]]), refuses to marry Nitin, hence the need for Baadshah's help. Baadshah comes up with an elaborate plan for the jon: he woos Seema with lies and has her fall in love with him, only to dump her later. Nitin comforts her, and Baadshah collects his payment. However, his feelings for her prove to be genuine.  Unbeknownst to Baadshah, Jhunjhunwala and Nitin are actually a father-son team wanted by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]. The marriage of Nitin to Seema, who is actually the sister of CBI Secret Agent Deepak Malhotra ([[Deepak Tijori]]) is meant to stop investigation into their bank fraud case. The plan fails when Agent Malhotra arrests the Jhunjhunwalas before the marriage can take place. It is revealed by the CBI that Shiva's attempt on Gaytri Bachchan's life failed as a result of his death in a car accident. Fearing a second attempt, CBI headquarters tasks Agent Malhotra with providing further protection for the minister in [[Goa]]. Malhotra is assigned the codename "Baadshah" for the mission. Thapar becomes informed of this and speaks to Rani who plans with her boyfriend, Moti ([[Sharat Saxena]]), travel to the airport to eliminate Secret Agent "Baadshah" and have Moti assume his identity to gain access to Bachchan and carry out the assassination.  At the same time, Baadshah the detective gets a job from Mahendra Seth ([[Anant Mahadevan]]). Manikchand ([[Razzak Khan]]) and Saxena ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) want to gain his diamonds and have kidnapped the businessman's child for ransom. Baadshah and his friend are given tickets to Goa, where the child is being held. Both "Baadshahs" are scheduled for the same flight. Agent Malhotra arrives at the ticket counter and Rani identifies him as Baadshah. This information is passed onto Moti, who quietly kills Malhotra. Baadshah comes up to the ticket counter and is mistakenly given Agent 420's ticket. Baadshah also finds Malhotra's fallen computer disk. At this point, Baadshah has functionally switched places with the deceased agent. Moti arrives at the ticket counter announcing himself as Baadshah and is given the real Baadshah's ticket. During the flight Rani realizes Moti killed the wrong man. Seema and her partner Tom Uncle are at the Goa airport expecting Agent Malhotra but see Baadshah instead. Seema knows him as Raj and wonders what he is up to. Baadshah meets CBI Agent Adi Chopra ([[Adi Irani]]) and thinks he works for Mahendra Seth while Agent Chopra believes Baadshah is the secret CBI Agent. They leave the airport and go meet CBI Dr. Rusi Surti ([[Neeraj Vora]]) who gives Baadshah an assortment of top-secret gadgets and a [[James Bond]]-style car for assistance on his mission. They commend him about the way he solved the Jhunjhunwalas' case, which Baadshah is shocked to learn is regarding them being arrested for bank fraud. He realizes that Jhunjhunwala lied to him earlier and that he made a big mistake with Seema.  Back at the airport, Baadshah's friends are picked up by a driver posing for Mahendra Seth but he's employed by Manikchand and Saxena the kidnappers. Seema, who had been following Baadshah, arranges to meet with him. They meet and he apologizes to her about what happened before. They reconcile temporarily but Seema wants to know what happened to Agent Malhotra. Moti interrupts their conversation and Seema flees while Baadshah and Moti fight. Baadshah remembers that he previously saw Moti back at the Mumbai airport pushing a man in the wheelchair, who Moti admits he had killed. Baadshah escapes and later receives a call from the kidnappers. He is told by the kidnappers to meet to exchange the diamonds for the child at Saint Paul school the next day. During the call Baadshah notices in a reflection that Seema is secretly nearby. Seema searches Baadshah's hotel room and finds the computer disk and takes it, unaware that Baadshah is watching her. She checks the disk and finds out that Agent Malhotra and CBI highly suspect Thapar as the man behind the assassination attempt. Seema and Tom Uncle now suspect that Baadshah is a fraud who took her brother's place and is working with Thapar in his plan to kill Bachchan. She heads to Thapar's club to meet Thapar, where Baadshah also shows up after following Seema. Thapar thinks Baadshah is the substitute that Rani arranged for, while Baadshah thinks Thapar is the Chief for Mahendra Seth. Baadshah tells Thapar that the work will be done the next day at Saint Paul school. Thapar thinks Baadshah is talking about the murder of Bachchan, who coincidentally has a program planned at Saint Paul school the next day as well.  The next day, Baadshah meets with the kidnappers to do the exchange. Finding the child and his friends, Baadshah saves them and captures the criminal duo. He sends Ram Lal and the others to an address given by Thapar. Baadshah thinks his friends will meet Thapar to return the diamonds and the child while Thapar thinks they have kidnapped Bachchan and are bringing her to him. Baadshah drives the kidnappers towards town. Back at Saint Paul school, Seema tells security about the planned assassination. Khanna ([[Pankaj Dheer]]), the corrupt chief security officer is informed and sends his men after Seema to kill her for knowing their secret. Baadshah spots her being chased while driving back and saves her. They both discuss everything they know and come to realize their misunderstandings. Rani and Moti secretly listen to and witness everything as well and they too understand the confusion. Seema and Baadshah find themselves in dire straits; Seema learns that Agent Malhotra, who she reveals was her brother, is dead; and Baadshah's friends and the child are now in the custody of Thapar, who isn't who Baadshah thought he was.  Thapar meets with Baadshah's friends and the child and is confused. Rani shows up with Moti and explains all the misunderstanding. Thapar decides to use the situation to his advantage. He forces Baadshah to assassinate Bachchan himself or else Thapar will kill his friends and the child. The key players travel to the Holiday Inn, where Bachchan is to speak at 12:30pm during a conference. The child is strapped to a bomb vest and held hostage in a van monitored by Moti and Baadshah's friends are held in a high-rise room monitored by Rani. Baadshah makes multiple attempts to have his gun taken away by security to get out of having to shoot Bachchan, but he realizes that the entire on-site security force is in cahoots with Thapar, keeping tabs on Baadshah. At one point during a conference by Bachchan, Baadshah quietly meets Sheetal, Bachchan's PA, and informs her about the assassination plan and the desperate situation that he is in, asking her for help. After being told that the security team is corrupt, Sheetal decides to take Baadshah up to meet the CM's husband, Tyagraj Bachchan ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), to tell him about the danger his wife is in. However, he kills Sheetal and it is revealed that he is behind the plan to kill his wife. Thapar and Khanna tell Baadshah that he has another chance to kill Bachchan during a speech scheduled at 2pm.  Baadshah secretly writes a message in a note for Bachchan which Seema (under disguise as a hotel worker) places inside the CM's speech script folder while in her room. With Seema's assistance, Baadshah escapes the building via a washroom window to go rescue his friends and the child. He succeeds but Baadshah and his friends realize that they don't know how to diffuse or remove the bomb strapped to the child, and so Baadshah must head back into the hotel. He returns to the washroom just before Khanna realizes he left. It's 2pm and they now head to the speech hall. Baadshah is confident that Bachchan will not come down after reading his message but is shocked to see Bachchan arrive at the hall and knows he must make a move as Thapar still has control of the detonator. Baadshah slowly approaches Bachchan as she arrives at the podium and discovers the note written to her. She reads it and learns of the assassination plan and that the mastermind behind it is her husband, who lied to her about Sheetal's disappearance. She learns that Baadshah will have to shoot her if she comes down for her speech. Bachchan notices Baadshah coming towards the front and knows what he is being compelled to do.  In a climatic moment, Baadshah pulls out his gun and opens fire upon the security personnel, triggering a shootout. He manages to wipe them all out, including Khanna. Thapar realizes he has the chance to shoot Bachchan himself and fires at her. Her personal bodyguard tries to cover her and they both fall to the ground. She survives, much to the shock of her husband who tries to flee but is stopped by CBI officers. Thapar is also shocked when she sees Bachchan stand up and he tries to shoot her once again but Baadshah interferes and disarms him. Thapar then pulls out his bomb remote and intends on detonating it because Baadshah has ruined his plan. Just then, Thapar's van enters the room and he is shocked to see Baadshah's friends and CBI agents appear from it, along with the child and the bomb. They all dare Thapar to detonate the bomb now. Thapar flees, and is pursued by Baadshah while Dr. Surti works on the bomb. He manages to remove it and they throw it out of the building. Thapar escapes and finds Rani and Moti outside and tells them to detonate the bomb once he is inside his car. However, he is killed when the bomb detonates under his car.  At the end, Baadshah is seen to have booming business back at his detective agency. Ram Lal receives a call President [[Bill Clinton]], offering $1,000,000 for assistance with the [[Lewinsky scandal|"Monica Case"]]. Baadshah announces his prioritization of "wife duty", refusing the case and disappearing with Seema.  
Baby Geniuses
 Two scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder ([[Kathleen Turner]]) and Dr. Heep ([[Christopher Lloyd]]), use genius-baby studies to fund BabyCo's [[theme park]] "Joyworld". According to Dr. Kinder's research on toddlers/babies, babies are born possessing vast, universal knowledge and speak a secret yet impossible-to-translate baby pre-language called ''Babytalk''. However, at age 2–3, the knowledge and language are lost as the babies ''cross over'' by learning how to speak [[human languages]]. Most of the babies raised in Dr. Kinder's underground research facility were adopted from the Pasadena City orphanage, transformed into little geniuses through use of the Kinder Method, and then used in experiments to decipher this secret yet impossible-to-translate language used by the 7 baby-geniuses.  One mischievous toddler, Sylvester (the only one of her toddlers who was raised through use of the superior version of the Kinder Method), makes repeated attempts to escape Dr. Kinder's research facility and one night, Sylvester goes into a dirty diaper truck and he actually succeeds. The next morning, one thing Sylvester does not expect is to run into his long lost normal twin brother, Whit, in a mall playground. Although Sylvester and Whit share a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] bond, they have no idea of each other's existence. While the guards from Dr. Kinder's research facility capture Whit, mistaking him for Sylvester, and take him back to Dr. Kinder's research facility, Sylvester is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, Robin ([[Kim Cattrall]]), who is Dr. Kinder's niece. After Dr. Kinder and the six other baby-geniuses are shocked that Whit and Sylvester switched places at the mall, Dr. Kinder decides to do a cross evaluation on Sylvester and Whit. However, when she comes to Dan Bobbin's place, she realizes that Dan can understand babies. After the attempts to retrieve Sylvester fail, Dr. Kinder decides to move the research facility to [[Liechtenstein]], and they have no chance but make Whit be the only normal baby to be raised in this research facility until they can find a possible way to get Sylvester back to her research facility.  The babies at Bobbin's place hypnotize Lenny ([[Dom DeLuise]]), the bus driver to drive to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Once at the research facility, Sylvester goes to the control room to set the robots from the theme park on the lab scientists. When the Bobbins return home, their natural daughter Carrie tells her father that the children are in Dr. Kinder's research facility. At the end of the fight, Dr. Kinder captures Whit and takes him to the helicopter pad on the roof. Robin and Dan chase them to the roof, where Dr. Kinder reveals that she and Robin are not related and that Robin was adopted at age two. After Dr. Kinder is arrested by the police, Sylvester and Whit come together on the roof to cross over.  Dan and Robin adopt Sylvester. And Dr. Heep is now in charge of Dr. Kinder's Research facility. Dan is still curious of the secrets of life; but, as the twins have crossed over, they no longer know those secrets. Carrie, their sister, doesn't reveal anything (just giving her dad a sly smile) because adults aren't meant to know their secrets.  
Babar: King of the Elephants
 The film opens with various birds singing "The Ancient Song of the Elephants". Marabou, a [[marabou stork]], states that the elephants have long forgotten the meaning behind the words of the song over the years; the birds, however, remember as they have been around for the same period of time as the elephants. Marabou provides a brief introduction to the story that is about to unfold, which begins with a historically significant event: the birth of Babar the elephant<ref name=":1"></ref>.  In the Great Forest, Babar lives a happy childhood being cared for by his loving mother and playing with the other young elephants, including his friends Arthur and Celeste. One day while walking alone with Babar, Babar's mother is shot and killed by a hunter, and Babar is forced to flee as the hunter approaches<ref name=":0"></ref>; after days of wandering, he eventually finds his way to an unnamed city in [[Paris]]<ref></ref>. Babar spends an eventful day exploring the city and engaging in human activities such as eating ice cream for the first time and attempting to order at a restaurant, all the while disturbing traffic and frightening the other citizens. He meets an older woman, Madame, who provides him with money to purchase proper clothing at a nearby store. Following an extensive fitting session, Babar emerges from the store wearing his signature bright green [[Suit (clothing)|suit]], red bow tie, and a [[bowler hat]]<ref name=":0" />. Madame invites Babar to live with her, and she raises him as if he is human, educating him on subjects including [[mathematics]], [[etiquette]], and how to drive a car on the roads. Although Babar enjoys his new life, he occasionally thinks back to his childhood in the Great Forest, missing his elephant friends and his deceased mother<ref name=":1" />.   Two years later, while on a walk with Madame, Babar is shocked to discover Arthur and Celeste, who have left the Great Forest in search of him. The three friends spend the day in a fashion reminiscent of Babar's first day in the city, but they are interrupted by Celeste's mother and another adult elephant from the Great Forest, who have been searching for the runaway children; though at first angry at their disappearance, the older elephants are ecstatic to see Babar, whom they had presumed dead. They inform him that the King of the Elephants has died from accidentally eating poisonous mushrooms, leaving the elephants in disarray, and that the rhinoceroses have waged war against the elephants due to Arthur and the other younger elephants playing pranks on them. That evening, Madame and Babar agree that it is time for him to return home<ref name=":1" />.   Babar is welcomed back to the Great Forest, where he reunites with his old friend Cornelius and the rest of the elephants. Meanwhile, [[Lord Rataxes]], the leader of the rhinoceroses, mobilizes his forces in preparation for war against the elephants. Babar devises a plan to stop the war: he paints monster faces on the backsides of elephants and has them walk backwards in their approach towards the enemy. The plan succeeds in forcing the rhinoceros troops to retreat in fear, and Babar then has Arthur apologize to the abandoned Rataxes for offending the rhinoceroses, thus restoring peace to the jungle. For his brilliant idea and bravery, Babar is asked to be the new King of the Elephants; he agrees on the condition that Celeste be his Queen, which she accepts<ref name=":1" />.    As King, Babar is keen to introduce [[Western culture|Western civilization]] to the elephants by building a [[Babar's Kingdom|City of the Elephants]]. He brings in Madame - along with loads of supplies on the backs of camels - to the Great Forest, and together with the rest of the elephants they build [[Hut|huts]] with [[Thatching|thatched roofs]] for residences, as well as other common city buildings such as a [[hospital]], a [[theatre]], and a [[courthouse]]. As they are establishing roles for all of the animal citizens within their new city, Celeste reveals to Babar that she is pregnant; she later gives birth to triplets Flora, Pom, and Alexander. Problems eventually begin to arise in the City of the Elephants, including Madame being bitten by a snake while protecting Zephir and Cornelius being struck unconscious by a fallen beam when his hut catches fire.

That night, Babar's troubles manifest in a nightmare in which he is threatened by a visit from the demon Misfortune, but he is awoken by Flora the next morning to discover that both Cornelius and Madame are well on their way to recovering from their respective ordeals. The elephants rejoice in the completion of their beautiful new city, for which Babar proposes a new name: [[Celesteville]]<ref name=":1" />.

Beau Travail
 The film begins with the silhouettes of soldiers being made to stand in the sun as an endurance test. It is the memory of [[Adjutant#France|Chief Adjutant]] Galoup ([[Denis Lavant]]), from his new home in [[Marseille]], where he writes his memoirs. He remembers the heat of [[Djibouti]], where he led his [[section (military unit)|section]] of men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Bruno Forestier ([[Michel Subor]]). We see numerous training scenes: [[assault course]]s; and securing of buildings. Much of the exercise has a ballet-like quality. This is set against a back-drop of traditional Djibouti life of the surrounding local people. Galoup says of Forestier: ''I admired him without knowing why''. He retains a wristband with the word ''Bruno''.  Galoup has a beautiful, young local girlfriend, Rahel.  Forestier envies many things in Galoup, including his clear affection from the men. However, they happily socialise together, playing [[chess]] and [[snooker]].  One day, his section is joined by Gilles Sentain ([[Grégoire Colin]]), whose physical beauty, social skills, and fortitude make Galoup envious. Repressed [[homosexual]] feelings from Galoup are suggested.  When Sentain helps another soldier being punished by digging a large hole in the heat of the day, by handing him a canteen of water, Galoup chastises Sentain and knocks the water from his hand. Sentain strikes Galoup. The sergeant has already sworn to destroy him. As a punishment, he drives Sentain out into the desert to make him walk back to the base. But Sentain does not return because Galoup has tampered with his [[compass]], and the soldier is lost without it. When Sentain fails to return Galoup accuses him of desertion.  We see Sentain collapse in the arid [[salt pan (geology)|salt flats]]. His salt-encrusted compass is spotted by fellow legionnaires at a sale of local salt-encrusted novelties and is believed to prove Sentain is dead. However, Sentain is found by local tribespeople who place him on a bus. We are not told, but he is clearly now safe, and going to live.  However, on the assumption that Galoup has either killed or tried to kill Sentain, Galoup is sent back to France by his commander for a [[court martial]]. It ends his career in the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]], his only real love. We see him immaculately make his bed then lie on top clutching a pistol. He is going to shoot himself. The final scene, a lively acrobatic solo dance to [[Eurodance]] music, is a flashback from an earlier point in the film when Galoup and the Legion have a night out in Djibouti.  
Bangers (film)
  Cate Blanchett portrays a marginally successful career woman preparing dinner for her gruff and unsympathetic mother.  As she cooks the mashed potatoes and sausages, she tells an indifferent audience of her mother and cat about a recent promotion at work.

Bangkok Dangerous (1999 film)
 Kong is a deaf-mute gunman, an [[assassination|assassin]] for hire who can neither hear nor see his gunshots or victims. He receives his guidance through Aom, a stripper in Bangkok, who rides on his back and gives him directions. Kong lost his hearing when he was a child, from listening to too much Thai rock music. Because of his disability, he was taunted by other children and grows up into an angry young man.  At a target range, he finds he has a knack for [[target shooting]] when he visualizes the faces of the boys that taunted him in the target. His deafness gives him an edge in shooting, as he does not react to the gunshots. He eventually gets a job as a janitor at the range, but one day loses his vision after an unfortunate incident with gunpowder.  One day while cleaning up, a customer named Joe Ruffo is at the shooting range with his girlfriend, Aom. Joe notices Kong watching them and he offers the [[pistol]] to Kong, who impresses Jo and Aom with his shooting. Joe agrees to be Kong's partner and teaches him how to shoot, while standing behind him. When Joe injures his gun hand in a battle, Kong is ready to take on more work.  Working for a mob boss, Kong is sent on a job to [[Hong Kong]]. He shoots his target while riding on the [[MTR|Hong Kong subway]] with Aom riding on his back. When Kong returns to Bangkok, he catches a cold and needs medicine, so he stops at a pharmacy and meets Fon, a pretty pharmacist, who gives Kong a special massage, with happy ending. This encounter changes Kong's perspective on life as he realizes that life can be meaningful, even for a deaf-blind assassin like him.  Fon has trouble with one of the mob boss' henchmen. She spurns him, but he rapes her. Enraged, Jo kills the henchman, which brings the mob's wrath down on Jo, which in turn leads to more revenge killing by Kong, and a final big shoot-out in a water bottle plant.  
Bartok the Magnificent
  Russia is being terrorized by an evil witch known as Baba Yaga (Andrea Martin), and the only one who is not afraid of her is Bartok (Hank Azaria). Bartok, an albino bat, has just arrived in Moscow and is impressing everyone with his performances, including Prince Ivan (Phillip Van Dyke). However, Ivan's advisor, Ludmila (Catherine O'Hara), finds Bartok annoying and naive, and she tries to make a Cossack stop his performance. After Bartok's show, a bear suddenly attacks. Bartok saves everyone by stunning the bear, knocking it over, and trapping it in a wagon.  Delighted with Bartok's bravery, everyone around him rewards him with gold, including Prince Ivan, who gives him a royal red ring, much to the displeasure of Ludmilla, who reminds him that the ring is only for members of the Romanov family, not commoners. She asks that he take the ring back, but Ivan disagrees, saying it is time for a change. Ludmilla, seeing that she cannot dissuade him, reluctantly allows it and they leave. When Ludmilla expresses that she is upset that Ivan has given a ring to a commoner, especially a street performer, Ivan retorts that that was his intention, and his friend Vol (Diedrich Bader) agrees that Bartok was funny. Ludmilla, on the other hand, believes that Ivan needs to respect his duty to the crown, which incites Ivan, to say that he will do as he pleases and it is she who must respect the crown.  Meanwhile, Bartok is counting the money he received when the bear wakes up and scares him. It turns out Bartok's amazing rescue was just another act - the bear is Zozi (Kelsey Grammer), Bartok's business partner. Zozi is apprehensive about Ivan's ring and agrees with Ludmilla, that the ring should be returned. Bartok stubbornly refuses to give it back since it was a gift.  Back in Moscow, Ivan is kidnapped by Baba Yaga, which leads to an immediate investigation. Ludmilla finds one of Baba Yaga's iron teeth, and she informs the people what has transpired. When she asks for someone brave enough to rescue Prince Ivan, two children (Kelly Marie Berger and Zachary B. Charles) nominate Bartok. Bartok and Zozi are on their way to St. Petersburg when Zozi spots the Cossacks coming after them. The pair become worried because they assume that Ludmilla wants Ivan's ring returned. Bartok tries to conceal his identity, but he is brought before the people, who explain that Ivan has been taken by Baba Yaga, and that they are relying on him to rescue their prince. Bartok reluctantly accepts, and he and Zozi head to the Iron Forest to confront Baba Yaga and save Prince Ivan.  They find Baba Yaga's hut, but must answer a riddle given by a giant skull (Tim Curry) to enter. When the riddle is answered, Baba Yaga successfully captures Bartok and explains that to save Ivan, Bartok must gather three items from the forest without any help from Zozi, or they'll "both die": Piloff, Oblie's Crown, and the Magic Feather. However, these tasks are very hard, as Piloff (Jennifer Tilly) is frozen to a boulder, Oblie (French Stewart), a giant blacksmith surrounded by an aura of fire, must be tricked into letting his crown be stolen, and the magic feather must be obtained without flight, using only the boulder Piloff was stuck to and Oblie's crown. He gathers the objects demanded, but Baba Yaga still needs something from Bartok himself. He offers everything he can think of, but Baba Yaga rejects everything and bursts out laughing. Bartok, outraged, begins to yell, and he upsets Baba Yaga by accusing her of lying and cheating, and claiming that everyone hates her. Baba breaks down in tears.  After he apologizes to her, he starts crying and Baba gets the most important ingredient: tears which are from Bartok's heart. She makes a magic potion from the items she had Bartok collect and reveals that she never took Prince Ivan and that the potion she made was meant for Bartok himself. Baba Yaga explains that when Bartok drinks the potion, whatever he is in his heart will show ten times in his exterior. Bartok and Zozi return to town and lead Ludmilla and Vol up to the top of the tower where Ivan is imprisoned.  When they arrive, Ludmilla locks Bartok and Vol up with Ivan and reveals she had Vol kidnap the prince (telling him to "get him out of the way" as in kill him, while Vol misunderstood and locked him up, supposedly for his own safety) while she framed Baba Yaga as part of her scheme to forcibly seize the Russian throne. She steals Bartok's magic potion and leaves Bartok, Ivan, and Vol trapped in a well tower filling up with water. She drinks it, believing her beauty will become tenfold, singing as she descends the tower, gleefully boasting that she will be unstoppable. Unbeknownst to her, the potion causes her to steadily transform into an enormous dragon as it reveals her true wickedness.  Upon this discovery, Ludmilla goes on a rampage through Moscow, setting many buildings alight with her newly acquired fire breath ability. Zozi then comes to the rescue, saving Bartok, Vol, and the Prince. Bartok battles Ludmilla and tricks her into climbing the tower. When she gets to the top, the tower starts to become unstable and causes the top of the tower to fall, flooding the streets and dousing the flames. As the townspeople gather around Ludmilla's dead body, Zozi reveals that Bartok is a true hero, not only because he stopped Ludmilla, but because he showed Baba Yaga compassion. Bartok returns Ivan's ring and Baba Yaga appears, writing "Bartok, The Magnificent" in the sky. Bartok gives Baba Yaga a goodbye hug as she and Piloff depart, counting on seeing Bartok again.  
Bats (film)
 After people start to die in the small [[Texas]] town of Gallup, the prime suspects are bats. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] calls in [[chiropterologist]]s Dr. Sheila Casper ([[Dina Meyer]]) and her assistant, Jimmy Sands ([[Leon Robinson]]), to investigate the situation. Dr. Alexander McCabe ([[Bob Gunton]]) is secretive about the situation, but admits that the bats were genetically modified by him to become more intelligent and also omnivorous so they wouldn't be in danger of extinction any longer. Sheila is disgusted by this but it seems that McCabe had the best intentions.  Aided by Sheriff Emmett Kimsey ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]) and CDC specialist Dr Tobe Hodge ([[Carlos Jacott]]), Sheila and Jimmy begin to search for the nest. The first night they are attacked and manage to capture one and plant a tracking device on it. However, as soon as they let it go, it is killed by the other bats, who understood the strategy. Emmett decides that Gallup needs to be evacuated, and the mayor is told to broadcast a warning to all residents to stay indoors and secure their houses. Unfortunately, no one listens. The bats invade the town and, within minutes, chaos ensues and several people are killed, including Dr. Hodge, who sacrifices himself to save Sheila.  The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] arrives and begins evacuating the town. They give Sheila and her bat hunters 48 hours before they destroy the town in hopes of killing the bats. Sheila sets up headquarters in the school. The military has promised to center the infrared cameras of a Chromo-B340 [[satellite]] on the area around Gallop to help locate the bat roost. Even when the roost is located, however, Sheila is at a loss how they can exterminate all the bats, of which there must be several thousand: bombing the roost will only scatter them, leading to the creation of other roosts and spreading the infestation through the rest of the country; while the most popular bat poison is only marginally effective against bats but highly lethal to humans. Sheila thinks the best solution is to lower the temperature inside the roose, since doing so will cause the bats to hibernate instead of flying away, before they freeze to death.  Jimmy arranges for an NGIC Industrial Coolant that uses [[freon]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[oxygen]] to be dropped off as soon as the roost is located, in a cave that Emmett recognizes as an abandoned mine. Everything is set to begin at 0600 hours—except that the government has other ideas, which don't include waiting until dawn. During the night, they wire the mine with explosives set to trap the bats inside and freeze them. Unfortunately, the bats kill all the soldiers at the location and then attack the school. Sheila and the others use electrified fences and blowtorches to keep the creatures at bay, but it is revealed that McCabe, actually insane, has created the bats to be the ultimate predator, specifically designing them to kill humans. McCabe flees outside, falsely believing that he can control the bats, only to be killed.  When Sheila, Emmett and Jimmy arrive at the mine the next morning, they are informed by the military that they weren't able to turn on the coolant unit, so the plan now is to bomb and gas the mine starting in one hour. Emmett calls the military and tells them that they will be able to activate the unit but they are unable to get the air strike called off. Sheila decides that one hour is enough time for them to get the coolant unit started, so she and Emmett suit up and enter the mine. Jimmy stays outside to monitor their progress and to blow up the mine entrance should it become necessary. Although they find themselves up to their waists in bat guano, they are successful at starting the coolant. As they make for the exit, the bats pursue them. The moment they exit, Jimmy detonates the explosives, collapsing the mine entrance and trapping the bats inside, freezing them. One final bat survives the freezing temperatures and burrows out of the ground, only to be crushed by the car as the group drives away.  
The Base (film)

Assigned to guard the United States's anti-drug interests in the area, disgruntled Sgt. Mike Gammon (Tim Abell) instead attempts to take over the drug business along the Mexican border, and Gammon is working for General Albert Becker ([[Frederick Coffin]]).  Feeling under appreciated by his government, Gammon begins killing drug couriers, appropriates their goods, and sets his crew to work distributing the drugs in [[Los Angeles]].  As Murphy penetrates Gammon's inner circle, the body count begins to rise.  
Bayaning 3rd World
  Two filmmakers try to create a film venturing on the life of José Rizal. Before they do that, they try to investigate on the heroism of the Philippine national hero. Of particular focus is his supposed retraction of his views against the Roman Catholic Church during the Spanish regime in the Philippines which he expressed primarily through his two novels ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''. The investigation was done mainly by "interviewing" key individuals in the life of Rizal such as his mother Teodora Alonso, his siblings [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]], Trinidad, and Narcisa, his love interest and supposed wife [[Josephine Bracken]], and the Jesuit priest who supposedly witnessed Rizal's retraction, Vicente Balaguer. Eventually, the two filmmakers would end up "interviewing" Rizal himself to get to the bottom of the issue.

As it turns out later, the stolen money was already taken away by a former apprentice of Kampmann, Melanie, who moved to Mallorca with a friend in the meantime.  
Being John Malkovich
 Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife Lotte. Gaining a file clerk job through Dr. Lester at LesterCorp, in the strange Floor  low-ceiling offices of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York City, he develops an attraction to his coworker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. Craig enters a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet and finds himself in the mind of actor [[John Malkovich]]. Craig is able to observe and sense whatever Malkovich does for fifteen minutes before he is ejected and dropped into a ditch near the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. He reveals the portal to Maxine and they let others use it for $200 a turn.  Craig tells Lotte, who becomes obsessed with the experience, allowing her to live out her [[transgender]] desires. Lotte becomes attracted to Maxine and they begin a sexual relationship, with Lotte inside Malkovich's head while Maxine has sex with Malkovich. Craig, forsaken by both women, binds and gags Lotte and locks her in a cage, then enters Malkovich's mind and has sex with Maxine. Craig, with his expert puppeteer skills, discovers that he is able to control Malkovich's actions while in his head, causing the actor to feel paranoid that he is being controlled by someone else. After Malkovich consults with his friend [[Charlie Sheen]], Malkovich trails Maxine to the Mertin-Flemmer building, where he himself tries the portal into his own head and finds himself in a world where everyone has his face and they only say "Malkovich". He is then ejected and meets Craig by the turnpike. Malkovich demands that the portal be closed, but Craig refuses.  Lotte escapes with the help of her pet chimpanzee. She phones Maxine, revealing that it was Craig who was having sex with her while inside Malkovich. Maxine is annoyed but accepts it, because she enjoyed the experience. Seeking help, Lotte finds Lester, who reveals himself to be Captain Mertin, the original founder of LesterCorp. Lester is aware of the portal, and has a room dedicated to Malkovich's life. Lester explains that the person who is connected to the portal becomes "ripe" for lasting occupation by others on the eve of their 44th birthday. However, when the host turns 44, the portal immediately moves to its next host, an unborn child.  If it is possible for a person to take advantage of the "ripe" host and enter the portal then, one can greatly increase one's lifespan, and then  one can eventually move on to another host. However, if one misses the brief window of "ripeness", and enters the portal even a minute too late, one will find oneself trapped within the unborn child who will be the next host. Lester, who has been using the portal in order to prolong his life, reveals his plan to use Malkovich when "ripe" as the host for him and several of his elderly friends. Offered the chance to join Lester's group, Lotte warns him that Craig currently has control of Malkovich.  Craig finds he is able to remain in Malkovich indefinitely. He spends the next eight months in Malkovich's body, and using his puppeteer's control, he is able to turn Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer. Malkovich marries Maxine. He learns that she is pregnant as their relationship grows distant.  As Malkovich's 44th birthday approaches, Lester and his friends cut a deal with Maxine, and fake her kidnapping. They call up Craig, threatening to kill her if Craig does not leave Malkovich. Craig ends the call, causing Lester to think that he is calling their bluff. Lotte loses hope and attempts to kill Maxine, but they end up at the turnpike after falling through the portal and through Malkovich's shame-ridden subconscious. Maxine reveals to Lotte that Maxine conceived when Lotte was inside Malkovich's body, and she kept the child because it is "theirs". The revelation cements their love for each other.  Craig calls Lester back, thinking Maxine is still in danger. Realizing his opportunity, Lester continues his bluff, convincing Craig to leave Malkovich's body. Lester and his friends enter the portal, taking control of Malkovich. Craig, discovering that Lotte and Maxine are together again, decides to enter the portal to become Malkovich and regain Maxine, however he has unknowingly missed the deadline for getting into Malkovich. Years later, an aging Malkovich, containing the collective mind of Lester and his friends, reveals to Sheen a plan to prolong their lives via Maxine's daughter Emily, within whom Craig is now permanently trapped. Through Emily's eyes Craig is forced to watch Maxine and Lotte living happily together as he futilely pleads that Emily look away.

Beyond the Mat
 The film begins with director Barry Blaustein discussing his love for professional wrestling and clips of him viewing employees of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. He then decides to travel the [[United States]] over a three-year period, endeavoring to understand the mindset of someone who would voluntarily choose to become a professional wrestler. Blaustein interviews a wide variety of wrestling personalities and ascertains their motivations.  Blaustein focuses on three famous wrestlers, one at the height of his career ([[Mick Foley|Mick Foley, aka "Mankind"]]), one contemplating retirement ([[Terry Funk]]) and one at a career low ([[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]). He begins by following Funk, a 53-year-old man in need of knee surgery who appears unable to retire, despite the mounting toll wrestling is taking on his body.<ref name=cnn/><ref name=100best/> Blaustein follows him as he competes at [[hardcore wrestling]] promotion [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]'s first pay-per-view event [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]]. Funk also appears with his friend, former wrestler [[Dennis Stamp]], who is eager to work as a referee in Funk's upcoming "retirement" match. Stamp discusses the fact that he has not wrestled in years, but remains in shape just in case he gets the call, and demonstrates his unusual workout regimen: jumping on a trampoline in his back yard while holding hand weights.   Funk's sometime in-ring rival, Foley, is profiled next. He has been taking increasingly risky falls (or "[[bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]") and blows to the head, and at one point is heard talking incoherently as the result of a fall (from his [[1998 Hell in a Cell match|Hell in a Cell match]] against [[The Undertaker]] at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] in 1998) which briefly rendered him unconscious. Clips of Foley with his wife and children are spliced with the clips of him risking his body for the sport. Later, in the film's climax, his wife and young children (particularly his daughter [[Noelle Foley|Noelle]]) watch in horror from the front of the audience during Foley's [["I Quit" match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]], wherein he takes multiple unprotected shots to the head by [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]] with a steel folding chair.<ref name=cnn/>  Lastly, Roberts is a wrestler whose height of popularity was in the 1980s.

They celebrate by lounging in a tub, but even though they have been dating for two years and all appears well in their relationship, Harper balks at the mention of marriage. Robin is hurt by his reaction and assumes it is because Harper still has feelings for the college girlfriend he wrote about in his novel. Despite this, Robin agrees to attend Harper's best friend's wedding in New York.  Harper, the designated best man, reunites with his college buddies ahead of the nuptials. The group includes: the groom Lance ([[Morris Chestnut|Chestnut]]), a star athlete in college who is now a famous running back with the [[New York Giants]]; the bride Mia ([[Monica Calhoun|Calhoun]]), his smart and devoted college sweetheart; Julian/Murch ([[Harold Perrineau|Perrineau]]), a do-gooder type who has chosen to work with disadvantaged kids rather than take a high-paying job at a law firm; Quentin ([[Terrence Howard|Howard]]), a smooth-talker who jumps between different artistic pursuits as well as different women; and Jordan ([[Nia Long|Long]]), a successful and driven TV producer, who is eager to find out if her friendship with Harper could develop into something more. Also present is Shelby ([[Melissa De Sousa|De Sousa]]) - Mia's sorority sister and Murch's manipulative, domineering girlfriend whom the other men openly dislike.  When Harper learns that Jordan has obtained an advance copy of his novel and that it is being passed around his inner circle, he begins to worry that his friends will recognize the thinly-veiled descriptions of themselves and each other contained in its pages. On the night of Lance's bachelor party, Murch resists Shelby's manipulations and joins the guys for a raunchy show. There, Murch becomes smitten with Candy ([[Regina Hall|Hall]]), one of the strippers Quentin booked for the event. Harper, meanwhile, looks forward to Jordan's invitation to get together afterwards and see where their mutual attraction takes them. But things go awry when Harper tries to prevent Lance from finishing his novel and learning about the one night he and Mia spent together back in college. Lance learns the truth and attacks Harper for his betrayal, then calls off the wedding. A distraught Harper unloads on Jordan, blaming her for circulating the book ahead of the wedding. Jordan tells him he has no one to blame but himself, since he chose to expose those secrets.  The next morning, Harper picks up Robin at the airport and confesses everything. She is heart-broken, but decides to attend the wedding because she owes it to herself to see what's been holding him back all this time. At church, when Lance is nowhere to be found, the friends debate what to do. Robin steps in to reassure a nervous Mia. Lance finally appears, saying that he wants to tell his parents himself that the wedding is off. Harper appeals to Lance's faith to make his realize the depth of his love for Mia, and the two get married in a touching ceremony. At the reception, Murch and Candy/Candance the college student, couple off, leaving a bitter Shelby to be teased by Quentin. Harper and Jordan acknowledge that they cannot recapture what they once had. He realizes his future is with Robin, and proposes to her on one knee in front of all the guests. The movie ends with a joyous rendition of the electric slide. (After the credits, we see Shelby and Quentin sharing an unexpected moment.)

They are joined in their hospitality suite by Bob Walker ([[Peter Facinelli]]), a young man from the company's research department. Larry and Phil are close friends with a long history together. Larry faces urgent financial difficulties that he alludes to only obliquely; Phil has recently come through a recovery program for [[alcoholism]]. Bob, an earnest young [[Baptist]], has few if any regrets. Larry explains that their single goal is to arrange a meeting with Dick Fuller, the CEO of a large company ("[[Kahuna|the Big Kahuna]]").  While the three wait in their suite for the convention downstairs to finish, Larry and Phil explain to Bob how to develop and discern character. They also make Bob the bartender for the evening even though he drinks infrequently. Larry remarks that as he has quit smoking, Phil has quit drinking and Bob is religious, it makes them "practically Jesus".  Even though he makes a poor bartender, Bob spends the evening talking to people. In doing so, he inadvertently chats with the Big Kahuna, who invites him over to a private party at another hotel. Larry and Phil excitedly coach Bob through their pitch on industrial lubricants down to an amount of information Bob can handle and supply him with their business cards.  As the pair wait for Bob, they reflect on the nature of human life. However, Bob returns to drop a bombshell: he used the time to discuss religion rather than pitch the company's product. Larry, dumbfounded, challenges Bob and leaves the room devastated. Phil explains to Bob that proselytizing is just another kind of sales pitch. He explains that making real human-to-human contact requires honesty and a genuine interest in other people. Phil gives his reason why he and Larry have a friendship: trust. He then tells Bob that until he can recognize what he should regret, he will not grow in character.  The next morning Phil packs his things. As Larry checks out, he sees Bob talking again to the "Big Kahuna" in the lobby. They exchange a knowing smile suggesting Bob is using his time with the Big Kahuna more judiciously. The soundtrack during the credits is "Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)", a setting of an essay by [[Mary Schmich]].<ref></ref>

Bicentennial Man (film)
 The NDR series [[robot]] "Andrew" ([[Robin Williams]]) is introduced in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties. The family's reactions range from acceptance and curiosity, to outright rejection, and deliberate vandalism by their rebellious older daughter, Grace ([[Lindze Letherman]]), who treats him as a mere robot and continues with her rebellious ways while growing up. This leads Andrew to discover that he can both identify emotions and reciprocate in kind. When Andrew accidentally breaks a figurine belonging to "Little Miss" Amanda ([[Hallie Kate Eisenberg]]), he carves a replacement out of wood, as way to apologize to her. The family is astonished by this creativity and “Sir” Richard Martin ([[Sam Neill]]) takes Andrew to his manufacturer, to inquire if all the robots are like him. The CEO of the company, Dennis Mansky ([[Stephen Root]]), sees this development as a problem and wishes to scrap Andrew. Angered, Richard takes Andrew home and allows him to pursue his own development, encouraging Andrew to educate himself in the humanities.  Years later, Martin again takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics for repairs following an accident in which his thumb is accidentally cut off. Richard ensures first that Andrew's personality will remain un-tampered with. Andrew requests his face be altered to convey the emotions he feels but cannot fully express, while he is being repaired. Twelve years later, Andrew eventually asks for his freedom, much to Richard's dismay. He grants the request, but banishes Andrew so he can be 'completely' free. Andrew builds himself a home and lives alone. In 2048, Andrew sees Richard one last time on his deathbed, where he apologizes for banishing him.  Andrew goes on a quest to locate more NDR series robots to discover if others have also developed sentience. After nearly twenty years of failure, he finds Galatea ([[Kiersten Warren]]), an NDR robot that has been given feminine attributes and personality. These, however, are simply aspects of her programming and not something which she spontaneously developed. Galatea is owned by Rupert Burns ([[Oliver Platt]]), son of the original NDR robot designer. Burns works to create more human-looking robots, but is unable to attract funding. Andrew agrees to finance the research and the two join forces to revolutionize robotics. He meanwhile maintains contact with Amanda, who grew up, married, had a child, divorced and now has a granddaughter called Portia. After receiving human features, Andrew comes back home, and sees Amanda, now aged, with Portia, who is the same as her grandmother in her younger years (they are both played by [[Embeth Davidtz]]). Initially he has some troubles reintegrating into the family since now there is only Amanda who actually knows him, but he manages to befriend Portia.  Some time later, Amanda passes away, leaving Andrew to realise that everyone he knows will die one day. Accepting this fact, Andrew decides to become human. With the help of Rupert, he creates a new type of mechanical organs that can be used both by him to become more human and used by humans as prosthetic organs. He gains a [[nervous system]] and lots of other organs that make him able to eat, to feel emotions and sensations, and also to have sexual intercourse. Eventually, Andrew becomes human enough to fall in love with Portia and, ultimately, she falls in love with him.  Over the course of the next century, Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as human, which would allow him and Portia to be legally married, but is rejected; the Speaker of the Congress explains that society can tolerate an everlasting machine, but argues that an immortal human would create too much jealousy and anger. Initially Andrew decides to make Portia live as much as possible through his medical inventions but after some decades she tells him that she can't and doesn't want to live forever, so one day she will refuse any more treatment. Andrew decides to make Burns inject [[blood]] into his system, thereby allowing him to age, and thus he begins to grow old alongside Portia.  Andrew again attends the World Congress with Portia, both now appearing old and frail, and again petitions to be declared a human being. On their death bed with [[life support]], Andrew and Portia watch as the Speaker of the World Congress announces on television the court's decision: that Andrew is officially recognized as human, and (aside from "[[Methuselah]] and other Biblical characters") is the oldest human being in history at the age of two-hundred years old. The Speaker also validates the marriage between Portia and Andrew. Andrew dies while listening to the broadcast despite his life support, and Portia orders their nurse Galatea, a now recognizably-human android, to unplug her life support. The movie ends as Portia dies hand-in-hand with Andrew after she whispers "See you soon" to him.

Blackadder: Back & Forth
 The film opens at Blackadder Hall where the present day [[Edmund Blackadder|Lord Blackadder]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is entertaining guests on [[New Year's Eve]], 1999. As a scam, Blackadder informs them he has invented a working [[time travel|time machine]] and [[Gambling|wagers]] £10,000 each that he can bring back anything they ask for. His guests – Archbishop [[Melchett (Blackadder)|Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]]), Archdeacon [[Kevin Darling]] ([[Tim McInnerny]]), [[George (Blackadder character)|Viscount George]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]) and [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Lady Elizabeth]] ([[Miranda Richardson]]) – announce that, if Blackadder is to win, he must bring back a genuine Roman [[centurion]]'s [[helmet]], the actual [[Wellington boot|wellington]]s worn by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] on the day he won the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and a really smelly pair of 200-year-old underpants. Blackadder intends to scam his guests by dredging the items from his personal store. However, he is stunned to discover that the time machine, built by [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) after plans by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], actually works.  The pair first land in the [[Cretaceous Period]], where they are attacked by a massive ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. After throwing all their items at it to no avail, Baldrick uses his underpants to beat back the [[dinosaur]], who takes one sniff and falls over dead. Lord Blackadder muses, "Fascinating. One of history's great mysteries solved. [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|The dinosaurs were, in fact, wiped out by your pants.]]" When attempting to reset the dials to return to the present, Baldrick reveals that this is impossible, as he never got round to writing the dates on them (meaning their first destination is 2 watermelons and a bunch of cherries).  After configuring the dials by instinct, Blackadder and Baldrick land back at Blackadder Hall at the court of [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Queen Elizabeth I]], with Nursie ([[Patsy Byrne]]) and [[List of Blackadder characters#Melchett|Lord Melchett]] at her side (in homage to ''[[Blackadder II]]''). The Queen, mistaking him for his ancestor, [[Lord Blackadder]], decides that "Edmund" is not grovelling enough and orders his beheading, unless he has a present for her. Blackadder first offers a supermarket [[loyalty card]], upon which the Queen screams, "Kill him!" He then offers her a [[Polo (mint)|Polo mint]], which the Queen proclaims to be "the tastiest thing in the history of the world". She rewards him with her crown, then orders him away to bring back more mints on pain of having his head crushed "like an egg".  On his way back to the machine, Blackadder literally runs into [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Colin Firth]]). After giving the Bard a [[ballpoint pen]] and receiving his [[autograph]], Blackadder punches him in the face, remarking, "That is for every schoolboy and schoolgirl for the next four hundred years!" Blackadder tells Shakespeare that his plays are nothing but people "in stupid tights... talking total crap," then kicks him in vengeance for [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s "[[Hamlet (1996 film)|endless, uncut, four-hour version of Hamlet]]". Stunned, Shakespeare asks, "Who's Ken Branagh?" Blackadder smugly retorts, "I'll tell him you said that, and I think he'll be very hurt!"  Then, Blackadder returns to the machine and tries very hard to remember how the dials were set. He then sets the dials and is happy until the time machine materializes into a space battle. Blackadder quickly realizes that they may have gone too far and resets the dials again. After that, Blackadder and Baldrick land in [[Sherwood Forest]] and are captured by [[Robin Hood]] ([[Rik Mayall]], in similar character to [[Lord Flashheart]]). However, Robin is horrified when Blackadder begins rattling off the flaws of his lifestyle. Blackadder smugly reminds the [[Merry Men]] that they face certain death if they're caught, live in total squalor in the forest with no toilet facilities, yet give all they steal to the poor, who do nothing but "sit on their backsides," waiting for the next cash installment. Enraged, the Merry Men promptly shoot Robin full of arrows. Then [[Maid Marian]] ([[Kate Moss]]), smitten by the "gorgeous" Blackadder, proceeds to have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with him. Baldrick later comments that "poof in tights" [[Will Scarlet]] was equally friendly. Before leaving, Blackadder takes Robin's hat as a trophy.  A further attempt to reconfigure the dials results in the time machine landing at the 1815 [[Battle of Waterloo]]. After the machine squashes the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] (Fry) just before he reveals his plan for defeating a flamboyant [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] ([[Simon Russell Beale]]), Blackadder steps out just long enough to steal the Duke's boots to win his bet.  One last attempt to set the dials right lands them at [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]]. The wall is being guarded by Blackadder's centurion ancestor, with a Roman-era Baldrick as his shield-carrier (reminiscent of ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''). After stealing the helmet of a Roman-era George, Blackadder and Baldrick escape just ahead of a charging wall of [[Braveheart]]-style [[Scottish people|Scotsmen]] wearing [[woad]].  Back in the time machine, Blackadder is becoming more discouraged about ever going home, but Baldrick comes up with "a cunning plan". Baldrick mentions that [[life review|dying men have their lives flash before their eyes]] and that, if Blackadder was about to [[drowning|drown]], he might remember how the dials were originally set. Blackadder agrees with this, but instead almost drowns Baldrick in the time machine toilet. As Baldrick's life flashes before his eyes, he remembers how to set the dials to return home.  Back in 1999, the party guests are very impressed by his trophies, but due to Blackadder's [[Alternate history|interference with history]], Robin Hood is completely unheard of, William Shakespeare stopped writing plays and is instead credited as the inventor of the [[ballpoint pen]], and Britain has been ruled by the French for two hundred years following Napoleon's victory at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Horrified by the sight of a traditional [[garlic]] pudding and Archdeacon Darling wearing a tutu and [[ballet slippers]], Blackadder leaps back into the time machine, screaming, "We've got to save Britain!"  This is accomplished by encouraging Shakespeare, flattering Robin Hood, and preventing the death of the Duke of Wellington (presumably, Baldrick has now labeled the dials, making the machine more controllable). They then return home to collect Blackadder's winnings from the amazed partygoers. After Melchett comments what damage an "unscrupulous" person could do with a time machine, Blackadder perks up. He tells his friends to go upstairs and watch the [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] festivities on television, assuring them he'll soon return. He and Baldrick set off again in the machine to put his "very, very, very cunning plan" into action.  The four guests sit down to watch the broadcast of [[Genealogy of the British Royal Family|the royals]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] arriving at the [[Millennium Dome]]. Blackadder – now the [[absolute monarch]] [[Edmund III|King Edmund III]] – steps from a [[limousine]] and is joined by Prime Minister Baldrick. The King is married to the beautiful Marian of Sherwood ([[Kate Moss]]). BBC correspondent [[Jennie Bond]] gushes about the King's 98% [[approval rating]]s, the success of Baldrick's cabinet, and the dissolution of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The film ends with the Blackadders having finally triumphed, with their descendants having become the rulers of Britain and millennia from now, the [[Blackadder's Christmas Carol|ruler of the entire universe]].

Sam (Shields), a filmmaker, is making a documentary about Rich and his circle, with the help of her husband Terry (Downey), a [[the closet|closeted]] [[homosexual]] who doesn't feel at home in this milieu.  Dean (Houston) is Rich's friend since childhood and a talented college basketball player. He is offered a deal by a bookmaker, Mark (Stiller) to throw a few games for a price. Dean takes the money against his better judgment, and he soon realizes how much of a mistake he made when Mark turns out to be a cop hoping to dig up dirt on Rich. Rich in turn discovers that Dean might be forced to tell what he knows to stay out of jail, and he decides that Dean has to be killed; however, rather than murder his friend himself, Rich asks one of the white kids who hangs out with him, who seems especially eager to prove himself, to do it for him. The kid, however, is actually the son of the District Attorney.  
Blue Streak (film)
 Jewel thief Miles Logan participates in a $17 million [[diamond]] heist in [[Los Angeles]]. One of his accomplices, Deacon, turns on Miles and kills Eddie, Miles' best friend and another member of the team, before attempting to take the stone from Miles. The police arrive and Miles is forced to hide the diamond in the ductwork of a building being constructed.  Deacon flees and Miles is arrested, and as Miles is being taken away he is shocked to discover that Eddie has been killed. Two years later, Miles is released from prison and attempts to reconnect with his girlfriend. She dumps him for lying to her about his criminal life, and Miles decides to go retrieve the diamond. He is dismayed to find that the building he hid the diamond in is now an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police station. He goes inside and discovers that the stone is hidden in what is now the Robbery/Homicide detective bureau, which requires a key card to access.  Miles returns later on disguised as an eccentric pizza deliveryman. While unable to gain access to the ducts, he does manage to steal an access card. Miles visits his forger Uncle Lou, who creates a fake badge and transfer papers that allow Miles to enter the building posing as a newly transferred Detective Malone. While trying to access the ducts, Miles inadvertently foils a prisoner escape and is teamed up with Detective Carlson. The pair are sent out on a burglary call, where Miles quickly solves it as a fraud perpetrated by the owner. On the ride back, they stumble upon an armed robbery being committed by Miles' good friend and former getaway driver Tulley. Miles intervenes and arrests Tulley before the police can shoot him, but Tulley demands $50,000 to keep quiet about who Miles really is.  Miles makes another attempt to locate the diamond but is interrupted by Carlson, who has discovered that Miles isn't who he claims to be. Miles convinces Carlson that he is from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]]. Miles tries to get back to searching for the diamond but he and Carlson are sent out on another call. While out, they capture a truckload of [[heroin]] belonging to a major dealer. Miles locates the diamond in the vent inside the evidence locker and finally retrieves it, but accidentally drops it into the load of heroin they seized. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrives and demands the heroin be turned over to them for testing.  A panicked Miles suggests the FBI and his police unit use the heroin as bait in a [[Sting operation|sting]]. He arranges to be with the heroin in the delivery truck, but is soon joined by Tulley (who he secretly set free from holding) and Deacon. During the drug deal, Deacon tries to expose Miles as a cop to the drug runners. While Miles and Tulley attempt to distract the dealers, the police and FBI raid the deal. Deacon escapes with the diamond in an armored truck and the police and FBI follow as he approaches the border to [[Mexico]]. The police and FBI are forced to halt their pursuit at the border, but Miles steals a patrol car and continues after Deacon. Miles forces Deacon to wreck the truck and then offers him a deal: Deacon gives Miles the diamond and allows Miles to arrest him and in exchange Miles takes him back to the United States and cuts him back in on the diamond. Deacon agrees, and Miles immediately double-crosses him by handcuffing him to the wrecked truck for the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federales]] to find. Deacon draws a gun to shoot Miles but Miles turns and shoots him first, killing him and avenging Eddie's death.  Miles walks back the US side of the border where the FBI demands he explain his actions. The police also want to know who he's working for as his fake credentials didn't check out.  Miles tells them he's an undercover Mexican officer, and has to get back to Mexico to explain everything to his fellow Federales. Miles gets a few inches over the border when Carlson and Hardcastle stop him and reveal that they know who Miles really is. However, they don't arrest him as they are grateful for all of his help and look at him as a friend. They state the FBI are strict about integrating people over International borders and Miles is a few inches over the border. The three men share a bittersweet goodbye, before Miles heads off into Mexico with the diamond.  
Blast from the Past (film)
  In 1962, Dr. Calvin Webber ([[Christopher Walken]]), an eccentric scientist who, like so many people at the time, thinks that a nuclear war between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] is imminent, has built a large, fully functional [[fallout shelter]] in his backyard deep underground. During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and thinking the conflict could escalate, Calvin ends the party at his house and takes his pregnant wife Helen ([[Sissy Spacek]]) into the fallout shelter as a precaution. When a fighter jet flying over loses control, the pilot bails out and the jet crashes into their house, causing a large explosion; Calvin, thinking the worst has happened, sets and activates the shelter's locks (designed not to open for 35 years). Everyone assumes the entire family was killed in the accident, as no one knew of Calvin's secret fallout shelter.  Calvin's wife Helen gives birth to a boy, whom they name Adam. Adam grows up being taught and exposed to all culture up to 1962, such as watching reruns of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and listening to [[Perry Como]] and [[Dean Martin]]. During their 35-year stay in the shelter, a small diner called "Mom's" is built on the site where their house stood. A young man named Melcher ([[Joey Slotnick]]) works for Mom ([[Dale Raoul]]) as a [[soda jerk]]. The diner (which later becomes a pub) is shown throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 90s, as the neighborhood deteriorates from suburban to inner city [[ghetto]] complete with abandoned graffiti-marked buildings, adult bookstores, and the homeless, prostitutes, and addicts as its residents. Eventually, Mom gives the pub to Melcher, who lives in the abandoned remains (in 1995), an alcoholic.  When the locks open in 1997, Calvin is so shocked to see how the world has changed (believing it to be a post-apocalyptic wasteland populated by irradiated [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]]), he decides the family must stay underground. However, their supplies are running out, and Calvin suddenly falls ill from the stress, so Adam ([[Brendan Fraser]]) must venture onto the surface to procure more. As he leaves the shelter for the first time, he meets Melcher who had encountered Calvin in his radiation suit the previous night and mistook him for God after he burst through the floor of the abandoned pub using his elevator to the surface. Having built a shrine above the elevator shaft, Melcher now worships Calvin and the elevator, with Adam's words of encouragement to him being mistaken as affirmation of his new religion. As he marvels at the outside world, seeing many things for the first time (the sky, a little girl, and "a [[Negro]]"), Adam eventually realizes that while purchasing supplies in bulk, he has strayed too far from the pub containing the elevator to the fallout shelter and cannot remember his way back.  Adam meets Eve Rustikoff ([[Alicia Silverstone]]) when he tries to sell his father's classic baseball cards at a hobby shop. She stops the store owner (Bill Gratton) from trying to buy the cards for much less than their collectible value and is immediately fired. Adam asks Eve to drive him to a [[Holiday Inn]] in exchange for a rare baseball card; she takes the card and leaves, but returns the next morning to give it back out of guilt. When Eve mentions that she must find a new job, Adam asks her to help him purchase supplies and, unaware of the value of money, immediately agrees to her request for $1,000 a week. He also asks Eve to help him find a wife from [[Pasadena, California]] (per his mother's advice), who is "not a mutant"; he uses the term literally as meaning a mutant due to radiation from the nuclear war which never happened. Adam meets Eve's gay housemate and best friend, Troy ([[Dave Foley]]), who is amused by Adam's naiveté but offers advice and gives Adam a fashion makeover.   Eve and Troy take Adam to a 1940s swing-style nightclub to find him a wife. Adam immediately attracts the attention of several women, including Eve's flirtatious rival and nemesis Sophie (Carmen Moré). Eve becomes jealous and reconnects with her ex-boyfriend Cliff ([[Nathan Fillion]]), who goads Adam into an altercation, ultimately backing off as Adam demonstrates his skills in boxing (having trained every day with his dad); Eve leaves the nightclub. Troy later returns home alone and explains to Eve that Adam went home with Sophie. Adam returns later, explaining that he politely rejected Sophie's advances, saying that he could think only about being with Eve. He and Eve kiss, but when Adam tells her the truth about his past and states that he wants to take her to be his wife "underground", she asks him to leave.  The next morning after successfully locating the pub containing the elevator (as well as a full congregation of destitute people hanging onto Melcher's every word), Adam returns to Eve's house, where she is waiting with a mental health professional named Dr. Nina Aron ([[Jenifer Lewis]]) and her assistant to have him committed. He sadly cooperates at first, but escapes as they leave the house, asking that Eve and Troy collect his things for him and pay his hotel bill. In the hotel room, Troy and Eve find toiletries and clothing manufactured in the early 1960s as well as absurdly valuable stocks in companies like IBM, and realize that Adam was telling the truth.  With Melcher and his cult helping with loading the supplies into the shelter, Calvin is prepared to seal him and his family inside once more. Eve spots Adam outside the abandoned pub; the two share an embrace and Adam takes her to meet his parents. Calvin and Helen are impressed with Eve and agree to Adam's request for the two of them to set the lock timer for two months while he and Eve make arrangements.  During this time, he and Eve use the money from selling the stocks to build his parents a new home in the country, which is a 1950s style suburban tract home identical to the home that was destroyed, except it is built on a beautiful spot way out in the country. Included with the house is a restored red 1960 [[Cadillac automobile|Cadillac]] convertible. They also use the money to help Melcher rebuild the old pub into a 50s-themed night club after convincing him that Adam isn't God.  When they are settled in, Adam lets Calvin know the truth about the jet crash. He tells his father there was never an atomic war and that the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]]. Calvin takes the news stoically, thrilled to hear of the fall of the Soviet Union, but still suspecting it was a Commie trick. He tells Adam not to mention this to Helen. After Adam walks away upon being told by Helen that dinner is ready, Calvin mutters "Commies..." to himself and begins measuring the space in the backyard, beginning the development of a new fallout shelter as Eve watches from the window while playing with her engagement ring.

The Blair Witch Project
  In October 1994, film students [[Heather Donahue|Heather]], [[Michael C. Williams|Mike]] and [[Joshua Leonard|Josh]] set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], and interview residents about the legend. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a [[hermit]] who lived in the woods and kidnapped and murdered eight children in the 1940s. After spending the night at a motel, the students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to research the legend. Along the way they meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted. He also tells them of a young girl named Robin Weaver, who went missing in 1888; when she returned three days later, she talked about "an old woman whose feet never touched the ground." His companion, however, is skeptical of the story. The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found [[Human sacrifice#Ritual murder|ritualistically murdered]] in the 19th century, their bodies later disappearing. The group camps for the night.  They move deeper into the woods the next day and locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small [[cairn]]s and set up camp nearby. That night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. They again hear twigs snapping at night but fail to find the source of the noises.  At morning, they find that three cairns have been built around their tent during the night, which unnerves them. As they continue, Heather realizes her map is missing and Mike later reveals he kicked it into a creek the previous day out of frustration, which prompts Heather and Josh to attack him in a rage. They realize they are now lost and decide simply to head south. They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. They again hear sounds that night, including those of children laughing, among other strange noises. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.  Upon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime. As they continue, they come across a log on a river identical to one they crossed earlier. They realize they have walked in a circle, despite having traveled south all day, and once again make camp. Josh suffers a breakdown while holding the camera, taunting Heather for their circumstances and her constant recording of the events.  Josh has disappeared the next morning and Heather and Mike try in vain to find him before slowly moving on. That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams in the darkness but are unable to locate him. Mike and Heather theorize that Josh's screams are a fabrication by the witch to draw them out of their tent.  The next day, outside her tent, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks tied with a piece of fabric from Josh's shirt. As she searches through it, she finds blood-soaked scraps of Josh's shirt as well as teeth, hair and what appears to be a piece of his tongue. Although distraught by the discovery, she chooses not to tell Mike. That night, Heather records herself apologizing to her family and to Mike's and Josh's families, taking full responsibility for their predicament.  They again hear Josh's agonized cries for help and follow them to a derelict, abandoned house containing symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Mike races upstairs to find Josh while Heather follows. Mike says he hears Josh in the basement and heads downstairs while a hysterical Heather struggles to keep up. Upon reaching the basement, Mike is suddenly attacked by an unseen force, causing him to drop his camera, and fall silent. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike facing a corner. The unseen force then attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera and go silent as well. The footage continues for another moment then ends.

Blood Dolls
 Virgil Travis is a wealthy, soulless psychopath who lives in seclusion in his mansion home with his dwarf butler ([[Phil Fondacaro]]) and his murderous, [[Evil clown|clown]] make-up-wearing maniac right-hand man. Tortured and forcibly mutated as a child by a woman who put him through [[Body modification|body transforming procedures]], Virgil has an abnormally sized head. Basking in the suffering, degradation, pain, and death of others, Virgil has already killed, and kidnapped a [[All-female band|female rock group]] that he keeps imprisoned in his basement to help satisfy his constant need for perverse amusement. Never satisfied, though, Virgil decides that he will once again try to fill the emptiness that exists within him, and so creates a trio of deformed, living dolls to systematically murder any and all people who have ever wronged him. What Virgil doesn't anticipate, though, is meeting his match and finding love, both of which come in the form of a woman who is even more evil and twisted than he is.  The film has 2 different endings: # After his new wife sees his deformed head, she is horrified, so the dolls attack her while Virgil has the house filled with poison gas. Ms. Fortune frees the rock group, who escape with the dolls. # Rather than be disgusted, she finds him attractive for his evil and intellect. She then says that together, the world is theirs for the taking.   ===Reference to ''Demonic Toys''=== In the film, there is a character by the name of Mr. Mascaro. He is a human version of the character [[Jack Attack (character)|Jack Attack]], who is a character from ''[[Demonic Toys]]''.  ===Reference to ''Head of the Family''=== Virgil Travis is the son of Myron Stackpool and from the yet-to-be-made ''Bride of the [[Head of the Family]]'', Georgina.  
Blue (Da Ba Dee) (music video)
 The video takes place on Tukon4, where lead singer Jeffrey Jey is abducted by blue [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] Zorotl and Sayok6 during a concert.<ref name = "Jeffery Jay kidnapped">[http://www.zorotl.com/zorotl_story7.php Jeffrey-kidnapped]. Zorotl.com. Accessed from April 1, 2013.</ref> The aliens then proceed to leave [[Earth]] with him. Group members [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Gabry Ponte]] give chase in their own small [[spacecraft]], and eventually both ships arrive on the blue aliens' [[planet]] via a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]].  It is then shown that the Jey was abducted to perform in a concert for the aliens, with him singing the same song he was about to sing when he was taken. He slowly realises that the crowd is composed entirely of strange blue beings, which are known as Tukonians,<ref name = "Jeffery Jay kidnapped"/> and becomes increasingly concerned.  After fighting off a number of alien guards using [[martial arts]] and several energy-based, psionic abilities, the pursuing band members succeed in rescuing their lead singer. While leaving the planet, they are asked to return by the aliens. They oblige, and spend the remaining duration of the video by performing a concert for the blue-skinned extraterrestrials with Zorotl joining them on stage, creating a friendship between the band and the creatures. These events possibly lead into the scenario in the music video for "[[Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)|Move Your Body]]".  The events in the video share no relation to the song's lyrical content apart from the fact that the aliens all have blue skin.  
The Boondock Saints
 [[Irish American|Irish-American]] twin brothers Conner and Murphy MacManus attend [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]], where the priest mentions the fate of murder victim [[Kitty Genovese]]. Later, when Conner and Murphy are celebrating [[St. Patrick's Day]] with friends, three [[Russian mafia|Russian mobsters]] arrive and announce they want to close the pub and take over the land it is built on. A brawl ensues, and the next morning two of the Russians seek revenge on Conner and Murphy. The twins kill the mobsters in self-defense.  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case, and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive a "calling" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.  Conner and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men. Conner learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel. Having equipped themselves with weaponry and rope from a local underground [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] gun dealer, the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the brothers and errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe "Papa Joe" Yakavetta, is sent on a hit as an unknowing pawn. The next day, Rocco learns that he was betrayed, having been sent to kill nine Russians with only a six-shot revolver. Rocco commits himself to helping Conner and Murphy. That night, they hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lapazzi, an underboss of the Yakavetta crime family.  Concerned he may be a target, Papa Joe contacts a hitman, Il Duce, to deal with them. After killing a criminal that Rocco had a personal hatred for, the three men are ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to chase Il Duce away, the three men suffer serious wounds, including the loss of a finger by Rocco. The three return to a safehouse where they treat their wounds.  Hours later as the police conduct an investigation at the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with [[ammonia]]. However, Smecker happens upon the part of the finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation to see who was behind the gun battle. Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers' actions. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.  Later, the brothers and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family, but Smecker learns they are walking into a trap. The brothers are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe, but the brothers are able to free themselves. As Papa Joe leaves his house, Smecker arrives in drag and kills a number of soldiers before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer – revealing he is the brothers' father and deciding to join his two sons in their mission.  Three months later, Papa Joe is sent to trial for a third time. However, the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal. The brothers and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, infiltrate the trial after sliding their weapons over the metal detector. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and killing Papa Joe. The media dubs the three "the Saints".  
Bowfinger
 [[Z-grade]] [[film producer]] Bobby Bowfinger has saved up to direct a movie for his entire life — he now has $2,184 to pay for production costs. He has a script ("''Chubby Rain''") penned by an accountant, Afrim, and a camera operator, Dave, with access to studio-owned equipment. Bowfinger then lines up several actors who are hungry for work, along with a crowd of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented Mexican immigrants]] for a camera crew; the only other thing he needs is access to a studio in order to distribute his masterwork.  He extracts a promise from a film studio executive, Jerry Renfro, that the executive will distribute the film if it includes currently-hot action star Kit Ramsey. Ramsey — a rather pompous, [[Neurosis|neurotic]], and [[paranoid]] actor — refuses, so Bowfinger constructs a plan to covertly film all of Ramsey's scenes without his knowledge. The actors, told that Ramsey is [[method acting]] and will not be interacting with them outside of their scenes, walk up to Ramsey in public and recite their lines while hidden cameras catch Ramsey's confused reactions.  The plan goes well at first: Ramsey (who is a member of an organization called MindHead) swallows the movie's [[alien invasion]] premise and believes he is genuinely being stalked by aliens, resulting in an exceptionally genuine and intense performance. However, the strain on his already-precarious mental state leads him to go into hiding in order to maintain his sanity, stalling the film's production.  Bowfinger resorts to hiring a Ramsey lookalike named Jiff. Jiff is kind, amiable and rather clueless. He even runs through a gauntlet of "stunt drivers" racing along a major freeway when asked. During a chat with the other cast members, Jiff mentions that he is Kit Ramsey's brother, explaining the likeness. Using this new knowledge, Bowfinger has Jiff find out Kit Ramsey's movements and the final scene to the film is readied for shooting.  The final scene is at an observatory. Though otherwise pleased with Ramsey's unscripted dialogue, Bowfinger considers his character's final line "Gotcha suckers!" to be the key moment of the film, and directs one of the actors to guide Ramsey through the scene under the guise of showing him how to get rid of the aliens. During the filming, Ramsey becomes terrified and struggles to deliver the final line. At this point, Ramsey's mentor at MindHead, Terry Stricter, has discovered evidence that Kit's 'aliens' may not be just in his head. MindHead officials track Bowfinger to the observatory, and shut down production.  Bowfinger's camera crew show him [[B-roll]] footage of Ramsey they were filming off-set, just in case they saw anything they could use. The footage shows Ramsey donning a paper bag over his head and [[indecent exposure|exposing himself]] to an amused [[Laker Girls|Laker Girl Cheerleading Squad]], something MindHead specifically discouraged him from doing. Bowfinger uses the footage as blackmail in his negotiations with MindHead to use Ramsey in the film. MindHead advises the star to finish the project. Bowfinger finally gets to sit at the premiere of a film he himself directed, and is awed. Following the arguable success of the film, Bowfinger receives a rare [[Federal Express|Fed-Ex]] envelope—an offer to film a [[martial arts film]] called "''Fake Purse Ninjas''" starring Bowfinger and Jiff Ramsey.  
The Bone Collector
 The film begins in late 1999. [[Tetraplegia|Tetraplegic]] [[forensic science|forensics]] expert Lincoln Rhyme and a patrol cop, Amelia Donaghy, team up to solve a string of murders connected to a [[serial killer]] by his signature: a single shard of bone removed from each of the victims. Rhyme was paralyzed from the neck down in an earlier accident and is bed-bound and completely reliant on machines and his nurse Thelma.   The killer poses as a [[New York City]] taxi driver and abducts and kills those who get in his taxi. The first victims are a married couple named Alan and Lindsay Rubin who the killer picked up at the airport. Amelia finds Alan's body buried in a [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era railroad bed. She also finds a collection of clues including a pile of piece-ground oyster shells, which eventually leads Amelia&mdash;now working with Rhyme&mdash;to Alan's wife, and a scrap of paper. The detectives find Mrs. Rubin, too late, at a steam junction in a below-ground services area of a building in the Financial District, secured using old antique handcuffs or [[shackle]]s at the mouth of a pipe which emits steam. She has been scalded to death from the steam. The killer has also removed a bit of flesh and bone from her arm. Amelia finds another scrap of paper at the scene.  The killer then abducts a [[New York University]] student, who is taken to a derelict [[slaughterhouse]], where he is tied to a pole. Part of his thigh bone is surgically removed, and he is left for rats to feed on. Amelia and Rhyme, using the clues left by the killer at the scene of Lindsay Rubin's death, find the victim dead. Again, the killer has removed a piece of the victim's bone. Amelia is able to collect the evidence, including another scrap of paper. The pressure of the tense investigation and bureaucratic challenges to Amelia and Rhyme's involvement with the case are having serious impacts on Rhyme's health and stability.  After piecing together the message the killer was sending using the scraps of paper, Amelia and Rhyme are led to an old crime novel, whose crimes the killer was replicating. This leads them to his next victims, a grandfather and granddaughter tied to a pier as the tide rises. The girl is the first victim they manage to save, but her grandfather dies. At the scene, Amelia finds another bone, part of an old police badge, and an old subway map. These clues, and some [[asbestos]] left by the killer at the scene of Mrs. Rubin's death, lead Amelia to an abandoned subway station, where she sees some numbers which have been tampered with to spell out Rhyme's police badge number&mdash;Amelia realizes that the killer is after Rhyme.  The killer arrives at Rhyme's house, and after killing Rhyme's nurse, Thelma, and Captain Howard Cheney,  he is revealed to be the medical technician who cares for Rhyme's medical equipment, Richard Thompson. Richard's real name is Marcus Andrews, and he is a former forensics expert who worked in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].  About 8 years ago, Rhyme wrote an article accusing Marcus of planting evidence and sending six innocent people to prison, and one of those people hanged himself. Marcus spent six years in prison, and after getting released, he spent two years trying to find Rhyme. Marcus was often attacked or raped in the prison, and he wants Rhyme to pay for what the article put him through.  Rhyme manages to crush Marcus's right hand by suddenly dropping his bed horizontally, and in the struggle to free himself, Marcus pulls Rhyme with him and they both collapse to the floor. Rhyme then manages to bite Marcus in the neck, causing massive bleeding. Marcus once again manages to free himself, grabbing his knife. As Marcus raises the knife for a killing blow, Amelia suddenly arrives at the apartment and shoots Marcus dead.  The film ends at a [[Christmas]] celebration at Rhyme's apartment. Rhyme, having given up his plans to commit [[suicide]], faces his sister and niece coming to visit him along with Amelia and his other colleagues on [[Christmas Eve]]. Rhyme and Amelia are implied to have a relationship.  
The Book of Stars
 Penny and Mary are sisters living together in a tenement apartment in a seedy section of an unnamed city. The responsibility of caring for fifteen-year-old Mary has fallen on Penny due to the death of their parents years before.  Mary has [[cystic fibrosis]], and the deterioration of her lungs is rapidly worsening. Forced to spend most of her time indoors, she has tracked her life and dreams and hopes in an artistic scrapbook which she calls her "Book of Stars and Lovely Things." In it, she fashions herself an astronaut, cut adrift in space and slowly and helplessly drifting towards the sun and her eventual doom. Penny is a once-promising poet who has turned to a life of drugs and prostitution to help numb her from the grim reality of her job and the impending loss of her sister.  There is a quiet young man who has moved in next door. He is from war-torn Eastern Europe and walks with a limp. Penny gets a letter from a prisoner, who was moved by her poetry and writes her admiring letters. She won't answer, or even read the letters, so Mary does it for her.  Mary arranges things and events to keep her sister human. Together, they all face life, death, and the universal need to reach out for someone.  
Bringing Out the Dead
 In [[Manhattan]] in the early 1990s, Frank Pierce is a burned-out [[paramedic]] who works the [[graveyard shift]] in a two-man ambulance team with various different partners. Usually exhausted and depressed, he has not saved any patients in months and begins to see the ghosts of those lost, especially a homeless adolescent girl named Rose whose face appears on the bodies of others. Frank and his first partner Larry respond to a call by the family of a man named Mr. Burke who has entered [[cardiac arrest]]. Frank befriends Mr. Burke's distraught daughter Mary, a former junkie. Frank discovers Mary was childhood friends with Noel, a brain-damaged drug addict and delinquent who is frequently sent to the hospital.  After a few minor calls (one involving Noel), Frank and Larry respond to a shooting and he tends to one of the surviving victims. Frank notices two vials of a drug named "Red Death", a new form of [[heroin]] that is plaguing the streets of New York City, roll out from the victim's sleeve which implies it was a shooting by a rival drug gang. While in the back of the ambulance with Frank and Noel the victim goes into denial and repents his drug dealing ways but dies before they can reach the hospital.  The next day Frank is paired with his second partner Marcus, an eccentric and religious man. They respond to the call of a man in a goth club who has suffered a [[heart attack]]. Frank diagnoses that he has in fact suffering from a heroin overdose caused by Red Death. As Frank injects the man with the antidote, Marcus starts a prayer circle with the baffled club-goers and just as his preaching climaxes the overdosed man becomes conscious again. On the way back to the hospital Frank swings by Mary's apartment building to tell her that her father's condition is improving. Frank and Marcus then respond to a call by a young Puerto Rican man whose girlfriend is giving birth to twins despite his claims they are both virgins, calling it a miracle. Frank rushes one baby to the hospital but it later dies. In a moment of desperation Frank starts drinking and Marcus soon joins in, crashing the ambulance into a parked car.  The following morning, Frank sees a stressed Mary leaving the hospital and follows her to an apartment block; she tells Frank that she's going to visit a friend and he escorts her to the room. After a while Frank goes to the room and barges his way in the door, only to discover it's in fact a [[crack house]] run by a friendly dealer named Cy Coates. Mary has turned back to drugs to cope with her father's fluctuating condition and Frank tries to get her to leave but he is dissuaded by Cy who offers Frank some pills. In another moment of desperation he swallows the drugs and begins to hallucinate, seeing more ghosts of patients and the moment when he tried to save Rose. Once over, he grabs Mary and carries her out of the building. While visiting a comatose Mr. Burke in the hospital Frank starts hearing Burke's voice in his head, telling Frank to let him die but he resuscitates Burke instead.  The next shift Frank is paired with his third partner Tom Wolls, an enthusiastic man with violent tendencies. At this point Frank is slowly beginning to lose his mind - while tending to a suicidal junkie Frank manages to scare the patient away. The pair are then called to Cy's drug den where another shooting has occurred, and find Cy impaled on a railing, having attempted to jump to safety. Frank holds on to Cy as the other emergency services cut the railing but Cy and Frank are nearly flung off the edge before being pulled back up. Cy then thanks Frank for saving his life - the first patient Frank has saved in months. Afterwards Frank agrees to help Tom beat up Noel, but Frank is distracted and Noel flees into an area beneath the houses. Tom and Frank chase after Noel but Frank starts to hallucinate again, snapping out of it just as he comes upon Tom beating Noel with his baseball bat. During his second visit to Mr. Burke, the voice again pleads to let him die, and this time Frank removes Burke's breathing apparatus causing him to enter cardiac arrest, ending his life. Frank then heads to Mary's apartment to inform her, and she seems to accept her father's death. Frank is invited in, falling asleep at Mary's side.

With the help of [[ex-gay]] Mike ([[RuPaul]]), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a [[reparative therapy]] camp which uses a five-step program (similar to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]' [[twelve-step program]]) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.  At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown ([[Cathy Moriarty]]), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock ([[Eddie Cibrian]]), and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program). This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton ([[Dante Basco]] and [[Kip Pardue]]), [[making out]].

Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.  Megan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines.

Butterfly's Tongue
 In a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] town, a young boy, Moncho, goes to school for the first time and is taught by Don Gregorio about life and literature. At first, Moncho is very scared that the teachers will hit him since that was the standard procedure back then, but he is relieved to discover that Don Gregorio doesn't hit his pupils. Don Gregorio is unlike any other teacher; he builds a special relationship with Moncho, teaching him to love learning. Don Gregorio teaches Moncho about The Butterfly’s Tongue on a field trip through the woods, with Moncho having an asthma attack and being assisted by Don Gregorio. Don Gregorio also builds a special relationship with Moncho's father, who is a Republican like him. At this point in Spain, the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] factions are vying for control of Spain in the civil war, forcing many to choose sides. Moncho's mother is lukewarm towards the Republic, her main concern being belief in God, and at the end of the film, she sides with the Nationalist rebels.  When Nationalists take control of the town after militarily defeating their opponents, they round up known Republicans, including Don Gregorio. Because of the fact that Moncho's father is a Republican, his family fears that he too will be taken away in the purge if the Nationalists discover his political leanings. In order to protect themselves, the family goes to the town square to jeer the captured Republicans as they are paraded out of the court house and boarded onto a truck. The film ends with Moncho, despite his continued great affection for his friend and teacher, yelling hateful things and throwing rocks at Don Gregorio and the other Republicans, as instructed by his mother, as the truck carries them away, although the last thing Moncho yells are the words for the tongue of a butterfly, ''espiritrompa'' (Galician for "[[proboscis]]"), a favorite word taught to him by Don Gregorio in an attempt to let his dear friend know that he does not truly mean the words he is yelling.

The Bumblebee Flies Anyway
 Barney Snow ([[Elijah Wood]]) wakes up in a hospital with no memory of why he is there. All he has is his name and some vague recollections of a car crash. He assumes that he is in the hospital for his amnesia and settles in to try to recover. He quickly realizes that all of the other residents of the youth clinic are all suffering from terminal illnesses.  Another patient, Mazzo ([[Joseph Perrino]]), asks Barney to play host for his visiting twin sister Cassie ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]). Barney immediately falls for Cassie and strives to get better, if only to be able to see her in a setting outside the hospital. He is determined to learn about his past so that he can make her a part of his future.  In his explorations, both inside his shattered memories and through the physical rooms of the hospital, Barney starts to realize that there was no car crash. Doctor Harriman ([[Janeane Garofalo]]) induced amnesia in Barney to make him forget everything in his past. Barney demands to know why, and Harriman tells him he has [[cancer]]. The experimental procedure that Barney is undergoing is attempting to test the power of the mind in fighting cancer. Barney had volunteered for the treatment, hoping for a miracle cure.  The theory was that if Barney didn’t know he had cancer, the body might stop creating the cancer cells. The explanation Harriman gives comes from an old myth that, based on [[wing loading|weight ratios to wing power]] and [[lift-to-drag ratio|wind resistance]], the [[bumblebee]]s should be aerodynamically incapable of flight — yet the bumblebee doesn’t know that, so it flies anyway.  Torn between his hope for a cure and his desire to continue his budding relationship with Cassie, Barney is forced to choose whether to go through the amnesia procedure again or remain with the memories and knowledge he has thus far acquired.

  The movie is a tale about a young boy aroused by the sexual awakenings and the political views of the Italian youth. It's set around a group of friends. Silvio (the main character), Ponzi (his best friend) and a group of boys and girls that go to the same school. When the school is threatened with privatization, the students gather to decide whether to occupy the school or take a different action.

They smoke and share experiences. Martino tells the boys that he's had sex with his girlfriend, and that he can last about ten minutes. On the other hand, as the girls chat, his girlfriend tells her friends that it was all very fast.  The next morning, as Ponzi comes to pick up Silvio at his place, he tells him that the school has been shut down and they're going to invade and occupy.

Silvio is thrilled and ends up telling Ponzi all about it on his way out (he was going home to get his sleeping bag, get back and sleep over at the school, hoping to get more intimate with the girl). Ponzi couldn't keep the secret and so the rumour is out. And the story builds up as it gets to Martino's ear. He gets furious and decides to get things right with Silvio and his girlfriend.

Claudia hangs up at first. He calls back thinking the line was down. She invites him out the next day, tells him that they should hang out to talk.  Martino has been at the school and learned all about the betrayal. He now rushes to the house of Silvio. As he gets there he rings and Silvio comes down, he punches him and storms away.  The next day, Ponzi calls Silvio and tells him that he has slept over at the school. Silvio goes out to the school. The police arrive at the scene of the occupation. The kids decide to resist. As the police come to storm the gates, the students throw eggs at them. The riot squad beats up a few kids. Some escape, but most of them get arrested: the jealousy-fueled Martino, the most exalted kids, Ponzi and most of the minor characters. Amongst the ones that got away we find Silvio and Claudia. As they talk, Claudia tells him that she has loved him for a long time. He doesn't say anything special in reply. Claudia drops him at home. When she gets home she goes to bed sad. Meanwhile all the kids are at the police department, even the toughest kids have to call their dads.  Silvio is confused about his friend. He consults his heartbroken brother and he tells him that he should only enjoy the girl but shouldn't fall in love with her. When he goes to Claudia's place, Claudia's mother wakes her up and she gets up confused. She welcomes him and he tells her that they should be together. She closes the door to her room and they kiss. Her mother knocks on the door and tells them that they shouldn't be in locked doors. Claudia takes him up to the rooftop, there they kiss and she asks him if he wants to make love right there. He says yes and things just happen. After they are done, Silvio rushes to Ponzi's house to tell him that he is no longer a virgin. Ponzi swears not to tell anyone this time. When Silvio tells Ponzi about his brother's advice Ponzi says that his brother doesn't know anything. They talk as they walk away and the movie ends.

As Sakura is drawn towards the well, Syaoran appears and scares the birds away. Reuniting with the others including Meiling, Sakura is taken to the Li family estate where she meets Syaoran's eccentric sisters and his mother Yelan, a powerful sorceress who senses Sakura is in danger. Staying for the night, Sakura experiences the dream again where the woman attacks her. Yelan takes Sakura outside and warns her that the woman is extremely powerful and is deliberately contacting Sakura. The next day, Syaoran and Meiling are forced to accompany Sakura and co. around Hong Kong should something happen.  Sakura spots the birds again and pursues them with Kero. They chase them down to an antiques store, where they come across an old book that has a picture of the woman on the cover. Sakura is hypnotised again and opens the book before her friends, flooding the shop and transporting the group to another dimension where the woman dwells. The birds are revealed to be her cloths. The woman, actually a sorceress referred to as Madoushi (named "Su Yung" in the English dub), attacks Sakura in rage, believing she had summoned Clow Reed, creator of the Clow Cards. Sakura discovers that her friends, except for Syaoran, have been taken prisoner, and Madoushi demands Clow comes in exchange for their freedom. Syaoran distracts Madoushi so Sakura can rescue Tomoyo but is captured as well. Sakura escapes with Kero and Tomoyo back to the antiques store, but find the book has vanished. Kero realises he knows Madoushi, a fortune teller who Clow fell in love with and taught her magic. But she used them for evil and was imprisoned in another dimension by Clow, but is likely unaware she is a spirit. Sakura realises the well appeared on the book cover and it is another entrance to Madoushi's prison.  Going to the well, Sakura encounters Yelan who breaks the shield surrounding the well to allow Sakura and Kero to enter. Sakura confronts Madoushi who uses the magic of Sakura's friends to escape her prison but is shocked by Hong Kong's appearance. Sakura and Kero follow, but Madoushi captures Sakura and holds her prisoner. When Sakura tells her of Clow's passing, Madoushi angrily tries to drown Sakura by trapping her in a flooded skyscraper with her cloths. Sakura uses the Arrow Card to escape and she confronts Madoushi, sympathising with the sorceress and confirms Clow is dead. Madoushi dissolves into water, passing on, but releases Sakura's friends. While Toya and Yukito have no memory of what happened, Sakura tells Tomoyo and Kero they may have to visit Hong Kong again in the future.

Chalo America
 The film chronicles the misadventures of three Lukkhas (Slackers) with just one dream preying on their minds - to get to the kingdom of Coca-Cola and Clinton. They make attempt after attempt to flee from the drudgery and boredom in dreary India to the land of the free and the home of the brave - the United States. They remain undeterred by their failure and woeful incompetence to get there - be it by acquiring a visa or a wife, or smuggling themselves into boats. Their hopes flag, but never quite fade away.  What is funny about the film is that it strikes a nerve. It is a comic illustration of an aspiration that is latent within many, if not all, of us. It is a portrayal of an obsessive fascination for the other, the conviction that the astroturf is greener on the other side, that comes through. This is an ironical reflection of the same sentiment that is in a film like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which the gloss and glitz is nothing if not Yankee. The film ends with some wisdom gained, but not too much to stop being human.  Deven Bhojani's portrayal of the cute Gujju-turned-mod is by far the highlight of the film. It is wonderful to see his talents reined in well by Jha, and hence being used to the full, unlike a lot of the work he does, or is probably asked to do, on television.  Aside from that, it is the little moments, like putting desi cigarettes in a pack of Marlboros, that lend the film a charm of its own. It is encouraging to see that such alternative films are being made, with the express purpose of entertainment, while remaining entirely independent of any pretensions to art cinema.

He is suspended from duty.  He is dropped off in the middle of a mysterious forest. He comes across various people who are in a dispute about an apparently unique tree named 'Charisma' growing in a clearing in the forest. Jinbo believes the plant is toxic will eventually kill the whole forest.  She wants to poison the tree so that the forest can be restored to its original condition. Kiriyama, a former sanatorium patient, wants to protect the tree, even if this leads to the death of the rest of the forest. Other military figures want to take the tree away for a collector.  Yabuike becomes the central figure in the dispute, somehow able to decide what will happen. After the tree has been stolen by the milias, recaptured by Kiriyama with Yabuike's help, and burned by Jinbo, a new, bigger tree appears, possibly similar to Charisma.  Yabuike mulls over the two choices he faces: saving the individual tree, or saving the whole forest. He decides that the dichotomy is a false one.  First that life and death are part of the same force, and second that every tree is a special tree and together they are a forest, but simultaneously no tree signifies anything more than any other.  Ultimately some will live and some will die and some will be killed and some will be saved.  When the head of the militia takes Jinbo hostage, Yabuike has no hesitation in shooting, though not killing, him.  The final scene shows Yabuike making his way back to the city to seek treatment for the injured militia. In the distance, the city can be seen in flames.

Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return
  Hannah, the first child born of the original Gatlin corn cult, visits the town of Gatlin to find her real mother. On the way, she picks up a street preacher by the name of Zachariah whose car broke down.  He tells her about her name, and then vanishes. After crashing into a corn field a lady sheriff suddenly appears and takes Hannah to a hospital in town. Once there, she finds out Isaac was not killed by "He Who Walks Behind The Rows" after the death god took control of his body in the first film, but instead went into a coma. The hospital appears to be filled with strange patients who speak of a prophecy involving Hannah and Isaac before the scene changes.  After she leaves the hospital and resumes her journey, she is nearly driven off the road by a mysterious truck. After pulling into a strange motel, she almost steps on a dead crow and then is startled by a smiling young boy (Daniel L Nicoletti) who suddenly appeared in a chair next to her car. In the motel office, she meets a pair of romantically-involved teenagers, a girl and her boyfriend, Matt. She then checks into the motel. The next morning as Hannah is leaving the motel, a small crowd gathers around her car, fascinated by her. Meanwhile, the scene changes and it is revealed that Isaac has awakened from his long 19 year sleep (in which He Who Walks Behind the Rows left him in at the end of the first film) and that he has a son. Hannah returns to the hospital where she begins having visions in the empty hallway before Gabriel appears behind her. He shows her to the record-room so she can look for her birth-certificate. While they're in the dark, she is almost killed when Jake tries to split her head open with an axe. Gabriel leaves Hannah alone to take Jake back to his room. While alone, Hannah finds a scythe pinning what she thinks is her birth-certificate into the wall.  In the middle of the night, a strange woman tries to touch Hannah while she is lying in bed, but leaves once she realizes Hannah is awake. Hannah recognizes her truck as the one that drove her off the road. She follows the truck until dawn into the middle of the corn-field, but before she can follow the person she runs into Jesse: another strange teenager carrying a machete. He tells her the owner of the truck is Rachel Colby, the same name on the birth-certificate. In her motel-room, Hannah discovers the words "GET OUT OR DIE!" written in what appears to be blood in the shower. Back at the church, Rachel confronts Isaac. It is revealed that Rachel is the widow of Amos ( Both Rachel and Amos appeared as teenagers in Children of the Corn) and she believes her daughter to be dead. When she leaves after arguing with the prophet, Isaac tells how she will be punished for her betrayal. Rachel later talks with Dr. Michaels, who just wants to move on beyond the ideas of cults and sacrifices. He tells Rachel to do whatever she needs to do to try to stop Isaac.  Dr. Michaels comes back to the hospital, he finds Jake has clogged the sink and caused water to go all over the floor and is now muttering mindlessly on his knees. Isaac steps out of the shadows, displaying supernatural power. Michaels stands, unafraid of him, warning him to leave Hannah alone, exposing himself as the one who took Hannah away from the town. Isaac pulls a sparking electric cord from the wall and drops it on the wet floor, electrocuting Michaels. Later, Isaac approaches the son, who is revealed to be Matt. He is proud in the belief that his son will carry on his legacy. Matt, though, seems less than enthusiastic. While Gabriel talks with Isaac in the cornfield, they both talk of the events that transpired and about the prophecy, but Gabriel mocks Issac for letting his own disciples hang him on a cross (which happened in the first film) and is forced to leave. Hannah is meanwhile driven off the road again, this time by a drunken Matt. After she yells at him, he hands her a shovel and tells her he is a descendant of Isaac and for her to trace her lineage. Hannah begins digging up the grave of Baby Colby, Rachel's apparently dead child. As she digs, the bloody dead body falls right above her head hanging from a tree; however, this turns out to be only an illusion. Rachel is in the graveyard with her and warns her that there's no going back if she continues. Hannah then says she'll only leave if Rachel tells her the truth. Rachel denies her this, calling it "repulsive". As Hannah prepares to open the casket, a desperate Rachel tells her the prophecy: "The firstborn daughter of the children will return on the eve of her nineteenth-birthday to find out who she is and He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows will awaken".       Hannah opens the casket to see it is empty and Rachel knew Hannah was her child and wasn't dead. She tells a distraught Hannah that Isaac wants Hannah to make a new, "pure" race. Hannah accuses her of insanity and runs away. In the corn-fields, all of the cult has gathered to celebrate as Matt is branded as the first of the chosen. While Hannah is walking through the corn-fields that night, she is surrounded by children, one of whom injects her with a sedative. Hannah wakes up surrounded by the cult-members and a blazing bonfire. They place a crown of corn-husks on her head and brand her hand like they did Matt. They begin to perform a union-ceremony between her and Matt, but Hannah escapes. They try to catch her, activating the irrigation-system and driving motorcycles through the fields. Rachel appears before the cult-members, claiming Isaac is a fraud. In the fields, Matt's girlfriend attempts to help Hannah escape, because she wants to be with Matt. They are soon cornered by the cult-members who capture them. It turns out that Gabriel was on the bike Hannah was put on and takes her out of the cornfields. Matt's girlfriend, though, isn't so lucky and Isaac orders Matt to kill her. Matt refuses and Isaac, cursing his son, splits her in half with Jesse's blade. With that, Matt runs into the corn-field.  Gabriel tends Hannah's wounds in a barn, helps her bathe and kisses her. They begin to have intercourse at the exact moment the clock strikes twelve. Matt then soon appears in the barn, Hannah asks about her mother and, after not receiving any answer, leaves to look for her. While in the barn, Gabriel shows Matt his collection of all of the farming tools of the original children and promises that Matt will be with his girlfriend. He leaves the barn with Hannah and Matt impales himself on a scythe. In the hospital, Rachel is being held in the basement and Hannah is being led to her by visions of her being beaten by Cora. In the hallway she meets Jake, who warns her of "a false-prophet, sheep’s-clothing, raving-wolves!" while Gabriel kills Jesse with his supernatural-power. Hannah now confronts Isaac, who now believes himself to be 'He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows' and has gone mad with power. Gabriel storms down the halls of the hospital and, when Cora tries to shoot him, with a flick of his wrist and the word 'bang', has her kill herself. He then confronts Isaac and exposes that he was the firstborn child of the children and that Isaac denied him his birthright in favor of his own son.  Gabriel tells Hannah to kill Isaac, but listening to her mother, Hannah does not. Gabriel however goes on to explain how everything that has happened has gone according to his plan. He then levitates Isaac with his power and reveals himself to be 'He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows", having stolen the first born child's body and has been manipulating everything from the start. He restrains Isaac to the ground and stabs him with the broken end of a lead pipe, ending the mad prophet once and for all. Rachel stabs Gabriel when he tries to convince Hannah to stay, then she and Hannah flee from the hospital but not before Gabriel tells Hannah "The seeds have already been sown" before dying. Gabriel, though, is healed almost instantly, and after commenting on his 'good performance', begins to set off explosions which kill Jake. Rachel and Hannah are then seen walking down the road, with Hannah now knowing what Gabriel's words meant. She is now pregnant with the child of 'He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows'.

Chill Factor (film)
 Ten years after a covert military experiment on a remote Pacific island went wrong and killed eighteen servicemen and his assistant, Dr. Richard Long is still trying to forget the havoc and death that his experiment caused.  Living in the small town of Jerome, Montana, Long still conducts scientific experiments at the local base, but far more enjoys his time fly-fishing with Tim Mason, who works in the local greasy spoon and has a checkered past.  Long's life changes, and then ends, when he's visited by Colonel Andrew Brynner, a former military officer who took the blame and served ten years in Leavenworth for Long's experiment.  Now a free man with a score to settle with the government, Brynner has assembled a team of high-tech terrorists, including an icy woman named Vaughn, and plans to steal and then sell "Elvis"—Long's highly volatile, blue crystal substance—to the highest international bidder, thus having his revenge against the government for covering up its existence, and making him a scapegoat for their handling of the weapon.  Unfortunately for Brynner, Long has already delivered "Elvis" to Tim, along with the directions that the substance must remain below fifty degrees, or it will detonate, and kill everyone within several hundred miles of it.  After Mason and Arlo, a wisecracking ice cream delivery man, have a run-in with Brynner, they set off en route for Fort Magruder, some ninety miles away. The two don't get along with each other—Arlo only agrees to transport the substance in his ice cream truck because Mason held a gun on him—but they find a common bond in trying to avoid Brynner and his team.  With the help of Colonel Leo Vitelli, Arlo and Mason try to survive Brynner's attacks, avoid the local deputy, Pappas, who's also hot on their trail, and keep "Elvis" below fifty degrees.  Arlo and Mason finally reach the base, but get ambushed by Brynner and his team who plan on detonating the device in an abandoned weapons test facility.

A Civil Action (film)
 Environmental toxins in the city of [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] contaminate the area's water supply, and become linked to a number of deaths of neighboring children. Jan Schlichtmann ([[John Travolta]]), a cocky and successful Boston attorney who zips around town in his [[Porsche]], and his small firm of personal injury lawyers are asked by Woburn resident Anne Anderson ([[Kathleen Quinlan]]) to take legal action against those responsible.  After originally rejecting a seemingly unprofitable case, Jan finds a major [[environmental issue]] involving groundwater contamination that has great legal potential and a couple of defendants with deep pockets. The local  [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] could be responsible for several deadly cases of leukemia, but also are the main employers for the area. Jan decides to go forward against two giant corporations (real-life companies [[Beatrice Foods]] and [[W. R. Grace and Company]]) with links to the tanneries, thinking that the case could possibly earn him millions, as well as enhancing his and his firm's already considerable reputation.  Bringing a [[class action]] lawsuit in federal court, Jan represents families who demand a clean-up of contaminated areas and an apology. However, the case develops a life of its own and takes over the lives of Jan and his firm. The lawyers for the tanneries' parent corporations are not easy to intimidate, a judge ([[John Lithgow]]) makes a key ruling against the plaintiffs, and soon Jan and his partners find themselves in a position where their professional and financial survival has been staked on the outcome of the case.  Jan stubbornly declines settlement offers, gradually coming to believe that the case is about more than just the money. He allows his pride to take over, making outrageous demands and deciding that he must win at all costs. Pressures take their toll, with Jan and his partners going deeply into debt. After a lengthy trial, the case is dismissed in favor of Beatrice, Jan having turned down an offer of $20 million from Beatrice attorney Jerry Facher ([[Robert Duvall]]) while the jury was deliberating. The plaintiffs are forced to accept a settlement with Grace that barely covers the expense involved in trying the case, leaving Jan and his partners broke. The families are deeply disappointed, and Jan's partners dissolve their partnership, effectively breaking up the firm. Jan ends up alone, living in a small apartment and running a small-time law practice. He manages to find the last key witness to the case, but lacks resources and courage to appeal the judgement. The files are archived while Jan later files for bankruptcy.  In a postscript, a montage of short scenes involving the key characters in the film, combined with on-screen captions, reveals that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], building on Jan's work on the case, later brought its own enforcement action against the offending companies, forcing them to pay millions to clean up the land and the groundwater. It takes Jan several years to settle his debts, and he now practices environmental law in Toms River, New Jersey.  ===Differences from the book===  The plotline has been greatly simplified from the book, e.g. later findings by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and its potential consequences that might have allowed the plaintiffs another trial against Beatrice, and which did ultimately lead to a conviction of [[perjury]] against John Riley, and improper conduct for Mary Ryan, are referred to only briefly in the epilogue.  The characters [[Charles Nesson]], Mark Phillips, Rikki Klieman, Teresa Padro and others have been removed from the film version, as well as the plot points that they contribute.  
The Cider House Rules (film)
 Homer Wells, an [[orphan]], grows up in a Maine [[orphanage]] directed by kindly, avuncular Dr. Wilbur Larch. Homer is returned twice by foster parents; his first [[Foster Care|foster parents]] thought he was too quiet and the second parents beat him.  Dr. Larch is addicted to [[Diethyl ether|ether]] and also secretly performs [[abortions]] for women.  Conditions at the orphanage are very sparse, but the children are treated with love and respect, and they are like an extended family.  Each night before they go to sleep, Dr. Larch says, "Goodnight you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England!", as both encouragement and a kind of blessing.  Homer, the oldest among the orphans, is very bright, helpful and even-tempered, so Larch trains him in [[obstetrics]] and abortions as an [[apprentice]], despite Homer's never having attended high school. Homer disapproves of abortions, and, although he has been trained by Larch in the field, he refuses to perform them.  After several years, Homer is very skillful and confident in performing obstetrical duties.  Larch wants him to take over his position after he retires, but Homer finds this idea impossible, because he lacks formal medical education and wants to see more of the world than just the orphanage.  Homer leaves the orphanage with Candy Kendall and her boyfriend, Wally Worthington, a young couple who came to the clinic to have an abortion.  Wally is a pilot on leave from the service.  Wally's mother, Olive, owns the Worthington family apple orchard where Homer settles in as a worker.  Homer lives on the Worthington estate in a bunkhouse called the Cider House.  Wally leaves to fight in [[World War II]]. Homer is exempt from military service because Dr. Larch has diagnosed that he has a heart condition.  While Wally is away, Homer and Candy have an affair. He goes to work picking apples with Arthur Rose's team.  Arthur and his team are migrant workers who are employed seasonally at the orchard by the Worthingtons, but are illiterate.  When Homer reads them the rules of the Cider House that have been posted, the workers observe that the rules have been made without the occupants' consent by people who do not live there and so do not face their problems.  Consequently, they feel that they can ignore these rules.  Homer and Candy become much closer during this period of harvest and spend more time together while Wally is in Burma fighting.  After Arthur and his team come back to work at the orchard the following season, it comes to light that he has raped and impregnated his own daughter, Rose.  Rose confides in Homer after he finds out himself that she is pregnant and experiencing morning sickness.  Homer decides that he must help Rose, and agrees to perform an abortion, with Arthur's assistance.  A few days later, when Rose tries to run away, her father notices and goes to say goodbye; Rose stabs him and flees.  Arthur then makes his own injury worse, and as a last request, asks Homer and another worker to tell the police that his death was a suicide.  Wally returns from Burma a paraplegic, and although she loves Homer, Candy decides to go where she is most needed.  Immediately following this decision, Homer learns that Dr. Larch has succumbed to an accidental ether overdose.  Eventually, Homer decides he too should go where he is most needed and returns to the orphanage, where he is greeted joyously by both the children and staff.  He is surprised to discover that he has been accepted as the new Director.  Homer learns that Larch faked his diagnosis and medical record to keep him out of the war.  Larch fabricated college credentials for Homer and used [[reverse psychology]] to convince the orphanage board to appoint Homer as the next director.  Homer fills the paternal role that Larch previously held for the children of the orphanage, saying, "Goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England!"

The City (1999 film)
 In the center of El-Madina lives Ali, a young man who wants to act but is unable to find proper work. The only escape for his creative instincts, besides nightly conversations with a poster of [[Robert De Niro]]’s Raging Bull, is occasional bottom-of-the-line stage melodramas. Ali makes money as a butchers’ accountant in his neighborhood’s [[souq]], where his father is a vegetable vendor.   This quarter, [[Rod al-Faraj]], is emblematic of a number of [[inner city]] neighborhoods in [[Cairo]], which have been erased, and isolated their residents to desert suburbs by an Egyptian government, wanting to restore its historic monuments and attract tourists. Throughout the film, there’s a point at which Ali’s souq, slotted for tourist gentrification, is shut by the [[Egyptian internal security]].   He finally decides to escape Egypt and pursue acting in [[France]]. Two years later we do find him acting, not on stage but in the boxing ring. Unable to find legal work, he has fallen in with a fellow countryman who pays him to “throw” fights in crooked boxing matches.   Ali is again stripped of his livelihood. After his business is forcibly absorbed by French [[gangsters]], Ali’s partner betrays him and flees to Egypt, leaving him penniless and without an identity.   Ultimately the actor finds himself back in Rod al-Faraj, having to start his life quite literally from scratch.<ref>http://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/al-madina-two-movies-one-egyptian-frame-french-plot</ref>

The Color of Paradise

His father, shamed and burdened by Mohammed's blindness, arrives late to pick him up and then tries to convince the headmaster to keep Mohammed over the summer. The headmaster refuses, so Mohammed's father eventually takes him home.  Mohammed's father, who is a widower, now wants to marry a local girl and is preparing for the wedding. He approaches the girl's parents with gifts and they give him . He tries to hide the fact that he has a blind son because he fears the girl's family will see that as a bad omen.  Meanwhile, Mohammed happily roams around the beautiful hills of his village with his sisters. He touches and feels the nature around him, counting the sounds of animals, and imitating them. He displays a unique attitude towards nature, and seems to understand its rhythms and textures as a language. Mohammed goes to the local school with his sisters and reads the lessons from his textbook in [[Braille]], which amazes the children and the teacher.  Fearing his bride-to-be's family will learn of Mohammed, his father takes him away and leaves him with a blind carpenter who agrees to make him an apprentice. The blind carpenter mentors the boy, who wants to see [[God]]. Mohammad says God does not love him and thus made him blind and tells him about how his teacher told him that God loves them more as they are blind, but then asks why God should make him blind if he loves him more.  He also tells him that he wanted to be able to see God, to which his teacher had said that God is everywhere and that you can also feel God. The carpenter then just says that he agrees with his teacher and walks away, possibly affected by the boy's words, as he himself is blind.  Mohammed's grandmother is heartbroken when she realizes that Hashem (Mohammed's father) has given him away to a blind carpenter and she falls ill. She leaves the family home but Hashem tries to convince her to stay back, questioning his destiny, wondering why he lost his father as a young boy, asking why God has taken away his wife and cursed him with a blind boy, and asking his mother what she did for him. Mohammed's grandmother faints on her way so Hashem carries her back home. Eventually Mohammed's grandmother dies. The bride's family sees this as a bad omen and the wedding is called off.  His hopes destroyed, Hashem decides to bring him back. The film shows glimpses of shame and pity that Hashem felt for himself and his son all along. He goes back to the blind carpenter and takes back Mohammed. They head for home through the woods. As they cross a small, crudely made wooden bridge over a stream, the bridge collapses and Mohammed falls into the water and is carried away by the strong currents. For a moment his father stands petrified, looking on in shock at the sight of his son being dragged away; he appears to be mentally torn between rescuing him and finally becoming free of this lifelong burden. Moments later he makes his decision and dashes into the river, and is also carried along swiftly by the roaring water, behind Mohammed.  As the film ends, Hashem wakes up on the shore of the [[Caspian Sea]] and sees Mohammed lying motionless a short distance away. He drags himself up and stumbles towards Mohammed's body and takes it in his arms.  In the ending scene, Hashem sits weeping over his son's body and looking to the skies. You can hear the sound of a woodpecker, and Mohammed's fingers slowly start to move; perhaps he is "reading" the sound with his fingers as if they are Braille dots. Maybe he thinks the woodpecker is giving clues about "the color of God". Or maybe, he has finally touched God.

After a bombing in Chinatown, Chen is reluctantly teamed up with Danny Wallace, who is unaware of Chen's corruption. Danny was also secretly tasked by Internal Affairs to monitor Chen. Danny lied to Chen and the Asian Gang Unit by claiming that he took the job as a means to quickly gain his detective shield.  During a police raid on a Fukienese whorehouse, Chen saves Wallace's life. Wallace, knowing that his life is now in Chen's hands, initiates a bust on a drug operation, not knowing that an undercover FBI agent was involved.

Cosy Dens
 Pelíšky is a bittersweet [[coming-of-age story]] set in the months from Christmas 1967 leading up to the ill-fated 1968 [[Prague Spring]]. Teenager Michal Šebek (Michael Beran) has a crush on his upstairs neighbor, Jindřiška Krausová (Kristýna Nováková). Michal's family is headed by a stubborn army officer who is a firm supporter of the communist system and who believes that communist technology will eventually triumph over western imperialist capitalism, while Jindřiška's father is an ardent foe of the [[Communism|Communists]] and a war hero, who has been imprisoned several times because of his outspoken opposition to the regime; he believes that "the Bolsheviks have a year at most, maybe two".  In contrast, the younger generation couldn't care less for politics. Instead, Michal sports a [[Beatles]] mop-top while Elien (Ondřej Brousek), the local hipster whose parents live in the USA, runs a local film group specialising in [[Hollywood film|Hollywood]] and pre-war [[Cinema of France|French film]]s, while Jindřiška becomes Elien's girlfriend.  After a wedding that unites the families, the film ends with the news breaking of the invasion of the Warsaw Pact.  A dispute in the film illustrates the tension between the nationalistic and fervently anti-Communist father and Jindřiška, who is more apolitical.  Jindřiška dares to suggest that her mother’s dumplings are closer to Italian ''[[gnocchi]]'' than traditional Czech ''[[knedliky]]'' (translated as "Viennese dumplings" in the English subtitles), sending her father into a rage.  The plastic spoon on the poster refers to the gifts, miracles of "socialist science", that a Šebek uncle keeps sending the family and which always fail to perform as promised, humiliating the Mr. Šebek.  Both cases foreshadow how the political hopes of the fathers are destroyed by the coming [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion]].<ref>http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/07/sff4-j29.html</ref>

The Craic
 It's 1988 and two best friends from Ireland (Jimeoin [McKeown], Alan McKee) flee from [[Belfast]] after a violent confrontation with Colin (Robert Morgan) of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and illegally enter [[Australia]], finding seasonal work picking fruit at [[orchards]] to afford [[hostels]], [[food|sustenance]] and [[Alcoholic_drink|booze]] costs (but so cash strapped, their [[Jack_and_Coke|whiskey and coke]]s are made by taking swigs of [[whiskey]] and [[Coca-Cola|coke]], mixing the two on the fly in their mouth), the last often used to dim the two's fear of [[immigration]] officers.  After some gentle persuasion, Fergus Montague (McKeown) goes on a TV dating game show and wins a trip to [[Queensland]]. This, however, occurs just as the pair's apartment is raided by immigration officer Derek Johnson (Nicolas Bell) and Wesley Murray (McKee) is forced to escape and eventually joins his friend in Queensland. Meanwhile, Colin is sent to Australia in a [[witness protection program]] after he gives up some of his former colleagues, and (much to the skepticism of his watchers, the [[Special_Air_Service_Regiment|S.A.S.]]) names Fergus and Wesley as terrorists. Irritated by their lack of progress he eventually takes off to find them himself.

Kathryn's step-brother, Sebastian ([[Ryan Phillippe]]), enters the room, whereupon Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile. Kathryn reveals to him that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds ([[Charlie O'Connell]]), who has dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile; he refuses as he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), the virgin daughter of their prep school's new headmaster. Annette is a 'paradigm of chastity and virtue' who recently wrote a published essay about [[Sexual abstinence|saving herself for marriage]] and has been temporarily staying with Sebastian's aunt. The two make a wager: if Sebastian fails to bed Annette, Kathryn gets Sebastian's vintage [[Jaguar XK140]]; if he succeeds, Kathryn will have sex with him. It is mentioned that Sebastian keeps a journal detailing his conquests.  Sebastian's first attempt to seduce Annette fails, as she had already been told of his reputation as a womanizer. He vents to his friend, Blaine Tuttle ([[Joshua Jackson]]), who suggests that the informant might be Annette's ex-boyfriend and [[closeted]] jock, Greg McConnell ([[Eric Mabius]]), revealing to Sebastian that Greg tried to make a pass at him. Sebastian uses the information to seduce Greg, while secretly filming their meeting. Sebastian then confronts Greg with the photographs, but the latter denies warning Annette. Greg is pressured into investigating who did, and Sebastian also orders him to present him in a good light to Annette. Later, while gushing about Sebastian to Annette, Greg discovers that the culprit is Cecile's mother, Mrs. Caldwell. Wanting revenge on the Caldwells, Sebastian agrees to seduce Cecile.  Meanwhile, Cecile's music teacher, Ronald Clifford ([[Sean Patrick Thomas]]), is in love with her. Cecile confesses this to Kathryn.

The next day, Cecile confides in Kathryn, who advises her to learn from Sebastian so that she can make Ronald happy in bed.  Sebastian begins to fall in love with Annette, who returns his feelings but still resists him. Sebastian calls her a hypocrite because she claims to be waiting for her one true love, but when her one true love chooses to love her back, she resists. She relents, but Sebastian refuses her, confused about his feelings colliding with his stolid sexuality. Annette flees to the estate of her friend's parents. Sebastian tracks her down, professes his love, and makes love to her. As he has won the bet, Kathryn offers herself to Sebastian the next day, but he refuses; he now only wants Annette. Kathryn tries kissing him, but he rejects her again saying that it's only a stupid bet. She starts taunting him and he tells her he was planning on confessing the truth to Annette anyway. Kathryn warns him not to do it, that people don't change overnight and that it would not only be destroying his reputation, but also hers.  Afterwards, Sebastian full of remorse tells Annette he just wanted to see what she was like in bed. Heartbroken, Annette tells him to leave. He then goes to see Kathryn to fulfill the initial arrangement they had and tells her that he has broken up with Annette and arranged for Cecile and Ronald to be together. Kathryn reveals that she has known all along that he was truly in love with Annette and that it amused her to make him feel ashamed of it. She tells him he gave up on the first person he ever loved, all because she threatened his reputation. Sebastian desperately tries to get a hold of Annette to confess the truth and beg for her forgiveness. Kathryn calls Ronald, telling him that Sebastian slept with Cecile and lying to him that Sebastian hit her. Annette refuses to see or speak to Sebastian, so he leaves his journal for her to read. In which, he has detailed all of Kathryn's manipulative schemes as well as their bet, and written his true feelings for Annette. As he heads home, Ronald intercepts him on the street, starting a fight. Annette runs out and tries to stop it, but is accidentally thrown into the way of traffic. Sebastian pushes her to safety, and is hit by a cab. Before dying, Sebastian confesses he loves her and Annette tells him she loves him too.

He sleeps with a fellow croupier named Bella ([[Kate Hardie]]) in contravention of casino policy. His relationship with girlfriend Marion ([[Gina McKee]]) begins to deteriorate when he lets her read part of his book about a cold, unfeeling croupier who enjoys seeing gamblers lose — a character transparently based on Jack himself. Bella confronts Jack at his apartment, accuses him of getting her fired and tells Marion about the one-night stand.  One gambler, Jani ([[Alex Kingston]]), tries to befriend Jack — another serious violation of casino rules. Jani shows him bruises saying she got them from gambling creditors and asks Jack to be the inside man for a planned robbery at the casino. All he has to do is raise the alarm when a gambler cheats at his table. Jack eventually agrees and accepts a £10,000 advance with an additional £10,000 if all goes well. In doing so, Jack notices that Jani's injuries were faked.  Marion reconciles with Jack but discovers that he is involved in something criminal and tries to foil it. On the night of the robbery, Jack raises the alarm anyway and gets beaten by the gambler as a distraction while others try to grab the money. They fail, and Jack and Marion have an argument but she stays with him.  When a late-night knock at the door comes, Jack assumes it to be the casino robbers demanding the return of their advance money. Instead, it is a policeman, who informs him that Marion has been killed in an apparent hit-and-run.  Jack finishes his book and gets it published anonymously. It is a big success, but he doesn't change anything about his life, continuing to work as a croupier and live in his basement flat, not even buying the new car he wanted.  Jack goes on with his life and gets another call, this one from Jani, who congratulates him on playing his part in the attempted robbery and implies that she benefited significantly. Then she puts his father on the phone, and he implies that he set up the croupier job for Jack in order to arrange for the attempted robbery, and he benefited as well.  Stunned but amused, Jack hangs up. Just then, Bella appears from the bedroom and kisses him.

Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)
  In an underwater facility, a team of scientists is doing research on [[Shortfin mako shark|mako sharks]] to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in [[Alzheimer's disease]] patients. After one of the sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of teenagers, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility. In the laboratory, doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock prove their research is working by testing a certain [[protein complex]] that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark. However, the shark awakens, and severs Jim's right arm. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter to evacuate Jim, but as he is being lifted, the stormy weather causes Jim to fall into the shark pen. The shark then grabs Jim's stretcher, and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots.  In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine biologist Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him, and flooding the facility. The group goes to the facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a [[submersible]] to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them smarter but more deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.  The remaining crew opts to climb up the elevator shaft at the risk of [[pressure|destabilizing]] the pool. In the process, Janice loses her grip and falls into the shark-infested water.

In the facility's kitchen, which has been partially flooded, cook Sherman "Preacher" Dudley, whose parrot is devoured in the process, manages to kill the first shark with an explosion. He then makes his way to the elevator shaft, where he encounters Carter, Tom, and Susan. Carter and Tom go to the flooded laboratory to activate a control panel that drains a stairway to the surface, while Susan heads to her room to collect her research material. Carter and Tom reach the control panel, but the largest shark storms in, killing Tom and sabotaging the controls. In her room, Susan encounters another shark, and manages to kill it with a power cable, destroying her research in the process.  After regrouping, Carter, Susan, and Preacher go to a [[decompression chamber]], and swim to the surface. Carter realizes that the sharks made them flood the facility, so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable to get out of the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a [[harpoon]], but also pierces Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark.

Suddenly, word arrives that [[Uday Hussein]], the leader of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], has invaded [[Kuwait]]. Using a television cameraman who is following his campaign, Emerson notifies the world that unless Hussein orders an immediate retreat and personally surrenders, he will bomb [[Baghdad]] with a nuclear weapon.  Hussein, through his [[Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations|United Nations envoy]], refuses to back down and cuts off telephone negotiations, claiming Emerson is a non-elected leader and also a [[American Jews|Jew]]. He threatens to fire Iraq's black-market [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]] at several global locations including Emerson's own, near [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] in Colorado, if his country comes under attack.  It is learned that Iraq purchased these weapons from [[France]]. Despite being a U.S. ally, the [[President of France|French President]] appears to be cavalier in confirming this with Emerson and his entourage. The sites of the missile launchers include [[Libya]] and [[North Korea]].  Emerson is counseled by his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]], Marshall Thompson, a former university classmate, and by his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]], Gayle Redford. Once his ultimatum is made and the countdown to his deadline begins, the President and his staff are confronted with the opinions of the diner's customers, including its angry owner and cook, Harvey, and a young bigot named Ralph.  Emerson is not only adamant in his beliefs, he seems every bit as willing as Hussein to trigger a nuclear war. He orders a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] bomber to cross Iraq's borders despite the threats of the Iraqi ambassador that this would constitute an act of war. In retaliation, the Iraqis aim 23 nuclear [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] against various countries, including [[Australia]], [[Japan]], France and other targets.  Emerson argues with advisers while appearing totally confident in his own actions. Suddenly, Harvey brandishes a gun and shoots the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] major carrying the briefcase that contains the launch codes. Emerson's bodyguards then kill the cook in self-defense.  To the horror of all, Emerson carries out his threat. He authorizes the dropping of a 100 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] bomb on Baghdad, resulting in the complete destruction of that city.  Iraq's retaliation begins. A bomb lands in [[Greece]], but it does not detonate. Neither does a device that lands in Japan. A majority of the other missiles have been intercepted.  A short time later, Emerson addresses the world on TV. He explains that in order to prevent Iraq from attaining nuclear weapons, the U.S. sold it nuclear weapons through the French, while ensuring that they would never be able to function properly.  Already reeling from the shocks of the past few minutes, the President's aides are further astounded when he announces his immediate withdrawal from the election campaign. He did what he felt it necessary to do, but believes that someone else should be the one to carry on.

Jam, imbued with new confidence, goes back to the rally and angrily berates his mother for her domineering ways and her hypocrisy, telling her that constantly shoving her extreme religious views down his throat has done nothing but cause him to [[Atheism|despise religion]] and he demands his drumsticks back. She does so and apologizes to him, remarking to the crowd, "They grow up so fast".  When the boys meet up empty-handed, they beat each other up to make it appear that they had been mugged of their tickets. Upon arriving at [[Cobo Center|Cobo Hall]], the guards are skeptical, but Trip points out Chongo and his friends, who are just entering, as the culprits. When the guards find Trip's wallet with his [[Kiss Army]] picture ID and money, they confiscate Chongo's tickets along with it and give them to the boys. Astonished and elated, the boys enter the concert hall as Kiss plays the title song of the film. As it ends, [[Peter Criss]] throws a drumstick and Jam catches it with joy and excitement.<ref></ref>  
Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo
 Deuce Bigalow, an insecure [[fishtank]] cleaner ([[aquarist]]), is fired for cleaning the tank at a public aquarium in the nude. Deuce is unsuccessful in attracting women, so he attempts to keep himself busy at work. On a house call, he meets an Argentinean [[male prostitute]] Antoine Laconte. Antoine is going on a business trip, and so asks Deuce to care for his sick [[lionfish]] and protect his home while he is away. Deuce accidentally sets Antoine's kitchen on fire when trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich in the toaster, and breaks an expensive fish tank.  Fearing Antoine will kill him, Deuce is forced to find a way to pay for the damage. Low-rent pimp T.J. Hicks offers to help Deuce make enough money to buy a new fish tank, and convinces Deuce to take over the absent Antoine's role as a gigolo. Deuce decides to make the clients feel better about themselves, since he only desires to have sex with beautiful women.  Deuce meets unusual clients but he still manages to get along with them, despite there being no sex involved, by helping them with certain issues in their lives. The clients include Carol, a woman who is severely [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]], Ruth, who has [[Tourette Syndrome]] with [[coprolalia]], and therefore is afraid of socializing, Fluisa, an [[Obesity|obese]] woman weighing close to 750 pounds, and Tina, another woman that has a pituitary gland disorder and is extremely tall. Deuce's list of clients gradually increases, with each client being satisfied by much more fulfilling measures due to his evasion of sex with them. However, Deuce falls in love with one of his clients, Kate ([[Arija Bareikis]]), who has a [[prosthetic leg]]. She later breaks up with Deuce when she finds out that he was a prostitute hired by her friends.  Meanwhile, Deuce is being stalked by Detective Chuck Fowler, who demands Antoine's "[[Address book#Little black book|black book]]" of clients and threatens to take Deuce to jail if he does not comply. Deuce eventually helps Fowler please his wife by stripping and erotically dancing for her, and the two make amends. Deuce is still taken into custody on prostitution charges, as Fowler needs someone to bring in and Deuce's own refusal to betray his newfound friend, T.J. (whom Fowler described as another person of interest aside Deuce due to his previous acquaintance with Antoine), by turning him in. At the hearing, it is revealed that Deuce never slept with any of the clients except for Kate. Since Deuce gave back the money to Kate and was not paid for sex with her, he is cleared of all charges.  Using the money he made, Deuce restores Antoine's fish tank, although due to time constraints he is warned that the glass may not be installed properly. Unfortunately, Kate's blind roommate accidentally kills the prize fish in Antoine's aquarium when she starts the mixer in which the fish was being kept. Deuce buys a replacement fish and returns to Antoine's house just in time. Antoine is suspicious, but cannot figure out why. He taps the new aquarium and the glass shatters. Deuce then reveals his prostituting adventures to the bemused and furious Antoine. Enraged, Antoine tries to kill Deuce, and at one point shoots a [[crossbow]] bolt at him. The aforementioned overweight client, Fluisa, shows up, comes between the two men, and saves Deuce's life (she is not killed because the bolt hits her breasts, between which she has hidden a roast [[chicken]]). Antoine is then arrested by Detective Fowler, and Deuce marries Kate. The end sequences continues to follow the epilogue, Deuce's father becomes a male prostitute, Fluisa underwent extensive liposuction and is now working as a model in Victoria's Secret known as Naomi, Ruth opens up an all girls school for Tourette's, Carol manages to fulfill her dream trip to [[France]], T.J. starts his own reality show dedicated to his experiences as a male prostitute and an incarcerated Antoine marries Tina.

Dick (film)
 Betsy Jobs ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) and Arlene Lorenzo ([[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]) are two sweet-natured but somewhat ditzy teenage girls living in [[Washington D.C.]] in the early 1970s. Betsy comes from a wealthy family in the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] area, while Arlene lives with her widowed mother in an apartment in the [[Watergate Hotel|Watergate building]]. One night, on a quest to mail a letter to enter a contest to win a date with [[teen idol]] singer [[Bobby Sherman]], the two girls sneak out of Arlene's home, at the same time as the Watergate break-in. They manage to enter and leave through the parking garage by taping the latch of a door, accidentally causing the break-in to be discovered. They are seen by [[G. Gordon Liddy]] ([[Harry Shearer]]), who they believe to be committing a jewel robbery; they panic and run away. The security guard, startled by the taped door, calls the police, who immediately arrest the burglars.  The next day, while at the [[White House]] on a school tour, they accidentally happen across Liddy again. They don't recognize him, but he recognizes them and instantly becomes suspicious. He points them out to [[H. R. Haldeman]] ([[Dave Foley]]), who proceeds to interrogate them; their conversation (in which it is revealed that the girls don't actually think about the President that much) is interrupted firstly by a phone call from Haldeman's wife, and secondly by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] himself ([[Dan Hedaya]]), who takes Haldeman aside to complain about the bugging operation being so fouled up.  The girls are naturally awestruck at being in the same room as Nixon &mdash; but more awestruck at being able to play with his dog, which gives Nixon an idea. In order to keep their silence, he appoints them his official dog-walkers&nbsp;... which means they must be admitted repeatedly to the White House. On these visits they accidentally influence major events such as the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] peace process and the Nixon-[[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] accord, by bringing along cookies that they have inadvertently baked [[marijuana]] into. (Near the end of the film, when Betsy's brother, Larry ([[Devon Gummersall]]), reveals the cookies' "secret ingredient" and realizes the President ate them, he concludes that this was likely a leading cause of Nixon's paranoia.) They also become familiar with the key figures of Nixon's administration, including the long-suffering, frequently ignored [[Henry Kissinger]], and inadvertently learn the major secrets of the [[Watergate scandal]] without realizing what they know.  Arlene, previously infatuated with Bobby Sherman, now falls equally hard for the president.  Just after reading an [[18½ minute gap|18½-minute]] message of love into his tape recorder, she plays back another part of the tape and, after hearing his coarse, brutal rantings, quickly realizes his true nature. When they confront Nixon, he fires and threatens them.  The girls now reevaluate what they have learned and decide to reveal everything to the "radical muckraking bastards" (Nixon's words) at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Bob Woodward]] ([[Will Ferrell]]) and [[Carl Bernstein]] ([[Bruce McCulloch]]). So they become informants; two 15-year-old girls are the true identity of the famous [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] (Betsy's brother had just been caught watching the [[Deep Throat (film)|film of the same name]]). Woodward and Bernstein &mdash; portrayed as petty, childish, and incompetent &mdash; are naturally skeptical of the two girls. To make matters worse, their only piece of [[physical evidence]], a list of names of those involved from the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]], is eaten by Betsy's dog.  Nixon's men realize that the girls are a real threat and attempt tactics such as [[bugging]] and [[Undercover operation|undercover agents]] to find out what they know, eventually going so far as to break into Betsy's house and plant an undercover agent as Arlene's mother's boyfriend. Eventually pushed to the limit after being chased by the Watergate [[White House Plumbers|"plumbers"]], the girls decide to take action: sneaking into Haldeman's house, they manage to find and steal a crucial [[Nixon tapes|tape recording]]. They give a transcription of it to Woodward and Bernstein (keeping the tape as a "souvenir") thus ending Nixon's political career. Nixon, finds Arlene's message on his tape and erases it, reasoning that he'd be "crucified" if it was perceived that he had an affair with a 15-year-old girl. After the resignation, as Nixon's helicopter flies over Betsy's house, the two girls hold up a sign with the phrase "You suck, Dick", further angering the now ex-president.<ref></ref>

Divided We Fall (film)
 The film opens in 1939 [[Czechoslovakia]]. Horst, a [[Czech people|Czech]]-[[German people|German]] [[Nazi]] collaborator married to a German woman and co-worker of Josef, brings food to the invalid Josef and his wife Marie, who are [[Czechs]]. Josef hates the Nazis. When Josef finds David, who had escaped a concentration camp in occupied Poland after first being sent to the [[Theresienstadt]] [[concentration camp]] in northern Bohemia, Josef and Marie decide to hide him in their apartment. Horst makes an unannounced visit, bringing presents as usual. Marie is ambivalent about their secret: On one hand she never misses an opportunity to blame her husband for bringing in the Jew, but on the other she is merciful and sympathetic towards the poor kid locked in the closet day and night. She suggests that Josef accepts Horst's job offer evicting Czech Jews from their homes, so as to get more protection and deflect possible suspicions. Josef accepts and is considered a collaborator by the neighbor Franta (who had tried to give David over to the Nazi authorities, when he first escaped from a concentration camp). Marie spends the days learning [[French language|French]] from David and getting more and more tender toward him. Horst's visits become more frequent, and one afternoon, he attempts to rape Marie.   Josef gets his fertility tested to confirm a long-time rumor: He can't have children. Humiliated by his earlier antics, Horst takes revenge on Marie by forcing them to provide lodging for his supervisor, a committed Nazi bureaucrat, who had suffered a stroke after Nazis kill his son for deserting the army. Marie refuses to accept him on the grounds that she is pregnant. Unfortunately, the community is well-aware that Josef and Marie are infertile, and Josef proposes that David get Marie pregnant in order to stage a "miracle" and avoid further investigation. After much resistance from Marie, she and David have sex. Marie becomes pregnant, and Horst eventually apologizes for his previous behavior.  As the Germans lose ground in [[World War II]], Horst's behavior begins to change. Based on his previous suspicions that someone else is living with Josef and Marie, he redirects German authorities when the latter search the street house by house. Finally, the Germans are defeated and the Czech people take brutal revenge on them.  As the Germans are being driven out, Marie goes into labor. Josef frantically searches for a doctor, but the streets of the city are in chaos and the Nazi-affiliated doctor has already been captured.  He finally finds the new ruling troika which includes his old neighbor Franta as the representative of the Czech Resistance. Unfortunately, Franta remembers him as a collaborator and orders his arrest. Josef protests his innocence and invites them to meet David as proof of his ambivalence towards the Jews, in exchange for a chance to find the Nazi doctor to deliver Marie's baby. In the jails, Josef finds that the doctor has committed suicide but also finds Horst crouched in a corner. Remembering Horst's previous actions that saved David's life, Josef tells the Czech soldiers that Horst is his doctor. The partisans escort them to Josef's house, driving through the ruins of the city. Horst is able to quickly assume the role of Marie's doctor due to his experience delivering his own sons, much to Marie's initial horror. The revolutionaries still want to see David in order to prove Josef's allegiance, but in the chaos and gunfire, David had hid himself elsewhere. The captain of the revolutionaries, a member of the external Czech forces, does not believe Josef's story and is about to shoot him, but David shows up at the last minute after Josef's despairing plea: "Let us be human!" After they all return to the household, Marie and David's son is born. The revolutionaries interrogate David about Horst's background, but David, realizing that Horst had known about the situation for over two years and had not reported it, supports Josef's claim that Horst is a doctor and thus saves Horst's life as well.    Days later, Josef walks the baby through the devastated streets of his city. In the ruins, he imagines David's deceased family and his supervisor's youngest son sitting around a small table, waving at him. Josef picks up David's son and waves his hand back. An aria from [[J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' (''Erbarme dich, mein Gott'', God, please have mercy on our frailty!) is the denouement of the film.

Dogma (film)
  [[List of minor View Askewniverse characters#Bartleby and Loki|Bartleby]] and [[List of minor View Askewniverse characters#Bartleby and Loki|Loki]] are [[fallen angel]]s, eternally banished from heaven to Wisconsin for insubordination, after an inebriated Loki resigned as the Angel of Death. In a newspaper article that arrives anonymously, the angels discover a way home: Cardinal Ignatius Glick is rededicating his church in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]] in the image of the "[[Buddy Christ]]". Anyone entering during the rededication festivities will receive a [[plenary indulgence]], remitting all sins, and permitting direct entry into Heaven. They are encouraged by the demon [[Azrael]] and the Stygian Triplets, three teenage hoodlums who serve Azrael in hell.  [[Bethany Sloane]]—a depressed [[abortion clinic]] counselor—attends a service at her church in Illinois. Donations are solicited for a campaign to stop a New Jersey hospital from disconnecting life support on John Doe Jersey, a homeless man who was beaten senseless by the Triplets. [[Metatron]]—a [[seraph]], and the voice of God—appears to Bethany in a pillar of fire and explains that if Bartleby and Loki succeed in re-entering Heaven, they will overrule the word of God, disprove the fundamental concept of God's [[omnipotence]], and nullify all of existence. Bethany, aided by two prophets, must stop the angels and save the universe.  Now a target, Bethany is attacked by the Triplets, who are driven off by the two foretold prophets—drug-dealing stoners [[Jay and Silent Bob]]. Bethany and the prophets are joined by Rufus, the thirteenth [[Twelve apostles|apostle]], and Serendipity, the Muse of creative inspiration, now working in a strip club in search of inspiration of her own. Azrael summons the Golgothan—a vile creature made of human excrement—but Bob immobilizes it with aerosol air freshener.  On a train to New Jersey, a drunken Bethany reveals her mission to Bartleby, who tries to kill her; Bob throws the angels off the train. Bartleby and Loki now realize the consequences of their scheme; Loki wants no part of destroying all existence, but Bartleby remains angry at God for his expulsion, and for granting free will to humans while demanding servitude of angels, and resolves to proceed.  Metatron confesses to Bethany that God's whereabouts are unknown; he disappeared while visiting New Jersey in human form to play [[skee ball]]. The task falls to Bethany, because—she now learns—she is the [[Brothers of Jesus|last scion]], the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandniece of [[Jesus]].  The group fails to persuade Glick to cancel the celebration; Jay steals one of Glick's golf clubs. Their only remaining option is to keep the angels out of the church; but Azrael and the Triplets trap them in a bar to prevent them from doing so. Azrael reveals that he sent the news clipping to the angels; he would rather end all existence than spend eternity in Hell. Bob kills Azrael with the golf club, which Glick had blessed to improve his game. Bethany blesses the bar sink's contents, and the others drown the Triplets in the [[holy water]]. They race to the church, where Bartleby kills Glick, his parishioners, and assorted bystanders. When Loki—who is now wingless, and therefore mortal, with a conscience—attempts to stop him, Bartleby kills him as well.  Jay attempts to seduce Bethany before all existence ends; when he mentions John Doe Jersey, Bethany puts it all together. Bethany and Bob race across the street to the hospital, as the others try to block Bartleby's path to the church. Bethany disconnects John's life support, liberating God, but killing herself. Bartleby reaches the church entrance, where he confronts God, who annihilates him with her voice. Bob arrives with Bethany's lifeless body; God resurrects her, and conceives a child—the new last scion—within her womb. God, Metatron, Rufus, and Serendipity return to Heaven, leaving Bethany and the prophets to reflect on the past, and the future.   
Double Jeopardy (1999 film)
 Libby Parsons ([[Ashley Judd]]) and her husband Nick ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) are wealthy residents of [[Whidbey Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  With her best friend, Angela Green ([[Annabeth Gish]]) offering to look after her 4-year-old son, Matty (Benjamin Weir), Libby and Nick go off sailing for the weekend on their yacht. After a session of [[Sexual intercourse|love making]], Libby falls asleep. She wakes to find her husband missing and blood all over her hands, clothes, legs, and the boat's floors. A Coast Guard vessel appears and Libby is spotted holding a bloody knife she found lying on the deck.  Even with Nick's body unaccounted for, Libby is arrested, humiliated in the media, tried, and convicted of her husband's murder. Libby asks Angela to look after Matty for the duration of her prison sentence. At first, Angela brings Matty to see Libby in prison, but after a while, these visits cease. On a phone call with Matty from prison, Libby hears a door open in the background, then Matty exclaims, "Daddy!" right before the line goes dead.  Libby realizes that Nick possibly faked his death and framed her, leaving Matty as the sole beneficiary of his [[life insurance]] policy, as people convicted for murder are not allowed to collect the life insurance on their victims. After unsuccessfully attempting to get investigative help, she is told by a fellow inmate named Margaret ([[Roma Maffia]]) that if she were to get [[parole]]d for good behavior, she could kill Nick with impunity due to the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]] in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].  Libby is paroled after six years and begins searching for Nick and Matty, while living in a [[halfway house]] under the supervision of [[parole officer]] Travis Lehman ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]). Lehman is a former law professor whose wife and daughter left him after the family was in a car accident with him at the wheel. Libby violates her curfew and is caught breaking into Matty's school on Whidbey Island to try to get Angela's records. However, as Lehman is delivering Libby back to prison via a [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferry]], Libby drives Lehman's car overboard, which forces him to uncuff her. Libby then knocks out Lehman and swims to shore while he is rescued by ferry personnel.  Libby discovers that Angela has recently died in [[Colorado]] in a gas explosion, which looks like an accident staged by Nick. Then Libby recognizes a [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] painting in a newspaper photo. Tracing it through an art dealer's database (which nearly again allows her capture by Lehman) leads her to [[New Orleans]], where she finds Nick running a luxury hotel under an assumed name, Jonathan Devereaux.  Libby confronts Nick after making a winning bid of $10,000 on him at a bachelor's auction during a party hosted at his hotel. She demands he return Matty in exchange for her silence about his real identity, while he claimed that he faked his death to collect insurance as his original business was going under. Their parley is cut short when Lehman shows up at the hotel party to warn Nick that his wife is a fugitive. In the French Quarter, Libby is later tipped off by a bartender who recognizes her from a wanted poster but lets her escape the police as no reward is offered.  Nick agrees to bring Matty to a meeting in a cemetery. There he uses a decoy boy to distract Libby, knocks her unconscious, and locks her in a casket inside a [[mausoleum]]. Using a [[.38 caliber]] handgun she had snatched from Lehman, Libby manages to shoot the hinges off the lid of the casket and escape the mausoleum by throwing a flower vase through a stained glass window.  While tracking Libby in New Orleans, Lehman himself becomes suspicious of Nick's death and begins to believe Libby's story, based on the clues uncovered in his search. He finds a picture of a different Nicholas Parsons when searching the Washington State [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] records to prove his suspicions, and later confirms them when he uncovers six DMV records under that name, including Nick's DMV application and photograph. After intercepting and capturing Libby later in the city as she makes her way to Nick's hotel, the two end up teaming up.  Lehman visits Nick in his office under the pretense of asking for money to keep his identity secret. He records a remark by Nick that he had murdered his wife, the only witness to his true past, and then Libby enters, holding Nick at gunpoint. Nick is given a choice of surrendering to the authorities or getting shot by his vengeful wife, who he believes would go free for this deed because of double jeopardy. Nick pulls out a hidden gun, shoots Lehman, and fires at Libby. Lehman manages to bring Nick down before he can shoot Libby. Nick gets the upper hand in the scuffle, but before he can kill the wounded parole officer, Libby shoots Nick dead.  Lehman promises to help Libby get fully pardoned, and together they travel to Matty's boarding school in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Matty ([[Spencer Treat Clark]]), now eleven years old, recognizes his mother, and they embrace with Lehman watching them.

A Dog of Flanders (1999 film)
 Impoverished and alone, [[fine artist]] Mary Daas (Deborah Pollitt) braves a blizzard with her toddler son, Nello, to reach the remote forest home of her father Jehaan Daas ([[Jack Warden]]). The journey has brought Mary close to death. Mary asks Jehaan to promise to care for Nello after she is gone. Jehaan keeps the promise, helping his grandson to become an intelligent and sensitive young man.  As the two live a very poor existence, Nello ([[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]]) and Jehaan make ends meet delivering milk to the nearby city of [[Antwerp]], where they are welcomed and respected by the community. One afternoon on their way home, they encounter a [[Bouvier des Flandres]] dog beaten and left for dead in the woods. Taking him home, Jehaan and Nello nurse the dog back to health, with Nello naming him Patrasche; the boy and his new friend are inseparable from thereon out. With Jehaan's guidance, Nello hones his skill as an artist with Patrasche as his subject; his artwork comes to closely resemble that of his mother.  Nello soon introduces Patrasche to his lifelong companion and artistic muse Aloise ([[Madylin Sweeten]]), daughter of the local mill owner Nicholas Cogez ([[Steven Hartley]]). Meanwhile, Nello and Jehaan struggle to appease their wicked, heartless landlord Stephens ([[Andrew Bicknell]]). Despite this plight, Nello sets his hopes on winning a famous art contest to gain respect from the art world. Aloise wholly supports her friend in this endeavor, as does the gregarious local blacksmith William ([[Bruce McGill]]). Nello gains a mentor when he meets artist Michel La Grande ([[Jon Voight]]) by the statue of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] outside the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]]. After defending the boy against Patrasche's vagrant first owner, Michel brings him into his study and begins his tutelage, though he leaves for business in Rome soon afterward.  As the years pass, Nello ([[Jeremy James Kissner]]) stays close with Aloise ([[Farren Monet Daniels]]) and they become engaged during their visit to a gypsy circus. Nicholas, disapproving of the match, forbids Nello from ever seeing Aloise again, despite protestation from his wife Anna ([[Cheryl Ladd]]). Nello finds some comfort in Michel, who has returned from Rome to help his pupil continue his education.  Not long thereafter, Stephens accidentally burns down Nicholas' mill; visiting with the Cogez's servant Millie, he had been smoking a pipe in the nearby shed and fell asleep. The next morning as the town inspects the damage, it is discovered that Nello had secretly visited Aloise the night before, to give her a birthday gift. Stephens uses this as evidence of Nello's guilt of committing an act of revenge. Furious, Nicholas believes the lie and smashes Aloise's gift and blames Nello for starting the fire while Jehaan comes to Nello's defense. Thereafter, Stephens takes advantage of the town's new distrust of the boy by taking over his milk delivery route. After Jehaan suddenly dies, Nello and Patrasche are evicted from their home by Stephens. Though William (who still trusts the boy) offers the two a place to stay, Nello insists that he has work to do.  On Christmas Day, Nello eagerly awaits the results of the art contest to be announced by Michel, but he loses to Robert Kessler (Julien Bosman), son of the Mayor of Antwerp (Fred Van Kuyk). Nello and Patrasche then find themselves back in the cold in the midst of a blizzard, just like Mary once was. As they wander along a dirt path, Patrasche sniffs out Nicholas' wallet buried in the snow; it contains a vast sum of money. Nello returns the wallet to the Cogez Mill and departs before Anna can offer him a meal, leaving Patrasche behind so that he might have a comfortable future. Nicholas then returns to the mill, distraught that he has lost his family's life savings. He becomes enraged upon seeing Patrasche until Anna explains what happened. At dinner, the family is quietly pensive until Millie reveals the truth of what happened to the mill. Horrified, Nicholas bands together his family and neighbors to find Nello. Patrasche runs ahead of the group and disappears into the storm.  Meanwhile, Nello returns to Antwerp and seeks shelter in the Cathedral just as Patrasche approaches. The two lie down to rest in front of the Rubens painting [[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]. Nello dreams of him and Patrasche dying and being brought to the next life by Rubens himself where they rejoin Jehaan and finally meet Mary. Witnessing his own funeral, Nello is torn between staying with his family and returning to life. Mary insists that it is not yet time for him to pass on and that she will always love and be with him.  Awakening, Nello is greeted by the search party; Aloise had realized that Nello would have gone to the Cathedral to see the Rubens. Nicholas falls to his knees and begs the boy's forgiveness for the accusations made against him. Michel then enters, having seen the villagers running for the Cathedral, and presents Nello with the medal he won in a previous edition of the art contest. Nello then remarks how (as his dream reveals) Michel knew his mother, to whom Michel referred as his "gifted student". Michel is shocked, at which Anna explains that Mary never told anyone that Michel was Nello's father, for fear of a scandal. Michel and Nello embrace as Michel thanks God for finally bringing father and son together. Outside the Cathedral, a star shines brightly.<ref></ref>

Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)
 In 1995, Mount Rose is preparing for its annual beauty pageant. Amber Atkins ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) is an optimistic teenager who signs up to compete in the pageant so she can follow in the footsteps of her idols, television news reporter [[Diane Sawyer]], and Amber's mother, a former contestant. Amber works after school applying makeup to corpses at the mortuary, and lives with her mother, Annette Atkins ([[Ellen Barkin]]), in a small trailer near their friend Loretta ([[Allison Janney]]).  This is in stark contrast to fellow contestant Rebecca ("Becky") Leeman ([[Denise Richards]]), the daughter of the richest man in town and his wife, Gladys Leeman ([[Kirstie Alley]]), who is the head of the pageant organizing committee and a former winner. Various business connections between the Leeman Furniture Store and the judges of the pageant cause many to speculate that the contest will be rigged or fixed.  Many odd events occur around town during the run-up to the pageant, including the death of a contestant, the athletic and competitive Tammy Curry, who is killed when her tractor explodes, and the death (ruled a hunting accident) of a boy who Becky liked, but who showed himself partial to Amber. Amber decides to pull out of the pageant after her mother is injured in an explosion at their [[mobile home]], but reconsiders and decides to compete to follow her dreams and make her mother proud. At the dress rehearsal, fellow contestant Jenelle Betz swaps numbers with Amber. When Jenelle walks on stage at the beginning of rehearsal, a stage light falls and hits her in the head, knocking her unconscious and rendering her deaf. Luckily, Jenelle is a master of sign language so she claims that despite dropping out of the pageant, she has never been happier.  At the pageant, Amber's dance costume mysteriously goes missing. Amber blames Becky and the two get into a catfight. Amber's best friend and fellow contestant Lisa Swenson ([[Brittany Murphy]]) pulls them apart. After comforting a crying Amber, Lisa drops out of the pageant in order to give her own costume to Amber. Amber then performs her tap-dance number to a standing ovation. Rebecca sings a cringe-worthy rendition of "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You]]" as she dances with a life-size Jesus doll on a crucifix, both amusing and horrifying the audience.  During judging, the previous year's winner Mary Johanson (now hospitalized with anorexia) reprises her talent act (lip-synching "[[Don't Cry Out Loud (song)|Don't Cry Out Loud]]") while being pushed around the stage in her hospital wheelchair in a re-enactment of her dance movements.  When the new winner is announced, Amber is named first runner-up to Rebecca.  During the victory parade the next day, Rebecca is killed in a freak accident when the elaborate float (made in [[Mexico]], to save her father money) on which she is riding explodes. The grief-stricken Gladys flies into a blind rage and admits to having killed Tammy and to being responsible for all the attempts against Amber in the run-up to the pageant, and is immediately arrested. Rebecca's tragic death and Gladys's antics leave Amber as the new pageant winner.   At the State Competition, Amber wins the Minnesota American Teen Princess title by default after all the other contestants fall ill with [[seafood]]-related [[food poisoning]], and Amber gets an all-expenses-paid trip to the national Sarah Rose American Teen Princess Pageant. Upon arrival there, Amber and the other state winners are devastated to find that the cosmetics company has been shut down by the IRS for tax evasion.  This sends all the contestants except Amber on a rampage, vandalizing and destroying the property.  A few years later, Gladys escapes from prison and is sniping from the top of the Mount Rose supermarket, declaring her intent to take revenge on Amber. During the six-hour police standoff, a television reporter doing a live report at the scene is hit by a stray bullet. Amber quickly picks up the reporter's microphone and takes over reporting the story, impressing the news station with her poise and confidence. The film closes with a scene showing Amber as co-anchor of the evening news for [[Minneapolis–St. Paul]] television station WAZB-TV, thus living her dream of possibly becoming the next Diane Sawyer.  
Doug's 1st Movie
 Doug Funnie ([[Tom McHugh (actor)|Tom McHugh]]) and Skeeter Valentine ([[Fred Newman (sound effects)|Fred Newman]]) discover a monster ([[Frank Welker]]) that lives in Lucky Duck Lake. Believing the monster is evil, they are scared of him at first, but later on, they find him to be nice. Despite this, however, the monster is proof that their friend Beebe Bluff's wealthy father, Bill Bluff ([[Doug Preis]]), owner of Bluffco Industries, is polluting the lake, which was what created this monster. The monster almost eats the book ''[[Moby Dick]]'', but Skeeter stops him and says, "Stop! You almost ate [[Herman Melville]]! You don't eat books, that is a NO!" and the monster returns it to them as an apology, so they name him Herman Melville after the author of the book, and the monster takes a liking to the name. Mayor Tippy Dink ([[Doris Belack]]) advises Doug to keep this a secret or Mr. Bluff will kill Herman. Unfortunately, all of this commotion with the monster makes Doug forget that he was supposed to meet Patti ([[Constance Shulman]]) at Mr. Swirly's (Bruce Bayley Johnson), the owner of the local ice cream factory. When he remembers this at the last minute, he runs to Swirly's as fast as he can using the quickest shortcuts that he knows. Once he gets there, Patti is nowhere to be seen. He asks Mr. Swirly if he's seen her, and he says that she was here for a while and looked very upset, and then left with a guy who kept talking about his big plans for a dance. When Doug heard this, he knew that this guy was no one else but Guy Graham (Guy Hadley), a snobby upper class man who wants Patti. Meanwhile, Roger ([[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]]) and the AV nerds are building a robot ([[Eddie Korbich]]) to kidnap Herman, but when they build the robot it acts like a babysitter to Roger, much to the latter's dismay and annoyance.  Doug then rushes to the Funky Town night club, where Guy and Patti are working on the dance. He apologizes to Patti there and she accepts his apology, but Guy cuts in and says that Doug is "just a stupid little kid." Doug, very angry now and going against Mayor Dink's warning, says that he has proof that Mr. Bluff is evil and is polluting the lake. Guy then calls Doug a liar. Doug then invites them both to the report that is being held in front of his next-door neighbor and husband to Mayor Dink, Bud Dink's (also played by Newman) house about Herman and the pollution and hopes to get back at Guy. Doug then leaves, but the picture of the monster falls out of his pocket without him knowing. Guy picks up the picture and realizes that Doug was telling the truth; however, he calls Mr. Bluff, whom he has connections to. At the reporting, Doug sees that a news reporter's camera is inflatable. He then realizes that the news company is a fake, that it is supporting Mr. Bluff, and trying to capture the monster. Doug then has to tell everyone that there has been a mistake, Patti gets mad at him, thinks that he is a liar, and walks away with Guy.  That night, Mr. Bluff finds the boys with Herman and kidnaps the monster. The next morning, Doug knows that this is his last chance to save Herman. He goes to the school newspaper room, hoping to find Guy who can lead him to Mr. Bluff. Guy isn't in the room, but Doug sees a newspaper article that says that Mr. Bluff and his men blew a monster to smithereens at a school dance. Doug is at first sad and believes that Herman has died, but he then realizes that the school dance isn't until tonight and that this is what is being planned, so Doug and Skeeter call the Sleech twins Al and Moo (also voiced by Korbich) to help.   At the school dance, Doug has to save Herman rather than being with Patti. When he does the former, Mr. Bluff catches Doug and Skeeter in front of Crystal Lake (a cleaner lake) after Herman escapes into it and plans to enslave them, but is stopped by Beebe and Mayor Dink. Beebe forces her father off of the scene to defend her friends, while Mrs. Dink hints at Mr. Bluff facing the wrath of the federal government if he does not clean up Lucky Duck Lake, which could bankrupt him and Bluffco due to lawsuits. Doug then finds Patti in front of the woods and tries to tell her he is in love with her, but is interrupted by Herman. With the return of Herman and a copy of the newspaper, Patti sees that Doug had been telling her the truth all along and dumps Guy for lying to her about all of this. Also, Skeeter gives Herman the ''Moby Dick'' book for something to eat in the lake and Herman also gives Doug a flower to give to Porkchop (also played by Newman) to which Porkchop comes running out of the woods into Herman's arms (earlier in the film, Porkchop was opposed to Herman, but softened up when the Monster gave the dog a gift). The kids say goodbye to Herman; after Herman jumps back into the lake, Doug tells Patti he likes her and Roger almost becomes friends with Doug, but is interrupted by Robocrusher. Doug starts dancing with Patti and Skeeter dances with Beebe as the music continues in the background. Doug closes his journal that even though he was worried about being a big loser, but he learned to do the right thing which is important. He also states that things are a little bit better in Bluffington. Mr. Bluff has volunteered to clean up Lucky Duck Lake, and he and Patti danced on the dock under the moon for quite some time. He wouldn't mind if it had gone on forever. Some huge bubbles from the water at the pond burst open on the surface once more.

After enjoying the concert, Kayla then gets the second part of her prize which includes having dinner with Olivia King. At dinner, Kayla lets Olivia know that she also would like to be a singer and invites Olivia to a small performance she would be doing. When Kayla gets home from dinner, her father asks her how it went and he is shocked to hear that the star Kayla got to meet was Olivia King, though he knows the truth he does not press the issue further as he sees his daughter is still in the dark.

As the story progresses, the two ladies continue living in Olivia's fancy [[penthouse apartment]] with Olivia trying not to step on Kayla's toes as she pursues success. Kayla then finds a steamy romance with a handsome older music executive, Ric Ortega ([[Allen Payne]]) whom her mother does not trust and warns her against, but Kayla ignores her mother's warning. Despite her growing success and hit single, Kayla continues to harbor bitter feelings towards Olivia, feelings which boil over during their record label's Grammy Party. After Kayla's performance, Olivia is asked to perform by the head of the label, causing Kayla to resent her mother for "stealing her spotlight". However, after discovering that Ric revealed her true parentage to the press and betrayed her just as her mother had warned, Kayla dissolves her relationship with him. Kayla, feeling down and regretful, heads up to her mother's cabin where Olivia is finding refuge. As they spend time at the cabin and truly communicate the two women begin to understand each other.

 George Khan is a [[British Pakistani|Pakistani]] Muslim who has lived in Britain since 1937. He has a wife in Pakistan. He and his second wife Ella, a [[White British|British]] Roman Catholic woman of [[Irish Briton|Irish]] descent, have been married for twenty-five years and have seven children together; Nazir, Abdul, Tariq, Maneer, Saleem, Meenah and Sajid. George and Ella run a popular [[fish and chips|fish and chip]] shop in the neighborhood.   While George is obsessed with the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war between East and West Pakistan]] and arranging marriages for his children, the children themselves, who were born and brought up in Britain, increasingly see themselves as British and reject Pakistani customs of dress, food, religion and living. After George disowns Nazir for running out on his arranged marriage, he immediately begins making plans to have another one planned to maintain his image.   While on a trip to Bradford, George is introduced to Mr Shah, a fellow Pakistani Muslim who wishes to marry off his two unattractive daughters. George arranges in secret for Abdul and Tariq to marry them, despite Ella's misgivings, a conversation that Sajid overhears. During a sibling quarrel, Sajid reveals the arranged marriage; Tariq, the most rebellious of the sons and who is in a relationship with a local girl, flies into a rage and defiles the wedding garments George had bought. The most obedient son, Maneer, is caught by George trying to tidy the mess up and beaten when he refuses to tell George who was responsible; Ella intervenes and is also beaten. Tariq travels to Eccles and tracks down Nazir, who is in a homosexual relationship and returns to confront George for his actions, but becomes frightened upon seeing Ella and Maneer's bruises and flees. Dejected, Tariq reluctantly agrees to go along with the marriage.  Mr and Mrs Shah arrive with their daughters to meet George's family.

Mrs Shah is angered by this insults George's entire family and is subsequently ejected from the house by Ella along with Mr Shah and the daughters. Enraged, George attacks Ella but is stopped by Abdul and the children long enough for him to see how his actions have turned his entire family against him, and leaves the household in shame to seek solace in his shop.   In the aftermath, George and Ella make amends over tea while the kids play in the street.

Dudley Do-Right (film)
 The story begins with three children and a [[horse]]. These are young versions of [[Dudley Do-Right]], Nell Fenwick, [[Snidely Whiplash]], and Horse. The three talk of their aspirations; Dudley believes he is destined to be a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officer (Mountie) while Nell wishes to see the world. Snidely, however, wishes to be the "bad guy" and travel around the world.  Several years later, all three have fulfilled their supposed destinies. Dudley is now a Mountie (but always sticks to the rules and is frequently oblivious to even the most obvious of things), and Snidely has become an infamous bank robber. After Snidely and his gang rob a bank of its money and gold, Snidely tricks his entire gang into believing he has fled with all the gold to the Sudan and going on a wild goose chase after him. Snidely subsequently salts the stolen gold and spreads it in the lakes. Dudley catches him the act, but Snidely fools him into thinking he is vampire hunting, and uses a similar tactic to scare Horse off. Not long after, Nell returns from her world tour and reunites with Dudley. The two attend a festival at the nearby Kumquat tribe.  Meanwhile, [[Prospecting|Prospector]] Kim J. Darling ([[Eric Idle]]), the poorest man in Semi-Happy Valley, stumbles across the gold in the river and is made into a media sensation by Snidely. The subsequent gold rush boosts Snidely's popularity and, after foreclosing many local mortgages, he quickly takes control of the town, renaming it "Whiplash City". Eventually, Snidely's men return from the Sudan to kill him for his deceit, but Snidely convinces them otherwise by offering them lives of luxury in his new town. Dudley becomes convinced that Snidely is up to something and confronts him, but Snidely laughs him off and snatches Nell from him. Snidely sends his second in command, Homer (Jack Kehler), to assassinate Dudley with a bomb, but Dudley is absent when the bomb goes off. Nell's father Inspector Fenwick ([[Robert Prosky]]), who is in good favor with Snidely, discovers Dudley's feud with Snidely and discharges Dudley from the Mounties. Dudley falls into a depression and wanders across the town until he runs into a drunken Darling, who offers him shelter at his cave in the woods. Darling tells Dudley of Snidely's plans and newfound popularity and takes him to see a Gala Ball in Snidely's honor. Despite Darling's warning not to challenge Snidely due to his loss of favor, Dudley comically attempts to take Nell back from Snidely, but loses pathetically.  Feeling sympathy for Dudley, Darling decides to put him through a very harsh training regimen to make him a more formidable opponent and take back Semi-Valley from Snidely. Dudley's first act is to intimidate one of Snidely's men into telling him the next gold shipment. Dudley sabotages the shipment and leaves his mark on Snidely's workshop as well as his favorite golf course. Snidely, unaware that Dudley lost his job, is offended by this and more so with his men's incompetence to stop him, believing Dudley is enjoying the perks of being the villain. Eventually, Darling leaves to find his family and parts ways with Dudley thanking him for his friendship. Dudley then uses his new training to win Nell back from Snidely, who swears revenge. At a nighttime town meeting, Snidely attempts to rally the people against Dudley, but it falls on deaf ears. The populace have grown weary of Snidely and shows more respect for Dudley in his efforts to retake their town. Snidely ultimately discovers that Dudley and Nell are at another festival with the Kumquat tribe and leads a full-scale attack on them. The Kumquats flee for their lives until Horse reappears and helps Dudley sabotage Snidely's tanks by making Snidely and Homer accidentally shoot each other. A cavalry of Mounties appears and arrests Snidely and his men. Darling also arrives with his wife, the Prime Minister of Canada (Jessica Schreier) and is reunited with Dudley, revealing that they called out the cavalry. Inspector Fenwick reinstates Dudley in the Mounties.  The final scene shows Dudley and Nell living together in Dudley's rebuilt house. They share a kiss as the film closes.

EDtv
 ''EDtv'' starts off with the television channel True TV commencing interviews for a TV show that shows a normal person's life [[24/7]]. This idea was thought up by a TV producer named Cynthia ([[Ellen DeGeneres]]). They interview Ed Pekurny ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) and his brother, Ray ([[Woody Harrelson]]). When the producers see the interview Cynthia decides to use Ed and interviews only Ed. The show hits the airwaves under the title "Ed TV." It is a total failure at first, as only boring things happen and the producers want to pull the plug, except for Cynthia.  Ed TV gets interesting suddenly on Day 3 when Ed visits Ray. Ed (along with the cameramen) discovers that Ray is cheating on his girlfriend Shari ([[Jenna Elfman]]). Ed then visits Shari to apologize to her for Ray's actions. Shari is very drunk and starts insulting Ray, by talking to the camera. She makes everyone laugh and gasp by saying "Ray was a bad lay." Ed tries to comfort Shari, and he reveals he has feelings for her. She then reveals she has feelings for Ed as well. They slowly move their faces closer and finally kiss each other. Ed then locks out the camera crew and proceeds to passionately kiss Shari for a while. Ed TV thus becomes extremely popular. At Cynthia's insistence Ed starts a relationship with Shari which is short lived, as Ed grows more interested in staying on TV and Shari is abused by viewers who find her unappealing.  Ed then goes on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and meets beautiful model/actress Jill ([[Elizabeth Hurley]]) who takes a liking to Ed. Ed then visits Shari and she tells Ed that she does not want to be with him until "Ed TV" stops airing. She then leaves town. Ed goes to the park with Ray and some friends to play football when Jill comes to talk to him, because Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. She invites Ed to dinner at her house. When he arrives at Jill's house, there is a massive crowd. They have a small talk, and then they kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but then Ed falls off the table and squishes Jill's cat. Ed never sees Jill again.  Ed's father ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who abandoned his family when Ed was 13, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed's mother was having an affair with Ed's current stepfather, Al ([[Martin Landau]]). Ed is furious with his mother and argues with her. Next, Ed gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital. The doctor says that his father is dead and that he died making love to his wife. Ed thinks this means Al, but it actually is his real father and that Ed's mother was cheating on Al.  After the funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by the fact that the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract. Ed is depressed until he catches a glimpse of Shari (in disguise wearing a wig and sunglasses). He chases her for a long time until she stops in the women's bathroom in a movie theater. She says she is staying with her brother as it is his birthday and she just wanted to see Ed. Ed vows to find a way to end the show to be with Shari. When Ed exits, one cameraman stays with Shari saying that it is the producers' new idea. The main cameraman tells him that all his family are being filmed, but they show the most interesting person, thus eliminating his family's right to privacy forever.  Ed gets an idea on how to stop the main producer from showing the show: he says that he will give $10,000 to the person who can give him the best amount of  "dirt" on the producers and that he will announce it live, with the desired result being they stop airing the show before he can make the announcement. As Cynthia feels sorry for Ed, she tells him a secret of the main producer. Ed announces the secret (that the man has to pump a liquid into his penis to get an erection) but before he can announce who it is they stop airing the show.  After the camera crew finally leaves Ed's apartment, he and Shari renew their relationship and celebrate the fact that TV news panelists predict Ed will be forgotten in a short period of time.  
Election (1999 film)
 Jim McAllister is a beloved high school teacher living in Omaha, Nebraska, whose enthusiastic involvement in school activities masks his frustration with other aspects of his life. Tracy Flick is an overachieving senior whom Jim sees as having a secret vindictive and sexual side. Earlier in the year, Tracy had an [[Extramarital affair|affair]] with another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny. When the affair was discovered, Dave was fired and divorced by his wife Linda; Tracy walked away with her reputation unscathed.  Tracy announces to Jim, who is in charge of organizing the school's student government, that she is running for [[Student Government President|student body president]], telling him they "will be spending a lot of time together." Jim sees this as unbridled ambition and sexual manipulation, and finds it repugnant. With Tracy appearing to have no opposition, Jim decides to teach Tracy a lesson in humility by encouraging Paul Metzler, to enter the race. Paul is a polite and popular football player, sidelined due to a broken leg, leaving him depressed. Jim convinces Paul to declare his candidacy, giving him new purpose. This serves to bring out Tracy's vindictiveness, as she resents Paul’s effortless popularity.  Paul's younger sister Tammy is dumped by her lover, Lisa, who says that she is straight and was just "experimenting". Lisa becomes Paul's girlfriend and [[campaign manager]]. In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for president as well, with a nihilistic platform that student government is a sham.  During a school assembly to hear the candidates' final campaign speeches, Tracy draws polite applause while Paul initially receives a warm reception despite giving a lackluster and halting speech, while Tammy delivers a defiant address in which she denounces the election and expresses her intention to dissolve the student government if elected. This rallies the student body to a [[standing ovation]]. As a result of her subversive speech, Tammy is suspended and her name removed from the ballot.  While working on a yearbook project, Tracy notices that one of her posters has come untaped from the wall. Attempting to fix it, she accidentally rips the poster apart. In a fit of frustrated rage, she destroys Paul's [[Campaign advertising|campaign posters]]. The following day when Jim confronts Tracy with his suspicion that she was responsible, Tracy claims innocence and threatens [[legal action]] against the school. Tammy falsely confesses to Tracy's crime even though she witnessed Tracy disposing of the posters. Tammy is expelled and her parents enroll her in a private [[parochial school]] for girls, much to her delight.  The day before the election, Jim visits Linda's house to help her with a home repair project, whereupon she initiates a physical relationship by kissing him. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for an after-school rendezvous, but never shows up at the motel. When Jim drives over to Linda's house to see what happened, he is stung by a bee on his right eyelid, causing a severe allergic reaction. He returns home to find Linda and his wife talking together. Knowing he has been caught, he spends the night in his car.  The next morning — Election Day — Jim's eyelid is disfigured from the bee sting, but he must oversee the counting of the election [[ballots]]. After the ballots are tabulated, it turns out Tracy has won by a single vote. Tracy's one vote margin of victory came about because Paul, feeling it would be dishonorable to vote for himself, voted for Tracy. During the ballot-counting verification, Jim observes Tracy dancing around gleefully in the hall — one of the student vote counters tipped her off that she won — and he secretly disposes of two of Tracy’s ballots, declaring Paul the winner. When a janitor discovers the two discarded ballots in the trash and presents them to the principal, Jim is forced to resign. Jim's wife kicks him out of the house when he tries to apologize for what happened with Linda.  Divorced and humiliated, Jim leaves Nebraska, choosing to fulfill his longtime dream of moving to [[New York City]], where he becomes a tour guide at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and begins dating a new woman. Tracy gets accepted into [[Georgetown University]], while Paul gets into the [[University of Nebraska]]. Tammy finds a new girlfriend at her all-girls school. Jim encounters Tracy Flick one last time on a trip to Washington, D.C., during which he happens to see her get into a [[limousine]] with a male [[politician]]. Disgusted by the thought that Tracy's climb up the ladder of success is the result of her calculating and manipulative nature, Jim impulsively hurls a cup of soda at the limo before making a quick getaway. Jim later speaks to a group of elementary school students at the museum, refusing to respond to the raised hand of an overeager girl who reminds him of Tracy Flick.  
The Emperor and the Assassin
 The film covers much of [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]]'s career, recalling his early experiences as a hostage and foreshadowing his dominance over China. It depicts him essentially as an idealist seeking to impose a peace or unity on the world despite various betrayals and losses. Its story consists of three main incidents: the attempt by [[Jing Ke]] to assassinate Ying Zheng in 227 BCE; the (fictitious) rumour of a [[Lü Buwei | Chief Minister]]'s having sired the latter before transferring his concubine to become the [[Queen Dowager Zhao | Queen Dowager]]; and the story of an [[Lao Ai | official]] having sired children by the Queen Dowager herself. The first incident is the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film, with earlier scenes foreshadowing it; the other two incidents occur between the fictional genesis and historical manifestation of the first.   In the film, Ying Zheng sends his concubine Lady Zhao to the [[Yan (state)|Yan state]] as a spy to enlist a Yan assassin to attempt to assassinate him, intending to use that as a ''[[casus belli]]'' to start a war against Yan. Lady Zhao persuades Jing Ke to perform the assassination. After learning of Ying Zheng's massacre of the children in her home state of [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], Lady Zhao desires the assassination in earnest. The attempt fails, but Ying Zheng expresses his fury when his associates make no attempt to stop the assassin and he is forced to kill Jing Ke himself. He is further saddened when Lady Zhao returns to Qin only to retrieve Jing Ke for burial.

East/West
 In 1946, Russians living abroad are invited back to the motherland and offered citizenship in the USSR. Among this group is Doctor Alexei Golovin (Menshikov), his wife, the natively French Marie (Bonnaire) and their young son. Atmosphere on the ship taking them to Russia is jovial, with drinking and singing, yet once they come ashore the Russian authorities separate them into two groups 'fit' and 'unfit'. A man is shot trying to run back to his father from who he is separated, and the Golovins begin to understand the situation they have landed in.  Marie is branded a spy, and her French passport is torn up. Alexei accepts a job in Kiev overseeing the health conditions in a factory and the family moves into a communal house. Marie briefly befriends the elderly housekeeper--who speaks some French--but this lady is quickly 'denounced' by the state. Her grandson Sasha (Bodrov), is left without a place when boarders come in and claim his missing grandmother's room, and Marie, guilty, invites him to live in the Golovin room.   Marie feels stifled and repressed and wishes to go back to France dearly. She attempts to go to the Soviet authorities and demand to be sent back, but she is stopped by Alexei. Public, noncompliance, he knows, could get them all killed. She also approaches a French actress, Gabrielle (Deneuve), and attempts to gain her help in escaping the USSR. Marie and Alexei grow distant as he acclimates to his role as the public health advisor and toes the party line, while she yearns for the West. Her budding friendship with Sasha, who is a champion swimmer recently thrown out of the local team, becomes a vehicle of possible escape. As she helps him train in order to regain his position on the team, they see an opportunity to go West for the European championships, and help them both towards liberation. Marie gains a job working to iron clothes for the military choir in Kiev.   Maria and Alexei have a falling out after he thanks the Soviet government and Marie is furious. Alexei reveals that he has slept with the neighbor, because Marie has become distant and the other woman 'looks at him differently' than the resentment he constantly gets from Marie. She throws him out and he begins to live in the neighboring room with the other woman.   Sasha wins the trials and is selected for the championship in Europe. After the selection, he spends the night with Marie. Yet soon after Marie's letters to her French family are discovered in his things and his coach warns her to stay away. He goes to a training camp by the Black Sea.   While abroad for training Sasha secures secret passage on a ship West and needs money. Marie furnishes the money and comes to that city with the military choir. The ship captain reveals he can't come close to shore, so Sasha attempts to swim 6 hours out to meet him in the water. Marie is brutally interrogated by the same KGB official she first met when she came to the USSR.   It is revealed that Sasha successfully escaped to the West and Marie is implicated and jailed for six years. Upon her release, her now-grow son and husband come to receive her. She reconciles with Alexei, and he promises her he still loves her. Two years later they are in a delegation to Sofia, Bulgaria and Alexei reveals to Marie he has arranged for her escape over the past few years by speaking to the actress Gabrielle. Marie and her son escape with Gabrielle to the French embassy. Alexei is arrested for complicity and sent to be a medic in a labor camp. He is not released until 1978.

Jericho and co-worker Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect the possessed banker. A priest, Thomas Aquinas, unsuccessfully tries to kill the banker. Jericho captures Aquinas, who tells Jericho: "The thousand years has ended, the dark angel is loosed from his prison" and says that a girl is central. Jericho shoots Aquinas, who is arrested by the [[New York Police Department]]. Marge Francis, an NYPD [[detective]] and Jericho's former colleague, tells him that Aquinas has no tongue.  Jericho and Bobby investigate on their own, learning that Aquinas was trained at the Vatican and was sent to New York before disappearing. Jericho questions Father Kovak, a priest who knew Aquinas. Kovak asks Jericho if he believes in God; when he says no, the priest tells him that Aquinas was driven mad by forces an [[atheist]] could not understand. They go to Aquinas' apartment, where they find his tongue in a jar and messages and symbols written in apparent blood on the walls. Marge arrives, forcing them to leave. Satan infiltrates Aquinas' hospital, and [[crucifixion|crucifies]] him on the ceiling. Although he survives, he is shot by a Satanic police officer. Jericho and Chicago see Latin words and "Christ in New York" scratched into Aquinas' skin, and begin searching for Christine York.

Satan enters the house and kills Mabel for failing him; Jericho and Christine escape. Marge and another officer, both Satanists, tell Jericho to surrender Christine. Jericho kills them, but Satan resurrects Marge. Father Kovak tells Jericho and Christine that Satan must impregnate her between 11 pm and midnight on New Year's Eve to usher in the [[Christian eschatology|"end of days"]]. Christine accepts Kovak's protection.  Satan infiltrates Jericho's apartment, showing him a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of his family's murder. Jericho throws Satan through his apartment window, and Chicago appears.  At the church, the cardinal and his knights try to kill Christine and Satan kills the Vatican clergy. Chicago tells Jericho and Christine that he is in league with Satan. Kovak rescues Jericho, and Satan kidnaps Christine. Jericho rescues Christine and again kills Marge. Chicago stops Jericho, who persuades him to fight off Satan's influence; Satan burns him alive. Jericho escapes with Christine into a [[Rapid transit|subway]] tunnel. He fires a grenade at Satan, who leaves the banker for a new host.  Jericho and Christine escape to another church, where he renews his faith in God and prays for strength. Satan confronts Jericho as a massive, winged creature and possesses him.

Jericho and Christine see his wife and daughter waiting for him in the [[afterlife]]. He dies in peace, and Christine waits with his body for the authorities.  ===Alternate ending===  An alternate ending was filmed in which Jericho returns to life after being impaled on the statue's sword and leaves the church with Christine, but test audiences preferred the original version.

The End of the Affair (1999 film)
 Novelist Maurice Bendrix narrates the film as he begins a book with the line "This is a diary of hate."  On a rainy London night in 1946, Bendrix has a chance meeting with Henry Miles, husband of his former mistress Sarah, who abruptly ended their affair two years before. Bendrix's obsession with Sarah is rekindled: he succumbs to his own jealousy and works his way back into her life.  As the story unfolds in 1946, we also see flashbacks of Bendrix with Sarah as they began their affair during [[World War II]]. Henry tells Bendrix that he believes Sarah is having an affair, so Bendrix hires the bumbling but amiable Mr. Parkis, who uses his young birthmarked son Lance to investigate. Sarah asks Bendrix to meet to talk about Henry and the cold tentativeness of their interaction is contrasted with the passion of their earlier encounters.  Bendrix learns from Parkis that Sarah has been making regular visits to a priest named Father Richard Smythe under the guise of false dentist visits and he grows increasingly jealous. Flashbacks show Bendrix expressing jealousy of Henry and asking Sarah to leave him.  Though Sarah and Bendrix express love to each other, the affair ends abruptly when a [[V-1 flying bomb]] explodes near Bendrix's building as he is out in the hallway. Bendrix falls down a staircase and awakes later, bloodied but not seriously hurt. He walks upstairs, where Sarah is shocked that he is alive. Bendrix accuses Sarah of being disappointed that he survived and she leaves, telling him "Love doesn't end, just because we don't see each other."  In 1946, Parkis obtains Sarah's diary and passes it on to Bendrix: it shows the affair from her perspective. After Bendrix is hurt by the bomb, Sarah runs downstairs and finds him still and not breathing. After trying to revive him, she runs back upstairs and begins to pray for Bendrix's life. Just as she says to God that she will stop seeing Bendrix if he is brought back, Bendrix comes into the room.  Now knowing why Sarah ended the affair, Bendrix follows Sarah and begs her to reconsider. Sarah tells Bendrix that she has felt dead without him and can no longer keep her "promise" to God. Henry, who has figured out that it is Bendrix who was Sarah's lover, desperately asks Sarah not to leave him. But, with more persuasion from Bendrix, Sarah agrees to go away with him for a weekend. Henry tracks the couple down to tell them that Sarah has a terminal illness.  Bendrix stays with Henry and Sarah over her final days and at her funeral, Parkis tells Bendrix that a chance encounter with Sarah cured his son of his birthmark. At Henry and Sarah's house, Bendrix completes his book and it is revealed that his diary of hate is directed toward God. While Sarah doesn't need to see God to love Him, Bendrix prays God will leave him alone, thereby finally acknowledging His existence.

However, it spells the word "third" "thrid", so the Professor activates the spell correction, resulting in the lab's screen being destroyed and several fires being started, which are put out by the Professor's robot assistant, M.A.X. ([[Stuart Pankin]]). The Professor has a new system called Real O Vision for 3-D technology, and to demonstrate has Elvira, Mistress of the Dark ([[Cassandra Peterson]]) perform a haunted house song, but the machine still has some bugs in it and traps Elvira between the second and third dimensions.  While the Professor tries to fix the problem, he has M.A.X. entertain the audience. When M.A.X. starts telling jokes, the Professor tells him to explain the difference between 2-D and 3-D, which he does, explaining that 3-D has depth to it unlike 2-D. After pictures from the stereographic archives are shown, the Professor tries his demonstration again, but this time the machines turn Elvira into cardboard. As he tries to fix this problem, he tells the audience about 3-D movies, and several clips are shown, particularly clips where objects or people are thrown at the camera.  Afterward the Professor opens up the Diorama of 3-D videos, such as [[Dino Island]], ''[[T-2 3-D]]'', and the [[Abandoned Mine]]. M.A.X. grabs a stick of dynamite, and puts it in his head when the Professor tells him to throw it away, and it explodes, briefly popping his eyes out. When he tells the Professor it was only a simulation, the Professor retaliates by making him enter the simulator, which does a simulation of traveling to the center of the earth.  M.A.X. explains how 3-D movies are made, and enters the television, but soon becomes trapped inside it by the Professor, who is tired of being annoyed by M.A.X., and mutes the TV. Then he begins the demonstration with Elvira and the haunted house, which works perfectly. After it is over, however, Elvira turns the Professor into cardboard and shuts off the TV with M.A.X. still inside it. She tells Ruth in the Booth ([[Andrea Thompson]]) that she'll let him out in an hour, but when the machine seems to malfunction she says "Or not."

Robert "Mac" MacDougal ([[Sean Connery]]) is a professional thief who specializes in international art. A priceless [[Rembrandt]] painting is stolen from an office building in New York one night, and Gin is sent undercover to investigate Mac as the chief suspect. She tries to entrap him with a proposition, claiming that she is a professional thief herself, and promises that she will help him steal a priceless [[China|Chinese]] [[mask]] from the well-guarded [[Bedford Palace]]. Before agreeing, Mac tells Gin his 'Rule Number One': "Never carry a gun: You carry a gun, you may be tempted to use it." They travel to [[Scotland]] and plan the very complicated theft at Mac's hideout, an isolated [[castle]]. Aaron Thibadeaux ([[Ving Rhames]]), apparently the only ally that Mac trusts, arrives with supplies for the heist. While Mac is busy making final preparations, Gin contacts her boss, Hector Cruz ([[Will Patton]]), from a payphone, and informs him of Mac's whereabouts. Little does she know that the whole island is bugged, allowing Mac to eavesdrop on their conversation.  Mac also makes sure to keep Gin's romantic advances at bay, unsure if she is a true partner in crime or an ambitious career woman on a mission.  After they have stolen the mask, Mac accuses Gin of planning to sell the mask to a buyer in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and then turn him in. Gin convinces him that her insurance agency job is the real cover and that she has planned an even bigger heist in Kuala Lumpur: $8 billion from the "International Clearance Bank" in the North Tower of the [[Petronas Towers]]. During their set-up, Cruz and his team (with the guidance of the stealthy Thibadeaux) track down Gin and confirm that she is still on mission to bring Mac in. Despite the presence of Cruz and other [[Royal Malaysian Police|security]] watching the building, the theft takes place in the final seconds of the new 2000 millennium countdown. Gin pulls the plug on her laptop prematurely and sets off alarms. They narrowly escape the computer vault and are forced to cross the lights hung from the bottom of the bridge linking the two towers. Following a death-defying escape when the cable breaks, Gin and Mac make their way to a ventilation shaft, where Mac explains "Plan B." Using mini-[[parachute]]s, they were going to escape down the shaft. Gin has lost her parachute earlier in the escape, so Mac gives her his. He tells her to meet him the next morning at the [[Pudu LRT station|Pudu train station]].  Gin arrives at the [[Ampang Line|station]] waiting for Mac. He shows up late with Aaron Thibadeaux, who reveals himself with fellow FBI agents. He explains that Cruz is here and that the FBI has been looking for her for some time. Two years ago when Agent Thibadeaux caught and arrested him, Mac made a deal to help the FBI arrest Gin, as she was the primary target all along. However, the aging thief has another plan: to help her escape. Mac slips Gin a gun and quietly explains that he returned only seven of the eight billion dollars they had stolen electronically in the heist. Gin then pretends to hold Mac hostage at gunpoint, threatening to shoot him if the agents follow her. She boards a [[Ampang Line|train]] and the FBI heads to the next station. Gin jumps trains mid-station and arrives back at Pudu. She tells Mac that she needs him for another job and they both board a train.

 Dr. Bill Harford and Alice are a young married couple living in New York. They attend a Christmas party hosted by a wealthy patient, Victor Ziegler, where Bill is reunited with Nick Nightingale, a medical school drop-out who now plays piano professionally. While a Hungarian man named Sandor Szavost attempts to seduce Alice, two young models attempt the same with Bill. He is interrupted by his host who had been having sex with Mandy, a young woman who has overdosed on a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]. Mandy recovers with Bill's aid.  The following evening at home, while smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], when Alice asks him if he had sex with the two girls, Bill reassures her that he had not. She inquires if he is jealous of men who are attracted to her. He thinks women are more faithful than men. She tells him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had met on vacation. Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is called by the daughter of a patient who has just died. After visiting the home, he goes to a prostitute named Domino but Alice phones as Domino begins to kiss Bill. He then has a change of heart and leaves,  paying Domino even though they had not done anything more than kissing. Meeting Nick at the jazz club, Bill learns that Nick has an engagement where he must play piano blindfolded. Bill learns that to gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask, and the password, which Nick had written down. Bill goes to a costume shop and offers the owner, Mr. Milich, a generous amount of money to rent a costume. In the shop, Milich catches his teenage daughter with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of decency.  Bill takes a taxi to the country mansion mentioned by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a sexual ritual is taking place. A woman warns him he is in terrible danger. A porter then takes him to the ritual room, where a disguised red-cloaked [[master of ceremonies]] confronts Bill with a question about a second password. Bill says he has forgotten it. The masked woman who had tried to warn Bill intervenes and insists that she will redeem him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there.  Just before dawn, Bill arrives home guilty and confused. He finds Alice laughing loudly in her sleep and awakens her. While crying, she tells him of a troubling dream in which she was having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them. Later that morning, Bill goes to Nick's hotel, where the desk clerk tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Bill goes to return the costume, but not the mask, which he has misplaced, and learns Milich has sold his daughter into prostitution.  Bill returns to the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by a man with a note warning him to cease his inquiries. After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy.  Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats.  Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd "sacrificed" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the "punishment" was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further.  When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, "Fuck."  
Existenz
  In the near-future, [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] [[virtual reality]] game consoles known as "game pods" have replaced electronic ones. The pods present "[[umbilical cord|UmbyCords]]" that attach to "bio-ports", connectors surgically inserted into players' spines . Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of "Realists" fights both companies to prevent the "deforming" of reality.  Antenna Research's Allegra Geller ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), a world renowned game designer, is demonstrating her latest [[virtual reality]] game, ''eXistenZ'' to a focus group at a seminar. A realist named Noel Dichter ([[Kris Lemche]]) shoots Allegra in the shoulder with an organic pistol he smuggled past security. As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard (and marketing trainee) Ted Pikul ([[Jude Law]]) rushes to Geller and escorts her outside.  Geller discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of ''eXistenZ'', may have been damaged. Pikul reluctantly agrees to have a bio-port installed in his spine so they can test the integrity of the game together. Allegra takes him to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas ([[Willem Dafoe]]) to get it done. Gas deliberately installs a faulty bio-port, which damages the game pod, and reveals his intention to kill Geller for the bounty on her head. Pikul kills Gas, and the two escape to a former ski lodge used by Geller's mentor, Kiri Vinokur ([[Ian Holm]]). Vinokur and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port.  Geller and Pikul enter the game, and meet with D'Arcy Nader ([[Robert A. Silverman]]), a video game shop owner, who provides them new “micro pods.” Pikul expresses surprise when he is compelled by the game’s program to speak rudely toward Nader as part of his in-game character. The pair activate the new pods and enter a deeper layer of virtual reality.  They assume new identities as workers in a grotesque game pod factory. Another worker in the factory, Yevegny Nourish ([[Don McKellar]]), claims to be their contact for the Realist underground. Nourish recommends that they order the special for lunch at Chinese restaurant near the factory, which turns out to be an assortment of cooked mutant animals. Pikul eats the unappetizing special, and almost automatedly constructs a pistol like the one used to shoot Geller out of the inedible parts. He threatens Geller in jest, then shoots the Chinese waiter (Oscar Hsu). When the pair return to the game store, Hugo Carlaw ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]) informs them that Nourish is actually a double agent for Cortical Systematics, and the waiter Pikul murdered was the actual contact.  Returning to the factory, they find a diseased pod. Geller connects it to her bio-port as part of a plan to infect the other pods and sabotage the factory. When Geller quickly becomes ill, Pikul cuts the UmbyCord, but she begins to bleed to death. Nourish appears with a flamethrower and blasts the diseased pod, which bursts into deadly spores.  Geller and Pikul awaken back at the ski lodge, where they discover Allegra’s game pod is also diseased. Allegra surmises that Pikul’s new bio-port must have been infected by Vinokur to destroy her game. She inserts a disinfecting device into Pikul's bioport. Unexpectedly, Carlaw reappears as a Realist resistance fighter and escorts Geller and Pikul outside to witness the death of ''eXistenZ''. Before Carlaw can kill Geller, he is shot in the back by Vinokur, who is a double agent for Cortical Systematics. He informs Geller that he copied her game data while he was fixing her pod. In revenge, she kills Vinokur. Pikul then reveals that he himself is a Realist sent to kill her. Geller tells Pikul she had known his intentions since he pointed the gun at her in the Chinese restaurant, and she remotely detonates the disinfecting device in his bioport, killing him.  Suddenly, Pikul and Geller are shown on stage together with the other members of the cast, wearing electronic virtual reality devices. Nourish explains that the story was all part of a virtual reality game he designed called ''tranCendenZ''. He tells his assistant Merle ([[Sarah Polley]]) that he feels uneasy, because the anti-game plot elements may have originated from the thoughts of one of the testers. Pikul and Geller approach Nourish and accuse him of distorting reality, before shooting him and Merle to death. As Pikul and Geller leave, they aim their guns at the person who played the Chinese waiter, who first pleads for his life, then asks if they are still in the game. The last shot is of Pikul and Geller standing together in wide-eyed silence.

In Alaska, Stephen gains the courage to ask Eris out, as he is a frequent patron of the diner at which she waitresses.

She then says she has nothing to offer and that he should leave her alone. The next day the police, as well as Eris' psychiatrist ([[Geneviève Bujold]]), come to the diner to arrest her. Stephen tries to save her, taking her to his trailer. There she is horrified to find out that he has been following her.

He catches up to her, and she realizes he is the "Angel" who saved her time and time again. At this revelation she crashes her car.

Fight Club
 The unnamed [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Narrator]] is a traveling automobile recall specialist who suffers from insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting a [[support group]] for [[testicular cancer]] victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.  On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share the same kind of briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.  Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he eventually ignores her, leaving his phone receiver without disconnecting. Tyler notices the phone soon after, talks to her and goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved. He warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country and, under Tyler's leadership (and without the Narrator's knowledge), they become an anti-[[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[anti-corporate]] organization, Project Mayhem, with many of the former local Fight Club members moving into the dilapidated house and improving it.  The Narrator complains to Tyler about Tyler excluding him from the newer manifestation of the Fight Club organization Project Mayhem. Soon after, Tyler leaves the house without notice. When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to shut down the project. Seeking Tyler, he follows evidence of Tyler's national travels. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. Tyler suddenly appears in his hotel room, and reveals that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body. When the Narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has been controlling his body and traveling to different locations.  The Narrator blacks out after the conversation, and when he awakes, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card companies' records. The Narrator tries to warn the police, but he finds that these officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in a building, but Tyler subdues him and moves him to the uppermost floor. Held at gunpoint by Tyler, the Narrator realizes that, in sharing the same body with Tyler, he himself is actually in control holding "Tyler's" gun. The Narrator fires it into his own mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head, and the Narrator stops mentally projecting him. Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing many buildings around them.

They come to the town filled with eager men but not lots of opportunities other than farming. Patricia settles with Damian, a hardworking farmer who lives with his mother, Gregoria. Looking to find stability for her young children and a hard worker herself, Patricia tries in vain to find common ground with her stern mother-in-law, who seems to reject her because of her skin color and the fact that her son is no longer under her control. Patricia, with more time and experience in Spain, befriends the newcomer Milady. Milady settles with Carmelo an older Spanish man who wooed her in [[Havana]].

For Love of the Game (film)
 The [[Detroit Tigers]] travel to New York to play a season-ending series against the [[New York Yankees]]. At 63–97, the team has long since been eliminated from playoff contention and are playing for nothing but pride against the Yankees, who have a chance to clinch the [[American League East]] with a win. For 40-year-old pitcher Billy Chapel, however, this may end up being the most significant 24 hours of his life.  In his [[Manhattan]] hotel suite, Billy awaits his girlfriend Jane Aubrey, but she doesn't show. Jane is also a single mother with a teenage daughter Heather that Billy got to know. The next morning, Billy is told by Tigers' owner Gary Wheeler that the team has been sold and that the new owners' first move will be to end Billy's 19-year tenure with the Tigers by trading him to the [[San Francisco Giants]]. Billy also learns from Jane that she is leaving that same day to accept a job offer in [[London]].  Billy is a famous, accomplished pitcher, but has a losing record this season, is near the end of his career and is also recovering from a hand injury. Wheeler hints that Billy should consider retiring rather than join another team. As he goes to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] to make his last start of the year, Billy begins reflecting about Jane, detailing how they met five years prior. These flashbacks are interspersed within the game, along with glimpses of Jane watching the game on a television at the airport.  As the game progresses, with friend and catcher Gus Sinski aware that something is on Billy's mind other than baseball, Billy dominates the Yankees' batters, often talking to himself on how to pitch each one. While in the dugout resting between innings, Billy also reflects how his relationship with Jane was strained by his shutting her out of his life after he suffered a career-threatening injury in the off-season. The pain of pitching is getting worse as the game goes on.  Billy is so caught up in his thoughts that he does not realize he is pitching a [[perfect game]] until he looks at the scoreboard in the bottom of the eighth inning. Gus confirms that no one has reached base, and says that the whole team is rallying behind Billy to do whatever it takes to keep the perfect game bid alive. Billy's shoulder pain has become intense by this point, and after he throws his first two pitches of the inning well out of the strike zone, Tigers manager Frank Perry makes the call to warm up two relief pitchers in the bullpen. The count goes to 3–0 before Billy recalls pitching to his father (now deceased) in the back yard. He rallies and throws a strike, then gets the batter out on the next pitch.  Before the Tigers take the field for the bottom of the ninth inning, Billy has final ruminations about his career and his love for Jane. He autographs a baseball for Wheeler, who has been like a father to him for many years. Along with a signature at the end, Billy inscribes the ball with "Tell them I'm through. For love of the game."  After finishing the perfect game, Billy sits alone in his hotel room as the realization sinks in that everything he has been and done for the past 19 years is over. Despite his amazing accomplishment, Billy weeps not only for the loss of baseball, but for the other love of his life, Jane.  The next morning, Billy goes to the airport to inquire about a flight for London. Jane had missed her flight the night before so she could watch the end of his perfect game. Finding her there waiting for her plane, they embrace and reconcile.

Lost and confused, they make it to the border only to have a stand-off with two customs officials, both of whom Cyclona kills. "White Girl" violently pistol-whips Cyclona and after making her point, the two race to the suburbs of Tijuana.  In Tijuana, Crystal/White Girl makes money by luring men to dark alleys on the promise of a good time, and mugging them. Cyclona and White Girl check into a run-down motel where they have a moment with beer, a shower and a vibrating bed. White Girl finally gives into Cyclona's sexual advances toward her and the two of them engage in some rampant lesbian sex.  After a few days, the two lovers find a poster that shows Sister Gomez is in town. Sister Gomez appears to be a Catholic/spiritualist healer; Cyclona is very keen that they visit her, for Sister Gomez has protected her from abuse in the past, and might be able to help them. They visit Sister Gomez at her gaudy mission house. Sister makes an enormous roast feast for her "little movie star" (Cyclona) and the friend "with the hungry demon" (Crystal), referring to her bulimia. Cyclona then disappears as White Girl is forced to work for Sister Gomez in the same way as she has been doing, in exchange for food. Finally, Crystal grows weary and makes her way to the basement, where she finds small children in a bondage room with a U.F.O shaped lantern. There is blood everywhere. Cyclona is hanging half-nude in a bondage style contraption. She tells Crystal that Sister Gomez made her watch while she chopped up children and made food out of them. She reveals that her ultimate plan for Crystal was to fatten her up with the meat of the children, and then, serve Crystal up for dinner as well. Crystal concludes that Sister Gomez is the witch-leader of a bizarre cult that rapes and eats children and then sells the child porn videos, protected by the front of a Catholic mission. Ready to deliver justice, White Girl/Crystal frees Cyclona and kills all the cult members; she also reveals Sister Gomez to be a rather well-endowed man. Not succumbing to bullets, Gomez is thrown in the oven. Burning, Gomez screams of his 100,000 years of terror and the revenge from his father Jupiter that will ensue. Crystal, keeping a promise made earlier, is forced to kill Cyclona in a tearful scene rather than allow her to be captured. Cyclona, wishing to leave behind a life of abuse and violence, hopes to be reincarnated as an eagle (we discover that Sister Gomez was her earliest abuser). White Girl makes a deal with the federales and leaves with her lawyer/pimp, stating "I'm not hungry anymore."  
Free Enterprise (film)
 The film deals with the mid-life crises of its two main protagonists, Mark ([[Eric McCormack]]) and Robert ([[Rafer Weigel]]), fictionalized versions of the film's director and producer/writer. The two friends struggle with adult career and relationship problems, all the while defiantly clinging to the geeky science fiction [[popular culture|pop culture]] of their youth and seeking advice from their greatest hero, [[William Shatner]].  Shatner plays a campy caricature of himself as he works on a one-man musical version of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in hopes of finally being taken seriously as a dramatist and musical performer. Hip-hop artist "The Rated R", joined by Shatner, provides the concluding musical number "No Tears for Caesar", a pastiche of famous lines from the play set to a rap rhythm. The film's score was produced by [[Scott Spock]].

Upon arriving at the bank, Luther enters the building through the vents and proceeds to kill the security guard on duty and snatches the keys to lets the others in.  Luther and C.W. proceed to the safe where they begin cracking it open. As they try to open the safe they notice the handle on the vault resembles the shape of a cross causing Luther to squeal before quickly covering the handle with a coat. While working with C.W. closely, Luther gets tempted to bite C.W.'s neck. C.W., feeling uncomfortable due to Luther's proximity tells him to back off, before removing Luther's coat from the handle revealing the cross again.

From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter
 The prequel is set in [[Mexico]] in the early 1900s and begins with an American author, [[Ambrose Bierce]], experiencing a nightmare in which he dies at the hands of [[Pancho Villa]]. Bierce wakes and talks to a local bartender about his intentions to join Pancho Villa's revolutionary army. He joins a stagecoach transporting a newly-wed couple, John and Mary Newlie, who are [[Christian mission|traveling to Mexico to preach Christianity]]. Meanwhile, Johnny Madrid, a dangerous local outlaw, escapes from the gallows and kidnaps his hangman's beautiful daughter, Esmeralda. Madrid receives assistance from Reece, a young woman who wants to become Madrid's apprentice as an outlaw. With the hangman and a local posse on their trail, Madrid meets with his gang. They later rob Bierce's stagecoach because of Reece's belief that Bierce possesses an invaluable object. The object turns out to be the manuscript for Bierce's new book. Annoyed by this, Madrid leaves Reece to die in the desert. She is found by the posse who use her to track the two.  As night falls, all the parties coincidentally seek shelter in an isolated inn that also serves as a whorehouse. They meet Ezra Traylor, a businessman heading to the U.S. The hangman is the only one who knows that the establishment is run by a group of [[vampires]] led by the high priestess, Quixtla, who targets Esmeralda. As night falls John gets into a fight with one of Madrid's men, drawing blood. The vampires eventually reveal themselves, lock the exit and attack the patrons. All of the hangman's men and the remnants of Madrid's gang are killed by the vampires. Ezra is overcome by vampire women, is fed on and quickly turns. His newly-undead form grabs the helpless Mary and bites her. Madrid, Bierce, Reece, John, Esmeralda, the hangman and one other patron manage to escape into the dungeons beneath the building and try to work together to find a way out.  Mary rises as a vampire and goes after the group, revealing that John is a fraud who has only married Mary for her father's money. John is eventually forced to kill her. The patron who escaped with them hides a bite he had received from a hooker earlier. As they continue through the catacombs, he turns and bites John. John kills the patron. Doomed, he persuades Madrid to stake him to prevent him turning. As the remaining survivors keep going, Reece confesses to Bierce that she is an outlaw who has killed her entire family. The group eventually ends up back at the bar entrance, only to find Quixtla and the vampires in wait for them. She reveals that Esmeralda is a [[Dhampir|half-human, half-vampire]] princess, [[Santanico Pandemonium]] ([[Salma Hayek]]'s character in the original ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]''), and the daughter of Quixtla and the hangman. The hangman had taken her away in the hope of raising her as a normal human but, thanks to his mistreatment and Madrid's kidnapping, she has been led back to Quixtla.  Madrid, the hangman, Bierce and Reece are hung upside-down to be fed on later as Quixtla transforms Esmeralda into the vampire princess. Madrid manages to break from his bonds and free the others. Reece is bitten in the scuffle and presumably becomes a vampire. Esmeralda bites and turns the hangman into a vampire, but he manages to open the entrance way and kill Quixtla before the change is complete, allowing Madrid and Bierce to escape. As the film ends, Esmeralda screams for Madrid not to leave her as the entrance is closed. Madrid looks away sadly and joins Ambrose's quest to join Pancho Villa's army. As they leave, the camera zooms out to show the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] temple behind the building that houses the vampires, a reference to the first film.

Galaxy Quest
 The former cast of the cult television space-adventure series ''Galaxy Quest'' spend most of their days attending [[fan convention]]s and promotional stunts. Though Jason Nesmith, the series' former lead star, thrives on the attention, the other cast members — Gwen DeMarco, Alexander Dane, Fred Kwan and Tommy Webber, resent Nesmith's irresponsible and self-serving attitude.   During a convention, Nesmith is approached by a group calling themselves Thermians, led by Mathesar, who request his help; believing this to be a scheduled fan event, he agrees to be picked up the next morning. Nesmith is unaware that the Thermians are really aliens, tentacled beings using human holographic disguises. Nesmith is hungover when he is picked up, and falls asleep as they take him through space to a exact, functional version of the NSEA ''Protector'', the starship from ''Galaxy Quest''. Still hazy, Nesmith proceeds to give orders as captain, directing them to strike on Sarris, a warlord that seeks to eliminate the Thermians. Only when Nesmith is transported back to Earth does he realize that the ship is real.   Nesmith eagerly explains the events of the previous day to his cast members, but they consider it part of his drunken ramblings. When Laliari, another Thermian, appears and requests Nesmith's help further, he convinces the cast including Guy Fleegman, who appeared  as a [[redshirt (character)|redshirt character]] in an episode, to join him. Once aboard the ''Protector'', they are astonished by the ship, and stumble with the controls, as the Thermians only built the ship to the show's specifications but do not know how to operate it. When Sarris attacks again, they evade through a magnetic minefield and take heavy damage, disabling their power core.   The humans take a shuttle to a nearby planet to recover a new power core, having to deal with its hostile native lifeforms. By the time they return, they find that Sarris has taken over the ''Protector''. Sarris discovers that the Thermians, having no understanding of the concept of fiction, took ''Galaxy Quest'' as a documentary, and Nesmith is forced to explain they are actors to Mathesar. Sarris sets the self-destruct mechanism and leaves a sacrificial guard aboard while he returns to his ship. Nesmith and Dane use a tactic from the show to overpower their guards and free the others. While the cast and Thermian crew make repairs and familiarize themselves with the ship, Nesmith and DeMarco travel through the bowels of the ship to shut off the self-destruct sequence, aided over a misplaced Thermian communicator by superfan Brandon and his friends on Earth with detailed knowledge of the show.  With the ship repaired, Nesmith leads his cast and the Thermians to attack Sarris' ship with the magnetic mines, destroying it. The crew prepares to head home through a [[black hole]] and leaving Mathesar in command, with Nesmith giving him confidence that the Thermians can run the ship. Suddenly Sarris, who had teleported onto the ''Protector'' just before his ship was destroyed, appears on the bridge and attacks them. Nesmith activates "Omega-13", a plot device from the show that reverts time by 13 seconds, giving him opportunity to knock Sarris out when he first appears. However, the scuffle has caused the ship to travel too fast, too close to Earth. Mathesar informs them that they must separate the ship or die. The cast say their goodbyes, the alien crew all heading to the second bridge – though Laliari, who has fallen in love with Kwan, goes with the cast.  The command module is flung back to Earth, but the cast have no indicators where to land. Brandon and his friends set off fireworks near the convention center, where their convention is still ongoing, to guide them. The module comes to a crash landing, breaking through the center's wall into an auditorium. As the crew exit the still-smoking module, the gathered fans assume this to be part of the act. Sarris wakes up and comes out of the ship after the cast, attempting to fire on them, but Nesmith is able to vaporize him with a weapon. The fans cheer in excitement.  Some time later, a revival of ''Galaxy Quest'' has been produced. The theme song plays as the credits are shown: the same cast, but this time with the additions of Fleegman and Laliari.  At the end of the credits, Mathesar can be heard saying "Never give up; never surrender!" – Nesmith's character's signature line.

The General's Daughter (film)
  [[Warrant Officer (United States)#Army|Chief Warrant Officer CW4]] Paul Brenner ([[John Travolta]]), a Vietnam War veteran of the [[196th Infantry Brigade (United States)|196th LIB]], is in Georgia, masquerading as [[First Sergeant#United States Army|First Sergeant]] Frank White, at a local Army base, to broker an illegal arms trade with a self-proclaimed [[freedom fighter]]. Brenner is actually an undercover agent of the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]].  While on the base, his car gets a flat tire and a young officer arrives and helps him change it. The officer is Captain Elisabeth Campbell ([[Leslie Stefanson]]), the base commanding general's daughter and an Army captain in [[Psychological Operations (United States)|psychological operations]]. The next evening, she is found murdered. Brenner and another warrant officer, CW2 Sara Sunhill ([[Madeleine Stowe]]), who is also a rape specialist, are brought in to investigate. At the scene, the base Provost Marshal, Colonel William Kent ([[Timothy Hutton]]) has secured the area. He informs Captain Campbell's father, Lieutenant General Joseph "Fighting Joe" Campbell ([[James Cromwell]]), a highly decorated West Point graduate who is preparing to run for Vice President immediately after his impending retirement from the Army.  Brenner and Sunhill search Elisabeth's home off base and find it typical of a career Army officer, with one exception: through a false door in the basement, they find what appears to be a sexual dungeon of sorts. Later Brenner questions Elisabeth's close confidante, Colonel Robert Moore ([[James Woods]]). Though cordial and somewhat cooperative, Moore is evasive when questioned, and gives an alibi, which proves false when Moore's fingerprints are found on Elisabeth's dog tags, which are found in a plastic trash bag several yards from her corpse, along with her clothing. Brenner arrests Moore on charges of conduct unbecoming an officer and impeding a criminal investigation and has him jailed.  Whilst Brenner is arresting Moore, Sunhill is knocked to the ground by four men who verbally threaten her and Brenner. They dash off as quickly as they arrive, but Sunhill notices that the main assailant was wearing a silver [[claddagh]] ring. It turns out to be Captain Elby. In an effort to avoid prosecution, he confesses that Elisabeth was sexually promiscuous with virtually all the officers that made up her father's staff as part of an extensive "psychological warfare experiment" targeting her father, something he had previously failed to mention.  Back at the jail, Colonel Kent releases Moore, confining him to quarters at his home on-base. When Brenner, Sunhill, and Kent later return to Moore's home, they find Moore dead on his couch with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. But Brenner is not convinced that Moore's death was a suicide. General Campbell's [[adjutant]], Colonel George Fowler ([[Clarence Williams III]]), attempts to close the investigation at the crime scene, stating that Moore killed himself out of guilt because he killed Elisabeth, but Brenner refuses to accept this- even after being reprimanded by Fowler, who sternly warns him to accept this version of events and drop any further investigation into the case.  Later it is revealed that Elisabeth was an honor student at [[West Point]] until her sophomore year, after which her class standing plummeted and she barely managed to graduate. Brenner and Sunhill visit Colonel Donald Slesinger ([[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]]), the Academy's psychiatrist, who explains that Captain Campbell had been brutally gang raped by fellow cadets at West Point during a training exercise and left to die in an isolated area—staked down in exactly the same manner in which she was found murdered. Luckily, another cadet group had found Elisabeth in time and rescued her. Elisabeth never knew the names of her assailants, but Sunhill tracks down one of the attackers through Colonel Slesinger, staying at [[Fort Benning]] and engineers a confession. They then swiftly arrest the other assailants, all of whom face 20 years imprisonment each for their crime.  The agents then pay a visit to the general, who corroborates the story. Fearing that the assailants would never be caught, Campbell had acted upon the advice of another general and decided to cover up the incident since such a scandal could have destroyed the United States Military Academy. This denial of justice severely traumatized Elisabeth, causing her to partake in various violent sexual activities and wage a years-long war of psychological revenge against her father behind the scenes. He also is forced to reveal that he did encounter his daughter the night of her murder and that Elisabeth herself, with the aid of Moore, staged the reenactment of her rape at West Point in an attempt to force him to face what he did. But Campbell was unmoved, and instead, harshly rebuked his daughter and left her tied to the stakes.  Realizing that Kent is the only suspect left, Brenner decides to question him. He calls Sunhill but learns that she was returning to the murder scene with Kent, who also wants to see Brenner. Brenner arrives and confronts Kent, who admits that he killed Elisabeth after she rejected him and threatened to tell his family about the affair. He also admits he murdered Moore and made it appear as suicide in an attempt to get away with it. Kent himself then commits suicide by deliberately stepping on an anti-personnel mine.  As General Campbell prepares to get on the plane to accompany Elisabeth's body to the funeral, he is confronted by Brenner, who lays the burden of his daughter's death on the general. Disgusted at what General Campbell did years before- choosing his Army career over his daughter at the moment she needed him the most- Brenner tells Campbell that his betrayal of Elisabeth was what had really killed her and that Kent had just put her out of her misery. Though General Campbell coldly threatens Brenner to keep silent or else be run out of the Army, Brenner promises to have him court-martialed for conspiracy to conceal a crime, thus ruining the general's public image and military career.  A written epilogue explains that Campbell is indeed court-martialed for the crime and found guilty, disappearing from public life soon after.  
Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris
 Three years have passed since [[Gamera]] defeated Legion and the world is once again plagued by [[Gyaos]], which have evolved into Hyper Gyaos. Mayumi Nagamine, noted ornithologist, returns to aid the [[Japan]]ese government in addressing this threat. A [[graveyard]] of Gamera fossils is found at the bottom of the sea. Shadowy government agents, occultist Miss Asakura and Kurata Shinya, are meanwhile working to a different agenda, with Asakura believing Gamera to be an evil spirit.  A pair of Gyaos glide across Tokyo's Shibuya district, but are destroyed by Gamera at the cost of twenty thousand human lives, causing the Japanese government to order Gamera's immediate destruction. Meanwhile, a young girl named Ayana, whose parents were inadvertently killed by Gamera during his previous battle with Gyaos in 1995, discovers a stone egg sealed within her village [[temple]]. The egg hatches a small tentacled creature, whom the girl names "Iris" after her dead pet cat. Iris forms a link with Ayana through an [[orichalcum]] pendant and becomes the focus of Ayana's quest for revenge as she seeks to raise her own monster and take vengeance against Gamera. Iris however attempts to absorb Ayana in the process of his growth. The girl's classmate manages to free her from Iris' [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]], but it leaves its lair and kills half of the village's populace, later growing into its adult form. The military attempts to destroy it, but fails.  Iris flies toward the city of [[Kyoto]], where Ayana has been taken by Asakura and Kurata, with Asakura deliberately trying to use the girl to summon Iris. Iris is intercepted in mid-flight by Gamera and the two engage in an aerial battle, but the Japanese army intervenes and knocks Gamera out of the sky with a tactical missile strike. Nagamine and Asagi, the girl once psychically linked with Gamera, retrieve Ayana and attempt unsuccessfully to get her out of Kyoto. Kurata expresses a belief that Iris had been deliberately created to defeat Gamera so that the Gyaos could wipe out humanity.  The two monsters meet and continue their fight, but Iris easily gains the upper hand, impaling Gamera and leaving him for dead. Iris then makes its way to the train station and absorbs Ayana, killing Asakura and Kurata in the process. From within Iris' body, Ayana experiences the creature's memories and realises that her hatred and bitterness motivated it. Just as she has her epiphany, Gamera plunges his hand deep into Iris' chest and wrenches the girl free, robbing Iris of its human merge.

Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai
 Ghost Dog sees himself as a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of Louie, a local mobster, who saved Ghost Dog's life years earlier. While living as a hitman for the [[American Mafia]], he adheres to the code of the samurai, and interprets and applies the wisdom of the ''[[Hagakure]]''.  Louie tells Ghost Dog to kill a gangster, Handsome Frank, who is sleeping with the daughter of local mafia boss Vargo. Ghost Dog arrives and kills the gangster, before seeing that the girl is also in the room; he leaves her alive. To avoid being implicated in the murder of a [[made man]], Vargo and his associate Sonny Valerio decide to get rid of Ghost Dog. Louie knows practically nothing about Ghost Dog, the hitman communicates only by homing pigeon. The mobsters start by tracing all the pigeon coops in town. They find Ghost Dog's cabin atop a building and kill his pigeons. Ghost Dog realizes he must kill the mafia or they will kill him and his master.  During the day, Ghost Dog frequently visits the park to see his best friend, an ice cream man named Raymond. Ghost Dog does not understand French and Raymond does not understand English but the two seem to understand each other. Ghost Dog also makes friends with a little girl named Pearline, to whom he lends the book ''[[Rashōmon (short story)|Rashomon]]''.  Eventually, Ghost Dog attacks Vargo's mansion and kills almost everyone he encounters single-handed, sparing only Louie and Vargo's daughter. At night, Ghost Dog kills Sonny Valerio in his house. Ghost Dog expects that Louie will attack him (as he feels that Louie must avenge the murder of his boss Vargo). He goes to the park and gives Raymond all his money, helping him to stay in the country. Pearline appears and gives back ''Rashōmon'' to Ghost Dog, saying that she liked it. Ghost Dog gives Pearline his copy of ''Hagakure'' and encourages her to read it.  Though Louie feels some loyalty to Ghost Dog, he finally confronts him at Raymond's ice cream stand with Raymond and Pearline watching. Ghost Dog is unwilling to attack his master and allows Louie to kill him. His last act is to give Louie the copy of ''Rashōmon'' and encourage him to read it. Pearline takes Ghost Dog's gun and shoots at Louie but the gun is empty. Ghost Dog dies peacefully with Raymond and Pearline at his side. Later, Pearline reads the ''Hagakure''.

After work, Ronna approaches Simon's dealer, Todd Gaines ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), for the drugs but, as she is unable to pay the full amount, leaves her friend and other co worker, Claire Montgomery ([[Katie Holmes]]), with Todd as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Before she can give Adam and Zack the drugs, Ronna grows suspicious of Burke ([[William Fichtner]]), a stranger with the two who presses her for the ecstasy.   In a panic, she flushes the drugs down the toilet and leaves. Ronna then steals over the counter pills to replace the ecstasy she disposed of, helped by her friend and another co worker, Manny ([[Nathan Bexton]]), who swallowed two of the ecstasy pills without knowing their strength. Ronna gives 20 of the fake pills to Todd, and she, Claire, and Manny make their way to a rave, where she sells the pills she stole as ecstasy.

When they cannot find their usual dealer, Simon, the two convince Ronna to come up with the drugs. When Ronna arrives later to make the deal, Zack has a change of heart and secretly warns her away, leading her to dispose of the drugs in the bathroom.   After the unsuccessful bust, Burke invites Adam and Zack to Christmas dinner, where they observe strange behavior from Burke and his wife, Irene. Burke and Irene finally pitch an [[Amway]]-type company to the two over dinner, but the pair make excuses and leave. Idly discussing their mutual infidelities, Adam and Zack realize they both cheated with the same person, Jimmy. They discover he is at a rave and confront him there, cutting his long hair.   While leaving the rave, they accidentally run over Ronna in the parking lot, panicking and driving away when they see Todd with a gun. Zack tries to reassure Adam that, even if Ronna had survived being run over, Todd would have shot her. Adam then discovers to his horror that he is still wearing his wire. Fearing they have been recorded and will be discovered, the two return to the accident scene to remove Ronna's body, but discover she is still alive. They prop her up on a car, setting off its alarm, and watch from a distance as other partygoers call for an ambulance.  As morning breaks, Claire goes to a restaurant where she hopes to meet up with Ronna and Manny, but sees Todd instead. The two end up talking and going back to Todd's apartment building. While making out on the stairs, they are confronted by Victor Jr. and Sr. Todd offers Simon's address just as Simon arrives, having hoped to hide for a few days. There is a scuffle but it is stopped by Claire, who refuses to witness a murder.   As a form of "justice," Simon agrees to be shot in the arm by Victor Jr. as Claire leaves in disgust. Meanwhile, Ronna wakes up in a hospital and hobbles back to the supermarket, where Claire is also working. Realizing she left Manny at the rave, Ronna returns with Claire to the venue to find Manny pale and shaken in an alley. The three go to Ronna's car, where Ronna muses that she can now pay her rent.

Godzilla 2000
 [[Godzilla]] is a literal force of nature to [[Japan]]. The Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN) functions independently to study the monster and predict its landfalls. Meanwhile, the scientists of Crisis Control Intelligence (CCI) find a sixty-million-year-old unidentified flying object (UFO) deep in the [[Japan Trench]]. As CCI attempts to raise the UFO to study it, it takes off into the sky on its own. Godzilla arrives in a village and then battles the [[Japan Self Defense Forces]], now equipped with powerful Full Metal Missiles, but the UFO appears, searching for genetic information that only Godzilla possesses. It fights Godzilla, driving the monster underwater, and then lands to replenish its solar power.  Yuji Shinoda, the founder of the GPN, discovers the secret to Godzilla's regenerative properties (named Organizer G1 in the Japanese version, but Regenerator G1 in the North American release), but so has the UFO. It frees itself from the JSDF's attempts to contain it, and heads for [[Shinjuku]]. After landing atop [[Tokyo Opera City Tower]], it begins to drain all the files about Godzilla from Tokyo's master computers. As it begins to alter the oxygen content of the surrounding atmosphere, CCI attempts to destroy the UFO using explosive charges, but Shinoda, attempting to find out more about the aliens, is nearly caught in the blast. He survives, and joins the rest of the cast on a nearby rooftop, watching the UFO. Almost in response, the UFO broadcasts its message of invasion and creating a new empire on Earth, and Shinoda reveals that the aliens are after the regenerative properties contained inside Godzilla's DNA so that they may use it to re-form their bodies.  Godzilla arrives and again battles the UFO. However, Godzilla is subdued by the UFO's assault, and the UFO absorbs some of Godzilla's DNA, which the aliens use to reform themselves outside the space ship as the gigantic Millennian. However, the Millennian is unable to control Godzilla's genetic information in the DNA and mutates into a horrible monster named Orga. Godzilla recovers and brings down the UFO before fighting Orga, but Orga, having absorbed the regenerative properties of Godzilla's DNA, is highly resistant to injury. Orga retaliates and extracts more of Godzilla's DNA in order to become a perfect clone. Godzilla breaks free and sets Orga aflame, but Orga re-emerges and attempts to swallow Godzilla whole. As Orga begins to transform, Godzilla unleashes its atomic breath, vaporizing Orga's entire upper body and killing it. Mitsuo Katagiri, head of CCI, dies when Godzilla partially destroys the roof of the building where he, Shinoda and the scientists were observing the battle. The remaining cast on the roof reminisces on how Godzilla was wrought by human ambition, prompting Shinoda to suggest that "Godzilla exists in us", as Godzilla begins rampaging through Tokyo.

The Green Mile (film)
  In a [[Louisiana]] assisted-living home in 1999, Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film ''[[Top Hat]]''. His companion Elaine becomes concerned, and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935, which took place when he was a prison officer, in charge of death row, what they refer to as the "Green Mile".  In 1935, Paul supervises officers Brutus Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger, and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary. Paul is suffering from a severe [[urinary tract infection|bladder infection]] and receives John Coffey, a physically imposing but mentally challenged black man, into his custody. John had been sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering two white girls. One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic streak, but, as the nephew of Louisiana's First Lady, he cannot be held to account. He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Delacroix; he breaks Del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles, which Del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head; Del dies screaming in pain.  John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures Paul's bladder infection, resurrects Mr. Jingles, and heals Melinda Moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. This last affliction he releases into Percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer William Wharton, dead. Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker; he assaulted the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions that later caused Paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped Percy, racially insulted John, and revealed psychically to John that he is, in fact, responsible for the crime for which John was condemned. John then reveals the story psychically to Paul, and, when doing so, he also releases his supernatural energy into Paul. Meanwhile, Percy is committed to the insane asylum.  Although distraught over the notion of being executed while innocent, John tells Paul that he wishes to die; he views the world as a cruel place and constantly feels the cruelty of humanity like shards of glass in his head. Mentioning that he had never seen a movie before, John watches ''Top Hat'' with the other guards as a last request. John is executed that night but refuses the customary hood, as he is afraid of the dark. Paul concludes his story by telling Elaine that John's was the last execution that he and Brutus supervised; following Coffey's execution, they both took jobs in the juvenile system.  Elaine realizes that, since he had a grown son in 1935, Paul must be much older than he looks. Paul reveals that he is 108 years old. He is kept alive by the power that John passed on to show his psychic memories. Not only is Paul still alive, so is Del's mouse, Mr. Jingles. Paul is shown attending Elaine's funeral as he muses that if John's power could make a mouse live for as long as Mr. Jingles has, how much longer does he himself have left?

On the hunt, the boy sees two grizzly cubs which no one else sees, then rejoins his father.  The next day, the hunters capture the two cubs, and hold them in the camp, near a waterfall called Grizzly Falls, hence the movie's title. The bear mother is angry, and comes to the camp. Although she cannot free her offspring, she instead kidnaps Harry to exact revenge on Tyrone.  She then runs away with him, and looks after him, feeding him, and once saving his life from [[northwestern wolf|wolves]]. He is at first intent on escaping from the bear, whom he names Mizzy, but eventually grows to love her.  Meanwhile Tyrone is intent on rescuing him, and Joshua comes along, but the men from the saloon and their dogs are hardly as keen. One breaks his leg at Grizzly Falls, and he and his friends leave, taking the bear cubs with them and setting up their own camp somewhere else. Tyrone and Joshua continue searching for Harry.  In another area Harry stumbles upon the saloon men's new camp whilst Mizzy is finding food. He looks inside the hut where the men are sleeping, and wakes them up. One man tries to protect the boy but another points his gun at him. Just as this man is going to shoot, Mizzy bursts through the window, knocking down one wall of the hut. This crushes one man.   Then Tyrone and Joshua find the camp, and attack the men who are in it, while the bear runs to its chained-up cubs outside, trying to free them.   The evil man gets up, but has no time to do anything because Tyrone shoots his hand, then leaps on him, and throttles him. They then begin a ferocious wrestle, which Tyrone wins, plunging his opponent into the river. Stream takes his corpse. Harry says goodbye to his bear-mother Mizzy, and she goes away into the mountains, reunited with her two cubs.  Tyrone becomes a better father, having learned a lesson on the adventure.  
Grey Owl (film)
 Archibald Belaney (Brosnan) was a British man who grew up fascinated with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture—so much so that in the early 1900s he left the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] for [[Canada]], where he reinvented himself as Archie Grey Owl and lived in the wild as a North American Indian [[Animal trapping|trapper]]. Eventually, Belaney becomes an [[environmentalist]] after renouncing trapping and hunting.  
Ground Control (film)
 [[Chicago]] [[air traffic controller]] Jack Harris ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) was cleared of liability for an ill-fated flight under his authority which resulted in the loss of Transair flight 290, a Lockheed L-1011 with all 174 souls aboard. He subsequently left the job and went on to design air control software, until five years later when T.C. Bryant ([[Bruce McGill]]), his ex-colleague who had since transferred to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], pleads for help on [[New Year's Eve]], due to a critical staff shortage and with torrential weather predicted.   Jack's return to the control room is met with both warmth and disdain, particularly when he experiences flashbacks of the crash. The atmosphere rapidly becomes much more serious as the storm approaches and, with the control tower suffering power cuts, the team is forced into manually directing busy air traffic through severe turbulence.  
The Green Elephant
 Two men (both being junior officers in Soviet Army, in 1986), nicknamed "Bratishka" (Little Brother) and "Poekhavshiy" (The Mad), are being held in a penal military prison. The room which they share looks like a dark cellar with a dripping sewer pipe running through it. One of the prisoners, Poekhavshiy, seems to be delirious and never stops talking. He tells stories of his past, sings the song of the "Green Elephant" circus, does push-ups, comes up with crazy ideas and even mimics a heron in an attempt to cheer up his cellmate Bratishka, leading only to an increase in his anger. He receives a violent beating from the enraged Bratishka, before he is then taken from the cell by a guard to clean up a dirty toilet bowl with a fork.  Some time later, after Bratishka falls asleep, Poekhavshiy defecates on their shared plate for eating (calling it "sweet bread"), smears feces over his belly and consumes a large portion of it. After doing so he offers a plate with the fecal matter to the other man right after he wakes up, and drives him mad again. Poekhavishiy tells him that he is just giving him some food to eat with together (as they will not be given anything to eat), but Bratishka angrily tells him to wash himself by the dripping pipe water, threatening Poekhavshiy that he will kill him. The guard arrives from the screaming in the cell, and drags the infuriated Bratishka out to clean the toilets again. The captain arrives to the cell and lectures Poekhavshiy on the [[Pacific War|theatre of operations of the Pacific Ocean]], particularly on the names and numbers of the Japanese and American ships on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. He scolds Poekhavshiy on his incorrect answers, and orders a guard to go to the canteen to prepare a glass of tea for him and the officer. The captain tastes it, and comments "It tastes like urine", spilling its contents on the guard's head. He orders to guard to hold the glass with his teeth, instructing him to go and tell the kitchen staff that "this kind of tea will not be tolerated, ever." The guard then beats up Poekhavshiy.<ref>[http://www.jerryrubin.ru/kino/rezhissery/svetlana-baskova/ Светлана Баскова «Клуб им. Дж. Рубина»]</ref>  The two main characters were sent to a basement and left in a pit, where the captain subjects them to various humiliating acts. He finds the guard wetting his trousers, and beats with a whip to make him dance while the two are forced to quickly sing "[[Yablochko]]". Bratishka struggles to get out of the pit, screaming and ranting of his normality, and telling Poekhavshiy to catch a rat for him to eat. The captain returns, and asks the two about the [[5th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Northern Formation]].  Taunting Bratishka's requests for food, the captain forces him to oral sex, which Bratishka begs that Poekhavshiy receive it instead. The captain then subjects Poekhavshiy to oral sex,<ref></ref> while muttering the names of the Japanese carrier ships at Pearl Harbor. Driven to insanity from this, Bratishka beats the captain with a pipe, and bites off his face, before sodomizing him and tearing off his trachea. He then plays with the dead captain's trachea by making the now-insane Poekhavshiy blow it, pretending that it is an elephant's trunk.  Upon realizing that he has murdered someone, Bratishka changes his uniform with Poekhavshiy's, and commits suicide by cutting his wrists. Poekhavshiy mourns him, crying for help and muttering about his experiences with his mother. The guard arrives to the bloodied basement, and goes mad, proclaiming himself as a [[Polkovnik|colonel]] and asking for Poekhavshiy to accompany him as a witness to the celebrations. The guard hangs himself and makes a speech, and Poekhavshiy knocks his chair over, causing the guard to fall and suffocate from the string. Poekhavshiy then scoffs at the guard's corpse as he ties it up with the string and the captain's trachea. He plays with the corpse, as he goes about singing about the "Green Elephant" and thrusting on his back, before tumbling over and falling asleep.  Between the lecturing and basement scenes, several black-and-white scenes were shown about the guard as he eats his meal and drinks. There, he complains about Poekhavshiy's and Bratishka's behavior affecting the prestige of the military, and he curses the captain, claiming that he will become a colonel. On the credits the guard is shown, improvising his own uniform as he continually screams "I am a colonel!"

Guest House Paradiso
 Richard "Richie" Richard ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Edward "Eddie" Elizabeth Ndingombaba Hitler ([[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]]) run the worst guest house in the [[United Kingdom]]. Their staff include a [[chef]], who is unable to cook, an idiotic drunkard and an illegal immigrant, and a waiter, whom Richies believes has checked into a psychiatric hospital. Both leave because of nonpayment for their employment, with the latter quitting because of the verbal abuse from his boss. The guests, including Mr Johnson ([[Bill Nighy]]), who reside in the pair's hotel are thoroughly dissatisfied by the poor service, and eventually decide to leave, except for Mrs Foxfur ([[Fenella Fielding]]) who lives there.  Life seems bleak for Eddie and Richie, until they seemingly improve with the arrival of the "Nice family", headed by Mr Nice ([[Simon Pegg]]), and the famous [[Italy|Italian]] actress Gina Carbonara (Hélène Mahieu).  Gina's decision to stay in the grotty house is primarily down to her need to seek safety from her ill-tempered fiancé Gino Bolognese ([[Vincent Cassel]]). However, thanks to the pair putting her names in lights outside the guest house to attract more guests, Gino eventually finds her. Forced to cook meals for the guest, Richie comes across some [[fish]] which fell off a military lorry, heading away from the nearby [[nuclear power]] station. Unknown to both him and Eddie, the fish had been comtaminated by a radiation leak due to the power station's poor maintenance.  Hours after serving the radioactive fish, everybody becomes violently ill and projectile-[[vomiting]] at high velocity and in huge quantities—all except for Gina Carbonara, the only guest who did not eat the fish. In an act of spontaneous solidarity, every guest projectile-vomits on Gino at once, forcing him backwards, out through a window and off a cliff edge into the ocean. Government agents arrive to hush up the incident and give Eddie and Richie £10 million pounds, first-class tickets to the [[Caribbean]], and new identities for both them and Gina, in exchange for their silence over the leak. The three accept the offer and head to the Caribbean. In the film's final scene, Eddie [[Fourth wall|winks to the camera]] after commenting "How lucky he was the only fatality. Otherwise there'd be a moral question-mark hanging over our escape."

H-E Double Hockey Sticks
 [[Satan]], in the form of Ms. [[Beelzebub]] ([[Rhea Perlman]]), sends apprentice demon Griffelkin (Friedle) to Earth's surface to steal the soul of a hotshot young [[hockey]] player named Dave (Lawrence), who aspires to be the youngest man to ever win the [[Stanley Cup]].  Dave and Griffelkin reach a very specifically-worded agreement whereby Dave's soul is forfeit in exchange for a Stanley Cup championship for the Delaware Demons (a thinly veiled version of the [[New Jersey Devils]]), which is Dave's team at the time. After the deal is done, however, Griffelkin also arranges for Dave to be traded to The Annapolis Angels, the last-place team in the league, allowing Griffelkin to fulfill his end of the bargain without actually allowing Dave to win the Stanley Cup himself. He later chooses to help Dave as revenge against Ms Beelzebub for her mean collapsible chair trick and because of his reformation, choosing to side with Good. An Angel named Gabrielle tells Griffelkin that Dave's soul can be saved if the Angels win the Stanley Cup. Dave then realizes that the only way to save his soul is to become a true team player and help his new teammates improve enough to defeat the Demons in the Stanley Cup finals. The Demons lose the Stanley Cup, The Angels win and the deal is off. Griffelkin decides to join Gabrielle, who tells him he has a few things he must do to earn his wings. Then Satan/Ms Beelzebub, enraged at her defeat and at Griffelkin for helping Dave win, madly goes back to Hell in a fit of rage.  
Happy End (1999 film)
 ''Happy End'' is about Choi Bora ([[Jeon Do-yeon]]), a successful career woman who becomes involved with her ex-lover, Kim Il-beom ([[Joo Jin-mo]]). Bora's home life is a snore: she's mother to an infant child and her husband, Seo Min-ki ([[Choi Min-sik]]) has lost his job, leaving Bora as the family's sole breadwinner. It's unclear if Bora is with Il-beom just for the sex or for the passion, both of which Min-ki seems incapable of giving. But it seems the jobless Min-ki hasn't been just wandering around parks and reading romance novels as first thought; he knows something is going on, and he's collecting evidence.  Min-ki has been emasculated by his inability to find a job and director Jung hammers this point home with a brief montage showing Min-ki grocery shopping, cooking, and doing the laundry. These are all very feminine jobs, particularly in very patriarchal South Korea. Most interesting is that Min-ki seems content to live with the cheating Bora, very much aware of his own shortcomings, which leaves him willing to be wronged.  Bora is unable to stop going back to Il-beom even though she seems physically and emotionally damaged by their continued affair. Il-beom has realized that he is hooked on her, and is very aware of his jealously-driven actions toward her and her family. Without each other, they have no passion in their lives, and so they must keep going back to each other.  Although ''Happy End'' ends rather unhappily, the film is not altogether downbeat. Director [[Jung Ji-woo]] has taken the role of observer, using mostly handheld cameras to capture the events in the lives of his 3 main subjects.  The film is [[sexually explicit]], and there is one scene of brutal violence.

Nell receives a phone call about an [[insomnia]] study, directed by Dr. David Marrow ([[Liam Neeson]]) at Hill House, a secluded [[manor]] in the [[Berkshires]] of western [[Massachusetts]], and applies for it. At the house, she meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley ([[Bruce Dern]], [[Marian Seldes]]), a strange pair of caretakers. Two other participants arrive, Luke Sanderson ([[Owen Wilson]]) and Theodora ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), along with Dr. Marrow and his two research assistants. Unknown to the participants, Dr. Marrow’s true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear, intending to expose his subjects to increasing amounts of terror. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning.   During their first night, Dr. Marrow relates the story of Hill House. The house was built by [[Hugh Crain]] — a 19th-century textile tycoon. Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to populate it with a large family of children; however, all of Crain's children died during their birth. Crain's wife Renee [[Suicide|killed herself]] before the house was finished and Crain became a recluse. After the story, Marrow's assistant's face is slashed by a snapped [[clavichord]] wire. The freak accident causes Marrow's research assistants to leave. Nell begins to suspect that it was no accident, as she notices that the wire was unwound by someone or something. Theo and Nell begin to experience unusual happenings within the house, such as a mysterious force trying to open the door, Nell starts seeing ghosts of children in curtains and sheets, Hugh Crain's wood portrait morphs into a skeletal face and is vandalized with the words "Welcome Home Eleanor" written in blood. Theo and Luke try to establish their innocence, but Nell tells them that they don't know her.  Nell becomes determined to prove that the house is [[Haunted house|haunted]] by ghostly children who are only terrorized and killed by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain kidnapped the children from his [[cotton mills]] and slaughtered them, then burned their bodies in the fireplace, trapping their ghosts and forcing them to remain with him, providing him with an 'eternal family'. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, from whom she is descended. Dr. Marrow is skeptical of Eleanor's claims, until he realizes he made a mistake by bringing them to Hill House when a statue tries to drown him in a pool of water in a greenhouse. After several more terrifying events, Nell insists that she cannot leave the ghosts of the kids to suffer for eternity at Crain's hands. Trying to convince Eleanor to leave the house with them, Theo offers to let Nell move in with her, but Nell reveals her relation to Carolyn and claims she must help the children to "move on" to the [[afterlife]].  Hugh Crain's ghost seals up the house, trapping them all inside. A frustrated Luke defaces a portrait of Hugh Crain. Crain's enraged spirit drags Luke to the fireplace where he is [[Decapitation|decapitated]] by the flue. Nell is able to lead Crain's spirit towards an iron door. The spirits pull Crain into the door, dragging him down to [[Hell]]. Nell is pulled with him, inflicting fatal trauma on her body, but the ghosts gently release her on the ground. Her ghost rises up to [[Heaven]], accompanied by the children's ghosts. After Nell's death and when she moved on to Heaven along with the ghosts, Theo and Dr. Marrow wait by the gate outside until the Dudleys come in the morning.  The Dudleys approach as the sun rises. Mr. Dudley asks Dr. Marrow if he found what he wanted to know, but the [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] psychiatrist does not give an answer, and neither does Theo. When the gate opens, the two silently walk out and down the road, leaving Hill House behind them.

Herod's Law
 After the [[mayor]] of the fictional village San Pedro de los Saguaros is lynched by angry villagers, a petty [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] party member named Juan Vargas ([[Damián Alcázar]]) is appointed temporary mayor by the state governor. At first, the new mayor attempts to do good, but a lack of funds, the fact that the majority of the villagers don't speak Spanish, and the opposition of both the local doctor (an obstreperous [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] mayoral candidate) and Doña Lupe (the brothel owner) cripple his efforts. Seeking help from his superior, López, the secretary to the PRI governor, he is given a copy of the [[constitution of Mexico]] and a [[revolver]] and is told that the only law is [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s law: literally translated: "either you get screwed or you get fucked" ("o te chingas o te jodes"). On his way back, he meets a caucasian American on the road when his car breaks down; the American looks under the hood, reconnects a wire and then asks Vargas for hundreds of dollars. He says that he is the mayor of San Pedro and that he is good for the money, then laughing it off as he drives away. Returning to the town, a bribe from Doña Lupe sets him on the path to corruption.  When Vargas thus has become the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]] of the village all in one person he soon becomes corrupt, first accepting the bribes from Doña Lupe (which he extends into paying free visits to the brothel's girls), and soon moving on to extort the local store owner and all of the villagers for even the smallest infractions. When questioned, he declares that he is funding a new project to bring [[electricity]] to the village with the help of an American engineer (in reality, the American he met earlier, having shown up in San Pedro wanting his money)—a farce which is obvious when only one utility pole is raised; still, the villagers are oblivious to this, except for the doctor. Vargas becomes progressively more corrupt, and when Doña Lupe's new bodyguard severely beats him after she resists his authoritarianism, he kills them both in retaliation. He incriminates Filemón, the local drunk, for the crime, and on the way to deliver him to the state's authorities he kills Filemón in the middle of the road. When he returns to the town, he discovers that his wife (not blind about his visits to the brothel) and the American are having an affair, and the American flees. Meanwhile, Vargas levies false accusations against the local doctor, assigning him the role of intellectual author in Doña Lupe's murder; nonetheless, it is also revealed that the doctor has been sexually abusing the teenage girl that serves as his maid, and Vargas uses this to blackmail him into leaving the town or face incarceration. Having gotten rid of his enemies, Vargas becomes obsessed with power to the point where the whole town despises him, levying absurd taxes for everything, incarcerating those who refuse to pay, seizing their possessions (including animals), and rewriting several laws to his own absurd and tyrannical whims.  It is in the middle of this that López and his henchman, Tiburón, arrive to San Pedro, on the run after López's men tried to shoot his rival for the governorship of the state, who is also president Alemán's nephew. Seeing that the town had riches after all, López demands all the money Vargas has extorted from the villagers. Discovering that his wife has escaped with the American, taking all of the fortune with them, Vargas grows enraged and kills both López and Tiburón. Then, Vargas seems to meet his demise when he is surrounded by a crowd of torch-wielding villagers, but unlike the previous mayor, he avoids this fate by climbing up the sole pole he raised, and is saved when several police cars arrive, hot on the trail of López. Vargas reappears at the very end of the film delivering a speech to the Mexican National Congress, a spot he earned as a prize for killing López. As Vargas says in his speech that the PRI must stay in power forever, the film cuts to the scene of a new mayor coming to San Pedro de los Saguaros in exactly the same way that Vargas did at the beginning.

At the beginning of the film, Lhakpa, the heir to the chieftainship of the tribe is revealed to have died in a botched attempt to navigate a shortcut.   An annual event, the caravan provides the grain that the villagers depend on to survive the winter. The film unfolds as a story of rivalry based on misunderstanding and distrust, between the aging chief, Tinle, and the young daring herdsman, Karma, who is both a friend and a rival to the chief's family, as they struggle for leadership of the caravan. The elders of the tribe assert that Karma should lead the caravan in the absence of Lhakpa, but Tinle objects and insists that someone else should lead the caravan.   Karma, seeking to prove himself as a worthy leader, departs a few days before the scheduled departure of the caravan, leaving behind only the youngest and oldest members of the tribe. Karma's relatives plead with Karma not to leave as leaving before the scheduled departure of the caravan was seen as deceitful. Karma does not heed this warning, and soon the elders of the tribe congregate to determine which households still had remaining salt. Tinle decides to lead the remainder of the community in a caravan with the remaining salt, recruiting his monastic son, Norbou, to join his endeavours, on the original set day of departure. Tinle soon catches up with Karma's caravan, despite Karma having taken a shortcut and having left days earlier.

When the snowstorm sets, Tinle grows weary and exhausted, and in ensuring that the caravan is remaining a cohesive unit, Tinle collapses in the snow. Karma arrives, having realized his mistake, and carries Tinle to the front of the caravan. The caravan is successful in reaching a landmark and survives the snowstorm, but Tinle collapses at the landmark, asking to be left to die. The leaders of the caravan agree, indicating that Tinle, as masters of the mountains, should honour his wishes to peacefully pass away in the mountains rather than the flatlands.  The film ends with Tinle's monastic son, Norbou, honouring the legacy of Tinle by painting a monastery wall with the caravan's adventures.

Unfortunately, they are separated at the end of the war when their father was celebrating their recent success in a battle with Pakistan. One of the twins end up in the neighboring Pakistan and is brought up as a [[Muslim]] named Tauheed. He was brought up by a terrorist who told him that his mother had died in an attack of Indian army, while the other grows up as a [[Hindu]] named Ajay Malhotra. Ajay is a novelist.  The movie begins with a montage of India's diversity and the [[Wagah border ceremony]], as a song describes India's agelessness, sanctity, patriotism, and the [[Partition of India]].  A boy runs in a city with an [[Flag of India|Indian flag]] in his hand to celebrate India's 50th [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]]. He gives it to his impatient father, who grabs the flag by the cloth. An old man kicks the flag off the father's hand, introduces himself as Kabira, and rebukes him for his lack of respect for India. He had lost his right arm. When the boy and several others applaud Kabira, Kabira tells them not to clap for him, but to be more active in loving their country and protecting it from attack. He asks them to say "[[Jai Hind]]", and they repeat and salute him.  An Indian commander discusses his strategy to several military officers to stop [[Pakistan]]'s attacks, by suggesting that evidence for Pakistan's terrorist activities should be collected and presented before the [[United Nations Organisation]], which will then condemn Pakistan as a terrorist state. Meanwhile, a soldier hijacks a Pakistani aeroplane and tells the pilot (Aziz Kashmiri, an intelligence officer) to give to him a floppy disk. He and the pilot fight, and the pilot parachutes out of his aeroplane. The soldier jumps out of the airplane, and continues fighting the pilot in mid-air. He kills the pilot, retrieves the floppy disk, and uses the pilot's parachute to glide his way to the ground.  The Indian commander later holds a meeting with his officers about the pilot's plane crash, and tells them to work prudently to expose whoever who was responsible. In an airport, Ajay has his picture taken by a photojournalist and permits him to publish his picture. A woman arrives and asks him to sign his autograph, as she is a fan of his novels. When she asks him about where did he get his ideas, Ajay said that it was a trade secret, and leaves. The photojournalist asks the fan to let her sign his autograph, but she refuses and leaves.  At home, Ajay's mother asks him about his conference, and the photojournalist asks for food, which Ajay's mother prepares for him. As the photojournalist eats his food, she receives a government pension from a postman. Ajay asks his mother on why did she take alms, but his father Kabira answers that she is not taking alms, but respect. Kabira then lectures him about the contributions of India's freedom fighters who fought against [[British Raj|foreign rule]], with [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]] as an example of a patriot.  On a street, Priya asks Ajay to take her on his motorcycle to the airport to get to the Miss Universe competition, and he performs several stunts to navigate through traffic and he confesses his love for her, until he wakes up from his daydream. Ajay sees Priya (as [[Miss Universe|Miss India]]) on television winning second place in the competition, and goes to an airport to congratulate Priya. They fall in love.  Two Pakistani officers snatch a copy of Ajay's novel, and give it to their commander as proof of the murder of one of their officers, Major Chawla in New York. The Pakistani commander asks them to bring Ajay to him for interrogation. After he promises his mother to bring Priya home, Ajay and the photojournalist depart by airplane to Srinagar for photography. The Indian officers visit Ajay's house and inform their commander about Ajay's location.  Pajirao Marathe films a terrorist base near Srinagar that sought to take over the Kashmir region, and fights an Ajay-lookalike. He is then stabbed by the Ajay-lookalike, who takes his film recording away. When the two Indian officers report this to their commander, their commander uses a film of his military training to show that Ajay had also received military training as a [[commando]], but was rejected from being a soldier due to his poor eyesight, and that Ajay is also planning his own schemes.  The real Ajay and Priya dance at a New Year's party, and was seized by the officers. The commander interrogates him about Pajirao's murder, which Ajay denies any involvement, and tells him that the events of his stories (which resembled the murders) were inspired by his dreams. Priya returns to Ajay's home and informs his mother that he has went missing. Ajay's mother later informs Kabira about Ajay's disappearance. After the commander orders Ajay to be tortured, one of the officers suggests that they use hypnosis to extract the origin of his novels' plots, and they send Ajay to Dr. Dastoor. During the session, Ajay recalls his childhood (where he recalls several children hiding from enemy soldiers), his shooting of a Pakistani army chief and his officer from his helicopter, and using that helicopter to kill the officer's truck. The commander then orders his officers to observe Ajay carefully.  Ajay returns home, and asks his mother about the "Aunt Geeta" that he had heard in his dreams. Ajay's mother shows him a photograph of their family, and recounts the Pakistani-led raid that took away his brother Raju and killed Aunt Geeta when the family visited an army base to celebrate the end of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Kabira adds that he was also there when he lost his right arm to a grenade thrown by a Pakistani soldier, who also took Raju away before his very eyes. When the family visits Dr. Dastoor, he explains that Ajay and Raju have a sort of bond that affects both of them if one of them is affected. Dr. Dastoor also adds that the incidents that Ajay sees in his dreams are his brother's experiences, and Ajay requests that he should not tell his mother about his brother's shared experiences.  With the ongoing rivalry and hatred between the two countries, both find themselves on the opposite side, and must battle each other. The only way they can unite is by saving the life of the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], who himself has become the target of terrorists. When

House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)
  In 1931 the patients at the Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally Insane revolt against the staff headed by the sadistic Dr. Richard Vannacutt. The patients start a fire which engulfs the building, killing all of the inmates and all but five of the staff.  In 1999, Evelyn Stockard-Price, a spoiled [[trophy wife]], is in a disintegrating marriage with Steven Price, an [[amusement park]] mogul with a wicked sense of humor. At Evelyn's insistence, Price leases the hospital from the owner, Watson Pritchett, for her birthday party. Five guests arrive for the party - Jennifer Jenzen, Eddie Baker, Melissa Margaret Marr, Dr. Donald Blackburn, and Pritchett himself. The guests are not the ones Price invited and neither of the Prices know who they are. Despite this, Price continues the party's theme, offering $1 million to each guest who stays in the house and survives until morning. Those who die forfeit their $1 million to the survivors.  The security gates are tripped, locking everyone inside. After finding some handguns, Jennifer, Eddie and Pritchett decide to take one of the guns and search the basement for the machinery which controls the gates. Price believes the trap is a stunt organized by Evelyn. As Eddie and Jennifer explore the dungeon-like basement, Jennifer confesses to Eddie that her real name is Sara Wolfe, and that she's an out-of-work assistant to the real Jennifer Jenzen. She attended the party in Jennifer's place because she needed the prize money. The two are separated, and Sara is nearly drowned in a tank of blood by a ghost impersonating Eddie. The real Eddie arrives in time to save her.  Melissa disappears when she wanders off in the basement, leaving behind a massive trail of blood. Price visits his assistant Schechter, who is supposed to be managing the party stunts, but finds him horribly mutilated. On the surveillance monitor he sees the ghost of Dr. Vannacutt walking around with a bloody scalpel. Evelyn dies in front of the others, when they find she has been strapped to an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] table. Price pulls a gun on the guests, demanding to know which one of them killed his wife. Sara nearly shoots him, but Eddie knocks him out before either one can kill the other. The remaining guests lock Price in the "Saturation Chamber", an archaic [[zoetrope]] device that Vannacut used to treat [[schizophrenics]]. Blackburn volunteers to guard Price. When the others leave he turns the chamber on, leaving Price to be tortured by the moving images and ghostly hallucinations until it drives him to a [[seizure]].  Sara and Eddie find Vannacut's office. Inside, they find a portrait of all the head staff and realize that all the party guests are descendants of the five surviving staff from the 1931 fire. Pritchett explains that the spirits themselves created the guest list by hacking into Price's computer. The only exception is Blackburn, whose name does not appear among the staff.  Blackburn is revealed as Evelyn's lover. Evelyn faked her death. The two are plotting to frame Price for the murders, hoping one of the guests will kill him in self-defense. Evelyn stabs Blackburn to add another victim to the mix and releases a delirious Price from the chamber. Sara discovers Price covered in blood and Blackburn's head hanging from the door of the Saturation Chamber. Believing that he is Blackburn's murderer, Sara shoots him. After the others return upstairs, Evelyn approaches Price to gloat. Price, protected by a [[bulletproof vest]], attempts to kill Evelyn. The two scuffle before Price throws her through a decaying door. Inside the rotting room, the two realize they just stumbled upon the evil core of the house. The Darkness – a dark, shape-shifting creature composed of the spirits in the house – awakens and begins to take form. Evelyn is captured and killed by the Darkness. Trying to escape the monstrous apparition, Price stumbles upon the remains of Melissa, neatly dissected and arranged as an anatomical display.  Pritchett is killed by The Darkness, allowing Price to evade it. Price tells Sara and Eddie that the only way out is through the attic. The three flee as The Darkness begins to seep through the house, manipulating the walls and shattering the floors. Price activates a pulley that reveals an opening in the window of the attic. When the Darkness seeps into the attic, Price sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape, but the Darkness closes the iron gate after Sara escapes, trapping Eddie inside.  As the Darkness prepares to assimilate Eddie, Pritchett's ghost appears and opens the iron gate. The Darkness is distracted by Pritchett long enough for Eddie to escape out of the window to Sara. Pritchett's ghost and the Darkness both fade away. As Sara and Eddie watch the sun rise, they notice an envelope on the ledge. It contains all five $1 million checks, made out to cash.  In a [[post-credits scene]] a short black and white film is shown, depicting the freed patients of the Vannacutt Institute torturing the Steven and Evelyn Price.

Kool reaches into his pocket, and Pee Wee, thinking Kool is about to kill him, runs for his own safety and is shot and killed by C-Dawg. Kool reveals that he was going to send him home with a plane ticket.  Saint finds the warehouse where the Hot Boyz do their business and has his crew, and the corrupt police working with them, draw their guns and get ready to kill. A 10-minute gunfight ensues, in which most of the Hot Boyz are killed or injured. Kool and Tully have a standoff in which Kool wins due to an assist from an injured C-Dawg, and in the end as he jumps out of the window, hops into a car and jumps into the river, he tells the audience that "There was time when the world was mine; LaShawna, me, and our baby, the future looked so good, and now I'm on a dead impact and a crash course with destiny." He also tells the audience that it's funny when you're thirty-eight feet below, all the guns, and the money in the world doesn't even matter any more, and that you find yourself thinking about the strangest things,noting "I found myself thinking about justice, and that I realized I had not found any for myself, I had just been sinking deeper and deeper, and that now all I wonder is if I had any air to get away, will I have anything to live for any more." He tells the audience that eventually he was found and locked in prison for 30 years without parole until Eddy got him out on a legal loophole after only serving 5 years in prison, getting a second chance to live a good life - a life that LaShawna and the baby would have approved of.  As the movie ends, it shows Kool sitting by LaShawna's gravesite and having flashbacks of her, after which he tells the audience that a good life is worth living, because as long as he lives the memory of LaShawna lives on forever, and that love is something to believe in, and all he has now is memories.

As the blockade still needs to be broken, [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] has the ship raised and puts [[George E. Dixon]] in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the [[Battle of Shiloh]], where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The [[Union Navy|U.S. Navy]] is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS ''Wabash'', but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the ''Wabash'' shoot at the ''Hunley''. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The  is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The ''Hunley'''s second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so.  On February 17, 1864, the CSS ''H. L. Hunley'' sails out and attacks the USS ''Housatonic''. The torpedo is rammed into the side of the ship. It blows up and the ''Housatonic'' is the first ship ever sunk by a sub. A bullet from the ship breaks a window in the conning tower and wounds Dixon. The explosion opens the seams on the ''Hunley'' and it takes on water. It settles to the bottom and the crew cannot release the ballast or pump the ship. As agreed the crew opens the valves and the ship floods, killing the entire crew.  
The Hurricane (1999 film)
 The film tells the story of [[middleweight]] boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "The Hurricane" Carter]], who was convicted of committing a triple murder in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. His sentence was set aside after he had spent nearly 20 years in prison. The film concentrates on Rubin Carter's life between 1966 and 1985. It describes his fight against the conviction for triple murder and how he copes with nearly 20 years in prison.  A parallel plot follows [[Lesra Martin]], an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, now living in [[Toronto]]. In the 1980s, the child becomes interested in Carter's life and circumstances after reading Carter's autobiography. He convinces his Canadian foster family to commit themselves to Carter's case. The story culminates with Carter's legal team's successful pleas to Judge [[H. Lee Sarokin]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]].  In 1966, Rubin "The Hurricane" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer, expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion. When three victims, specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police.  Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, "were never suspects," a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club, Carter was given three consecutive life sentences.  Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, claiming that his race, his boxing career and status and his work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. Eight years later, Bello and a co-suspect, Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, renounced and recanted their testimony. However, Carter and Artis were convicted once again.  Afterwards, the plot goes back to Lesra Martin, who works with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reexamine Carter's case.  In 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed "grave constitutional violations" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. As a result, Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, "Hate got me into this place, love got me out."<ref name=answers/>

The next morning, Gilmore arrives at the Johnnie's workplace, having heard about the incident, to interrogate Johnnie about where he was last night. Being convinced that Johnnie was at his family's barbecue, Gilmore starts to leave, but Jamie, afraid of going to jail, knocks him out over the head with a wooden board. Freaking out, Johnnie takes Gilmore to the hospital, and later goes on the run with Jamie, and tells Judy to stay in town to not get involved.  Johnnie takes Jamie, who is convinced that Gilmore is dead, along to work at a tortilla factory owned by a Mexican friend, Villalobos, in Tijuana, to hide out for a few months. While working there for several weeks, which makes Jamie uneasy, they conspire with another long-time employee, Cesar (Palomino), to pull off a heist at a bullring to finally get out of Tijuana. Gilmore, who has been recovering from his injury, searches for Johnnie and Jamie by interrogating different people, including Judy. This worries Judy, who later tries to find Jamie in Tijuana and inform him and Johnnie about how Gilmore isn't really dead. Johnnie tries to send Judy away, but she is later kidnapped by the Mexican drug dealers from the beginning when they recognize Johnnie working at the tortilla factory and see her there.  Villalobos and Sean eventually discover the scheme the brothers and Cesar are planning at the bullring and want to be part of it. Johnnie tries to get out of it all when he learns Gilmore survived the blow to the head, but Sean convinces him to stay and help out. While going through with their plan, Judy is tortured by her abductors until she reveals Jamie's heist plans. The dealers go to find Jamie in retribution for the killing of one of their men, and Judy escapes from them and tries to get to Jamie before they do. While Johnnie and Cesar are robbing the cashiers at the bullring, Jamie gets their getaway car ready to go to the beach, where Sean is supposed to be waiting for them all on a speedboat. Judy arrives at the bullring to reunite with Jamie, but the drug dealers also arrive. As Johnnie and Cesar try to get into the getaway car, a shootout ensues with the drug dealers, which catches the attention of the bullring guards, who also get involved. In the ensuing gunfight, Judy, Jamie, Cesar, and some of the dealers are killed, and Johnnie tries to get away with the money to the beach. The guards call the police to help catch Johnnie. When Sean sees Johnnie arriving with the money, but with some policemen on his heels, he uses the speedboat to escape, leaving Johnnie behind again to be arrested for the robbery.  The film ends with a flashback where as kids, Johnnie is explaining to Jamie the art of theft.

In Too Deep (1999 film)
  Jeffrey Cole ([[Omar Epps|Epps]]) is a recent graduate of the Cincinnati police academy who dreams of working undercover. Cole manages to get an undercover assignment the day of graduation and earns the praise of his superiors. Good at earning the trust of small-time drug dealers, Cole is given the task of taking down statewide crack dealer Dwayne Gittens ([[LL Cool J]]), an underworld boss so powerful that his nickname is "God". Gittens is known as a family man and a man of the people, contributing to his community and helping those in need. However, there is another side to him, a ruthless leader of a criminal empire who will torture or kill anyone without question. Gittens controls eighty percent of the drug traffic in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], controls many of his opponents through bribery or intimidation, and appears to be untouchable. Building up his skills and credentials as an effective undercover officer, Cole earns the praise and adoration from his superiors, and he is eventually assigned to undercover work in the case against Gittens.  Cole goes undercover, posing as a drug dealer under the name of J. Reid from [[Akron, Ohio]]. He is determined to be the man who brings down Gittens underworld empire. Cole has to prove he has street cred to gain a place in God's crew. At one point God sends Cole out on a mission with a couple of his cohorts with the intention of Cole killing a man that God wants dead. Trapped in that position, Cole goes along and has to find a way not to kill this man, but not blow his cover. This on the car ride over. What he does is chase the man firing shots at him, but misses intentionally. Thus the crew believe he's loyal, but has bad aim. Cole eventually becomes close with one of the members of Gittens' crew, Breezy T. ([[Hill Harper|Harper]]). Later on, Cole eludes an assassination attempt by members of Gittens' crew that he was with earlier. Cole goes to Breezy T., thinking that he was set up by Breezy or God. Once Breezy advises that he had nothing to do with that, nor did Gittens, and the guys acted on their own accord, Cole leaves.  Cole's superiors are impressed at his undercover work and how close he has gotten to Gittens, earning his trust while providing his superiors with intricate details into Gittens' organization. Cole's superior, Preston D'Ambrosio ([[Stanley Tucci|Tucci]]) worries that the line between cop and bad guy is getting blurred and that both identities are becoming one. He begins to see behavioral changes in Cole, as more and more, Cole starts to assume the J. Reid identity, and D'Ambrosio believes that Cole is getting too far deep undercover that, characteristically and morally, he may not be able to recover from. Because of this, D'Ambrosio places Cole on forced hiatus from undercover and sends him to a place in the woods far from the city to get his head straight and re-discover himself.  During that time, Cole rediscoveres his identity and meets Myra ([[Nia Long|Long]]), an aspiring model during one of Cole's photography classes. The two eventually begin dating and D'Ambrosio (who checks in on Cole from time to time) begins to take notice of his new life away from undercover work. Cole tries to convince D'Ambrosio to let him go back undercover in the Gittens case, to no avail. D'Ambrosio is too concerned for Cole becoming the J. Reid persona and losing his identity for good. D'Ambrosio is eventually overruled by District Attorney Daniel Connelly ([[Jake Weber]]) and [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent Rick Scott ([[David Patrick Kelly]]), reasoning that Cole is the only undercover cop to infiltrate Gittens crew as deep as he has, and Cole is the person who can bring down Gittens' organization. Cole is then reassigned to the Gittens case. Myra, realizing that he has to go back undercover, begins to distance herself from Cole.  As Cole becomes J. Reid once again, he becomes reacquainted with Gittens. Cole starts to see Gittens becoming unhinged and his sporadic violence in the community (with one example, Gittens beating a man and woman in the streets in broad daylight with his infant son in the car), going as far as beating one of his close associates with a pool stick and ramming the stick up the guy's anus, killing the man for making a pass at his baby's mother. The ruthlessness starts to get to Cole, as he dives deeper into his J. Reid cover. The further Cole goes undercover, the more his identities and loyalties are blurred between Jeffrey Cole, the undercover officer, and J. Reid, the gangster from Akron that has earned Gittens full trust. Because of this, Cole begins to alienate himself from his superiors, his fellow officers, and even Myra, as Cole begins to lose reality of who he is, becoming more and more the J. Reid gangster.   D'Ambrosio wants to pull Cole out of undercover again, as he sees his officer becoming unhinged and becoming J. Reid. Connelly and Scott disagree, and they come up with a sting to bust Gittens meeting with his suppliers, to which D'Ambrosio eventually agrees after Cole convinces him the importance of this sting. During the sting, where Cole and Gittens are meeting with Gittens' suppliers, the police arrive to arrest Gittens and the suppliers. A gunfight ensues, with the police and Gittens. Gittens advises his crew to lower their weapons and surrender (advising that his lawyers will get them out and a shootout with police is futile). Cole shields Gittens from police and a standoff ensues between the officers and an unhinged Cole, struggling between his loyalties. Realizing he is losing himself, Det. Angela Wilson ([[Pam Grier|Grier]]) talks him down and reminds him that he is Jeffrey Cole, not J. Reid, and to lower his weapon. Cole eventually gets a hold of himself and lowers his gun. As Gittens is being read his Miranda rights, Scott requests Cole to bring Gittens in (and exposes Cole's identity as an undercover cop). Gittens, in disbelief, denies all allegations that Cole is an undercover cop. Eventually Gittens realizes the magnitude of the situation and that J. Reid is a cop; Gittens calls Cole a sellout, and leaves in police custody.   During trial, Cole (now out of undercover and back to his normal identity) testifies against Gittens and his organization. Cole puts in a good word for Breezy T., helping him reduce his sentence. Because of the evidence against him and Cole's testimony, Gittens is convicted and sentence to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Gittens and Cole share a final glance before Gittens is taken away.  As Connelly and Scott hold a press conference for the conviction of Gittens (taking credit for Cole's undercover work in the process), Cole and Myra (assumed to be back together) are driving and listening to the press conference. Cole switches off the radio, while Myra reminds Cole that his undercover work was the sole reason Gittens is behind bars. The last scenes are shown where Cole is teaching new young officers about undercover work, and the importance to never lose their cover or get too deep.

Inferno (1999 film)
 The film opens as Eddie Lomax ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]) drives an Indian motorcycle in an open desert plain (referred to as the Dry Lake). Soon enough, the motorcycle breaks down and Eddie dismounts, carrying nothing but his jacket, his .45 pistol, and a bottle of tequila. As he lies in the desert drinking, he eventually sees his friend Johnny Sixtoes ([[Danny Trejo]]), a [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican Indian]], to whom he had sent a postcard notifying him of his arrival.  In their conversation Eddie reveals that the surprise he wrote about in the letter was, in fact, the Indian motorcycle. He also reveals that he's there to kill himself as he goes into a drunken rage, revealing deep regret from their days in the Army, claiming that the souls of those he killed haunt him. Firing shots off in all directions, he vents his buried feelings to Johnny, and hopes he will "give him the OK to take a journey".  Soon after the shots are fired, a truck pulls up to Eddie, Johnny disappears, and it becomes clear that Eddie was hallucinating about him being present. Matt ([[David "Shark" Fralick|Shark Fralick]]), Jesse ([[Silas Weir Mitchell (actor)|Silas Weir Mitchell]]), and Petey Hogan ([[Jonathan Avildsen]]), sons of Ramsey Hogan ([[Larry Drake]]) get out of the truck, Matt furious as one of Eddie's drunken shots almost killed him.  Eddie staggers to them, not wanting any trouble; Matt, however, insists that he apologise. Matt then proposes that they take the motorcycle, and they'll forget about the gunshot. Eddie persists that the motorcycle is a gift for his friend, telling Matt to get off. Matt seems to comply, until he delivers a cheap blow to Eddie. After a fight, Eddie is left beaten and shot in his right shoulder. As the brothers stand over Eddie, another truck passes with a local restaurant waitress Dottie ([[Jaime Pressly]]) and cook Vern (Kevin West). Dottie expresses extreme concern; Vern simply drives on, not wanting any trouble from the Hogans. Matt begins to load the motorcycle onto the truck, instructing Jesse to make sure that Eddie is dead.  Jesse asks for Eddie's gun from Pete, who took it from the earlier struggle. Being the youngest of the three, Petey insists on doing the job. As Jesse and Matt load the motorcycle, Petey aims at Eddie's head. Eddie's eyes open briefly, which makes Petey uneasy. Two shots ring out, which make Matt and Jesse think that Pete shot Eddie twice. However, Petey froze and simply shot two rounds into the ground.  Johnny Six Toes finds Eddie and nurses him back to health. Eddie then comes back to town to recover his pistol from Leon ([[Gregory Scott Cummins]]) and Lester (Neil Delama) in the pawn shop by killing them. Eddie falls for Rhonda Reynolds ([[Gabrielle Fitzpatrick]]), the other waitress,and enlists the help of Jubal Early ([[Pat Morita]]) to help him dispose of the bodies.

 A prologue establishes the journalistic bona fides of Bergman and [[Mike Wallace]] as they prepare to interview [[Sheikh Fadlallah]] for ''[[60 Minutes]].''  Bergman approaches Wigand—a former executive at the [[Brown & Williamson]] tobacco company—for help translating technical documents. Wigand agrees, but intrigues Bergman when he refuses to discuss anything else, citing a confidentiality agreement. B&W later coerce Wigand into a more restrictive agreement, leading Wigand to accuse Bergman of betraying him. Bergman subsequently visits Wigand to defend himself and investigate the potential story. Wigand, though apparently possessing very damaging information, is hesitant to jeopardize his severance package with B&W by revealing anything.  The Wigand family move into a more modest house, Wigand now working as a teacher. One night Wigand finds evidence of trespass, and receives a sinister phone call.  Bergman contacts [[Richard Scruggs]], an attorney representing [[Mississippi]] in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, suggesting that if they [[Deposition (law)|deposed]] Wigand, it could negate his confidentiality agreement and give CBS cover to broadcast the information. Scruggs expresses interest.  Some time later Wigand receives an emailed death threat, and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but the agents who attend are hostile and confiscate his computer. A furious Wigand demands that Bergman arrange an interview. In the interview, Wigand states that he was fired after he objected to B&W intentionally making their cigarettes more addictive.  Bergman later arranges a security detail for Wigand's home, and the Wigands suffer marital stress. Wigand testifies in Mississippi, over the objections of B&W attorneys, despite having been served with a [[gag order]]. On returning home, he discovers that his wife Liane ([[Diane Venora]]) has left him and taken their daughters.  Eric Kluster, the president of CBS News, decides not to broadcast Wigand's interview, after CBS legal counsel Helen Kaperelli warns that CBS is at risk of legal action from B&W. Bergman confronts Kluster, believing that he is protecting the impending sale of CBS to [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]], which would enrich both Kluster and Kaperelli. Wallace, and their executive producer [[Don Hewitt]], both side with Kluster. Wigand is appalled, and terminates contact with Bergman.  Investigators probe Wigand's personal history and publish their findings in a 500-page dossier. Bergman learns that ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' intends to use it in a piece questioning Wigand's credibility. He convinces the editor of the ''Journal'' to delay while [[Jack Palladino]], an attorney and investigator, evaluates it.  After infighting at CBS over the segment, Bergman is ordered to take a "vacation", as the abridged ''60 Minutes'' segment airs. Bergman contacts Wigand, who is both dejected and furious, accusing Bergman of manipulating him. Bergman defends himself and praises Wigand and his testimony. Scruggs urges Bergman to air the full segment to draw public support for their lawsuit, itself under threat by a lawsuit from the Governor of Mississippi. Bergman is unable to assist, and privately questions his own motives in pursuing the story.  Bergman contacts an editor at ''[[The New York Times]]'', disclosing the full story and events at CBS. The ''Times'' prints the story on the front page, and condemns CBS in a scathing editorial. The ''Journal'' dismisses the dossier as [[character assassination]] and prints Wigand's deposition. Hewitt accuses Bergman of betraying CBS, but finds that Wallace now agrees that bowing to corporate pressure was a mistake. ''60 Minutes'' finally airs the original segment, including the full interview with Wigand.  Bergman tells Wallace that he has resigned, believing ''60 Minutes''<nowiki>'</nowiki> credibility and integrity is now permanently tarnished.  
The Iron Giant
  Shortly after the Soviet Union launches ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' in October 1957, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine, then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds a giant robot attempting to eat the transmission lines of an [[electrical substation]]. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding it docile and curious. When it eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with it and derails, and Hogarth leads the Giant away from the scene, discovering that it can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books of the adventures of [[Superman]].  The incidents lead a cowardly and paranoid U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother, Annie, and rents a room in their house to keep watch on him. Hogarth evades Kent and moves the Giant to a junkyard owned by [[beatnik]] artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant but is forced to explain "death" after witnessing hunters killing a deer.  When Kent discovers evidence of the giant after finding a photo of it next to Hogarth, and brings a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to 'prove' the Giant's existence, Dean tricks them by pretending the Giant is one of his art pieces. Rogard is enraged by the apparent false alarm and prepares to leave with his forces after berating Kent on his antics. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun, but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system, and Dean orders it away for Hogarth's safety, with Hogarth giving chase. Dean realizes the Giant was acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.  The Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when it arrives, winning over the townspeople. Kent convinces Rogard to return to Rockwell when he spots the Giant in the town; the Army attacks the Giant after he had picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant, thinking Hogarth dead, transforms into a war machine in grief and retaliates, forcing its way back to Rockwell. Kent then convinces Rogard to prepare a [[UGM-27 Polaris|nuclear missile]] launch from [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], as conventional weapons prove ineffective. Dean and Annie revive Hogarth, who returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. The General is ready to stand down when Kent impulsively orders the missile launch, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell where it will kill everyone. Kent attempts to escape, but the Giant stops him and Rogard has him detained. In order to save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population, and the military forces nearby but seemingly destroys the Giant, devastating Hogarth.  Months later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard, containing a bolt from the Giant; the only remnant ever found. That night, Hogarth finds the bolt trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the bolt to leave. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the [[Langjökull]] [[glacier]] in [[Iceland]], and he smiles as he begins reassembling himself.

Gadget infiltrates Claw's lab but is caught and deactivated, Claw crushing his control chip.  Brenda, Penny, her dog Brain, and the Gadgetmobile track Gadget to the junkyard but find him unresponsive. Brenda kisses him, and the power of Gadget's heart reanimates his body without the need for the control chip. After dropping Penny and Brain off at home, Gadget, Brenda and the Gadgetmobile give chase to Claw's limo. Gadget and Robo-Gadget are thrown off and do battle, ending with Gadget detaching Robo-Gadget's head. Gadget uses his helicopter hat to fly to Claw's headquarters, where he is planning to escape with Brenda via a helicopter.

Sapna, having been stood up at her own wedding, is mocked by her community. Later that night, Badshah finds a child who has survived a train crash, and goes to Sapna for help. Sapna mistakenly believes that Badshah is a married man and has brought his own son to her. Sapna's uncle calls the police, and Badshah escapes with the child, without explaining the truth to Sapna. Meanwhile, the child's distraught parents, Aaditya and Mamta, struggle to deal with their son's disappearance. Badshah attempts to leave the boy at a mosque, but later decides to adopt him. Months pass by and Abdul still refuses to cooperate with police. Inspector Pradhan refuses to close Badshah's file, promising that he will neither accept any promotions or transfers until he is caught. Badshah leaves his criminal life behind and starts a new, honest life as Babu Lohar. Babu works hard to earn money to provide for the boy, who he names Raju and raises as his own.  Seven years later, Raju has grown up and starts to attend school. Mamta, who is the school's trustee, meets Raju and bonds with him, not realising that he is her son. She showers him with gifts, which angers Babu, as he feels that his son is being enticed away from him with material things. Abdul is released from prison and goes home to Sultan, who assumed that Badshah was imprisoned as well. Abdul concludes that Badshah had stolen the money from the deal and abandoned him in jail. Sultan calls for revenge and wants Badshah to return to work for him. Abdul tracks down Sapna, who now works as a bar dancer in a nightclub, and finds out that she does not know where Badshah is either. Soon, Abdul finds out about Badshah's new identity and confronts him about the money and his disappearance. Babu meets Sultan and tells him to forget their past and leave him alone, but Sultan refuses. Having followed Abdul, Inspector Pradhan arrives at Babu's house and meets Raju. He is impressed with the character of the young boy and decides not to pursue Badshah anymore. After a school concert, Aaditya gives Raju a lift home and comes across his childhood pictures, causing him to realise that Raju is his son. He invites Babu to his home and pleads for the return of his son, but Babu cannot bear to be separated from Raju and refuses. Abdul tries to persuade Sapna to kill Badshah to avenge her humiliation, but she is unable to do so after she overhears Mamta pleading with Babu to return her son. Desperate for the return of his son, Aaditya takes Babu to court and wins the right to have Raju in his and Mamta's full custody. Realising that their son is unhappy with his new life, Aaditya and Mamta take Raju to visit Babu, but he is kidnapped by Sultan's men during the trip.  Babu goes to save Raju, but is outnumbered and trapped in a cage. Sultan intends to torture Babu by hurting Raju, using his 2 dogs. Babu manages to free himself and saves Raju from the dogs, killing Abdul and Sultan in the process. Badshah reunites with Sapna, and they decide to live with Aaditya and Mamta, in order to collectively raise Raju.

While waiting for the commander, Jakob overhears a German radio broadcast speaking about Soviet offensives. Returned to the ghetto, Jakob shares his information with a friend, sparking rumors that there is a secret radio within the ghetto. After hesitating, Jakob decides to use the chance to spread hope throughout the ghetto by continuing to tell the optimistic, fantastic tales that he allegedly heard from his "secret radio" and his lies keep hope and humor alive among the isolated ghetto inhabitants. He also has a real secret in that he is hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from an [[extermination camp]] deportation train.   However, the [[Gestapo]] learn of the mythical radio and begin a search for the resistance hero who dares operate it. Jakob surrenders himself to the Germans as they demand the person with the radio give himself up or risk hostages being killed. During interrogation, Jakob tells the police commander that he had only listened to the radio inside his office. He is ordered to announce publicly that this was all a lie, so the ghetto's liquidation would then proceed in an orderly fashion. When presented to the public, Jakob refuses to tell the truth, but is shot before he can make his own speech.   At the film's ending, Jakob says, [[post-mortem]], that all the ghetto's residents were then deported and were never seen again. As in the novel, there is an alternate "but maybe it wasn't like that at all" ending where, following Jakob's death, the train carrying the Jewish prisoners to the death camps is halted by Soviet troops and the occupants released.

When Dane and Courtney are announced as Prom King and Queen, Zack sneaks backstage and broadcasts the card's message over the sound system. Disgusted, Dane quickly abandons Courtney while Marcie hides under a table.

Julien Donkey-Boy
 The film opens on television footage of an ice dancer - a recurring motif in the film - before cutting away to Julien, a young man with untreated [[schizophrenia]]. In the opening scene, Julien meets up with a small child with several turtles, only to strangle him to death when he is denied one. Julien then buries the child under the mud and prays for mercy from God.  We see snapshots of Julien's [[dysfunctional family]], including his pregnant sister Pearl (it is implied that Julien could be the father), his brother Chris, who aspires to be a wrestler, his grandmother, and his domineering, German father, who shows no real love or encouragement to his family.  Rather than a linear narrative, we instead see various scenes and vignettes involving the main characters, such as Julien working at a school for the blind, going to confession, muttering to himself on the streets and imagining conversations with [[Hitler]]. Pearl meanwhile learns to play the harp, looks for baby clothes for her soon-to-be-born child, lists her favorite baby names and cuts her father's hair. Chris spends nearly the entire film working out and practicing wrestling moves on trash cans, even having a frustratingly unserious match with Julien. The father recounts historical stories, lambasts Julien and Pearl for "artsy-fartsy" poetry and being "a dilettante and a slut" respectively, and pines for his dead wife.  At the film's climax Pearl and Julien are at an ice-skating rink. Julien tries to sell some homemade skates to a Hasidic boy and Pearl takes to the ice despite being heavily pregnant. She trips, landing on her stomach and causing a miscarriage. At the hospital, Julien convinces a nurse to let him hold the baby, saying it is his. She allows it, but while alone with the baby, Julien escapes home on a bus.  Julien goes to his room, hides under the blankets, cradles the baby and mutters prayers. The film ends with ice-skating footage.

In 1995, in Seoul, a huge shopping centre, the [[Sampoong Department Store collapse|Sampung department Store collapsed]], killing about 500 people and injuring many others. This tragedy was caused by human negligence. Half a million dollars were offered in indemnity to the victims' relatives, and this triggered a merciless looting made by unscrupulous people. In a morgue where the lifeless body of a girl lies, waiting to be identified, a man and a woman, who introduce themselves as the parents of the victim, are distraught over the loss of the young girl. However, after a moment's hesitation, a morgue employee claims the body of the girl. The grotesque controversy about who is the real "owner" of the corpse and the legitimate beneficiary of the money starts here. Between turn of events and paradoxical punishments of fate, the ending leads to a tragic and ironic conclusion. In black and white, the whole story is set in the cold morgue, where the characters' absurd and pathetic dialogues take place, like a journalist and a police detective who keep on squabbling.

 Raja ([[Kunal Singh|Kunal]]) is from a very poor, illiterate family, from Tamil Nadu (in the Hindi version he is from [[Allahabad]]). People from his region consider that "education is meant only for the rich". There, poor boys are made to work from age 5, either at factories or farms, so that they can support their families. But, Raja's mother forced his father to let Raja study up-to class 2, without any work. But he refuses to fund him, and orders him to start work as accountant for their landlord. Raja's dad is violent and an alcoholic. He spends the family's income on alcohol. Raja's family struggles to work hard everyday. Raja's mom begs him to move to Mumbai to start a new life. Raja heeds his mom's pleas and moves to Mumbai to attend Ramachandra Institute of Management Studies, the top-most  premier b-school in India. The movie starts off at a train station on New Year Day, 1999. Raja talks with a person ([[Manivannan]] in the Tamil version, [[Anupam Kher]] in the Hindi version)  who was well-wishing him. Due to insistence, Raja goes into a flash back. 3 years ago, he reaches Mumbai, where he plans to get admitted into the prestigious Ramachandra College of management, one of the most premier institutes in the nation. He gains admission for an MBA program at the Ramachandra College in [[Mumbai]], though he was in 41st rank,in admission tests, for the 40 member class, with the help of the college chairman, Ramachandra ([[Nassar]]), but he doesn't realize this at first. He thought that he managed to get a seat due to his own abilities. This was because Ramachandra saw Raja sleeping on the same enclave-side bench, where he slept without having anything else than the thought of providing quality education to all, 40 years ago. Ramachandra was born to a poor illiterate family and his father abandoned them after his sister's birth. Out of his desire to become a student, his mother rents the baby sister for beggars, to pay fees. But the poor baby dies and this pushes Ramachandra to create the best institute in India, by hard work. He brings up his daughter, in a humble manner, all alone after the death of his wife.  Raja meets Roja ([[Sonali Bendre]]) through the Internet. After a brief introduction, Raja and Roja started loving each other. They have yet to see each other and thus, they sent their pictures through e-mail to each other. As Roja checks her e-mail and sees Raja's photo, Raja enters the Net Cafe where Roja was. Then, they meet each other. They are initially shocked by seeing each other as Roja told him that she is in America and Raja told her that he is in London, although they were both in India and were studying in the same college.  The very next day, Raja meets Roja again in the train station where he usually comes to board the train. Again they are both surprised and were speechless when they saw each other. However, things take a turn for the bad when they are both unable to express their feelings about each other due to fated accidents. Raja wanted to see if Roja really likes him by asking her to wear a rose on her head. But, as she walks towards the train station, her rose drops off. Unaware of this, Raja believes that Roja really doesn't like him. Ramachandra meets him and tells him to be practical. He suggests that Raja should write her a love letter. As Raja doesn't know how to write one, Ramachandra helps him. Even his daughter, Roja, helps him write a letter for Raja, unaware that it was for Raja that the father was writing it.  The next day, Raja meets her in the train station and gives her his books, with the love letter inside of it. Not knowing why he gave her his books, she just skims through his books, accidentally causing his love letter to fly away. However, Roja does write a love letter to him too. As she returns his books, a long-lost friend of Raja meets him on the train station. Raja writes the address on the first page of the book and tears it off to give to his friend. Unfortunately, he wasn't aware that Roja wrote her love-letter right behind it. He feels disappointed and doesn't show interest to Roja, causing her to think that he doesn't like her. Ramachandra comes to the rescue again and asks Raja to write another love letter and give it to her the next day, which happens to be Valentine's Day. When Raja comes to express his love for Roja, he finds out that Roja is the daughter of Ramachandra, who has decided to fix his daughter up with Rajesh Gupta, a smart and wealthy man. Rajesh's father owns the second best private University in India and wants to merge Ramachandra's own. Roja makes a last attempt to find out if Raja likes her or not. She sends him an e-mail stating that she loves him. On the other hand, Raja doesn't want to hurt the feelings of his beloved guide and teacher, whom he respects as his father. Thus, he sends her an e-mail stating that he is unable to return his feelings for Roja. Roja begrundgingly agrees to the wedding, assuming that Raja will never fall in love with her.  Raja leaves the wedding hall and plans to go back to his hometown, which goes back to the beginning of the story. Coincidentally, Ramachandra overhears his conversation between Raja and his friends and realizes that he is in love with his daughter. He goes to the train station to stop Raja, asking him to return and propose to his daughter. Raja and Ramachandra reach the wedding hall just in time to stop the wedding from taking place. But as they make their way, Roja faints due to ingesting poison in a suicide attempt (this scene is not shown in the Hindi version).  In the Tamil version, Raja and Roja are married on Valentine's Day, and the movie ends with showing them marrying. In the Hindi version, Raja and Roja confess their love for each other and the movie ends with them embracing.

But Sitharam faces problems in the form of another loving couple, Akash ([[Suchindra]]) and Akhila ([[Ruchita]]) due to an old argument between Sitharam and Akash, for which Akash decides to humiliate Sitharam in front of his own lover. They tell that Akhila was cheated by Sitharam when they were in bed and Kalyani, being an innocent, believes their words and goes away from Sitharam. Hence, Sitharam becomes the main antagonist of the film to make the lives of Akash and Akhila the living hells. An enraged and betrayed Sitharam therefore decides to seek revenge against Akash and Akhila but fails in all of his attempts. He also attempts to stop the love marriage between Akash and Akhila, which is arranged by Madana Gopal ([[Manivannan]]), Akash's father.  But, when Akash and Akhila meet and ask apologies to him, Sitharam forgives them by seeing their good hearts but to his horror and sad shock, Sitharam meets Kalyani as a housewife who is now married to the blind business tycoon Thangarajan ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]). She tells him that Akash and Akhila met her and apologized for their betraying behaviours and she learnt the good heart of Sitharam, but she chose to marry Thangarajan as the former would spoil himself if she doesn't meet him at least once. Sitharam also informs this matter to Akash and Akhila, who are now married and the trio become best friends. Sitharam pleads Akash to look for a good bribe like the good hearted Akhila for him, to which the latter happily and wholeheartedly agrees and bids goodbye to the former.

Immediately afterwards, one of the remaining Komodos attacks them. Oates manages to lure the dragon away into leaking oil/gasoline and attempted to kill it by igniting the oil with one of Denby's cigars. The dragon escapes the fire and rushes after Victoria, but she kills it by using a rock to bash in part of a broomstick handle into its head that she earlier injured it with.  The helicopter finally arrives along with Bracken. Oates turns up at the station alive and steals the helicopter to leave Bracken on the island with the creatures. Victoria and Patrick are trying to make their way back to Martin's boat when another large Komodo dragon tracks them down. It traps them by the coast cliff side, however, Oates flies overhead in the helicopter and saves them by shooting a flare gun into the Komodo dragon's mouth, incinerating it.

The Last September
 ;Preface Although ''The Last September'' was first published in 1929, a preface was written for this text decades later to be included in the second American edition of this novel. Concerned that readers unfamiliar with this particular chapter of [[Irish history]] would not fully comprehend the anxieties of these times,<ref>Williams, 221</ref> Bowen takes great pains to explain the particulars of both her writing process and the political reasons for the unsettled atmosphere felt throughout the text, palpable even in its most seemingly serene moments. Of all her books, Bowen notes, ''The Last September'' is "nearest to my heart, [and it] had a deep, unclouded, spontaneous source. Though not poetic, it brims up with what could be the stuff of poetry, the sensations of youth. It is a work of instinct rather than knowledge—to a degree, a ‘recall’ book, but there had been no such recall before.”<ref>Bowen, "Preface" 199</ref> While Bowen's own beloved family home, [[Bowen's Court]], remained untouched throughout "The Troubled Times"<ref>Bowen, "Preface" 201</ref> this preface explores the ramifications for witnesses of “Ambushes, arrests, captures and burning, reprisals and counter-reprisals”<ref>Bowen, "Preface" 202</ref> as "The British patrolled and hunted; the Irish planned, lay in wait, and struck.”<ref>Bowen, "Preface" 202</ref> "I was the child of the house from which Danielstown derives" Bowen concludes, “nevertheless, so often in my mind's eye did I see it [Bowen’s Court] burning that the terrible last event in ''The Last September'' is more real than anything I have lived through.”<ref>Bowen, "Preface" 204</ref>  ;Part One: The Arrival of Mr. & Mrs. Montmorency ''The Last September'' opens in “a moment of happiness, of perfection”<ref>Bowen, 3</ref> as Sir Richard and Lady Naylor welcome their long-awaited guests, Hugo and Francie Montmorency, to their country estate, Danielstown, in Cork, Ireland. Despite—or, in some characters’ cases, in spite of—the tensions produced by what Bowen obliquely refers to as “The Troubled Times,”<ref>Bowen, "Preface" 201</ref> the Montmorencys, the Naylors, as well as the Naylors’ niece, Lois, and nephew, Laurence, attempt to live their lives in the aftermath of [[World War I|The Great War]] while coping with the occasionally conflicting dictates of their class's expectations and personal desires. Preoccupied with the concerns of social obligations which must be met even as they are enacted against a backdrop of uncertainty and national unrest, the residents of Danielstown occupy themselves with tennis parties, visits, and dances, often including the wives and officers of the British Army who have been assigned to this region. The people of Danielstown all share a particular interest in the shifting relationship between Lois and a young British officer, Gerald Lesworth, as Lois struggles to determine precisely who she is and what it is she wants out of life.  ;Part Two: The Visit of Miss Norton Lois’s confusion regarding her future and the state of the bond she shares with Gerald is temporarily sidelined by the arrival of yet another visitor to Danielstown, a Miss Marda Norton whose connection to the Naylor family remains strong even in the face of perpetual inconvenience and Lady Naylor’s long-standing polite aversion to the younger woman. Marda’s presence is, however, as much of a blessing for Lois and Laurence as it is an annoyance for Lady Naylor and Hugo Montmorency—the latter having developed a one-sided fixation on the soon-to-be-married Marda.  While Lois and Marda’s friendship deepens, readers are also made aware of escalating violence as the fragile status quo established between the British Army, the [[Black and Tans]], and local Irish resistance is threatened by Gerald's capture of Peter Connor, the son of an Irish family friendly with the Naylors. Unbeknownst to the residents of Danielstown (with the single exception of Hugo), Lois and Marda's acquaintance with Ireland's national turmoil is expanded firsthand as they are confronted by an unknown individual while on an afternoon stroll through the countryside of [[County Cork]]. Although permitted to depart with only a trifling wound to Marda's hand and Lois's promise that they will never speak of this encounter in the ruins of the old mill, this meeting and Marda's subsequent return to England signal a shift as the novel's characters’ attention return to the various topics occupying their thoughts before her arrival.  ;Part Three: The Departure of Gerald After Marda Norton’s departure, Lois’s attention is once again firmly fixed upon both Gerald and the activities organised by the British officers’ wives. But despite Lois’s determination to finally come to a firm conclusion regarding her future, her relationship with Gerald is first delayed by Lady Naylor’s machinations and then left forever unresolved by Gerald’s death—which may have been at the hands of Peter Connor’s friends. Not long after Gerald’s death Laurence, Lois, and the Montmorencys leave Sir Richard and Lady Naylor, but the Naylors have little time to enjoy their solitude at Danielstown. The Naylor family estate and the other great houses are put to the torch the following February—likely by the same men who organised the attack on Gerald—their destruction reinforcing the fact the lifestyle once enjoyed by the landed [[Anglo-Irish]] gentry has been brought to an end.

The Legend of the Titanic
  In modern-day New York City an old [[mouse]] named Conners tells his grandchildren the supposedly "true" story of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].  In April 1912, Conners was a young sailor mouse on ''Titanic''s maiden voyage from [[Southampton]] to [[New York City|New York]]. He is in charge of taking account for the mice who are making the trip. A young mouse from Brazil named Ronny who enjoys playing [[soccer]] befriends Conners and Conners falls in love with Ronny's sister Stella.   Meanwhile, a rich aristocratic woman named Elizabeth and her family board the ''Titanic''. Her father is a famous [[Duke]] and is very prominent in the [[whaling]] business. He and Elizabeth's stepmother have arranged for Elizabeth to marry Mr. Evarard Maltravers, a rich whaler. Unknown to the Duke, the marriage is actually a scheme concocted by his wife and Maltravers to gain worldwide whaling rights for themselves, and asserts that the marriage is what's best for his daughter. Elizabeth sees several [[Romani people|gypsies]] dancing at the dock and happily watches them. A gypsy man named Don Juan is dancing with his dog Smiley. He notices Elizabeth and sends Smiley to see her. When Elizabeth takes off one of her [[gloves]] to pet Smiley, Smiley snatches it and takes it back to Juan. Juan looks at Elizabeth and the two instantly fall in love. The ''Titanic'' then sets off to sea from Southampton on her first, and only, voyage.  Conners and Ronny learn all about what's going on with Elizabeth by their observations during their trips throughout the ship's [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation system]]. They are appalled by the way Elizabeth is being treated badly and decide to help her. When Elizabeth goes to the bow of the ship that night, some [[dolphins]] talk to her due to some magic [[Moonlight|moonbeams]] catching her tears. The dolphins jump very high out of the water and seem to [[Levitation|levitate]]. They tell her of Maltravers's evil scheme. Maltravers's manservant Geoffreys spies on Elizabeth's activities and uses a special [[whistle]] at the stern of the ship to call the criminal [[shark]] named Mr. Ice and use him for causing destruction.  Conners and Ronny introduce themselves to Elizabeth and offer to help her. Listening to their advice, Elizabeth tells her father she doesn't want to marry Maltravers. He listens to his daughter and tells her that he will never force her to do something she doesn't want to do. Meanwhile, Smiley tries to look for Elizabeth to cheer up Juan. After he unsuccessfully tries to find her in the ship's [[ballroom]], he meets Conners and Ronny, who agree to help arrange a meeting and dance for Elizabeth and Juan. The meeting goes according to schedule and Elizabeth and Juan dance together before sharing their first kiss and first conversation.   Elizabeth tells her father that she wants to marry Juan, and he agrees, but Elizabeth's stepmother is furious. Following an argument with Elizabeth, she storms off in anger. Elizabeth's stepmother and Maltravers decide to resort to drastic measures, as it is clear that Elizabeth will not marry him. They decide to sink the ''Titanic'' using the help of Mr. Ice and his gang of criminal sharks. Maltravers prepares to send news to his whaling ships by [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], and the mice decide to chew apart the wires to stop it from being sent.   Ice and his gang of sharks decide to let an [[iceberg]] sink the ''Titanic''. They fool an [[octopus]] named Tentacles into heaving an iceberg to the surface of the ocean by concealing the plan in the form of a bet to see who can throw ice the farthest. Onboard the ''Titanic'', the Duke is forced to sign the whaling concession at [[Coercion#Physical|gunpoint]], after which Maltravers and his entourage flee the ship in a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]].   The crew of the ''Titanic'' then see the iceberg and attempt to avoid it, but the ''Titanic'' hits the berg despite their efforts. The ship quickly begins to sink. The mice realize that because they have cut the telegraph wires, the ship can't send out a distress signal. They enlist the help of another mouse friend of theirs, named Camembert, to help repair the wires. They are unable to do so, so Camembert has them tie up the ends of the cut wire to his [[moustache]]. They do so, but Camembert is electrocuted as the [[SOS]] is signalled out.  Elizabeth and Juan manage to save her father, who is still tied up in a chair by Maltravers, and manage to put him on a lifeboat. Suddenly, several [[whales]] and [[dolphins]] arrive to help with the rescue. Elizabeth, Juan, Conners, Ronny, and Smiley jump off the now-perpendicular stern and jump into the water, and they are saved by a whale as well. Once everyone on the ship has been saved, the ''Titanic'' finally sinks, taking Tentacles with it and seemingly killing him, as he was still heroically holding it together. In the morning, the passengers are taken aboard the ''[[RMS Carpathia]]''. Conners mournfully remembers the heroes of the disaster; Camembert and Tentacles.   The ''Carpathia'' arrives in New York and disembarks the passengers. Elizabeth and Juan are married, as are Conners and Stella. It is revealed that Tentacles and Camembert have both somehow survived and are well. Everyone is elated and celebrates at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], congratulating Tentacles for saving everyone in the disaster.  The film ends with old Conners and Stella back in modern-day New York and Conners telling his grandchildren that whales are still hunted. Stella says: "Your grandfather loves to tell stories, but like all sailors, you shouldn't take him too seriously."

Life (1999 film)
 Elderly inmate Willie Long ([[Obba Babatundé]]) attends the burial of two friends who recently perished in an infirmary fire in a Mississippi prison. He begins telling the two young inmates digging the graves his friends' life story.  Ray Gibson ([[Eddie Murphy]]) and Claude Banks ([[Martin Lawrence]]) are two New Yorkers in 1932 from two different worlds. Ray is a small-time [[charlatan|hustler]] and petty thief, and Claude, an honest, yet often selfish minded man, has just been accepted for a job as a bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. They are both at a club called Spanky's when Ray picks Claude as his mark to pick-pocket. They both end up in the bad graces of the club's owner Spanky ([[Rick James]]), and Ray arranges for himself and Claude to do some [[Smuggling|boot-legging]] to pay off their debt, heading down south in order to buy a carload of [[Mississippi]] 'hooch'. Before they can get back to New York, a man named Winston Hancock ([[Clarence Williams III]]), who swindled Ray in a card game, is murdered outside of a [[juke joint]] by the town's sheriff, Warren Pike ([[Ned Vaughn]]), who frames Ray and Claude for the murder. A short time later, they go to trial, are convicted, and sentenced to life.  Ray and Claude are sent to an infamous [[prison|prison camp]] called 'Camp 8' (now [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]]) to perform hard labor. They spend the next 65 years trying to escape from prison, while making new friends - Biscuit ([[Miguel A. Núñez Jr.]]), Jangle Leg ([[Bernie Mac]]), Radio ([[Guy Torry]]), Goldmouth ([[Michael Taliferro]]), Cookie ([[Anthony Anderson]]) and Pokerface ([[Barry Shabaka Henley]]) - and dodging guards Sergeant Dillard ([[Nick Cassavetes]]) and Hoppin' Bob ([[Brent Jennings]]) as their own friendship grows. Claude has his attorney cousin, Melvin, appeal against his conviction with his girlfriend Daisy's help, but it is denied, and shortly afterwards he finds out that Daisy has left him for Melvin. With any chance of being freed gone, Claude attempts to escape one night with Ray, getting as far as [[Tallahatchie County, Mississippi|Tallahatchie]] before being captured and sentenced to a week in [[solitary confinement]].  Around 1944, 12 years later, aged 37 years old, they meet a [[Muteness|mute]] inmate nicknamed 'Can't-Get-Right' ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]), a talented [[baseball]] player and likely was the one to impregnate the Superintendent's daughter when he discovered the baby is biracial. He catches the eye of a [[Negro League Baseball|Negro League]] scout who states that he can get him out of prison if he will play baseball. Ray and Claude, seeing an opportunity to freedom, try to convince the scout to help let them out as well, as they relate to 'Can't-Get-Right' and get him to play best. During a dance social, Biscuit confides to Ray that he is going to be released; however, Biscuit is afraid to return to his family, being gay, and committs suicide by deliberately running across the "firing line", getting shot and killed by the guard. After 'Can't-Get-Right' is released to play for the [[Pittsburgh Crawfords]], Ray devises an escape but Claude refuses, upset with the fact that 'Can't-Get-Right' was released without them, leading to an argument that results in Ray and Claude going their separate ways.  Twenty-eight years later, in 1972, Ray and Claude are now elderly, aged 65 years old.  All of the duo's friends are gone either by death or release from prison, except for Willie, now confined to a wheelchair. Dillard still runs the camp, who one day informs Ray and Claude that they will be transferred to live and work at Superintendent Dexter Wilkins' ([[Ned Beatty]]) mansion. Claude forms a friendship with Wilkins, and is entrusted to drive and pick up the new superintendent, Sheriff Warren Pike ([[R. Lee Ermey]]), the man who framed them forty years earlier. While on a pheasant hunt, Ray confronts Pike, where the sheriff admits to framing him and Claude with no remorse saying that "The state of Mississippi got forty years of cheap labor out of the deal." As Claude struggles to stop Ray from taking revenge, Pike attempts to kill them both, but he is shot and killed by Wilkins, realizing that Ray and Claude are indeed innocent, covering it up as a hunting accident. He intends to give them a [[pardon]], but dies of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] before he can do so.  In 1997 (present day), Ray and Claude are now very elderly, aged 90 years, living in the prison's infirmary. Claude tells Ray of yet another plan he has devised, but Ray has accepted his fate of dying in prison. That night, the infirmary catches fire, and they seemingly perish in the flames. Willie concludes the tale by outlining Claude’s plan: Ray and Claude would steal two bodies from the morgue, start the blaze, plant the bodies, hide in the fire trucks and depart with them in the morning. When the workers ask why the plan didn't work, Willie tells them that he "never said it didn't work", as the inmates begin to realize that the bodies they buried are not Ray and Claude, who have escaped back to New York, watching a [[New York Yankees]] [[baseball]] game. The film concludes by revealing the two are again on good terms, living together in [[Harlem]].  
Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod
 In the present day, German industrialist Hans Wieck returns to [[Budapest]] with his family on the occasion of his 80th birthday having been stationed there during World War II. During dinner at his favorite restaurant, Szabó's, Hans regales his family and friends with stories of his many visits to the restaurant before and during the war. As he relishes his favorite dish, "Beef Rolls," he suddenly collapses with the song "Gloomy Sunday" being played, at his request, by two musicians. As he dies he sees a portrait of a beautiful woman taken many years before. The film then flashes back to [[Budapest]] during the late 1930s.  Restaurant owner László Szabó (a Jew by birth) and his beautiful lover and waitress, Ilona (the woman in the photograph) hire a young pianist, András, to play in their restaurant. András falls in love with Ilona and she with him, though she continues to sleep with László. András is inspired to write the song "Gloomy Sunday" for Ilona's birthday, the same night that a young Hans (who also shares the same birthday) takes the picture of her and asks her to marry him, though she refuses him. Later that night Hans tries to commit suicide by jumping into the Danube, but László saves him and Hans returns to Germany. The resulting song "Gloomy Sunday" is recorded and though very popular at first soon becomes feared by the public for its melancholy melody which seems to trigger a series of [[suicide]]s. András comes to regret writing the song and nearly attempts to kill himself but is stopped by Ilona and László before he can take a small vial of poison. András, László and Ilona form a tenuous relationship. It has its problems, as articulated by László to Ilona during an argument he is having with András in front of her: ''"Easy for you, you've got all you need. You have two men, and each of us only half a woman."''  During [[Operation Panzerfaust]], the Nazis invade Hungary and Hans returns as an SS officer responsible for organizing the deportation of Budapest's Jews to the [[death camps]]. Secretly, he saves the wealthiest Jews and smuggles them out of [[Occupied Europe]] in exchange for substantial bribes, including both goods and money. One night at the restaurant Hans brings a fellow SS officer to Szabó's and insists that András play his fateful composition. András refuses, but is compelled to do so when Ilona begins to sing the words to the song, something she has told him she would never do unless they were alone. When the song is over András kills himself by grabbing Hans's pistol and shooting himself in the head.  After they bury András, László and Ilona pledge their love to each other and László puts the restaurant in her name to keep it from being confiscated by the Nazis. At Ilona's request Hans promises to protect László from being rounded up for "special treatment". However, shortly before the [[Battle of Budapest]], László is rounded up and sent to the railway station to be sent to the [[death camps]]. Ilona hurries to Hans' headquarters to ask him to intervene, which he promises to do, making it clear that she must first sleep with him. A tearful Ilona submits, but Hans later reneges on the bargain, passing László by at the station and saving another Jew whose family had already paid him off. The flashback ends with the revelation of Ilona's pregnancy as she "speaks" to András at his grave, leaving the audience unsure as to who is the child's father.  In the present, media reporters are paying tribute to the deceased Hans, as he is being put into his casket and driven away in a hearse. Ironically, Hans Wieck is now remembered not only as a wealthy industrialist but also as a [[Righteous Among the Nations]] who saved "a thousand Hungarian Jews" during the war. In the closing scene of the film, the middle-age waiter at Szabó's pours two glasses of champagne and returns to the kitchen, where his elderly mother (Ilona) is washing out András' now empty bottle of poison. Her son congratulates her on her birthday and the two embrace as the song "Gloomy Sunday" playing in the background.

The next day, Jasmine awakes still looking youthful. She joyfully urges Peter to go out and experience life with her. Charlie offers to stay behind to continue the lab work. Later, Charlie notices that the rabbit injected with the governing agent has died.  While Peter and Jasmine are at a conservatory, Peter notices a streak of white in her hair, and decides that they should return to the lab.  Meanwhile, Charlie is confronted by Max and Ed.

Meanwhile, Charlie reveals that Jasmine is Mark and Tina's child, and mentions the video footage used to track her development. Ed doesn't believe Charlie, but Max departs to find the footage.  Peter and Jasmine arrive at a lab that he previously shared with Leo, so that he can gather materials for a functional governing agent. Jasmine looks in a mirror, shocked by her older-looking face. As Peter unsuccessfully attempts to open a cabinet containing a governing agent, Leo enters, alerted by a security alarm. He insists that the governing agent doesn't work. As Peter pleads with him, the police arrive, looking for Peter. Peter shoves Leo and escapes with Jasmine through a back exit; he tells Jasmine to wait for him at the conservatory while he retrieves the governing agent, but he is caught and arrested.  While being interrogated by Ed, Peter attempts to escape from the police station, but is stopped by Max, who demands the truth. Carla confesses that she went along with Leo's orders to conduct the AccelRate experiment, so that they could make millions. Ed reluctantly releases Peter and Leo is arrested.  By the time Peter reaches the conservatory, Jasmine is elderly. They accept that it's too late to save her, and she dies in Peter's embrace.  Later, Charlie is packing Peter's possessions into storage, as he has decided to get away from Concord. The final scene shows Peter leaving the campus, holding a [[jasmine]] branch in memory of the woman he loved.

The two become close and eventually begin a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Joe gets the chance to return to fishing when Frankie and Lou ask him to work a fishing boat which they have acquired as collateral from local fisherman Harmon. Donna has a strained relationship with her daughter Noelle, due mainly to Noelle's disapproval of her mother's lifestyle. This is exacerbated when Donna begins dating Joe, who Noelle had a crush on. Donna overhears the story of why Joe quit fishing: he had been involved in a deadly sinking which claimed the lives of all of his boatmates, including the brother of local bush pilot and small-time criminal "Smilin Jack" Johannson.  When Joe's dissolute half-brother Bobby shows up, he asks Joe to help crew his boat to pick up a client. Joe brings along Donna and Noelle. They dock for the night in an isolated bay and Bobby reveals the truth: he is involved in marijuana smuggling and had dumped a load overboard when he was spooked by the police. Now they are going to meet Bobby's partners to settle his debt. That night, men sneak onto the boat and kill Bobby. Joe, Donna, and Noelle flee to a nearby island where the men begin to hunt them.

Joe, who does not trust Jack, sees the radio was removed, and remains unsure of whether the seaplane return will bring rescue or the men who killed his brother. A stressful few days of rain prevent any flights' return. One morning Joe, Donna, and Noelle gather on the beach as a seaplane flies towards them, larger than the one belonging to Jack.

Templeton ([[Fredro Starr]]), rebellious pregnant Lynn Sabatini ([[Sara Gilbert]]), and Robert Tremont a.k.a. "Rivers" ([[Clifton Collins, Jr.]]), attend the history class of Ken Knowles ([[Judd Nelson]]). Police officer Dante Jackson ([[Forest Whitaker]]) tries to arrest Lester after a misunderstanding when the classroom's windows are broken by rocks, Mr. Knowles takes them to the [[Principal (school)|principal]]'s office, where Principal Allen Armstrong ([[Glynn Turman]]) tells Knowles to take them "anywhere".  Since there is no space anywhere in the school, Knowles and the kids go to a local diner, where a [[robbery]] takes place. Knowles confronts the robber, who was a former student that dropped out of school. Principal Armstrong is infuriated by what Knowles has done, and puts him on administrative leave. Lester, Stephanie and Ziggy are at the main office as Knowles leaves the school. Stephanie is disgusted that Principal Armstrong has ignored that he told Knowles to "take the class anywhere" and confronts him about this. In response Principal Armstrong suspends Rivers, Ziggy, Stephanie and Lester from the school and calls in Officer Jackson to remove all of them.

Lester tries to resist Officer Jackson and loses, but Ziggy picks up Officer Jackson's dropped [[Glock pistol|Glock 19]] pistol and says "I [Ziggy] cannot go home." The reason for this, is because Ziggy has been physically abused by his father for many years. Officer Jackson tries to restrain Ziggy but gets accidentally shot in the leg as he grabs for his gun.

Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night; she says yes.  Jimmy hosts a long-running quiz show called ''What Do Kids Know?'' and is dying of cancer; he has only a few months to live. That night the newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on air, Stanley refuses to return for the final round.  Donnie Smith, a former ''What Do Kids Know?'' champion, watches the show from a bar.

Suddenly, the girls are interrupted by Pepito who was playing his violin from next-door, he promises Madeline ([[Andrea Libman]]) that he'll stop playing until Miss Clavel feels better again. That night as they're getting ready for bed, the children begin to reminisce about the good times that they've had with each of their families back at home especially the times when they have been sick as well. Madeline also tells her friends about the good times that she's had with her own family; she also shows them a special gold necklace with animal printings on them that her mother had given her, unfortunately since both of parents died many years ago she has no other family members to return to. Saddened by Madeline's story, the girls begin to feel sorry for her and they start crying but are soon comforted by Miss Clavel, who was awoken by the commotion. She reminds each of the girls that they all love and look out for each other, and that they are all are just as much a family as anybody else, bringing peace of mind to all of the girls.   One day, Madeline receives a mysterious letter in the mail from her long-lost Uncle Horst ([[Jason Alexander]]) from [[Vienna]], who is planning on a visit. He arrives at the school later that week where is invited to have dinner with the girls including Lord Cucuface and Pepito's family, he then announces that he has been designated Madeline's new [[legal guardian]] (shows the court papers to Miss Clavel, her teacher). Horst plans on taking her to his hometown Vienna, to attend a fine [[finishing school]], and plan on leaving the following day via the Orient Express. Madeline and her classmates react with shock, elation, and sadness. The children, wanting to prove that their school is just as good, puts on a musical to display their talents to Uncle Horst; however this does not impress him enough and he decides to take Madeline with him the next day.  That morning when Uncle Horst leaves with his niece the next morning, he takes Madeline on the [[Paris Métro]], instead of the Orient Express, to an unfamiliar part of the town that ravaged with poverty and crime. Realizing that she is being kidnapped, Madeline throws beads of her mother's treasured necklace to make a trail to where she is taken to, however she keeps one of the beads which has a lion on it as a memento. It is then revealed that Uncle Horst is not Madeline's uncle nor is he related to her, but a Frenchman and a failed actor named Henri (who can only do accents), who works for Madame LaCroque ([[Lauren Bacall]]), the owner of a lace shop/factory. Henri takes Madeline to the lace shop's basement, which is full of kidnapped orphan girls who are [[Child labor|forced into slave labor]] to making laces to sell. One of the girls, Fifi, befriends Madeline. It is then revealed that Madeline's court custody papers were forged by Madame LaCroque, and that the criminal duo plan to steal her family inheritance as she works in the factory.  Shortly after Madeline left, Miss Clavel, the girls, and Pepito tried to stop her and Horst so that Pepito could give her his Halloween parting gift: a [[shrunken head]] from [[Brazil]]. They arrive at the train station, only to learn that the two had taken the Métro, not the Orient Express. They also find Genevieve abandoned at the station. Fearing the worst, Miss Clavel enlists the police to help them rescue Madeline.  At the lace shop, the child workers endure enormous amounts of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of LaCroque; especially when Fifi accidentally causes her coughing to turn one of the laces yellow. As a result, LaCroque forbids Fifi from using white lace and instead allows her to make only black lace in the dark, which could potentially render her blind as explained by one of the girls whose grandmother lost her sight that way; Madeline defends Fifi and the other children in the process by explaining that Fifi is sick and that they each need more food and respect, however this gets her into more trouble. As punishment for talking back, LaCroque throws Madeline into a prison cell where she shown singing a song about love along with the other orphans. After breaking off a loose brick, Madeline tells Fifi and the children that they should escape from the factory; however Fifi said that she tried once but was caught in the process, and as a result LaCroque cut off her hair to make lace. She's then asked by Madeline why LaCroque is "so horrible", she explains through a flashback sequence of how LaCroque was once a famous cabaret dancer who experienced a performance disaster, by accidentally ripping her dress. In total humiliation, she stopped performing all together and sold all of her long blond hair to make lace. She and Henri then gained legal custody of all of the orphan girls. Rather than taking care of them (as they promised to the courts), they treat them as their miserable slaves.  Through following the trail of Madeline's necklace beads, Madeline's classmates along with Pepito and Genevieve find their way to the factory; back at the lace store, a customer tells LaCroque she wants red lace, which gives her the idea to cut Madeline's hair. Madeline tells her new friends that when an escape plan fails and that they may be small, but can follow as one. LaCroque interrupts their escape attempt and cuts off a few locks of Madeline's hair and prepares to torture her and the other orphans by deciding to give all of them haircuts. Back at the factory, Pepito uses his shrunken skull head to knock off LaCroque's wig from outside the window (revealing her bald head), and then frighten her to the ground. Meanwhile, Miss Clavel and the police catch Henri walking through the streets of Paris, planning to sell-off Madeline's belongings. Through a plea bargain deal, Henri agrees to lead them to the lace factory, in exchange for a lighter punishment. Madeline and all of her friends are able to tie up LaCroque in endless rolls of lace just as the police arrive with Henri and Miss Clavel. Henri makes one last attempt to escape, only to be tripped by Pepito's spool trick, allowing the girls to tangle him up as well. After the children celebrate their victory, the criminal duo are arrested and taken away by the police to be sent to prison and charged for their crimes; the girls give Madeline her mother's beads that they had found earlier. The factory girls, however, still have no family or a place to call home. During bedtime, Madeline's friends talk about what they would do with the reward money that they had received for LaCroque and Henri's capture. Danielle would go shopping for fashion, clothes and jewelry, Chloe would travel to exotic countries around the world, and Nicole would own a zoo "with all of her favorite animals". However Madeline has a better idea.  A while later Madeline-(who wearing her mother's now repaired necklace) uses the money to open up a special school for the orphans; she also reunites with Fifi who now has long hair and is completely healthy and fully recovered thanks to Dr. Cohn who had given her treatment. The girls from both sister schools rejoice in the fact that they are all one whole family. The film ends with Madeline smiling and winking at the audience.

Seamus introduces Jack to his wife Mary ([[Zoë Wanamaker]]) and his son, Mickey ([[Daniel Betts]]), and shows him the mystical world of the leprechauns.  The "solitary fairies" (which includes leprechauns) love to play tricks on others, especially on the snobbish "trooping" [[fairy|fairies]]. The leprechauns and the trooping fairies have been enemies for ages, but the Grand [[Banshee]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) has decreed that they must stop fighting each other. Jack gets used to the little people he shares the house with, because they help him to get to know Kathleen.  Jack offers to drive Kathleen's cart for her in a beach race because she's not allowed to on account of her gender. He wins and convinces Kathleen to take him on a tour of the local environs. While on their walk together, they kiss.  Meanwhile, Mickey, along with his friends Sean Devine ([[Tony Curran]]) and the brothers Jericho ([[Kevin McKidd]]) and Barney O'Grady ([[Kieran Culkin]]) sneak into a masked party in the flying castle of the trooping fairies. There Mickey sees the fairy-princess, Jessica ([[Caroline Carver (actress)|Caroline Carver]]), the daughter of the fairy-king Boric ([[Roger Daltrey]]) and queen Morag ([[Harriet Walter]]). Jessica eventually finds out that Mickey is a leprechaun, but they have already fallen in love. Jessica's hot-headed cousin, Count Grogan ([[Jonathan Firth]]), discovers their presence, and the leprechauns flee.  Later Count Grogan seeks out Mickey and attempts to fight with him, but Mickey declines. Sean steps in and battles Count Grogan, eventually losing. The Grand Banshee appears and takes Sean's life as punishment for breaking her decree. Mickey attacks Count Grogan, killing him, too. After Jessica's parents learn that Mickey has killed Count Grogan, they send her with her [[governess]], Lady Margaret ([[Phyllida Law]]), to a hidden underwater-castle. Mickey eventually finds her, rescues her, and flies with her to his uncle Sir Aloysius Jantee ([[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]]), the butter-fairy. Jessica's parents think Mickey kidnapped her and they start a war with the leprechauns. The Grand Banshee continues to take their lives.  Jack and Kathleen have a problem too, because she finds out that he is in Ireland to buy up homes in Carrick for his company to build a holiday-park. Jack does not want to do that any more (and loses his job because of it), but Kathleen does not believe a word he says.  In the human-world nature starts to collapse: in the summer it starts snowing and there is torrential rain. This happens because the fairies aren't taking care of nature any more because of the war. Jack and Kathleen decide to help Jessica and Mickey to seek out the Grand Banshee and ask her to help them end the war. The Grand Banshee reveals to them that Nature is dying because of the war and if it doesn't stop, soon, everything will be destroyed. She also says she cannot stop the leprechauns and trooping fairies from doing what they really wanted to do.  As the war escalates, Mickey and Jessica decide to do something radical: they obtain a [[poison]] from the butter-fairies and threaten to take it if their parents won't stop the war. Their parents took them seriously but were unable to make peace, so they take the poison. Their bodies are brought before their parents who immediately become distraught. Jack convinces the warring parties to make peace. Both Muldoon and Boric agree. Kathleen immediately rushes to give an [[antidote]] to the lovers but an attack-tunnel dug by general Bulstrode ([[Frank Finlay]]) collapses. Kathleen brakes her carriage to avoid the pit. The [[vial]] with the antidote flies from her hands and breaks. Jack runs to help and falls into the pit, knocking himself out. Kathleen panics until she learns that he's alright. The Grand Banshee says she can still save them, but only if ''everyone'' agrees to peace. Eventually they all do. The Grand Banshee then brings back not only Jessica and Mickey, but all of the lost leprechauns and fairies (with the exception of Count Grogan who the Great Banshee decides to keep so there wouldn't be trouble caused because of him). In the end Mickey and Jessica marry, Jack and Kathleen are reconciled, and the long-lasting war is finally over.  
A Man Called Hero
 The story begins in early [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican China]]. After passing a test, Hero Hua is accepted by Pride, a master swordsman, as his second apprentice. When he returns home, he is horrified to see that his parents have been murdered by foreigners for opposing the [[opium]] trade. That night, Hero breaks up the foreigners' party and kills them in revenge. He spends the rest of the night with his lover, Jade. The next morning, he flees from China to avoid arrest and sails to America.  16 years later, Hero's childhood friend, Sheng, and Hero's son, Sword Hua, arrive in [[New York City]] on the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]]. They visit China House, the biggest inn in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], where they see a [[lion dance]] performance led by the Boss of China House. A group of thugs show up and demand that the Boss hand over a monk, Luohan, whom they believe is hiding in China House. After defeating and driving away the thugs, the Boss brings Sword and Sheng to meet Luohan. Luohan tells them how he met and befriended Hero on board the ship bound for America, and their experiences as labourers in Steel Bull Canyon. Later, Sword and Sheng visit Jade's grave, where Sheng tells Sword how he and Jade travelled to New York City 16 years ago in search of Hero. Hero and Jade were reunited and married in New York City. While visiting the shop where Sword's parents took their wedding photographs, Sword and Sheng sense someone following them. Sword surprises the stalker and corners her after a brief chase through the streets. She identifies herself as Kate, the daughter of Hero's senior, Shadow.  Kate leads Sword and Sheng to her father. Shadow tells them how he rescued Hero from Steel Bull Canyon when Hero was buried in the sand after being falsely accused of murdering two men. Hero and Shadow encountered the Five Elements Ninjas and defeated them. During the fight, Hero injured the female ninja, Wood, but spared her life and sent her for medical treatment. When Wood develops a crush on Hero, the Gold Ninja, who is secretly in love with Wood, becomes very jealous. Jade had just given birth to a pair of twins in China House when the Gold Ninja set fire to the building. During the chaos, Bigot, a traitor, kidnapped Sword's twin sister and disappeared. There have been no news of her since then. Jade died in Hero's arms shortly after due to excessive blood loss during childbirth.  Shadow continues narrating the story. After Jade's death, Hero met a fortune teller, who told him he was born under the Star of Death and is destined to lead a life of loneliness because misfortune will befall those who are close to him. Hero entrusted his baby son, Sword, to Sheng before leaving with Shadow to meet their master, Pride. In Japan, they witnessed a duel between Pride and his rival, Invincible. Pride defeated Invincible but sustained internal injuries and died not long after the duel. Before his death, Pride passed Hero the martial arts manual ''China Secret'' and transferred all his [[Neigong|inner energy]] to him.  Back in the present at China House, the Boss, Sword, Sheng, Luohan and others come up with a plan to liberate the labourers at Steel Bull Canyon. They disguise themselves as a [[Chinese opera]] troupe, infiltrate the canyon, and catch the supervisors off guard in a surprise attack. Luohan sacrifices himself in a [[suicide attack]] to stop the supervisors from throwing explosives at the escaping labourers. Sword corners Bigot and demands the whereabouts of his twin sister, but Bigot suddenly pulls out a pistol and shoots him. Bigot is about to kill Sword when Hero shows up and finishes him off. Hero uses his inner energy to create an explosion and prevent a group of horsemen from advancing further. They return to China House in triumph.  Sword is happy to see his father in person for the first time after hearing the stories about him. However, Hero appears cold towards his son and constantly keeps a distance away because he strongly believes the fortune teller's words that he will lose his loved ones if he gets close to them. Hero also meets Wood, who has maintained her crush on him for the past 16 years, but he refuses to accept her. She warns Hero that her master, Invincible, has arrived in New York City. Since Pride is dead, Invincible turns on Hero, Pride's successor, to finish the duel. The next morning, Invincible shows up at China House and fights with the Boss and Sword until Hero appears and stops him. Hero and Invincible then duel on top of the [[Statue of Liberty]]. In the meantime, Black Dragon Commander leads his men to attack China House but are eventually forced to leave by the police. At the Statue of Liberty, Hero eventually defeats and destroys Invincible. Before the movie ends, Sword and Sheng prepare to leave America while Hero watches them from a distance and walks away in the opposite direction.

Man on the Moon (film)
 Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his peculiar "foreign man" puts on a [[rhinestone]] jacket and does a dead-on [[Elvis impersonation]]. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.  He catches the eye of talent agent [[George Shapiro]], who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named [[Latka Gravas]]. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit.  Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, [[Tony Clifton]], whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on ''Taxi''. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a "villain character" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, [[Bob Zmuda]]. Once again, the gag is on the audience.  Kaufman's fame increases with his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' appearances, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When he travels to college campuses, audiences dislike his strange sense of humor and demand that he perform as Latka, so he deliberately antagonizes them by reading ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the ''Taxi'' set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience "short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire."  Kaufman decides to become a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] — but to emphasize the "villain" angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion." He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies, and they begin a romantic relationship.  Problems arise when an appearance on a live TV comedy show, ABC's ''Fridays'', turns into a fiasco when Kaufman refuses to speak his lines. Also Kaufman feuds publicly with [[Jerry Lawler]], a male professional wrestler, who challenges him to a "real wrestling match", which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and seriously injures Kaufman, resulting in the comedian wearing a neck brace. Lawler and an injured Kaufman appear on NBC's ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ostensibly to call a truce, but Lawler insults Kaufman, who throws coffee at the wrestler and spews a vicious tirade of epithets. It is later revealed that Kaufman and Lawler were in fact good friends and staged the entire feud, but Kaufman pays a price when he is banned from ''Saturday Night Live'' by a vote of audience members, weary of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler not to work together again, and later calls Kaufman to inform him that ''Taxi'' has been canceled.  After a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of [[lung cancer]] and may die soon. They aren't sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic [[practical joke|prank]]. With little time to live, Kaufman gets a booking at [[Carnegie Hall]], his dream venue. The performance is a memorable success, culminating with Kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. His health deteriorates. Desperate, he heads to the [[Philippines]] to seek a medical miracle through [[psychic surgery]] only to find it a hoax, laughing at the irony. He dies soon after. At his funeral, friends and loved ones sing along to "[[This Friendly World]]" with a video of Kaufman.  One year later, in 1985, Clifton appears at Kaufman's tribute at [[The Comedy Store]]'s main stage, performing "[[I Will Survive]]". The camera pans over the crowd and reveals Zmuda in the audience.

Mary, Mother of Jesus (film)
 The film emphasizes Mary's importance in Jesus's life, suggesting that his parables were inspired by stories she told him in his childhood. This, and similar details about Jesus's upbringing, cannot be confirmed, but are certainly not impossible. The resurrected Jesus also appears to his mother privately. This event is not found in the Gospels, but is probably based on an ancient Catholic tradition (not official teaching) that he appeared to her first of all people. The tradition influenced [[Ignatius of Loyola]]'s ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]'' among others. The film closes with Mary suggesting the disciples should start preaching about her son.

Once at Mansfield Park, Fanny meets her cousins Tom, [[Maria Bertram|Maria]], [[Edmund Bertram|Edmund]], and Julia, as well as Fanny's other maternal aunt, Mrs Norris. Fanny does not feel welcome, and Norris treats her more like a servant than a relative. Edmund behaves kindly to her, and the two develop a friendship that grows as the years progress.  When Fanny is eighteen, Sir Thomas and his eldest son Tom travel to [[Antigua]]. In their absence, the Bertram family is disrupted by the arrival of [[Henry Crawford|Henry]] and [[Mary Crawford (Mansfield Park)|Mary Crawford]], relatives of the local clergyman. Worldly, cynical and beautiful, Mary and Henry arrive looking for amusement. Edmund is instantly smitten with Mary, somewhat ignoring and hurting Fanny. Maria and Julia both vie for Henry's affections, even though Maria is already engaged to Mr Rushworth. Henry shamelessly flirts with Maria. Later, Tom returns from Antigua, arriving drunk and bringing a friend, Mr Yates, with him. Yates and Tom convince the Bertrams and Crawfords to stage a risque play, ''[[Lovers' Vows]]''. The play allows the young people to openly flirt with each other. Edmund initially speaks out against the play but changes his mind when he is offered a part that allows him to act out flirtatious scenes with Mary. Sir Thomas arrives home and in anger immediately stops the play.  Maria marries Rushworth, esteeming his fortune above his character. Henry decides to pursue Fanny as a means to amuse himself. However, Fanny's gentle and kind nature gradually captures his fancy, and Henry becomes emotionally attached to her. After his behaviour towards the Bertram girls, Fanny distrusts him and does not believe his declarations of love. Even so, Henry proposes and Fanny is pressured by her uncle to accept the offer; she disappoints the family by refusing. Angry, Sir Thomas gives Fanny an ultimatum: accept Henry's proposal of marriage or be sent back to her poor family and experience the difference in comfort. Fanny looks to Edmund for support, but his indifference forces her to choose the latter. Several days after her return home, Henry pays a visit to convince Fanny that his affections for her are genuine. Although she looks more favourably on him, Fanny continues to cling to her feelings for Edmund and rejects Henry. Only when a letter from Edmund arrives which discloses his hopes of marrying Mary does Fanny accept Henry's offer. However, Fanny realizes she does not trust him, and takes back her acceptance the next day. Henry leaves, exceedingly hurt and angry. Edmund arrives to take Fanny back to Mansfield Park to help care for Tom, who has fallen seriously ill and is near death. Edmund confesses he has missed Fanny.   Henry gains Maria's pity when she learns of Fanny's refusal of his marriage proposal, and they are found having sex by Fanny and Edmund. Shocked, Fanny is comforted by Edmund and the two nearly kiss, but Fanny pulls away. News of the scandal spreads rapidly and Mary quickly devises a plan to stifle the repercussions. She suggests that after a divorce, Maria would marry Henry while Edmund would marry Mary; together they might re-introduce Henry and Maria back into society by throwing parties. Fanny questions Mary as to how a clergyman could afford lavish parties, and Mary shocks everyone by stating that when Tom dies, Edmund will be heir to the family's fortune. Edmund is appalled and tells Mary that cheerfully condemning Tom to death whilst she plans to spend his money sends a chill to his heart. Having betrayed her true nature to the Bertram family, Mary leaves the Bertrams' company. Edmund ultimately declares his love for Fanny, and they marry. Sir Thomas gives up his plantation in Antigua and invests instead in tobacco, while Tom recovers from his illness. Fanny's sister Susie joins them at the Bertram household while Maria and Aunt Norris take up residence in a small cottage removed from Mansfield Park.

The Matrix
  A woman is cornered by police in an abandoned hotel; after overpowering them with superhuman abilities, a group of sinister superhuman grey green-suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] leads the police in a rooftop pursuit. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.  [[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, living a [[Alter ego|double life]] as the [[Security hacker|hacker]] "[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase "the Matrix". The woman, [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]], contacts him, saying that a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by [[Agent Smith]], apprehend Neo and attempt to threaten him into helping them capture the "[[terrorism|terrorist]]" Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a [[red pill and blue pill|red pill]] that will show him the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his former life. After swallowing the red pill, his reality disintegrates and Neo awakens, naked, weak and hairless, in a liquid-filled pod, one of countless others connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.  As Neo recuperates, Morpheus explains the truth: in the 21st century, [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]] [[AI takeover|waged war against their human creators]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines retaliated by harvesting the humans' [[Bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power. The Matrix is a shared [[simulated reality|simulation]] of the world, in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified. All free humans live in [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], the last refuge in the real world. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to "unplug" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the simulated reality enables them to bend its [[physical law]]s, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents are powerful sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credence to Morpheus' belief that Neo is "the One", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humans and end the war.  The group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], a prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns Neo that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police alerted by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a crew member who betrayed Morpheus to Smith in exchange for a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so Neo and the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. As he prepares to disconnect Neo and Trinity, [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had left for dead, kills him.  In the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, believing that he is not the One, resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar''. Trinity whispers to Neo that he can't be dead because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix just as the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon disables the attacking Sentinels.  Later, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners "a world where anything is possible". He hangs up and flies into the sky.

During that occasion, the trio were called upon for an operation to arrest drug dealers. A gunfight and chase ensues and two of the suspects were apprehended.

Hiu-tai also promises to leave Hong Kong and will only return after Guy retires.  The next day, Guy was arrested by the Internal Affairs for assaulting Wah and helping Hiu-tai escape. When Hiu-tai was about to leave Hong Kong, he hears about Guy's arrest on the news, he gives a call to Wah, accusing Wah of pushing a cop to hell since Guy would either be killed or commit suicide if he will be imprisoned.

In much the same manner as an [[imaginary friend]] acts, 'The Big Guy' never responds until he finally becomes fed up with Citizen 43275-B and declares that he does not like being called 'The Big Guy' - but this intervention serves only to worsen Big Brother's predicament, as 43275-B enthusiastically hugs the telescreen and goes on to "amuse" him through a variety of ways: [[sock puppets]], [[Boggle]], [[hide and seek]], one-sided [[pillow fight]]s, and [[knock-knock joke]]s.

The appearance in the opening scenes of a volume entitled "[[Mind Control|RE-EDUCATION]] MANUAL" on 43275-B's bookshelf, references to "[[Brainwashing#In popular culture|re-education lectures]]", and the fact that he has a diary already set aside, all imply that this is not his first attempt, and suggests his behavior was deliberate.

Several years later at [[Chinon]], the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] and soon to be King of France, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] ([[John Malkovich]]), receives a message from the now adult Joan ([[Milla Jovovich]]), asking him to provide an army to lead into battle against the occupying English. After meeting him and his mother-in-law [[Yolande of Aragon]] ([[Faye Dunaway]]) she describes her visions. Desperate, he believes her prophecy.  Clad in armor, Joan leads the French army to the besieged city of [[Orléans]]. She gives the English a chance to surrender, which they refuse. The armies' commanders, skeptical of Joan's leadership, initiate the next morning's battle to take over the stockade at St. Loup without her. By the time she arrives on the battlefield, the French soldiers are retreating. Joan ends the retreat and leads another charge, successfully capturing the fort. They proceed to the enemy stronghold called the "Tourelles". Joan gives the English another chance to surrender, but they refuse. Joan leads the French soldiers to attack the Tourelles, though the English defenders inflict heavy casualties, also severely wounding Joan. Nevertheless, Joan leads a second attack the following day. As the English army regroups, the French army moves to face them across an open field. Joan rides alone toward the English and offers them a final chance to surrender and return to England. The English accept her offer and retreat.  Joan returns to [[Rheims]] to witness the coronation of Charles VII of France. Her military campaigns then continue to the walls of [[Paris]], though she does not receive her requested reinforcements, and the siege is a failure. Joan tells King Charles VII to give her another army, but he refuses, saying he now prefers diplomacy over warfare. Believing she threatens his position and will require expenditure of treasure, Charles conspires to get rid of Joan by allowing her to be captured by enemy forces. [[Siege of Compiègne|She is taken prisoner by the pro-English Burgundians]] at [[Compiègne]], who sell her to the English.  Charged with the crime of [[heresy]], based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an [[ecclesiastical]] court proceeding, which is forced by the English occupation government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught that she will be executed without making a final [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.  The frustrated English devise another way to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting that she is a witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was [[canonization|canonized]] as a saint in the [[20th century]].

Back at Minnie's house, Mickey gives her the chain for her watch and Minnie gives him a case for his harmonica. Of course, the irony is that Minnie no longer has her watch—just as Mickey no longer has his harmonica—so the gifts are essentially useless. As in the classic ''Gift of the Magi'' upon which this adaptation—penned by O. Henry—is based, the thought behind each gift is what counts.<ref></ref> The film concludes with a medley of various carols featuring the main characters from the three segments.  In "The Gift of Magi", one of Mickey's dance moves are very similar to his dance routine in the 1942 theatrical short, "[[Mickey's Birthday Party]]".  
A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999 film)
 In 19th century Monte Athena, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], young lovers Lysander ([[Dominic West]]) and Hermia ([[Anna Friel]]) are forbidden to marry by her father Egeus ([[Bernard Hill]]), who has promised Hermia to Demetrius ([[Christian Bale]]). Lysander and Hermia make plans to flee to the forest to escape the arrangement. Demetrius follows them, having been made aware of the plan by Helena ([[Calista Flockhart]]), a young woman who is desperately in love with him. Once in the forest, they wander into the fairy world, ruled by Oberon ([[Rupert Everett]]) and Titania ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), King and Queen of the fairies. Oberon and his servant sprite Puck ([[Stanley Tucci]]) cause mayhem among the lovers with a magic potion that causes both Lysander and Demetrius to fall in love with Helena, leading to a rift between all four that culminates (famously in this adaptation) in a mud-wrestling scene. Oberon then bewitches Titania with the same potion.  Meanwhile, an acting troupe prepares a play for the entertainment of the Duke. The leader of the actors ([[Roger Rees]]) and the actors, including a weaver named Bottom ([[Kevin Kline]]), and Francis Flute ([[Sam Rockwell]]) take their rehearsal to the forest. The mischievous Puck magically enchants Bottom with the head of an ass and Bottom is then seen by the bewitched Titania. Titania woos Bottom in her bower, attended by fairies. Oberon tires of the sport and puts all to rights, pairing Lysander back with Hermia and Demetrius with Helena, and reconciling with his own queen, Titania.  In the final part, Bottom and his troupe of "[[Mechanical (character)|rude Mechanicals]]" perform their amateur play, based on the tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, before Duke Theseus ([[David Strathairn]]), his wife Hippolyta ([[Sophie Marceau]]), and the court, unintentionally producing a comedy that turns to be a tragedy.

Mister Smile
  Two men and a bear cower in their [[tree house]] home, awaiting the arrival of their newly ordered robot. Meanwhile, a bird drives home to his human wife. That night, he dreams about the childhood moment when he realized that he has fingers instead of wings - a discovery that prompted him to become a salesman. A monkey paces in the waiting room of a nearby hospital, as a chicken is called back to see the doctor. The doctor zaps the chicken with a [[Resizing (fiction)#Shrinking machines|shrinking machine]], and after putting the chicken into a [[syringe]], injects her into the monkey. Around this time, a squirrel and an old man play a game together, within their shared [[apartment complex]]. The squirrel removes the old man's [[dentures]] and hides them from him. The old man then tries to guess where his dentures are.  In the apartment above the bird-human couple, lives Mister Smile, whose head is a yellow [[smiley face]]. Mr. Smile stamps his face onto sheets of paper, causing the features to disappear from his face completely. The features always regenerate though, as he slips the stamped sheets of paper into envelopes. Each group of characters receives one of these envelopes in the mail. They have been invited to visit Mr. Smile, who is presumably a celebrity.  Although the doctor's procedure goes awry, leaving the now normal-sized chicken stuck inside of the monkey's head, all three are delighted to receive their invitation. At the party, Mr. Smile hands out autographs, and the bird explains why he has the words "Love" and "Food" tattooed on his hands. In the bird's estimation, love and food must exist in harmony, for they are the only two things that anyone needs in life. He places the fingers of one of his hands in between the fingers of the other and declares "Flooovde". The end credits inform the audience that the chicken and monkey got married shortly after the end of filming.  
The Minus Man
 Vann Siegert ([[Owen Wilson]]) is a serial killer who poisons his victims; he explains that he feels he is helping them and that they die without pain. After killing a [[heroin]] addict named Casper ([[Sheryl Crow]]) he met at a bar, he makes her death look like an [[drug overdose|overdose]] and moves on to a new town. The next day, he arrives at the home of Doug and Jane Durwin ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] and [[Mercedes Ruehl]]). He rents out the room of their missing daughter. Doug recommends he look for work at the [[post office]], as they are hiring seasonal help for [[Christmas]].  Vann is shown retrieving a kit from under his car. It contains the poison he uses on his victims, which he places in a flask and fills with [[amaretto]].  Doug takes Vann to a high school football game, where he meets Gene ([[Eric Mabius]]), a star athlete, and his family. A few days later, Vann offers the boy a ride and murders him, burying his body on a beach. While he is digging the grave, Vann has an imaginary conversation with two detectives, Blair and Graves ([[Dwight Yoakam]] and [[Dennis Haysbert]]), who stand over him, asking taunting questions about his methods. Throughout the film, Vann has imaginary conversations with the two detectives.   Vann helps the town search for the missing athlete and even attends his [[Funeral|memorial service]]. Vann reveals that killing Gene broke two of his personal rules: don't kill anyone you know, and don't kill anyone from your town.   His ties to the community grow as he is given more responsibility at the post office. One of his co-workers, Ferrin ([[Janeane Garofalo]]), sheepishly pursues him. Doug drives Ferrin to the beach. The pair exchange an awkward hug, directly over the spot where Vann buried the high school football player.  On Christmas Day, Vann goes to a diner and chooses another victim ([[Meg Foster]]). She invites him to her home, where he sees that she is a painter. Something about her work disturbs him and he flees. Vann returns to the diner and slips poison into the water of a man ([[Lew McCreary]]) eating alone. An autopsy reveals that the death was the result of a rare poison derived from tree bark fungus found in the Pacific Northwest. The poison is then linked with the murder of Casper. The young athlete's body is found and also linked to the same poison. Vann knows that the police will eventually tie the murders to him. While looking in the mirror, he pulls hairs off his jacket and puts them in an envelope on which he writes 'FERRiN'.  Jane is found dead from a blow to the back of the head. The police suspect Doug, but Vann is worried that the increased scrutiny from another murder will lead the police to him. During a date with Ferrin, he tries to initiate sex by assaulting her. She is terrified, and Vann leaves.  The next day, the police arrive and arrest Doug for the murder of Jane. Vann packs his things. Before he leaves town, he puts his postal uniform and the envelope marked "FERRiN", containing the sample of his hair, in a mailbox. The film ends as he drives on the highway, saying that he wants to lead a more regular life once he gets to wherever he is going. He is pursued by a cop who had earlier approached him on the beach. After taking a good look with her spotlight, she smiles at him and takes the right fork in the road, while Vann takes the left.  
The Miracle Maker (2000 film)
  === Jesus leaves home and prepares to start His Father's Work === The film opens in ‘[[Tzippori|Sepphoris]], Upper Galilee, Year 90 of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman Occupation]].’ [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|Jairus]] and his sick daughter Tamar are travelling to meet their friend [[Cleopas]], who knows a doctor that may be able to help Tamar. However, the doctor is only able to offer painkillers, confiding to Jairus that there is nothing else which can be done. While Jairus is with the doctor, Tamar witnesses [[Jesus]], one of the carpenters building a new [[synagogue]], protect a deranged woman, [[Mary Magdalene]], from being attacked by the townspeople. Jesus leaves his job, and goes to visit his mother, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]. While he is there, Mary recalls [[Nativity of Jesus|his birth]], the [[Adoration of the Magi|visit of the Wise Men]], and how a young Jesus went missing during [[Passover]] and was [[Finding in the Temple|found conferring with the elders at the Temple]], who were amazed at his understanding of the scriptures. After leaving his mother's house, Jesus travels to the Jordan River to be [[Baptism of Jesus|baptised]] by [[John the Baptist]]. When Jesus rises out of the water, a [[Yahweh|voice]] from [[Heaven]] declares, "This is my beloved son," and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends on him as a dove.  After his baptism, Jesus wanders out into the wilderness, where he is [[Temptation of Christ|repeatedly tempted by Satan]]. After Jesus rebukes Satan temptations and leaves the wilderness, he is met by his friend [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]. Jesus returns to Lazarus' home, where he is hosted by Lazarus’ sisters, [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]].  === Jesus begins his Ministry in Galilee === Jesus begins preaching the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in the fields near [[Capernaum]]. Tamar and her mother Rachel happen to be nearby, and Tamar wishes to stay and listen to Jesus, remembering him from her visit to Sepphoris. Jesus tells the [[Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders]], while many priests listen on and debate the legitimacy of Jesus and his teachings. Tamar's illness worsens, and her mother takes her home despite Tamar's protests. Meanwhile, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] and other [[Zealots (Judea)|zealots]], including [[Barabbas]], are plotting an uprising against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in a cave nearby. Judas thinks Jesus is the [[Messiah]] come to deliver them from the Romans, and that the people will follow him to a glorious victory. He leaves the other zealots to follow Jesus, who mock him and believe he's chasing after foolish dreams.  Shortly afterward, Mary Magdalene is being harassed by the tax collector, [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], for not paying the tax to cross the border from [[Judea]] into [[Galilee|Herod’s Kingdom]]. Four fishermen, [[Saint Peter|Simon]], [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] also confront Matthew, angry at having to pay taxes despite not having caught any fish. Jesus arrives, which excites Andrew but evokes scepticism from Simon. Jesus commandeers Simon and Andrew’s boat to preach to the crowd from the water, and tells the [[Parable of the Mustard Seed]]. After the crowds have gone, Jesus tells the fishermen to row out into the deep and cast their nets. Simon protests, explaining that no one catches fish in the middle of the day as they hide from the sunlight, but eventually complies to appease Jesus. Much to the fishermen's surprise, [[Miraculous catch of fish|they haul in an extremely large catch]]. Simon tearfully recognises Jesus as the Messiah, and Jesus says he will make him a [[Ring of the Fisherman|fisher of men]].  === Jesus teaches, performs miracles and upsets the authorities === [[Simon the Pharisee]], an elder of the Capernaum Synagogue, is visited by Ben Azra, one of the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|Temple priests]], worried about the possibility of Jesus causing a revolt. He says Jesus is more dangerous than John the Baptist and hints that John has already been 'dealt with'. Nearby, Tamar is resting on a balcony, watching a crowd of people swarming a house where Jesus is teaching. Simon the Pharisee and Ben Azra join the crowds to listen to Jesus. A group of men carrying their paralytic friend on a stretcher try to fight their way through the crowd so that Jesus may heal their friend, but find it impossible to make their way to the door. As Jesus teaches using the example of [[The Mote and the Beam|a man with a plank in his eye trying to remove a speck from another's eye]], the men with the paralytic friend dig their way through the roof and lower their friend in front of Jesus. Jesus [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|forgives the sins of the paralytic man, and heals him]]. Tamar and her family watch as the healed man dances through the streets. That night, Jesus encounters Mary Magdalene outside the town and casts several demons out of her. The next day, Jesus chooses his [[Apostles#The twelve apostles|twelve apostles]] and changes Simon’s name to Peter. Shortly afterward, the leaders of the synagogue have invited Jesus and his disciples to their house to question him. Mary Magdalene enters and washes Jesus’ feet with her tears, drying them with her hair. Jesus tells her her sins are forgiven, causing Ben Azra and Simon the Pharisee condemn Jesus as being in league with the Devil.  Tamar's illness worsens, but Jairus is hesitant to take her to Jesus as the leaders of his synagogue claim that anyone who follows Jesus is an enemy of God. Rachel pleads with Jairus to find Jesus and ask him save their daughter. Jairus agrees to go to Jesus, and pleads with him to heal Tamar. On the way to Jairus' house, a [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|woman with internal bleeding reaches out to touch Jesus's robe and is cured]]. Just before they arrive at Jairus' house, servants come to tell Jairus that Tamar is dead. Jesus encourages Jairus to remain faithful, enters the house, and raises Tamar, who awakens fully healed. Jairus, Rachel, Cleopas, and Tamar begin to follow Jesus' as well. Jesus learns that [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]] has killed John the Baptist and mourns for him, while Ben Azra meets with Herod about Jesus.  === Jesus goes to Jerusalem === Jesus and all his followers begin to make the journey from Capernaum to [[Jerusalem]] for the Passover festival. Meanwhile, [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] and his Centurion prepare for an influx of pilgrims in Jerusalem, and discuss the suppression of an uprising and the capture of Judas’ friend Barabbas. Jesus teaches his followers on the road and tells the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]. A rider comes to Jesus and tells him his friend Lazarus is dying, begging him to come. Jesus does not go immediately, which confuses and upsets Tamar. A short time later, Ben Azra rushes to [[Caiaphas]] and explains that he witnessed Jesus [[Raising of Lazarus|raise Lazarus from the dead]]. Despite Ben Azra's apprehensions about the Jews possibly following a man as powerful as Jesus in an uprising against Rome, Caiaphas reasons that Jesus can be disposed of, placating Caesar's anger against the Jews.  Jesus [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|enters Jerusalem, followed and greeted by adoring crowds]]. Judas begins to become disillusioned with Jesus, as the sight of Jesus on a donkey and people singing and waving palm branches does not fit his idea of a conquering army. Jesus and his disciples go to the [[Third Temple|Temple]], where Jesus becomes enraged at the sight of the merchants who have set up shop inside. Jesus proclaims the Temple to be a house of prayer and [[Cleansing of the Temple|turns the tables of the traders]]. The temple priests begin to plot to subdue Jesus, while the elders try to trick Jesus by asking him whether or not it is right to pay taxes. Jesus points out that Caesar's portrait and title are on the [[denarius]], and proclaims that people should "[[Render unto Caesar|give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, but give to God what belongs to God!]]" When Judas hears Jesus validate the payment of taxes to the Roman Empire, encounters Barabbas in prison, and hears Jesus predict His death, he despairs and resolves to betray Jesus to save himself. He goes and offers his services to Ben Azra, who is looking for a way to arrest Jesus away from the crowds.  === Jesus is condemned and crucified === Jesus and his followers eat [[Last Supper|the Last Supper]] in secret, where Jesus tells his disciples they will abandon him. Jesus instructs Judas to do what he has to do, and Judas slips out to lead the authorities to Jesus. When they have finished supper, Jesus and his followers gather around fires outside. Cleopas and Jairus ask Jesus to explain all that they don’t understand, to which Jesus replies that they will understand soon. He takes Peter, James and John to pray with him in the [[Agony in the Garden|Garden of Gethsemane]]. Jesus goes off a bit further by himself, where he prays earnestly and is tempted by [[Satan]] to flee while he still can. Jesus refuses, and prays for God's will to be done. Judas returns and leads the authorities to Jesus, who is arrested by the Temple Guard while the disciples flee. Jesus is tried by Caiaphas and the [[Sanhedrin]], who send him to Pilate. Despite having an intense dislike for the Jews, Pilate finds no case against Jesus and sends him to Herod. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod mocks Jesus]] and sends him back to Pilate. Judas is overwhelmed with guilt and tries to appeal to Ben Azra, who dismisses him and asserts that what Judas has done is his own problem. Ben Azra gathers a crowd and instructs them to call for the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus and the release of Barabbas, despite Pilate's reluctance to do so. Caiaphas blackmails Pilate into condemning Jesus to death. Jairus learns what has happened and Jesus’s followers run into Jerusalem, but are unable to interfere. Jesus is led up to [[Golgotha]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], while his followers look on. As Jesus dies, the sky goes dark and he proclaims ‘It is finished’. The curtain in the temple that separates the [[Holy of Holies]] from the rest of the temple is torn in two.  === Jesus rises from the dead === The disciples bury Jesus and mourn for him. Mary Magdalene returns to the tomb on Sunday morning and finds the body is gone. She encounters Jesus in the garden and goes to tell the other disciples, who believe she is mad. Peter goes to the tomb and also encounters Jesus. He tells the other disciples that he, too, has seen Jesus, but [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] is sceptical. Cleopas and Jairus arrive, and tell the disciples that they [[Road to Emmaus appearance|encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus]]. Thomas declares that they have all gone mad, and that he will not believe unless he sees Jesus and touches his wounds. Just then, Jesus appears, and Thomas also believes. Some time later, Jesus appears among all his followers on a mount, gives [[Great Commission|the Great Commission]], and then [[Ascension of Jesus|ascends into heaven]]. A child asks where Jesus has gone, and Tamar explains that [[Kingship and kingdom of God|the Kingdom of God]] has come, and that Jesus will be with them forever.

A Monkey's Tale
  Kom is a member of the Woonkos, a tribe of monkeys who live in a canopy and they live in obsessive fear of falling into a nearby pit, which is inhabited by other monkeys they believe to be demons. Kom refuses to believe these superstitions and claims bravery and is rude to the elder of the Woonkos. However, on the way home, he accidentally falls from the trees into the land below. When there, he meets the Lankoo tribe and finds they are in fact very similar to his own tribe. He befriends Gina, a young maid and Master Martin, the librarian and they help teach him to behave like a Lankoo. The Lankoo king is impressed by his actions, although Gina doesn't like it when he tries too hard for popularity, and briefly forgets her. However, there is also evil afoot. The chancellor Sebastian, the governess and their dim-witted side-kick, Gerard the Gormless, are up to evil plans: they will find a way for the King to die and they are poisoning his already sick daughter, Princess Ida. The King, along with most of his army, die drowning while attempting to reach the "promised land" on the other side of the poisonous lake when it was frozen. Sebastian believes his plan has worked, but the governess (who was giving the princess the poison) is given it herself by Gina and the one remaining soldier, however it is believed she is tough enough not to die, but will remain a "sleeping ugly". The film ends with Sebastian and Gerard in cages, Princess Ida as the new queen and Kom and Gina returning to the land of the Woonkos, while it is clear that the two tribes will unite.

 With the coming of more immigrants from Asia, cases of leprosy began to appear around the Hawaiian islands in the late 19th century.  Aware of its spread, a colony for the isolation and care of lepers was established on the isolated Kalaupapa peninsula on the norther side of the island of Molokai.  The Hawaiian government, with support from the Catholic and other churches sent almost all lepers to the colony. The Catholic Bishop who is in charge of the places feels a need to send some priests there to administer [[last rites]] to people shortly before their deaths. Fr. Damien volunteers for the same and is sent to the island with the caution from the Bishop that he shall not touch any of the patients. Fr. Damien is welcomed at the island by a man who is a Lutheran who takes care of the provisions sent by the government to the island. The Lutheran points to a mountain and tells him that whoever tries to go beyond it is shot dead to prevent the spread of the disease. On his arrival Father finds that the little chapel in the island is not properly taken care of and is ruined. With help he restores the chapel. With God as his sole help he starts his work at Molokai. A boy who comes to the chapel volunteers to become the altar boy. The boy is the first person Fr. Damien touches.

The conversation is recorded by Pugazh in his video camera. Pugazh meets a village girl, Thenmozhi ([[Manisha Koirala]]), and falls in love with her. But her father ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]) does not accept the marriage proposal as he wants to get Thenmozhi married only to a government employee.  One day, QTV arranges for a live interview with Aranganathar and the anchor in charge does not turn up at the last moment. Pugazh is thrilled and excited as he gets the opportunity to interview the CM. During the course of the interview, Pugazh unmasks many events done by Aranganathar and his party against the welfare of the state, for political reasons with necessary evidences, and he also blames Aranganathar for not taking action while at the riot by evidencing his recorded video taken at the time of the riot. Aranganathar justifies his indifferent stands and challenges Pugazh to accept his post for a day so that he will realize the pressures faced on a daily basis. Pugazh, after a brief trepidation, accepts the challenge provided the constitution permits. Lawmakers confirm that such a provision is possible and Pugazh is sworn in as the CM for 24 hours.  To everyone’s surprise, Pugazh does not prefer speaking to the waiting media crew, but gets into action immediately by collecting a list of irresponsible civil servants and issues suspension letters immediately. He helps poor people rightfully reclaim houses allotted by the government and requests every Indian citizen to pay all required taxes even if it is for a day highlighting the effects of avoiding the same. Mayakrishnan ([[Manivannan]]), an honest official, is the government secretary and helps Pugazh through his one-day mission. Finally, Pugazh digs a case of corruption against the ruling party leading to the arrest of Aranganathar.  The next day, Aranganathar retains as the CM and cancels all orders issued from the previous day. Taking Pugazh's success as his defeat and a demean to his long-standing political career, he plans to take revenge and sends goons to kill Pugazh, who escapes with heavy injuries. Aranganathar’s image is tarnished before the public and the coalition parties withdraw their support, resulting in dissolving the government and leading to another election.  A huge crowd gathers in front of Pugazh’s house requesting him to contest in the upcoming election. Other political parties also come forward to offer their support for their own reasons. But Pugazh is not for it, as he wants to have a safe and secured life. Thenmozhi's father advises him not to go in politics, while accepting him to marry Thenmozhi.  Mayakrishnan makes him understand how much the people have gathered themselves and shows the plight of people and advises him to sacrifice his comfort zone for the sake of achieving heights in the politics and doing good for the people. Finally, Pugazh accepts to it and contests in the ensuing election and wins by the vast majority of voters ever in the political history of Tamil Nadu. After assuming the office, Pugazh is keen in the state development and gets busy in his schedule of doing welfare to the people, while Aranganathar and other politicians unite as they are worried by the change of events.   They hire a hitman to get Pugazh killed but he escapes with the help of the Z Cadre security guard officials, who shoot the hitman to death. A bomb planted in Pugazh's house to kill Pugazh, instead claims the lives of his parents. Pugazh, on knowing Aranganathar is behind this, gets enraged, and challenges the latter that the law will not spare him. Aranganathar plans to create a havoc in the rule of Pugazh and hence he has his men plant bombs across [[Chennai]]. Pugazh and Mayakrishnan get to know of this by a tactful inquiry of Chinnasamy ([[Cochin Haneefa]]), who is Aranganathar's right-hand henchman. The bomb squad diffuse all the bombs except one. Aranganathar blames Pugazh to be the man behind the entire episode and claims it as a ploy to win public support.  Pugazh realizes he will be prevented from performing his duties and invites Aranganathar to his office. As their conversation progresses, Pugazh pulls out a gun and shoots himself without causing any major injuries. He throws the gun to Aranganathar who catches it out of his reflexes. At the same time, the security guards officals rush in hearing gunfire and see Aranganathar pointing the gun at Pugazh. The security guards officials shoot and kill Aranganathar to save Pugazh.  Pugazh feels glad he can continue his mission without being interrupted, but also feels guilty for having staged a false incident to kill Aranganathar. He confesses to Mayakrishnan, that even he has been forced to play the game of politics. Mayakrishnan supports him by consoling that he played the politics only for a good cause and Aranganathar deserves this. Thenmozhi's father realizes the greatness of Pugazhendhi and consents to the marriage.

Imhotep's priests are all [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|mummified]] alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetles]]. Imhotep is sealed away in a [[sarcophagus]] at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god [[Anubis]] and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return.  In 1923, [[List of The Mummy characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan Carnahan]] presents his sister, [[List of The Mummy characters#Evelyn "Evie" Carnahan O'Connell|Evelyn]], a Cairo librarian and aspiring [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], with an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra.

Muppets from Space
 [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] has always been identified as a "whatever"; but, after having disturbing dreams of abandonment and rejection, he begins to realize just how alone he is in the world. One of his nightmares involves his being denied entry by [[Noah]] onto his [[Noah's Ark|boat]]. The next morning, Gonzo tells [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] that he is getting tired of being referred to as a "whatever." After an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien race]] appears to be trying to send him a strange mysterious message through his bowl of cereal, Gonzo realizes that he may not be so alone after all and climbs to the rooftop to watch the sky. Gonzo is hit by a [[Meteoroid|shooting star]] and communicates with a pair of cosmic knowledge fish, who reveal his origins as an alien from outer space.  Unable to convince Kermit and his friends of the aliens' existence, Gonzo is lured by Agent Barker into the clutches of K. Edgar Singer of C.O.V.N.E.T., a government organization disguised as a cement factory. Singer is aware of the aliens' attempts to communicate and thinks that Gonzo is the key to convincing his superiors that aliens do exist. Gonzo and [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] are taken to C.O.V.N.E.T. by Agent Barker. Rizzo's antics cause himself to be flushed down a tube by wrestling legend [[Hulk Hogan]] and ends up having to go through C.O.V.N.E.T.'s [[rat]] training and medical research held by Dr. Tucker, alongside other Muppet rats. After [[Miss Piggy]] interrogates Barker, she, Kermit, [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]], [[Pepe the King Prawn|Pepe]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] go to rescue Gonzo and Rizzo from C.O.V.N.E.T., using inventions from [[Bunsen Honeydew|Bunsen]] and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]] such as a door in a jar, a rubber duck that emits temporary invisibility spray, and mind control gas.  An alien channeling his voice through a [[sandwich]] asks Gonzo where the alien ship can land, and Gonzo suggests a beach known by the name of Cape Doom, unaware that Singer's assistant Agent Rentro (Bobo the Bear) is listening. The gang arrives at the military base to rescue Gonzo and Rizzo. They use the invisibility spray to enter but when Fozzie washes his hands upon exiting a restroom it wears off, attracting the attention of a female guard who Animal chases. Meanwhile, Rizzo frees Gonzo from the dissection table while the other rats attack Dr. Phil Van Neuter, which is witnessed by Singer and General Luft. Luft feels that his time has been wasted and leaves angry. Upon discovering from Rentro that Gonzo is heading for Cape Doom, Singer prepares the Subatomic Neutro-Destabilizer to use on the aliens. Rentro tells Singer that his car has been [[Vehicle impoundment|impounded]] because of unpaid parking tickets; they use the company car—a cement truck.  The Muppets rescue Gonzo then go to Cape Doom where a crowd of alien-happy spectators await their arrival. The ship comes to Earth and the aliens, who all resemble Gonzo, explain that many years ago they lost him but now welcome him back into the fold. Singer shows up and tries to kill the aliens, ultimately failing to do so (Rentro removed the Subatomic Neutro-Destabilizer's battery) and is laughed at. Gonzo considers going into space with his long-lost family but chooses to stay with his fellow ''[[The Muppet Show|Muppet Show]]'' cast-mates. Singer is invited by the aliens to go with them and leaves as Earth's ambassador.  As the Muppets are watching the stars from the roof, Gonzo tells Kermit he wonders why his family asked him to build a [[Jacuzzi]]. Pepe chuckles, because he and Rizzo had pretended to be them and asked him to do it.

Murder in a Small Town
 The film opens with a series of scenes in which local millionaire Sidney Lassiter ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) has arguments with his son Albert (whom he threatens to remove from his will, if Albert doesn't leave his current lover), his wife Martha (who reveals that she knows that Sidney is unfaithful, and unsuccessfully tries to seduce him), and his secretary, Kate Faxton (who wants him to reconcile with Albert).  After the argument with Ms. Faxton, Mr. Lassiter meets with Carter, who is there to ask for a donation to the theater; Mr. Lassiter responds with unreasonable demands in exchange for his donation, as well as a few subtly bigoted comments about the fact that Carter is a Jew. Carter, despite his own best interest, calls Mr. Lassiter an [[anti-Semite]] and storms out of the office.  That night, Mr. Lassiter is surprised in his car by a stranger who had hidden in the back seat; the stranger fatally shoots Mr. Lassiter.  The next day, the detective in charge of the case, Lieutenant Tony "Baloney" Rossini ([[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]]), informs Cash that Mr. Lassiter has been murdered, and that there is a long list of suspects, due to Mr. Lassiter's temper and penchant for making enemies. Cash agrees to accompany Tony when they go to meet Albert, Martha, and Kate, who are all beneficiaries of Mr. Lassiter's will, and thus at the top of the suspect list.  While interviewing Mrs. Lassiter, Cash explains that his experience in theater has made him an expert on both observation and human psychology, both of which are helpful in police investigation; he demonstrates this by noting that, due to the muscle tone in her legs, the scuff marks on the soles of her shoes, and the lack of calluses on her hands, Mrs. Lassiter is faking the need for a wheelchair.  After interviewing all three top suspects, Cash and Tony conclude that they are all lying about ''something'', but cannot conclude which, if any of them, is responsible for Mr. Lassiter's murder.  Scenes of the investigation are intercut with scenes from Cash's personal life, as he dates Mimi Barnes ([[Cherry Jones]]) and copes with the fact that his daughter Sophie (Elisabeth Rosen) is leaving for college.  We also learn how Cash and Tony met, when Tony was assigned to investigate the (still unsolved) murder of Cash's wife; Cash and his wife had been accosted by two thieves who shot Cash's wife while trying to steal her necklace; only one of the thieves was caught, although Tony has sworn to one day find the other. A scene in a restaurant, in which Cash mistakes a random man for the other thief, hints that Cash is still haunted by the murder.

Music of the Heart
 The film opens with violinist Roberta Guaspari having been deserted by her US Navy husband and feeling devastated, almost suicidal. Encouraged by her mother, she attempts to rebuild her life and a friend from student days recommends her to the head teacher of [[East Harlem]]'s Central Park East School. Despite earning two degrees in music education, she has little experience in actual music teaching, but she accepts a substitute violin teaching position at Central Park East. With a combination of her toughness and determination, she inspires a group of kids, and their initially skeptical parents. The program slowly develops and attracts publicity, eventually expanding to Central Park East II and River East Schools.  Ten years later, in 1991, the adversaries of the Central Park East, Central Park East II and River East School string programs win a decisive institutional victory. They work with the [[New York City Board of Education]] to help eliminate funding for string programs, which leads to Roberta's early dismissal. Determined to fight the cuts, she enlists the support of former pupils, parents and teachers and plans a grand fund-raising concert, 'Fiddlefest', to raise money so that the program can continue. But with a few weeks to go and all participants furiously rehearsing, they lose the venue. Fortunately, the husband of a publicist friend is a violinist in the [[Guarneri Quartet]], and he enlists the support of other well-known musicians, including [[Isaac Stern]] and [[Itzhak Perlman]]. They arrange for the concert to be mounted at [[Carnegie Hall]].  Other famous musicians, including [[Mark O'Connor]], [[Michael Tree]], Charles Veal Jr., [[Arnold Steinhardt]], [[Karen Briggs (musician)|Karen Briggs]], Sandra Park, Diane Monroe, and [[Joshua Bell]], join in the performance, which is a resounding success.  The film's end credits declare that the Opus 118 program is still running successfully. They also report that the school's funding was restored during the making of the film.  
My Best Fiend
 The film opens with shots of [[Klaus Kinski]] performing, after his own interpretation, the role of [[Jesus]]. Kinski harangues the audience for not paying attention to him, curses wildly, has the microphone taken away from him, and, screaming, steals it back. Kinski left one of his Jesus tours to star in Herzog's film, ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972). This was the first of five films that the two would make together, the others being ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' (1978); ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'' (1978); ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' (1982); and ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987).  Herzog tours a substantially renovated apartment that he and his family shared with Kinski and other boarders, looks at the first film clip he ever saw of Kinski, and presents footage from the sets of their various movies. He recounts the heated and sometimes violent altercations between them, including the oft-repeated story of how he threatened to shoot Kinski should he leave the production of ''Aguirre''. He also draws on footage from ''[[Burden of Dreams]]'' (1982), a documentary about the making of ''Fitzcarraldo'', which was a particularly difficult film for their relationship.  At the same time, Herzog expresses a deep respect for Kinski's acting talent. Interviews with two of the women who starred opposite him, [[Eva Mattes]] (from ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'') and [[Claudia Cardinale]] (from ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]''), suggest that the actor had a calmer side. The final sequence in the film shows Kinski playing with a [[butterfly]] in the [[Peru]]vian jungle.  Herzog describes Kinski's death as the result of having lived so strenuously and fully – "like a comet", as he puts it. His voice is heard over the final scene of ''Cobra Verde,'' in which Kinski collapses in the surf as he tries to pull a large boat out to sea.  
The Muse (1999 film)
 After winning a lifetime achievement award, esteemed successful [[screenwriter]] Steven Phillips (Brooks) has a rude awakening. Steven believes the award has no real meaning, but it does—it means his career is over. His studio has reneged that means they won't renew his contract and told him he's gone cold, saying he's "lost his edge." A junior exec named Josh Martin ([[Mark Feuerstein]]) tells Steven his new script is dull and to be off the lot by 5 p.m.  Taken by surprise, the Oscar-nominated writer is desperate to revive his career. He seeks the advice of a very successful screenwriter buddy, Jack (Bridges), who arranges an introduction to Sarah (Stone), a modern-day [[muse]] who can inspire anyone.  Sarah, however, has conditions and unnecessarily lavish needs, such as expensive hotel rooms and gifts from [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany & Co]]. Steven is forced to make good on those conditions, much to the chagrin of his wife Laura (MacDowell).  Steven isn't sure if the muse could be the real thing or just somebody sucking him dry of his money and patience. She takes him to [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], where they encounter writer-director [[Rob Reiner]], someone Sarah clearly knows. Steven gets an idea for a movie set in an aquarium and thinks of [[Jim Carrey]] as the lead.  As Sarah's demands increase, Steven's apprehensive wife begins to be won over. Through the muse's encouragement Laura decides to pursue her dream of baking and selling cookies, to much fanfare and success.  To save money, Sarah is invited by the Phillipses to move into their house. Steven, however, is frustrated because Sarah spends more time helping others—notably Hollywood writers and directors like [[James Cameron]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who come to Steven's house to see her. Steven even surrenders his own bedroom to Sarah and sleeps in the guest house.  When he pleads for a way to end his aquarium screenplay, Sarah does point Steven in the right direction and inspires him with a great idea. Steven's agent Hal is thrilled and urges him to finish the script as quickly as possible. Steven did finish the script, when he heard Sara's advice.  The following morning, though, two visitors come to Steven's home, revealing that they are doctors from a mental clinic. They tell Steven that Sarah is an escaped psychiatric patient from their asylum who has [[multiple personality disorder]]. They find the whole "muse" idea hilarious. When they try to find Sarah to take her back, they discover that she has escaped. They decide not to go after her, since she can come and go anytime she wants.  The junior exec, Josh, loves Steven's script, but he breaks the news that the idea is already in production at another studio—by Rob Reiner. A broken-hearted Steven goes to work in his wife's new cookie business.  Things turn around when the agent calls to inform Steven that the Reiner project fell through and the studio wants to purchase his version, contingent upon a few changes being made. An excited Steven goes to the studio, where a secretary reveals that the studio fired Josh for stealing and they have a new boss, Christine, is now in charge. Christine is revealed to be Sarah. She takes Steven's arm and insists that they discuss the changes over a nice, expensive lunch, which she expects him to pay for.  
My Favorite Martian (film)
  News producer Tim O'Hara (Daniels) is fired for unwillingly "compromising" his boss's daughter, reporter Brace Channing ([[Elizabeth Hurley]]), during a live broadcast of the first [[Space Shuttle]] launch from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. His assistant, Lizzie ([[Daryl Hannah]]), tries to comfort him, and  she apparently has a crush on him. Later, Tim witnesses a small Martian [[spacecraft]] crash landing. Realizing his chance to deliver a story that will "rock the Earth", he brings Brace to show her the ship, but by the time he reaches the crash site, the ship has been shrunken to toy size. Nearby, its only occupant (Lloyd) hides in the bushes. Tim takes the now-shrunken spaceship home with him, and the Martian follows him to retrieve it. After a confrontation, Tim is knocked out and the Martian disguises himself to look like Tim and ends up kissing Lizzie when she visits.  When Tim confronts the Martian the next morning, he finds out that a small device called an "electron accelerator", which powers the control systems of the ship, is damaged beyond repair and the Martian needs Tim's help to find a replacement. The Martian takes the name "Uncle Martin" and explores the city with Tim, unaware that they are being watched by [[SETI]], which discovered [[DNA]] left by Martin while hiding out at Tim's. While exploring Tim's neighborhood, Martin tells him about a friend of his named "Neenert", one of his planet's most gifted Martian scientists, who came to Earth in 1964, but never came back. Brace is captured by the SETI gang and is interrogated.  Tim secretly tapes Martin and his sentient suit, Zoot, with hidden cameras to back up his story and impress the TV station staff, but he eventually decides not to reveal the tapes, as he has become fond of Martin. Meanwhile, Martin and Zoot discover a subsystem of the ship called the Interstellar Safety System, which is prepared to self-destruct. Brace discovers the footage of Martin in his Martian form and she steals the tape. Lizzie shows up at Tim's house to discover Brace stealing the tape. Thinking that Tim cheated on her, Lizzie rejects him and storms out, only to be distracted by the now-full-sized spaceship, and is pulled into the cockpit by Zoot.  Martin and Tim go after the Martian evidence, shrinking the ship (along with Zoot and Lizzie) and racing down to the station, where Tim admits to Martin that he has been videotaping him, but says he likes Martin and apologizes. Accepting Tim's apology, Martin subdues Brace, then disguises himself as her so he can take her place on the news, and Martin's alien form is almost exposed during the broadcast, which is carefully watched by Elliot Coleye (Shawn), head of SETI. As footage from another news report is aired, Tim and Martin escape the station, pursued by SETI through the sewers in Tim's car, shrunken using Martin's device. They eventually end up in the hands of Coleye, who takes them back to SETI for investigation.  At the lab, Tim tricks one of the scientists into growing Martin's ship to normal size, breaching security, and allowing Lizzie and Zoot to escape. However, the trio's escape is blocked by two security guards, one of whom shoots Zoot. With the help of a "nerplex", a piece of alien [[Chewing gum|gum]] that can transform anyone into another life form, Lizzie transforms into a hideous monster from "Veenox 7". She defeats them, then spits out the nerplex and turns back into a human.  The three eventually succeed in locating Martin, who has undergone surgery involving the removal of his antennae and presumably killing him. When Martin and Zoot reunite, he comes back to life and wakes up. They then escape SETI headquarters, and Tim and Lizzie prepare to bid farewell to Martin, installing a car alternator in place of the ship's damaged electron accelerator. However, they are interrupted by Coleye, who attempts to stop him from escaping, saying that he will stop at nothing to prove the existence of aliens, even if it means killing Martin. A SETI official named Armitan, revealed to be Martin's old friend Neenert (Walston), saves Martin by destroying Coleye's gun and tossing Coleye wildly in the air. After a reunion, Martin and Neenert fly back to Mars on their ship, much to Coleye's dismay.  Eventually, Coleye catches hold of the piece of nerplex left by Neenert. Believing that he can still prove his cause, Coleye chews on it, and he is turned into an alien. Laughing, Coleye accidentally swallows the gum. He ends up caught and tranquilized by his own organization, as Tim and Lizzie escape the scene.  In the end, Martin and Zoot decide to return to Earth and stay with Tim and Lizzie, while Neenert flies Martin's spacecraft back to Mars. Tim initially objects to Martin's staying, but Lizzie convinces Tim to change his mind.  
My Brother the Pig

Muro-Ami
 Fredo ([[Cesar Montano]]) is a fisherman who has endured more than his share of hardship in life; his wife and child both perished in a boating accident, and today Fredo approaches each trip to the sea with the angry determination of a man out for revenge. Fredo commands a crew of young people from poor families as he takes his rattletrap ship into the ocean in search of fish that live along the reefs, snaring catch with an illegal netting system. Not all of Fredo's youthful sailors are willing to put up with his abusive arrogance, however, and even his father Dado ([[Pen Medina]]) and close friend Botong ([[Jhong Hilario]]) have grown weary of Fredo's tirades. Fredo's body is beginning to betray him as well, and as he and his crew damage the sea's reef beds in search of fish, no one is certain how much longer he will be able to continue.  Maestro Fredo, a tyrant captain, fixates to claim the treasures of the sea—no matter what, in whatever diabolical technique for as long as he profits. He employs dozens of men, mostly children, in his dangerous expeditions. Conditions aboard the ships are oppressive. Children are often overworked and his crew is furious with the way they are living. He blames the sea for claiming the lives of his family and he exacts revenge by plundering its depths.  
Mutiny (1999 film)
  The film fairly closely follows the timeline of actual events as set out in the [[Port Chicago disaster]] article.  
Mystery Men
 In Champion City, would-be [[superhero]] team of Mr. Furious, the Shoveler, and the Blue Raja attempt to make a name for themselves, but their suspect skills make them ineffective, and they find themselves upstaged by the city's most successful superhero, Captain Amazing. However, Amazing is finding that his effectiveness at fighting crime has practically made his job obsolete, and without any worthy adversaries remaining (most are either dead, in exile, or in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to pull their funding.  To create a need for himself, Amazing uses his [[alter ego]], billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of [[supervillain]] Casanova Frankenstein. The plan backfires; once reunited with Tony P and his Disco Boys, Casanova Frankenstein blows up the insane asylum, captures Amazing, and prepares to unleash the "Psycho-frakulator", which lethally bends reality. Mr. Furious, while spying on Casanova Frankenstein's mansion, discovers Amazing's capture and informs the others.  After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the three realize they need more allies, and through word-of-mouth and try-outs, they recruit Invisible Boy, the Spleen, and the Bowler. The newly formed team "assaults" Casanova, which only succeeds in annoying him and damaging his car. While drunk from celebrating their victory, the team is nearly killed in retaliation by Tony P and the Disco Boys, but they are saved at the last minute by the Sphinx. The Sphinx trains them, but his methods annoy Mr. Furious – he has them complete rote team-building exercises and speaks exclusively in [[Chiasmus]]. They also seek out Doc Heller, who specializes in non-lethal weaponry, to equip them for their battle.  The group breaks into Casanova's mansion during a gathering of several of the city's gangs; but, while attempting to free Captain Amazing, they inadvertently set off the Psycho-frakulator, killing him instead. Without Amazing, the team despairs of saving the city, but the Shoveler delivers a pep-talk that succeeds in uniting and inspiring them.  With new-found purpose, they assault the mansion and, by making effective use of their negligible superpowers and Heller's weapons, manage to subdue most of Casanova Frankenstein's henchmen. As the heroes approach Casanova Frankenstein, he reveals that he is holding Mr. Furious' girlfriend Monica hostage, and activates the Psycho-frakulator, which begins to wreak havoc upon the city.  While the team tries to stop the device, Mr. Furious takes on Casanova Frankenstein. After initially taking a beating, Mr. Furious unleashes his inner rage and manages to fight effectively for the first time. He defeats Casanova Frankenstein, who is thrown into the core of the Psycho-frakulator and killed by its reality-bending powers. The rest of the team helps The Bowler use her bowling ball to destroy the device and escape the mansion as it implodes.  The team is interviewed by reporters, begging to know their team name. As they argue among themselves, one reporter states "Well, whatever you may call them, Champion City will forever owe a debt of gratitude to these 'Mystery Men'," but the others are too busy arguing to hear it.  
Mystery, Alaska
   Sheriff John Biebe, who is married to Donna, is one of the townsfolk who play in "the Saturday Game"—a weekly hockey game played on an [[pond hockey|open pond]]. The entire town, which is hockey-mad, turns out every week to watch. After the game commences, we see young Stevie Weeks in the stands, kissing Marla Burns, daughter of the town's judge. When the judge sees what is going on, he raps Stevie on the head and reprimands them both. Donna arrives with the latest edition of [[Sports Illustrated]], which features an article on the town and the Saturday Game. The article serves also to explain the nature of the Saturday Game, as well as to introduce some of the prominent team members. It also refers to John as being "slow in the feet", but concludes with a statement that on the ability to skate, the Mystery team rivals any team in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  That evening, while having supper with his family Judge Burns and his son Birdie get into an argument about the game, with the judge saying that Birdie doesn't play well because he doesn't pass. In an effort to change the subject, Mrs Burns mentions that Price World may be interested in moving in to Mystery, which would threaten all the local businesses. During the next week, John is called into the Mayor's office to be told that he is being dropped from the Saturday game, in favour of Stevie Weeks.   Skank Marden and the mayor's wife, Mary Jane, have been having an affair. At the school, where he is a teacher, he protests to her that she should have told him about John Biebe being dropped from the team. The mayor then enters, and Skank expresses his disgust at the decision.  John sees Stevie Weeks at the diner and offers him congratulations. John is then called away because Connor Banks, the team's best player, has just shot someone. While Connor is being read his rights, the deputy explains to John what happened. Connor and a rep from Price World named Mr. Walsh got into an argument; Connor fired a shot to frighten him, but the bullet ricocheted and hit the rep in the foot. Mr. Walsh is then seen having his foot treated while swearing angrily about Connor and the town. John is then called away as there is helicopter about to land at the town hall. Charles Danner, the author of the Sports Illustrated article, steps out of the helicopter. In the mayor's office, he explains to the Committee that as a result of his article the NHL suggested that the New York Rangers be brought up to Mystery to play the town's team in a televised exhibition game.  At a town meeting called to discuss the matter, the mayor re-introduces Charlie, who although originally from Mystery, seems not to have been very popular. Charlie is also revealed to have once been romantically connected with Donna. Initially feelings about the match are mixed but then Birdie indicates his eagerness to play and the game is given a rousing endorsement. Later John is approached by the mayor, and assumes that he will be invited back onto the team. However, the mayor wants John only to coach: Judge Burns has refused to do so. John says that he doesn’t know how to coach.  Connor Banks' arraignment is brought before Judge Burns, with his attorney, Bailey Pruit, accepting a trial date for the following week. Connor informs him that he doesn't want a trial so soon in case he loses, which would mean he would miss the upcoming game. Bailey tells him not to worry because no jury will lock up the town’s star player. At Connor’s trial, Bailey asks the victim, Mr. Walsh what he thinks of Mystery, and asks him to confirm verbatim transcripts that the sheriff had taken at the time, in which he had disparaged the town. The jury delivers a "not guilty" verdict on Connor Banks. Amid much jubilation, Judge Burns angrily addresses those assembled, telling them that they have exalted the hockey game above what is right, and that they have disgraced themselves and his courtroom. Birdie confronts him in his chambers and tells him he feels that he was always ashamed of his son for staying in town to play hockey, instead of going to college.   Before the next Saturday game, the players watch some NHL hockey on TV, and it emerges that the Rangers players are not keen to play the match, which they disparage as a joke. In the evening, crew from Charlie's TV network arrive. They meet with the mayor and John, informing them that they want to call the team the Mystery Eskimos, which they both take offence to. While John is arguing with Charlie on the street, Judge Burns arrives. John asks him to coach as he doesn’t know how to, but the Judge turns him down.  Preparations for the match continue, with it becoming obvious that it is now becoming much more than a game of pond hockey.  The mayor and his wife Mary Jane are discussing the forthcoming game, when he finds a locket which he realizes is Skank's. He confronts Mary Jane, and says, "Skank Marden has been in this bed." They fight, but some days later they reconcile.   When the mayor meets Charlie the next morning, Charlie tells him that the Rangers players had filed a grievance with their players' union, and are no longer coming. The mayor punches Charlie, giving him a bloody nose. Judge Burns meets Bailey and tells him that there is a hearing in New York over the legal dispute. He suggests to him that it might be useful for Mystery to have a presence, and suggests a few legal arguments he could use.  At the hearing Bailey makes an impassioned plea for the game to continue. However, while still arguing the case he suffers a fatal heart attack. After the funeral back in Mystery, it is revealed that he won the case, and the game is back on. John confronts the judge, saying that as he sent Bailey to New York he would now have to take over the coaching. The judge agrees, but only if John will come back onto the team as captain.  Under the guidance of the judge, the team is seen training frantically for the match.  The Rangers' players arrive by helicopter and are greeted by the mayor and townsfolk, who are all amazed at their size. John is called away to deal with a problem, which is revealed to be Charlie driving drunkenly on a Zamboni. He and John talk, and he reveals his bitterness towards Mystery, which he believes rejected him. John points out to him that bringing the Rangers to Mystery could destroy the town if its team were to lose very badly.  During the match, the Mystery team take time to settle, but eventually go ahead two goals to nothing in the first period. One of the goals is scored by Stevie, who impresses the commentators with his speed. In the second period however, the Rangers score five unanswered goals. Birdie costs the team a goal through his desire to “go it alone” when he should have passed. Unwilling to accept defeat, Mystery scores two goals in the third period, including one from a pass that Birdie makes instead of shooting for goal himself. As the clock ticks down, Connor has a chance to level the scores, but his shot hits the crossbar, and the game is over, with the score at 5 – 4 to the Rangers. Both the Mystery team and spectators appear completely deflated, until Judge Burns starts clapping for them, after which even the Rangers players applaud them.  The following day the Rangers leave, and it is revealed that both Stevie Weeks and Connor Banks have been given professional contracts and fly out with the Rangers.  
My Neighbors the Yamadas
 The film is a series of [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] following the daily lives of the Yamada family: Takashi and Matsuko (the father and mother), Shige (Matsuko's mother), Noboru (aged approximately 13, the son), Nonoko (aged approximately 5, the daughter), and Pochi (the family dog).  Each of the vignettes is preceded by a title such as "Father as Role Model", "A Family Torn Apart" or "Patriarchal Supremacy Restored". These vignettes cover such issues as losing a child in a department store, the relationships between father and son, or husband and wife, the wisdom of age, getting one's first girlfriend and many more. Each is presented with humour, presenting a very believable picture of family life which crosses cultural boundaries. The relationships between Matsuko, Takashi and Shige are particularly well observed, with Shige giving advice and proverbs to all the family members, and having a great strength of character which far outweighs Matsuko's. Takashi and Matsuko's relationship is often the focus of the episodes, their rivalries, such as arguing about who has control of the television, their frustrations and their difficulties, but the overriding theme is their love for one another despite their flaws, and their desire to be the best parents possible for their children.<ref>For a much more detailed plot synopsis, covering every episode in detail see: [http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/yamada/synopsis/page1.html plot synopsis].</ref>  
My Life So Far
 The film tells the story of how the Pettigrew family, living in their family estate Kiloran House in Scotland, deal with changes brought by the end of World War I, told through the point of view of one of the Pettigrew children, Fraser (Robert Norman).  The family is headed by the maternal grandmother MacIntosh ([[Rosemary Harris]]), affectionately known as  "Gamma", whose decisions are to be obeyed without question.  Gamma's son Morris ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) left home to build a career for himself and succeed as a well-to-do businessman; while her younger daughter Moira ([[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]]) followed the traditional route - she fell in love with Edward Pettigrew ([[Colin Firth]]), gave up a promising chance at becoming an opera singer, settled down at her family estate and raised a large family.  Edward is a typical country gentry of his time - owns a minor business (turning [[sphagnum moss]] into medical dressings), a pious man and defender of traditional values (gives a speech at every Sunday service), loves and listens only to [[Beethoven]] and has a passion for inventions and mechanical improvements all over the estate.  All of which are laughed at by Morris, who lives in London but comes back to visit often, as he is competing with Edward to inherit the estate after Gamma passes away; the two can barely conceal their loathing for each other.  Edward does not appreciate and resists waves of new changes in the world, but the harder he tries, the more things fall apart.  Morris and his beautiful and charming French fiancée Heloise ([[Irène Jacob]]) introduce [[jazz]] to the children ("the sound of the devil speaking" according to Edward).  An emergency landing brings the eldest daughter Elspeth's ([[Kelly Macdonald]]) first suitor - French show pilot Gabriel Chenoux ([[Tchéky Karyo]]).  Fraser discovers grandfather MacIntosh's book collection in the attic, and as an act of rebellion against Edward, sets out to read them all.  Without guidance, he misunderstands the definition of "[[prostitution]]", and believing it to be a business term, suggests to all guests at Morris and Heloise's engagement party that Moira, Heloise and Gamma should go into prostitution to enhance the moss business.  Worst of all, Edward finds himself drawn to Heloise, and makes a pass at her prior to the wedding.  While passing out food during a [[curling]] game held in her husband's honor, Gamma falls through the ice into the lake.  Although she is pulled up immediately, she dies of [[pneumonia]] soon after.  Gamma's will leaves the estate to Edward, leading to the ultimate altercation between Edward and Morris at her [[wake]].  Edward boasts that Morris has lost more than the estate to him, causing Moira to finally confront him and tell him that she has been aware of his affair with Heloise all along.  It takes months before Edward's efforts finally win back Moira, and the family settles back into its old routine.  On a Sunday morning, all Pettigrews are heading to church, except Fraser.  Edward finds him relaxing in a [[chaise longue]] in the library, a cognac glass filled with milk in one hand and a lit cigar in the other, swaying his head and body to a gramophone recording of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[On the Sunny Side of the Street]]" (a secret gift from Heloise).  Instead of being thrown into a fit of rage, he smiles and closes the door, leaving Fraser to enjoy himself.

Nang Nak
 In a rural village west of Bangkok, Mak ([[Winai Kraibutr]]) is conscripted and sent to fight in the [[Siamese-Vietnamese War (1831–1834)]]. He has to leave behind his pregnant teenage wife, Nak (Intira Jaroenpura). Mak is wounded and barely survives. He eventually returns home to his beloved wife and their child.  A friend visits and sees Mak living with Nak. The villagers, knowing she had died months earlier, realize Mak is spellbound by her ghost. But those who attempt to tell him are killed in the night by Nak's ghost, desperate to stay with her husband. When Mak confronts Nak about the rumors, she lies and says the villagers disliked her after he left for the war. She claims they are also telling lies about their son not being Mak's. Mak believes her and lashes out at anyone who tell him she is dead.  Mak eventually discovers the truth. Crawling under their house, one night to retrieve an item, he trips ons something sticking up from the dirt. Curious, he digs it up and finds a corpse making him wonder why Nak would always prevent him from going down there. Looking up through the creaks of the wood floor, he sees Nak sitting and brushing her hair. Dropping the comb through a creak, her arm eerily extends all the way to the floor to retrieve it. Mak covers his mouth, so she wouldn't hear him scream and continues observing Nak. Nak picks up her crying baby wherein Mak sees that their son is a corpse as well. A series of flashbacks reveal that Nak had a difficult childbirth and both mother and child died from complications. Mak flees in terror to the local temple to hide. Nak follows him and attempts to win him back, but he is too frightened of her. The villagers attempt to drive out Nak, burning down her house and at last summoning an exorcist. Nak refuses to leave unless Mak returns to her. Mak pleads with her to leave to the netherworld. He loves her, but they can't be together since she is dead. He tells her that he is going to cut his hair and become a monk in order to pray for her sins and allow her spirit to find peace. She still refuses.  The kingdom's most respected [[Buddhist]] monk ([[Somdej Toh]]) arrives and in a tearful farewell Nak repents, leaving her husband for this life. Somdej Toh has the centre of her forehead cut out, thus releasing her spirit, and makes a girdle brooch of it. The epilogue states it later came into the possession of His Royal Highness Prince [[Abhakara Kiartivongse|Chumbhorn Ketudomsak]]. It was thereafter handed down for generations and its current owner unknown.

The Nameless (film)
  In Spain, the vanished six-year-old daughter of the editor Claudia and her husband Marc is found completely mutilated in a well by the police, being recognized by her husband only due to a bracelet and leg defect (one legbone is shorter than the other). The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive.  Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers.  Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help.  After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera, to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find.  Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] journalist Quiroga, a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic.  Visiting a theological expert at the university, the two begin to uncover a bizarre [[cult]] called ''The Nameless'' that is said to sacrifice children. The cult was led by a now-imprisoned man called Santini who believed in absolute evil, and created his cult which also links to Germany's [[Thule Society]]. A doctor who helped him was also arrested but was released for lack of evidence. To make matters worse, Claudia finds herself stalked by psychotic ex-boyfriend Toni. Toni meets a strange man with a scarred eye in a bar (the man has previously encountered Claudia on a train); they decide to go see Claudia, and are followed by mysterious figures as they leave.  Meanwhile, Claudia visits Massera because she is scared to stay at home. She learns his wife died the year before. They then go to visit the prison where Santini is held. Santini has a degenerative skin disease which is believed to be due to inoculations he was given as a prisoner in the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Santini talks to Claudia cryptically but though he talks about the painful experience of having been placed in a cobalt capsule at the concentration camp, and how he has 'vermin' inside of him, Claudia pleads with him to reveal Angela's whereabouts but he only tells her to think, and says that Angela is in the place 'where the whole thing began'. It soon becomes evident that while Santini may be in jail, his followers are still at large; as Claudia returns to her apartment, she finds Toni murdered, along with another cryptic message.  The trail leads to an abandoned hotel where Angela was conceived years ago. Quiroga scouts ahead, soon followed by Massera; both men are quickly subdued and slain by cult members. Another call from Angela urges Claudia to investigate. On the site the woman is greeted by the cultists, among them Marc, her own husband. He reveals it was their plan all along to lead her to their den. Claudia then confronts her now grown daughter, alive and well, but twisted and indoctrinated by the cult with the intent to create a perfect evil being. It is now her task to commit the ultimate atrocity and kill her own mother. However, Angela attacks Marc instead and briefly seems to resist the indoctrination – before proclaiming she has in fact prepared an even more sinister plan and does not wish to share its fruits with the cult. She proclaims to Claudia that she will "see her later" and that she is going to be a [[saint]], before putting the gun in her mouth and pulling the trigger.

She gives a man with one shorter leg some of her Elixir, and his leg grows to the length of the other one. The carnival's dwarf then leads Pinocchio and Lampwick to "The Hall of Freaks", a place with a clown that washes his face, an albino who can blow fire from his mouth, a large fish tank that have fish with human faces, a woman with a beard, and a fairy called "Blue" who only Pinocchio can see. They then return to Pinocchio's house and find his father Geppetto, who is very sick. Pinocchio and Lampwick then return to the carnival to each buy some of Madame Flambeau's Elixir. Felinet and Volpe, a human-cat and human-fox respectively, lead them to Madame Flambeau. They don't have enough money for the Elixir, so they agree to work for her in the carnival. Lampwick drinks his Elixir and returns home, and Pinocchio gives his Elixir to Geppetto.  The next morning, Pinocchio finds the Elixir has transformed his father into a puppet. Madame Flambeau enters their house, and gets angry at Pinocchio for giving the Elixir to his father instead of himself. She reveals she is Lorenzini's widow. Geppetto and Pinocchio are then forced to work at the carnival's show. Geppetto eventually accepts and enjoys being a puppet, much to Pinocchio's dismay. Lampwick had been transformed into a sea donkey because of the Elixir, and Pinocchio finds him in the large fish tank. Madame Flambeau compromises Pinocchio that if he becomes a puppet, then Geppetto and Lampwick will automatically become human again; but this was a trick so that Pinocchio would perform in front of the prince. Seconds before the show, the dwarf takes Pinocchio; Felinet and Volpe take Geppetto and replace the two with inanimate puppets. The prince angrily leaves due to the audience booing. Madame Flambeau and her team go on a search for Geppetto and Pinocchio. The dwarf takes Pinocchio and Lampwick to the forest where Pinocchio came from. The dwarf transforms and reveals himself as Pepe.  Madame Flambeau finds Geppetto and then finds Pinocchio. Geppetto apologizes to Pinocchio for being more interested in his fame than his son, and it is implied he wants to be human again. Madame Flambeau then transforms into Lorenzini, a secret he had been hiding the whole time. He plans on cooking Lampwick using Pinocchio and Geppetto as the firewood. Pepe gives Pinocchio clues on how to find the Heart of the Mountain. Pinocchio, Geppetto and Lampwick get to the Heart of the Mountain via sliding down a long pathway. Once there, they find a pool called the "magic water", something that turns someone/something into their true nature. Lorenzini and the others also enter the Heart of the Mountain. Lampwick falls into the water and is instantly restored to human. Lorenzini laughs and jumps in the magic water thinking it will make him powerful, but it instead turns him into "the sea monster" over a period of time. Geppetto and Pinocchio then jump in and are instantly restored to human. Volpe and Felinet jump in but their true nature remains.  The next day, Lorenzini is locked up in a cage, and is laughed at by the carnival's audience for his grotesque sea monster appearance. Pinocchio and Lampwick go to see Geppetto's puppet show, along with a girl called "Isabella" who looks just like Blue but with black hair. Isabella tells Pinocchio that the Elixir can't truly fix anyone's troubles. Geppetto performs in front of the prince, and is applauded by Pinocchio and the rest of the audience.

The Ninth Gate
 Dean Corso ([[Johnny Depp]]), a New York City rare book dealer, makes his living conning people into selling him valuable antique books for a low price, and then re-selling them to private collectors. Corso meets with wealthy book collector Boris Balkan ([[Frank Langella]]), who has recently acquired a copy of the (fictional) book ''The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows'' by 17th-century author Aristide Torchia, one of only three extant copies. The book is an adaptation of one written by the [[Devil]] himself and purportedly contains the means to summon the Devil and acquire invincibility and immortality. Balkan believes two of the copies are forgeries. He hires Corso to check all three and acquire the legitimate one by any means necessary.  Balkan's copy was acquired from Andrew Telfer ([[Willy Holt]]), who killed himself soon after. Telfer's widow Liana ([[Lena Olin]]) seduces Corso, in a failed attempt to get the book back. Meanwhile, Corso leaves the book for safekeeping with bookseller Bernie Rothstein ([[James Russo]]), who is then murdered; his corpse is found posed like an engraving in ''The Nine Gates''.  Corso travels to [[Toledo, Spain]]. The Ceniza brothers, book restorers, show him that three of the engravings are signed "LCF". Corso deduces that [[Lucifer]] himself designed and cut them. Corso travels to [[Sintra]], [[Portugal]], to compare Victor Fargas' ([[Jack Taylor (actor)|Jack Taylor]]) copy of the book to Balkan's. To Corso's surprise, he discovers that the signature "LCF" is found in three different engravings, which vary in small but significant details from the images in the Balkan copy. The next morning, a mysterious young woman (identified only as "the Girl") ([[Emmanuelle Seigner]]) who appears to have been shadowing Corso since Balkan hired him, awakens Corso and leads him to Fargas' house. He finds the old man murdered and the "LCF"-signed engravings ripped out of that copy.  In Paris, Corso visits the Baroness Kessler ([[Barbara Jefford]]), who owns the third copy. At first, the Baroness refuses to cooperate, but Corso intrigues her with evidence that the engravings differ among the three copies. He explains his idea: each copy contains three different "LCF"-signed engravings, therefore all three copies are required for the ritual. Corso finds "LCF" on three different engravings in the Baroness's book, confirming his theory.   Kessler is killed, and the Girl rescues Corso from Liana's bodyguard. When Liana steals Balkan's copy from Corso's hotel room, he follows her, and witnesses her using the book in a [[Satanist]] ceremony. Balkan suddenly interrupts the ceremony, kills Liana, and leaves with the engraved pages and his own intact copy.  Corso pursues Balkan to a remote castle, depicted in one of the engravings, and finds Balkan preparing the final ritual. After a struggle, Balkan traps Corso in a hole in the floor. Balkan performs his summoning ritual: he arranges the engravings on a makeshift altar, and recites a series of phrases related to each of the nine engravings. Balkan then douses the floor and himself with gasoline and sets it alight, believing himself to be immune to suffering. Balkan's invocation fails, and he screams in pain as the flames engulf him. Corso frees himself, shoots Balkan, takes the engravings, and escapes.  Outside, the Girl appears and has sex with him by the light of the burning castle, her eyes and face seeming to change as she writhes on top of Corso. She tells him that Balkan failed because the ninth engraving he had used was a forgery. On her suggestion before she disappears, Corso returns to the Ceniza brothers' now vacant shop. By chance, he finds there the authentic ninth engraving. On it, there is a likeness of the Girl. With the last engraving in hand, Corso returns to the castle. He completes the ritual and crosses through the Ninth Gate into the light.

Office Space
 Peter Gibbons is a programmer at a company called Initech who is frustrated and unmotivated at his job. His co-workers include Samir Nagheenanajar and Michael Bolton, also programmers, and Milton Waddams, a meek collator who is mostly ignored by the rest of the office. The staff constantly suffer under callous management, especially Initech's smarmy vice president [[Bill Lumbergh]], whom Peter loathes. During lunch together, Peter takes an interest in a local waitress, Joanna, but does not act on it out of loyalty to his girlfriend, Anne, whom his friends believe is cheating on him. The group returns to the office and are further agitated by the arrival of consultants Bob Slydell and Bob Porter, who are brought in to help the company [[layoff|downsize]].  Anne persuades Peter to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session, but Dr. Swanson, the therapist, dies of a heart attack while hypnotizing Peter, leaving him in a deep state of relaxation and reduced inhibitions. Waking up the next morning, Peter sleeps in and ignores repeated phone calls from Lumbergh, who had been expecting him to work over the weekend. He also ignores calls from Anne, who responds by angrily breaking up with him and admitting that she has been cheating on him, confirming his friends' suspicions. The following workday, Peter decides to skip work and asks Joanna out for lunch. Joanna and Peter bond over their shared loathing of idiotic management and love of the television series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''.  When Peter finally shows up at work to write down Joanna's number, he is called in to speak to the consultants. Unfazed, he confidently arrives for his meeting and vents his frustrations. However, both consultants are impressed with his identification of redundant, inefficient work--especially by management--and are captivated by his brutal honesty and frank insights into office problems. Over the next few days, Peter disregards office protocol, including violating Initech's dress code, taking Lumbergh's reserved parking spot, refusing to follow Lumbergh's directions, and removing a cubicle wall that blocks his view out the window. When Lumbergh raises the issue with the consultants, they defend Peter's actions, stating that he is not challenged enough in his role due to Lumbergh's inefficient policies and they recommend Peter for immediate promotion.   After accepting the promotion, Peter discovers that the downsizing will cut Michael and Samir's jobs will be eliminated; Peter relays this news to them, and the trio decide to get even by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed to [[Salami slicing|divert fractions of pennies]] into a bank account. They believe that such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but will result in a substantial amount of money over time. On Michael and Samir's last day at Initech, the pair along with Peter steal a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three take to a field and smash to pieces to vent their frustration.  At a barbecue, Peter learns that Joanna had previously slept with a colleague identified as "Lumbergh". He assumes it to be his boss and confronts Joanna in disgust. She questions the morality of his financial scheme, and the two split up. Peter then discovers that a [[Software bug|bug]] in Michael's code has caused their virus to steal over $300,000 in only a few days, which is far more conspicuous. Meanwhile, Joanna has finally stood up to her boss and quit, and Peter has discovered that she slept with a different "Lumbergh." Peter admits to her that the scheme was a bad idea and that he plans to accept responsibility for the crime, and they reconcile. He writes out a confession and slips it under Lumbergh's office door late at night, along with [[traveler's cheque]]s for the stolen money.  Milton, meanwhile, has become increasingly disgruntled at his treatment by management, to the point that he has mumbled threats about setting the building on fire.  The next morning, he enters Lumbergh's office to reclaim a red [[Swingline]] stapler that was taken from him. Peter arrives at work fully expecting to be arrested, but he finds instead that his problem has solved itself. The Initech building is engulfed in flames, and all evidence of the missing money has been destroyed. Peter finally finds a job that he likes, doing construction work with his next-door neighbor Lawrence, while Samir and Michael both get jobs at a rival company to Initech. Milton lounges on the beach at a fancy Mexican resort, complaining about his beverage and threatening to take his business to a competitor.  
Notting Hill (film)
  William "Will" Thacker owns an independent book store, The Travel Book Co. in [[Notting Hill]]. He is divorced from his wife who left him for a man he claims looked like [[Harrison Ford]], shares his house with an eccentric, carefree [[Wales|Welshman]] named Spike and has a small, tight knit group of friends that includes his sister, Honey, Bella, Max, Bernie, and Tony.  Will encounters [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actress Anna Scott when she enters his shop. Minutes later, they collide in the street and his drink spills on her clothes. Will offers his house nearby for Anna to change. Before leaving, she impulsively kisses him and then asks him not to mention what just occurred.  Days later, Spike belatedly relays a message from Anna. Will calls and she invites him to visit her at [[The Ritz London Hotel|the Ritz Hotel]]. On arrival, Will is mistaken for a journalist. In a panic he claims he works for ''[[Horse & Hound]]'' and is made to interview not only Anna, but the entire cast of her new [[science fiction|sci-fi film]], which he knows nothing about. Anna calls him back in and says she has cleared her evening. Will is exhilarated, before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey's birthday party; Anna surprises him by offering to be his date.  At the house of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in perfectly as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a [[garden square]] as they walk back from the birthday party. The next evening they go to a restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, thinking he's a member of the hotel staff, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on, but Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.  [[File:Portobello Road, Notting Hill.jpg|thumb|alt=A road with some cars parked on it next to a line of houses|300px|right|Much of the filming took place on [[Portobello Road]]]]  One day, a distraught Anna appears at Will's doorstep; some pre-stardom nude photos have been published in the tabloids (along with reports of a video filmed without her permission), and she needs a place to hide from the fallout. Once she calms down, they spend some time on the rooftop patio rehearsing lines from Anna's next film. She also apologizes for the previous incident, telling Will her boyfriend simply showed up out of the blue and the relationship had broken down long before then. When she sees a poster of the [[Marc Chagall]] painting ''[[La Mariée]]'' on his kitchen wall, Anna tells Will that "it feels like how love should be". That night, Anna goes to him and they have sex. The next morning, the press (inadvertently tipped off by Spike) besiege Will's house and get pictures of him and Anna half-dressed. While packing to leave, a furious Anna accuses Will of exploiting the situation for his own benefit and declares that she regrets their time together, because the press will make sure it never goes away.  Seasons pass and Will, though determined to forget Anna, remains miserable. Spike and Honey find the numbers to Anna's New York and London agents, encouraging him to reach out, but Will decides to throw them away. At a dinner with his friends, Will discovers that Anna is now an Oscar winner and back in town making a period film. He visits her [[Location shooting|location shoot]], where Anna sees him and invites him past security. Although things are not going well on set, she asks him to stay because there are "things to say". He is surprised to find that it is a [[Henry James]] film, something he had previously suggested would be a good role for Anna. Given headphones to listen to the actors over their microphones, Will overhears Anna bantering with her rude co-star, until the co-star mentions seeing Will and Anna refers to him dismissively. Saddened, Will leaves the set.  The next day, Anna comes to the bookshop with a present. Visibly nervous, she apologizes for her previous behavior and expresses a desire to rekindle their relationship. When Will points out her comments the previous day, she explains that she would never discuss her private life with "the most indiscreet man in England." Believing it inevitable that they would break up, Will turns her down, as her superstar status would mean he could never really escape the pain of losing her, and having it happen a third time would crush him. Although saddened, Anna accepts his decision, but reminds him that underneath all the fame&mdash;which is really just nonsense&mdash; she is "also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."  Will meets his friends in a restaurant with the opened gift&mdash;the original ''La Mariée''. They take turns supporting his decision to end the relationship by (halfheartedly) pointing out Anna's flaws. When Spike enters and is told what happened, he promptly calls Will a "daft prick". Will reiterates Anna's last comment and realizes his mistake. They pile into Max's car and race across [[London]] to Anna's hotel, where they find that she has checked out and is holding a press conference at the [[Savoy Hotel]]. When Will arrives, Anna's publicist is telling the crowd that Anna will be taking time off from making films and leaving the UK that night. Will, pretending to be a reporter again, admits he made the wrong decision and begs Anna to reconsider. After admitting she would, Anna announces that she will be staying in Britain "indefinitely." Anna and Will smile at one another from across the room as the press goes into a frenzy. A montage shows their wedding and arrival at one of Anna's movie premieres, before ending with them on a bench in the private garden, Will reading to a visibly pregnant Anna.  
October Sky
   In October 1957, news of the [[Soviet Union]]'s launch of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' reaches the town of [[Coalwood, West Virginia|Coalwood]], where most people work in the coal mines. As the townspeople gather outside on the night of the broadcast, they see the satellite orbit across the sky. [[Homer Hickam|Homer H. Hickam Jr.]], filled with awe, sets out to build his own rockets to hopefully get out of Coalwood. His family and classmates' do not respond kindly, especially his father John (the mine superintendent), who wants Homer to join him in the mines.  Despite this, Homer eventually teams up with math geek Quentin Wilson, who also has an interest in [[aerospace engineering|rocket engineering]]; with the support of his friends, Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman O'Dell, and their science teacher, [[Freida J. Riley|Miss Frieda J. Riley]] — known as Miss Riley, the four construct small rockets. While their first launches are failures, they experiment with new fuels and designs and eventually succeed. The local paper runs a story about them after a few of their launches. Nevertheless, they are accused of starting a [[Wildfire|forest fire]] with an astray rocket and are arrested. After John picks up Homer, Roy Lee is beaten up by his abusive [[Stepfamily|stepfather]], Vernon. John intervenes and rescues Roy Lee, warning Vernon that he will protect Roy Lee as Roy Lee's late father would have.  The four abandon rocketry and destroy their launch site. After a [[Mining accident|mine disaster]], John is injured while rescuing other men. One of the miners, Ike Bykovsky, a machine shop worker who let Homer use the shop for rocketry and transferred for better pay, is killed. Homer drops out of high school and works the mine to provide for the family while his father recovers.  Later, Homer is inspired to look at a rocket science book Miss Riley has given him, learning how to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. Using this, he and Quentin locate the rocket while proving that it could not have caused the fire, as it was unable to travel that far. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal, Mr. Turner, who follows up and identifies the catalyst as a [[flare]] from a nearby airfield. Homer returns to school by special invitation; the boys return to rocketry and win the school [[science fair]]. This wins them the opportunity to participate in the National Science Fair in [[Indianapolis]]. As only one of them can go there, they elect Homer.  Meanwhile, the workers' union goes on strike against John. That night, when the family eats dinner, Vernon shoots into the kitchen and misses John. Homer and Jim express their concern to their father, but John dismisses their fears. Fed up, Homer confronts his father, and a heated argument ensues. The mines are set to close down and there is nothing but trouble and no future for Homer in the mines. He resents his father's pressures to follow in the mine work and storms out of the house, vowing to never return.  At the fair, Homer's display is received very well. After a scheduled few days show, the prizes are to be awarded, and Homer enjoys top popularity and some sightseeing. Overnight, someone steals his machined rocket part model – the [[de Laval nozzle]] – as well as his autographed picture of [[Wernher von Braun|Dr. Wernher von Braun]]. Homer makes an urgent phone call home for help. His mother, Elsie, implores John to end the ongoing strike so that Mr. Bolden, Bykovsky's replacement, can use the mine's machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John relents when Elsie, fed up with his lack of support for their son, threatens to leave him. With the town's support, Homer wins the top prize and is bombarded with scholarship offers from colleges. He is also congratulated by his inspiration, von Braun, but does not realize the engineer's identity until he has gone.  Homer returns to Coalwood as a hero and visits Miss Riley, who is dying of [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's disease]]. A launch of their largest rocket yet (the ''Miss Riley'') is the last scene of the film. John, who never attended any of the launchings, attends and is given the honor of pushing the launch button. The ''Miss Riley'' reaches an altitude of  — higher than the summit of [[Mount Everest]]. As the crowd (and the rest of the town) looks up to the skies, John slowly puts his hand on Homer's shoulder and smiles, showing Homer that he is proud of him.  At the end of the film, a series of vignettes reveals the true outcomes of the main characters' lives.  
Not One Less
 Thirteen-year-old Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village to substitute for the village's only teacher (Gao Enman) while he takes a month's leave to care for his ill mother. When Gao discovers that Wei does not have a high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.   When Wei begins teaching, she has little rapport with the students: they shout and run around instead of copying their work, and the class troublemaker, Zhang Huike, insists that "she's not a teacher, she's Wei Chunzhi's big sister!" After putting the lesson on the board, Wei usually sits outside, guarding the door to make sure no students leave until they have finished their work. Early in the month, a sports recruiter comes to take one athletic girl, Ming Xinhong, to a special training school; unwilling to let any students leave, Wei hides Ming, and when the village mayor (Tian Zhenda) finds her, Wei chases after their car in a futile attempt to stop them; and yet they, the sports recruiter and mayor, first notice and comment on Wei's running ability, endurance, and tenacity.   One day, after trying to make the troublemaker Zhang apologize for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of [[Zhangjiakou]]. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.  {{Location map+|China|float=right|caption=Location of [[Zhangjiakou]], relative to [[Beijing]]|places=   |alt=Map of China, with Zhangjiakou and Beijing marked. The cities are close together in northeast China; Zhangjiakou is slightly northwest of Beijing.}}  In the city, Wei finds the people that Zhang was supposed to be working with, only to discover that they had lost him at the train station days before. She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the [[public address system]] and "missing person" posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as "a man with glasses". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street. The next day the station manager (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the gate again, through his window, and lets her in, scolding the receptionist for making her wait outside.  Although Wei has no money to run an ad on TV,  the station manager is interested in her story and decides to feature Wei in a talk show special about rural education. On the talk show, Wei is nervous and hardly says a word when the host (Li Fanfan) addresses her, but Zhang—who has been wandering the streets begging for food—sees the show. After Wei and Zhang are reunited, the station manager arranges to have them driven back to Shuiquan village, along with a truckload of school supplies and donations that viewers had sent in. Upon their return, they are greeted by the whole village. In the final scene, Wei presents the students with several boxes of colored chalk that were donated, and allows each student to write one character on the board. The film ends with a series of title cards that recount the actions of the characters  after the film ends, and describe the problem of poverty in rural education in China.  
The Nuttiest Nutcracker
 A retelling of ''The Nutcracker'', featuring a cast of fruits and vegetables that include Mac the [[macadamia nut]], Gramps the [[walnut]], and Li'l Pea the [[peanut]]. The Sugar Plum Fairy is an actual [[plum]].  
Oi! Warning
 Janosch (Sascha Backhaus) has problems at school and despises the lifestyle of his [[bourgeois]] mother. He runs away from home, to his friend Koma (Simon Goerts), who he had met at a holiday camp. Koma is an [[Oi!]] [[skinhead]] (also known as a [[punk-skinheads|punk-skinhead]]). He is a particular sort of skinhead who has little political motivations, preferring a lifestyle of partying and [[binge drinking]], and whose musical tastes are a synthesis of skinhead and [[punk rock]] music.  Koma's girlfriend is pregnant, and wants him to change his ways. She blows up his secret hideaway with [[dynamite]], but this only infuriates Koma, who blames this on the [[punk subculture|punks]] he had gotten into a fight with previously.  Meanwhile, Janosch meets Zottel (Jens Veith), a punk who earns a living with small [[circus]] acts at wealthy people's parties. The two fall in love, but their happiness is cut short when Koma attacks Zottel and kills him. In a fit of fury, Janosch grabs a brick and slays Koma.  
The Omega Code
  In Jerusalem, a [[rabbi]] named Rostenburg is using software he designed to decode seventy eschatological [[Bible code|prophecies hidden within the Torah]]. Rostenburg has handwritten each one in a journal, to be entered into the program for deciphering. The program deciphers a prophecy which says that he is about to die; immediately, he tears the page containing the final code from his journal, hiding it in his shirt pocket. He is then shot and killed by an assassin, who takes his journal and the [[optical disc]] containing the decoding program. After the assassin leaves, two mysterious men (later revealed to be [[Two witnesses|two prophets]]) retrieve the journal page Rostenburg had hidden.  Television reporter and talk show host Cassandra Barris ([[Catherine Oxenberg]]) introduces Dr. Gillen Lane ([[Casper Van Dien]]) as her show's guest. Lane is a popular author and charismatic motivational speaker who explains that codes hidden in the Old Testament describe events past, present, and future; he sees no contradiction between this belief and his dismissal of religious faith.  Media mogul and European Union Chairman Stone Alexander ([[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]) receives a humanitarian award in [[Rome]] for having all but eliminated world hunger through advances in nutritional technology. There, we see that the man who killed Rostenburg and stole his decoding software is Alexander's apprentice, Dominic ([[Michael Ironside]]). Dr. Lane is in attendance, seeking to meet with Alexander "to discuss some ideas." Cassandra, employed by one of Alexander's television networks, is also in attendance, providing Lane brief conversation after Alexander spurns him. Some time afterward, however, Alexander sees a prophecy (deciphered with Rostenberg's program) that leads him to ask Lane to become his Minister of Information.  Using each prophecy Rostenburg's program deciphers to guide him, Alexander works toward world domination by whatever means he deems necessary, including secretly arranging for the bombings of Muslim and Jewish holy sites in Israel. Reporting from Jerusalem, Cassandra is caught up in one of the blasts. The two prophets from Rostenburg's study take her from the rubble, telling her that they have "a message for [her] to carry".  Alexander goes on to use the sites' rebuilding to help forge a groundbreaking Middle East peace treaty. Not long thereafter, most national governments agree to join a ten-state "World Union", of which Alexander is chairman. Lane finds fulfillment in his new position, though he regrets not being able to be with his estranged wife and young daughter.  Cassandra delivers to Lane a warning that the prophets gave her, though he is skeptical. Nevertheless, the warning leads Lane to discover the decoding facility where Alexander's staff uses Rostenburg's program. No one else is in the facility at the time, but Lane sees that the program is running, and leafs through printouts of previously deciphered codes. Seeing Lane on a surveillance feed, Alexander and Dominic go to confront him. A disillusioned Lane accuses Alexander of "following the code like a script," and being behind the Israeli bombings. Confessing to Lane's charges, Alexander asks him to be "my spokesman for this new world, my visionary, my [[The Beast (Revelation)#Beast from the earth|prophet]]." Believing himself to be the only rightful aspirant to the position, Dominic pulls his gun on Lane, who flees. Firing repeatedly at Lane, Dominic inadvertently shoots Alexander in the head, mortally wounding him. Dominic immediately alerts security, claiming that Lane shot Alexander and fled. Lane escapes Alexander's compound, but becomes the target of a worldwide manhunt. Alexander is pronounced dead at a local hospital.  Lane runs into a sympathetic Cassandra, who agrees to smuggle him onto a network jet so that he can return to his family in [[Los Angeles]]. Meanwhile, Satan enters Alexander's body in the hospital, causing his head wound to heal miraculously and the World Union chairman to rise from the dead. Seven of the ten World Union leaders agree that Alexander will be appointed "Chancellor of the United World" in a ceremony to be held at the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem, coincident with the reopening of [[Solomon's Temple]]. In Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Lane cannot be safely reunited with his family, which is under heavy surveillance. He and Cassandra end up flying back to Jerusalem, where the prophets give him the page of Rostenburg's journal containing the final code. Immediately thereafter, Cassandra pulls a gun on Lane, demanding the code and revealing that she is loyal to Alexander.  At the ceremony in Jerusalem, Chairman Alexander (now Chancellor Alexander) proclaims that he has become "both king and god!" The crowd is upset by this statement, with some devout Jewish and Muslim listeners denouncing him as a blasphemer. Out of the growing tumult, the two prophets appear inside the temple, identifying Alexander as the [[Abomination of Desolation]], quoting [[Good News (Christianity)|evangelistic]] biblical prophecies, and predicting that they would be resurrected three days after their deaths. Alexander has Dominic kill them both, and put them on display as an example of what happens to those who oppose him. He leaves for his compound in Rome, as Dominic relays word to him that "the Israelis and several others are seceding." Alexander plots a massive military action, including a nuclear strike.  Alexander meets Cassandra, who gives him the final code; when he examines the writing, it evaporates from the page supernaturally. Alexander accuses her of conspiring with Lane (who is being detained on-site). The two of them go to Lane's holding cell, where Dominic violently interrogates him as to the whereabouts of the final code. Lane is truly ignorant of its whereabouts, causing the interrogation to reach an impasse. Lane is left alone in his cell. In his solitude, demons swirl around him, tormenting him; Lane prays, "God ... Jesus, save me." Immediately, the demons are scattered, Lane's cell door opens, and he exits. Meanwhile, the two prophets are resurrected.  Lane, trying to find Alexander, runs into Dominic instead. Dominic is about to kill him when the two prophets supernaturally appear. They strangle Dominic without touching him, and give Lane the journal page with the final code. Lane takes Dominic's gun and confronts Alexander, who, with Cassandra at his side, is about to commence the attack. Alexander uses this as a bargaining chip to get Lane to give him the final code; Lane agrees, typing it into Rostenburg's program for deciphering. Once he does, however, Alexander reveals that he never intended to call off the attack, and now, with the final code, will begin his massive war. Just as Alexander is about to give the final authorization to attack, a blindingly brilliant and pure white light appears on the horizon, expanding like a shockwave through the entire surrounding area. As it reaches Alexander's war room, its appearance is accompanied by a strong wind. While Lane stands safely and peacefully within it, it blows through Alexander violently enough to cause Satan to fly behind him. Initially attempting to grasp onto Alexander's shoulders for stability, Satan is finally blown away, out of sight. At this point, Alexander reaches behind his ear and finds that his hand is bloodied; his head wound was restored after Satan was ejected from him, leaving him dead again.  The shockwave of light spreads to cover the entire Earth, then grows in brightness and intensity such that it causes the entire screen to remain white for a few seconds. This effect ends with a fade to the printer in Alexander's facility, the output tray of which bears a freshly-printed page with Rostenburg's final code, deciphered as follows: "0000 ... Dawn of New [[Millennialism|Millennium]]".  
Olympic Garage
 The film tells of Maria ([[Antonella Costa]]), a political activist in an Argentine organization that is fighting the oppressive military dictatorship during the [[Dirty War]].  She also teaches reading and writing in the suburbs of [[Buenos Aires]] in a blighted area.  She lives in a decrepit rooming house with her mother Diane ([[Dominique Sanda]]), who rents out some rooms.  One of the lodgers is a young man named Felix ([[Carlos Echevarría]]), who's in love with Maria, and rather shy.  Felix seems to have come from nowhere and is supposed to work as  a watchman in a garage. One morning, Maria is kidnapped by a military squad in civilian clothes in front of her mother and is taken to the garage ''Olimpo,'' one of the many well-known torture places in the middle of Buenos Aires, which operate to the general indifference of the local citizens.  As soon as Maria is captured the film's mood becomes uncomfortable and the atmosphere is minimalist.  Tigre, who's the head of the center ([[Enrique Piñeyro (actor)|Enrique Piñeyro]]), appoints Felix, their best torturer, to make Maria talk.  Yet, Felix is overcome by his feelings for Maria, and Maria is determined to exploit the situation with Felix for her survival.  
The Old Man and the Sea (1999 film)
 The film follows the plot of the original novel, but at times emphasizes different points. It opens with the dream sequence of an old man named Santiago, who dreams about his childhood on the masts of a ship and lions on the shores.  When he wakes up, we find out that he has gone 84 days without catching any fish at all. He is apparently so [[luck|unlucky]] that his young [[apprentice]], Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the old man and been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen. Still dedicated to the old man, however, the boy visits Santiago's shack in the morning. The next day, before sunrise, Santiago and Manolin make their way to the seashore. Santiago says that he will venture far out into the Gulf to fish. Manolin wants to come, but Santiago insists on going alone.  After venturing far out, Santiago sets his lines and soon catches a small fish which he decides to use as bait. A big fish that he is sure is a [[marlin]] takes his bait. Unable to pull in the great marlin, Santiago instead finds the fish pulling his skiff. An unspecified number of days pass in this manner, during which the old man bears the tension of the line with his body. On one night, Santiago dreams of his youth, of how he won an arm wrestling match against the strongest black man in town.  On another night, though he is wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago dreams that he and the marlin are brothers, swimming through the ocean together. An extended fantasy sequence is animated here by Petrov. Suddenly, he is woken up; the marlin tries to take advantage of the situation and escape. As the fish jumps out of the water, the old man sees for the first time just how big it is.  Eventually, the fish begins to circle the skiff, indicating his tiredness to the old man. With each circle, Santiago tries to pull it in a little closer. As the fish swims under the boat, Santiago manages to stab the marlin with a [[harpoon]], thereby ending the long battle.  Santiago straps the marlin to his skiff and heads home, triumphant. However, in a short while, [[shark]]s are attracted to the trail of blood left by the marlin in the water. Santiago kills one with his harpoon, losing that weapon in the process. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his [[knife]] to the end of an [[oar]] to help ward off the next line of sharks and manages to kill a few more. Soon, however, the sharks have devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving only its skeleton. The old man castigates himself for sacrificing the marlin.  The next morning, a group of fishermen gathers around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. Manolin, worried during the old man's endeavor, brings him food and drink and finds the old man lying in his cabin. When he wakes, he tells him that they had boats searching for him and that his parents allowed him to fish together once again.

He finds out who Mamman's kid is by accident. He makes the school principal ([[Seema (actress)|Seema]]) call Mamman saying that his daughter is affected by rabies after a dog bite. Mamman rushes to see his kid, falling for the trap that Antony has set for him.  
Onegin (film)
 In early 19th century Russia, a bored St Petersburg socialite named Onegin inherits his uncle's estate in the country. There, he meets a neighbouring landowner and poet and a widowed mother and her two daughters. The poet is engaged to the elder daughter. Her sister writes Onegin a passionate love letter but is cruelly spurned by him. His flirtatious attentions towards the poet's fiancée lead to a duel and the death of the poet. Onegin disappears. On his return, six years later, he encounters the woman he spurned, who is now married to a prince. Onegin begs her forgiveness for his past behaviour.<ref name="Onegin &#124; BFI &#124; BFI"></ref> The film compresses the events of the novel somewhat; for example, the Naming Day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin's speech to Tatyana. As a result, Onegin's reasons for dancing with Olga and insulting Lensky are left somewhat confusing. Much like the [[Eugene Onegin#Film|1988 film version]], ''Onegin'' gives the impression that, during the duel sequence, Onegin shoots to kill.  
One Man's Hero
 The story centers around Sgt. John Riley and 16 men of his [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] battalion who (against military law) are whipped for "[[desertion]]" only because they had traveled&mdash;without an explicit permission&mdash;to the Mexican side of the border to fulfill their religious obligation to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and because they are thought to be "[[Papist]]s" whose loyalty is ''[[ipso facto]]'' suspect in the eyes of their [[Protestantism|Protestant]] commanders. Sgt. Riley, with regard for the safety and well-being of his men, releases them at gun-point from the lash. He escorts them across the border to Mexico to hopefully find at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] a ship back to Ireland, only to be violently captured by the revolutionary [[Juan Cortina]] as enemies of Mexico. Riley, wounded in his thigh, is nursed by Cortina's woman Marta. As Cortina considers what to eventually do with Riley and his men, news arrives that the [[U.S.-Mexican War|U.S. and Mexico are now at war]], and if they are captured they could be hanged. Because of this, the Irish deserters are presented with the choice of joining and fighting on the side of the Mexican revolutionaries under Cortina, or be executed by him as enemies of his country.  Cortina and his forces are soon taken by Col. Maximo Nexor, commander of the Republican Army of the Mexican Government, and given the choice of fighting for [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] against the aggressor U.S. Army, or be executed as [[treason|traitors]] and bandits. Cortina reluctantly surrenders himself and his revolutionaries under Nexor's command. Riley is made a captain, in charge of all the Irish-immigrant U.S. soldiers who have come over to the Mexican side in increasingly large numbers, (as General [[Zachary Taylor]] puts it, "''because of sex, saints and sadism''"). For encouragement they are given their own green flag as the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]].  Several key battle engagements are highlighted, with dates, and a [[cease-fire]] is reached. Meanwhile, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] is threatening to [[impeachment|impeach]] President [[James K. Polk|Polk]] as world opinion turns against U.S. aggression and the invasion of the Republic of Mexico. The cease-fire is soon violated and hostilities resume. Gen. Zachary Taylor, unlike Gen. [[Winfield Scott]], deplores the war, but he obeys his commander-in-chief.  As it becomes increasingly evident that the war is being lost by Mexico, Riley's men debate what to do. There is a difference between desertion and treason. Those who deserted before the war and are taken back to the U.S. will be lashed and branded; those who deserted after the declaration of war will be hanged as traitors. They decide to die as men fighting for freedom. When they finally lose, Cortina has escaped with many of his forces, and the Irish are taken prisoner. Many of them are still officially British citizens, having never yet been granted the U.S. citizenship they had first been promised for enlisting in the U.S. Army. General Winfield Scott utterly rejects the appeal of the Mexican Government, presented by Col. Nexor, to recognize Riley's men as Mexican citizens and [[prisoners of war]]; protests have come in from all the nations of the world denouncing their punishment as barbaric and an utter contradiction of the principles of the [[American Revolution]]. Scott is adamant: the deserters will be lashed and branded, and forced to watch those condemned as traitors hanged, whose heads will be forcibly faced in the direction of [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]] to watch the taking of that stronghold and the sight of the lowering of the Mexican flag and the raising of the Stars and Stripes, so that this will be their last sight—they will be hanged at that instant.  On the day of their execution, in sight of the men on the scaffold, Riley is lashed with a [[cat-o-nine-tails]]: 50 strokes.  He is then branded on his right cheek with a large letter '''D''' "''just below the eye, so not to impair his vision.''" The soldier ordered to wield the red-hot brand is told to do it quickly, as "Riley must be conscious when it is done!". Visibly shaken, the soldier sears the brand into Riley's face upside down (backward). He is harshly reprimanded, then told to "''do it right!''", but he vomits and faints, and Riley is branded on his left cheek by the officer in charge of punishment. Riley is then forced to watch the executions ordered by Scott. He loudly cries out encouragement to them, who shout back as they are hanged.  Some time afterward, while working in a [[stone quarry]] for [[POW|military prisoner]]s, Riley is told by his former U.S. commander that he has been freed, to which he responds, "I have always been free". Riley returns to Mexico, locates Cortina, and finds Marta still alive. She still has the green flag of the St. Patrick's Battalion. Cortina recognizes her love for Riley and departs. Riley and Marta disappear into the wilderness. The epilogue explains that Gen. Winfield Scott, who had hoped to become President of the U.S., was defeated, and Gen. Zachary Taylor, who only wanted peace, was elected. To this day the St. Patrick's Battalion has been honored annually by Mexico and Ireland.  
One Soldier
 The film is told entirely in retrospect, from a veteran of the [[American Civil War]] who may already have been executed. During the war, his job was to play music for a general who decided, in the soldier's words, "where hundreds of men would die."  He has come home from the war skeptical about the meaning of life (or that there is a meaning), and trying to search for answers. He attempts to express his thoughts and doubts to his wife Becky, but she remains unconvinced that life is horrible and thinks he is crazy and going to hell. Convinced that people have come to have too much influence over art, he tries to play music not written by people by drawing music lines on his glasses and playing the stars as if they were notes. He also tries to get in touch with [[God]], but, not wanting to be intrusive, he merely hangs about outside the church and whispers through the windows, "God...hey, God...what're you doin'?"  Finally, after many hints, it is revealed why he is sentenced to death: he fought in the war because a rich man paid him to fight in his (the rich man's) place. When the rich man showed up to see how he was fighting, he found the soldier standing and playing the [[concertina]] during a battle. The rich man gave him a gun and started yelling at him, so in frustration the soldier shot the rich man instead of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]], picked up the concertina, and left him lying in the field. "He killed the wrong man in the war."  As he is about to be executed, the soldier has an epiphany: "My God...I wasted my whole life thinking about this stuff. I should have just gone fishing!  I should have had a sandwich, or had a few laughs!  ''Now'' I get it!" His illumination is cut off by the firing squad.  He, perhaps in some sort of spirit form, walks through a graveyard and muses, "I'm gonna miss being alive." The  credits follow.  
One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich
 The film combines clips from Tarkovsky's films with footage of Tarkovsky on the set of his last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' and on his deathbed, during the final stage of his battle with cancer. The film mostly relies on images, with only sparse commentary, and concentrates mainly on giving insight into Tarkovsky's work and philosophy and on exploring the intersections between his private life and his work. The film starts with a scene from Tarkovsky first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' and ends with a parallel scene from his last film ''The Sacrifice''. It shows the reunion of Tarkovsky with his son Andrei Jr., who had been allowed to leave the [[Soviet Union]] only after Tarkovsky was diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]].<ref name="slavicreview" /> Apart from Andrei Tarkovsky himself the film shows, among others, his second wife [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]], his son Andrei Jr., the editor of the film ''The Sacrifice'' [[Michal Leszczylowski]], the French actress [[Valérie Mairesse]], the Swedish cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]] and the Russian actress [[Margarita Terekhova]].<ref></ref>  
The Firing Squad
 A woman tries to obtain justice for a friend and instead finds she and her friends are in grave danger in this crime drama.  
Our Friend, Martin
 Miles ([[Robert Ri'chard]]) is a wisecracking [[African American]] boy who is an avid fan of sports, particularly [[baseball]] icon [[Hank Aaron]], but is failing at school. His teacher Mrs. Clark ([[Susan Sarandon]]) threatens Miles that she will make him repeat 6th grade should his grades not improve. He and his class, including his friends, two [[White American|Caucasian]] boys Randy ([[Lucas Black]]) and former bully Kyle ([[Zachary Leigh]]) and a [[Latino]] girl Maria ([[Jessica Garcia]]), visit a museum, dedicated to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. Randy and Miles explore Martin's bedroom, and are caught by the museum's curator Mrs. Peck ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), who winds up an old watch. The boys hold Martin's baseball glove and the two are transported back to 1941 and encounter a 12-year-old Martin ([[Theodore Borders]]) playing with his friends, Sam and Skip Dale ([[Adam Wylie]]), until their mother ([[Ashley Judd]]) arrives and reprimands her sons for integrating with the "[[colored people|coloreds]]".  Martin explains to Miles and Randy that Mrs. Dale's hatred of black people stems from the fact she regards them as "different", but violence would only worsen things.  The boys then travel 3 years in time and meet a teenage Martin ([[Jaleel White]]) on a segregated train. He explains to them that blacks and whites are unable to integrate and must use separate [[Public toilet|bathrooms]], [[restaurants]], and [[waiting room]]s. They later have dinner with Martin's family and while he goes to do shut in rounds with his father ([[James Earl Jones]]), the boys travel forward 11 years and meet Martin ([[LeVar Burton]]), who by now is in his 20s and works as a minister at the church. He is holding a meeting about the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], set off after [[Rosa Parks]], a black seamstress refused to give up her seat on a bus and was put in prison for it. As a result, no black adults or children will ride the buses. Just then, Turner ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), Martin's friend, alerts him his house has been bombed. He races home, where his wife [[Coretta Scott King]] and newborn daughter [[Yolanda King|Yolanda]] have escaped unharmed.  Turner announces that in retaliation, they will attack the perpetrators with bricks, guns, [[Molotov cocktail]]s and knives, but Martin stops him, reminding the crowd of [[Gandhi]] peacefully standing his ground to exile the British colonies from [[India]] and of [[Jesus]] teaching love for his enemies. Miles and Randy then travel to the [[Birmingham riot of 1963]] and witness firemen and police officers squirt black protesters with hoses and release [[German Shepherd]]s on them. The boys are later transported back to the museum and join their class back at school. The following day, Miles and Randy tell Miss Clark about the events prior to Martin's work and later the class watch a [[VHS tape]] of Martin's work. After the class leaves, Maria and Kyle decide to investigate for themselves how Miles and Randy got the information. When the boys arrive at the museum, Mrs. Peck lets them stay but warns them that when one messes with the past, this can affect the present.  Maria and Kyle follow the two boys in and catch them in Martin's bedroom.  The four children are then transported to the [[March on Washington Movement]] and meets Martin who is in his 30s ([[Dexter Scott King]]) along with a young white woman, whom they realize is a younger version of Mrs. Clark. When they return, Miles discovers that Martin was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|murdered]]. The children travel back to 1941 and bring the 12-year-old Martin back to the present. When they return, only Miles and Martin return together and the present is different. They discover that the museum is now just a burned down house. They also find out Randy and Kyle are also racists and no longer friends with Miles or know him. His middle school is segregated and named after [[Robert E. Lee]], Miss Clark is treated poorly by the principal and Maria works as a maid and can't speak English. He and his mother ([[Angela Bassett]]) live in poverty as she now works as a cleaning lady. The next day Miles cannot understand what is going on but Martin figures out because he left his own time, it created an alternate timeline where his civil rights work never happened. Miles realizes the error of his ways and must sacrifice his plans to rescue Martin. Miles bids a tearful farewell, but realizes he still has Martin's watch and begs for him to come out of his house. Martin returns to his time, where he is shot and killed at his hotel. This results in the present reverting to normal and Miles is reunited with Randy, Maria, and Kyle. Mrs. Peck knows about Miles time traveling and tells him that while they cannot change the past as long as they remember Martin and what he stood for he will always be with them. He receives an A+ on his history test, allowing him to progress to 7th grade. He and his friends then vow to continue Martin's work. At the end of the film, Mrs. Peck closes the door to Martin's bedroom as the credits roll.  
The Other Sister
 After receiving a well-earned certification from a [[Special Education|sheltered boarding school]], Carla Tate ([[Juliette Lewis]]), an ambitious and mildly [[mentally disabled]] young woman, returns home to her  over-protective and slightly snobby mother Elizabeth ([[Diane Keaton]]). Elizabeth seems to act as if she is embarrassed about her youngest daughter's disability. During family discussions, Elizabeth adopts an uneasy attitude. Carla's father Radley ([[Tom Skerritt]]) is a dentist and recovering alcoholic. Carla's ambition is to seek more independence from her family by earning a diploma from a trade school. When Carla meets another mentally disabled student, Daniel McMann (nicknamed "Danny") ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]), they become friends and soon fall in love together. Envying Danny's freedom, Carla convinces her parents she is capable of living on her own and moves into her own [[apartment]]. After a time, Carla and Danny become sexually active together.  Danny's independence is financially compromised when his wealthy and emotionally detached father abruptly stops sending subsistence money. Danny begins to realize that the independence he enjoyed comes with a staggering cost. Danny gets drunk, then seeks solace and insight (and a joyride in a vintage [[Ford Mustang]] convertible) from his landlord and friend, Ernie ([[Hector Elizondo]]).  During a Christmas party at the country club, Danny, nervous about his personal lot, drinks too much to build up his courage to declare his love for Carla. He is also telling everyone about their first time [[sexual intercourse|making love]]. A humiliated Carla bursts into tears, screaming at everyone to stop laughing at her. Although Daniel did not intend to embarrass Carla, she nonetheless refuses to see him. Over time, Carla realizes she still loves Danny and wants to see him again despite her mother's advising her otherwise. At her older sister Caroline's ([[Poppy Montgomery]]) [[wedding]], Danny surprises Carla by showing up at the church. Also, he is asking Carla to marry him, in a scene mimicking ''[[The Graduate]]'', the couple's favorite film.    Everyone supports their wishes except Elizabeth, who is unsure Danny can take care of himself, let alone Carla, who becomes angry with her. Carla angrily tells her mother off that she is sick of her three behaviors: dominance, negativity, and doubt. Also, Carla is sick of her mother treating her like both an embarrassment and a handicap. Radley and her sisters Heather ([[Sarah Paulson]]) and Caroline support her decision, and the wedding is planned. At first, Elizabeth is determined not to attend, but Radley admonishes her. He said that he will walk Carla down the aisle and finally, she relents. Outside the church, Danny surprises Carla with a marching band playing a song from ''[[The Music Man]]''... and they are chauffeured away to their honeymoon in Ernie's prized Mustang.  
The Other Conquest
 On November 8, 1519 the Spanish Conqueror Hernando Cortés and his small army rode into the Aztec capital of the vast Aztec Empire, where they were welcomed by the Emperor Moctezuma. Within two years, the Aztec civilization was in a state of collapse, the survivors having lost their families, homes, language, temples... and gods  ''The Other Conquest'' opens in May 1520 when Topiltzin (Damián Delgado), a skillful Aztec scribe who is one of Moctezuma's illegitimate sons, survives the Massacre of the Great Temple by hiding under a corpse. After the Spaniards leave the sacred site, he finds his people dead, including his mother.  By 1526, Topiltzin is still striving to preserve the cult of [[Tonantzin]], based upon the Aztec [[Mother Goddess]]. When a squadron commanded by Captain Cristóbal (Honorato Magaloni) and Friar Diego (José Carlos Rodríguez) discover the clandestine human sacrifice of a beautiful Aztec princess, two incompatible ways of life come face to face... and violence erupts. Topiltzin manages to escape by making Friar Diego believe he is drawn to the statue of the Virgin Mary that accompanies the Spaniards wherever they go. He is eventually captured and presented to Hernando Cortés (Iñaki Aierra), who has just returned from an ill-fated campaign to Las Hibueras (today's [[Honduras]]). In an attempt to create a hybrid empire, Cortés has taken Emperor Moctezuma's daughter and heiress, the notorious [[Tecuichpo]] (Elpidia Carrillo), as his new mistress and interpreter. She reveals that Topiltzin is her half-brother, and a skeptical Cortés spares the young man's life, but in turn decides to convert him to the new Spanish ways with the aid of Tecuichpo (from now on, Doña Isabel) and Friar Diego. After being subject to a brutal ritual of conversion, Topiltzin (now called Tomás) is confined in the Franciscan Monastery of Our Lady of Light.  Five years later (1531), under the tutelage of Friar Diego, Tomás is struggling to reconcile two worlds which could hardly be more different but which also share some basic truths. However, Friar Diego realizes that Tomás and Doña Isabel are forging Cortés's correspondence with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], King of Spain. Things become even worse when Friar Diego discovers them making love inside the monastery, in a desperate attempt to perpetuate their race. Friar Diego takes it upon himself to save Tomás's soul, and asks Cortés to keep Doña Isabel from returning to the monastery. A pregnant Doña Isabel is secluded in a dungeon.  The overwhelming absence of his half-sister erodes what is left of Tomás's world. He falls into a state of desolation and illness. A well-meaning Indian nun ([[Zaide Silvia Gutiérrez]]) applies medieval remedies to him, but these only help turn his feverish attacks into [[hallucinations]] that merge Christian and Aztec imagery. Tomás has a vision whereby the Virgin Mary is revealed as the Aztec Mother Goddess.  The arrival of the statue of the Virgin Mary in the monastery, a token of gratitude from Cortés to Friar Diego, now causes Tomás to become genuinely drawn to the statue as a substitute for all he has lost, and he sets on a personal crusade to conquer her. If he absorbs her powers, if he fuses with her, redemption will follow.  Is the Indian's conversion real? Or is Tomás trying to retain his own beliefs under the guise of the new creed? Will he be able to survive with his sanity intact? These questions start revolving in Friar Diego's head, and although he puts many obstacles to keep Tomás from entering the sacristy and consummating his obsession with the statue, he finally allows Providence to decide whether Tomás's mission is legitimate or not. So who is in fact converting whom? Maybe the greatest mystery in the history of beliefs is how certain unorthodox encounters make us continue believing...

Operacja Samum
 The film takes place after the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990. The film opens with retired Major Józef Mayer in a doctor’s office in Warsaw.  Mayer is a former agent of the [[Urząd Ochrony Państwa|Polish Office for State Protection]] (UOP), the main Polish intelligence agency. Mayer’s doctor tells him that he may die from an unspecified disease. The film then shifts to Baghdad, Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raid a CIA safehouse maintained by CIA agent Jeff Magnus. Walton and his two other CIA agents manage to escape into hiding as they prepare to leave Iraq before a possible war. Walton is warned by a Polish-American [[Mossad]] agent named Karen Pierce to leave Iraq immediately.  Meanwhile, Pierce is having an affair with Mayer’s son Paweł, who is a Polish engineer working in Iraq. Paweł is detained and Pierce escapes after they are stopped by Iraqi secret police. While in a military prison, Paweł is tortured for not disclosing Pierce’s location to the Iraqis. The Iraqis suspect that Paweł is a spy.  Józef Mayer is summoned to UOP.  The head official of the agency informs Mayer that his son has gone missing after meeting Pierce.  Mayer then inquires to an attaché of the American Embassy in Warsaw regarding the whereabouts of Karen Pierce.  The film shifts back to Iraq, where two Polish UOP agents, Edward Broński and Stanisław Kosiński, are inquiring on the whereabouts of Pierce and Mayer’s son.  Mayer manages to discover from his embassy attaché that Pierce is a Mossad agent.  At the same time, Magnus and the other CIA agents prepare to leave Iraq via a helicopter extraction, until their helicopter is shot down. They escape and go back into hiding. In Poland, the head of the UOP meets with Hayes, a high-level official of the CIA.  Because the UOP still has agents in Iraq, Hayes asks the head of the UOP to extract his CIA agents out of Iraq.  Hayes says that if the extraction is successful, Poland’s foreign debts to the United States would be decreased dramatically.  Hayes stresses that his agents must be evacuated out of Iraq, because they hold sensitive materials viable for war.  Meanwhile, Mayer demands to go into Iraq and get his son out, undercover as a construction engineer.  Pierce manages to escape Iraq and meets with the head of Mossad, Shopsovitz.  Shopsovitz reveals that Magnus and his team hold a [[microfilm]] containing [[Saddam Hussein]]’s daily schedules.  Pierce agrees to take the microfilm from Magnus.  In Baghdad, Mayer arrives and meets with Broński and Kosiński.  The agents provide Mayer with an Iraqi driver named Faisal, who is fluent in Polish.  Mayer and Faisal drive to the Iraqi construction site where his son worked.  They discover that Mayer’s son is possibly being held at a nearby police station.  Meanwhile, Pierce goes back into Iraq and receives the Magnus’ microfilm.  The next day, Pierce finds Broński in Baghdad and gives him information on the location of the CIA agents.  As Broński and Kosiński head out of the Polish Embassy to find the agents, they are followed by Iraqi secret police.  Kosiński manages to drop out of the car without notice of the secret police agents.  As he heads off on foot, he tracks down the CIA agents in hiding.  Kosiński gets the agents on board of a bus with other Europeans and gets them inside the Polish Embassy without being noticed by the secret police.  Broński and Kosiński give them Polish passports and new cover identities.  Back in Poland, the chiefs of UOP, Mossad and the CIA agree to use Mayer as bait to get the CIA agents out of Iraq.  They want the Iraqis to believe that Mayer is going to get the agents out himself, but in reality he only wants to get his son out.  At the Embassy, Kosiński and the CIA agents leave on a bus towards the border.  Meanwhile, Mayer infiltrates the Iraqi police station and gets his wounded son out.  Kosiński and the agents cross the Iraqi-Turkish border without trouble or raising suspicions.  At another border checkpoint into Turkey, Broński assists Mayer, his son, Pierce and Faisal get across.  Once they cross the border, Pierce is shot and killed by an Iraqi colonel and his troops.  Back in Poland, Mayer, Broński, Kosiński and the UOP chief are awarded medals of distinction at the American Embassy.  As the film closes, Mayer reacquaints with his estranged son.  
Oxygen (1999 film)
 "Harry Houdini" ([[Adrien Brody]]) has kidnapped and buried alive a rich businessman's wife. He demands $1 million in cash from the woman's husband in return for the release of the location of her burial site before she runs out of oxygen. He also states that if police involvement is initiated, he will ensure she is never found alive. As expected, however, police involvement is initiated and Detective Madeline Foster ([[Maura Tierney]]) is assigned with the task of finding the buried woman and catching Houdini.  It is quickly realized though that Houdini, in fact, wanted the police to get involved so he could commit a second kidnapping - that of Foster. When Houdini is finally caught as the result of a car chase involving him and Detective Foster, she attempts to get him to reveal the location of his buried victim. When Foster's initial interrogation of Houdini proves unsuccessful, the FBI are assigned to take over the case, although they do not have any more luck. In a plot twist, it is revealed that Houdini has already committed a murder, that of his accomplice. He now has nothing to lose and the police realize the death of the buried woman would not be as significant as first thought.  However, Houdini offers them a final lifeline - if he is allowed to talk to Foster, alone, he will allow his victim to be recovered alive. The police, now just puppets in Houdini's plan, give into his request. Troubled, Foster begins to reveal her darker side to Houdini and he sees a kindred spirit in her.  Soon after, it is revealed that Houdini was in fact a painter in the police department, and outlined the entire building in a very detailed map. Just as Foster is revealing the truth, Houdini takes her to the place where he buried the first woman. Foster escapes her hold, and releases the woman and takes Houdini's gun, then pushes him inside the coffin. As he taunts Foster, she shoots him rather than burying him.

Outside Providence (film)
  Timothy "Dildo/Dunph" Dunphy ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), is in the Class of 1974 in his high school senior year living in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], comes from a troubled single parent working-class family, and is friends with those that have aspirations which do not exceed smoking marijuana at the water tower that has a view of the town. His father, Pat ([[Alec Baldwin]]), suffers from his wife committing suicide and appears naïve when the boys come back to the Dunphy's house to get a bong. A regularly held poker game is in progress. Pat insists that the boys be respectful and come in to say hello. The boys' intention is undetected by Pat that they are using drugs when Dunph's wheelchair-using younger brother, Jackie (Tommy Bone), attempts to hand off the bong wrapped in Dunph's coat. It falls to the floor. Jackie suggests that it is a musical horn which Pat's friend, Joey ([[George Wendt]]), asks Dunph to demonstrate, only able to make sounds about which Pat is dismissive. Pat's friends chuckle at Pat's reaction. Off the boys go on their adventures.  The guys head home with Dunph at the wheel but he is unable to see the road with the cloud of marijuana smoke filling the cab. He rear-ends a police vehicle. Pat's poker game player, Caveech, uses his influence with a local judge to replace a reform school sentence with the stipulation of parole graduating high school at Cornwall Academy, a Connecticut boys' boarding school with a sister school nearby under the same name. Failure to graduate vacates the terms of parole and he will serve a one year jail sentence.  He meets the rigid dorm master, Mr. Funderburk (Timothy Crowe), who emphases learning the school rules book. Dunph learns that new friend Wheeler and other new schoolmates, a class of people that seem to have more opportunities than himself, are involved in their own mischief just like the boys back home. Billy Fu is one particular example. He is a middle eastern exchange student with "the best reefer on campus". He routinely misses classes without repercussion because his father pledges a large donation to the school on the condition that Billy graduate.  Dunph is no longer just any student at the school when "Drugs" Delaney ([[Jon Abrahams]]), writes Dunph with his particular colorful words and addressing the letter in the most simplest of ways that the school has to open it to learn of the contents; Dunph has low regard for both the school and Mr. Funderburk. Dunph routinely gets sanctioned with work hours as punishment for his school rules transgressions. He also develops a friendship with a sister school student, Jane Weston ([[Amy Smart]]), regarded as "hands down, the coolest girl in school". A romance develops and through her advice he learns about personal fulfillment which could be achieved by an education.  She and others are found out by Mr. Funderburk smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol in a dorm room of the boys' dorm. The incident is resolved, unknown to Dunph's knowledge until too late, with Jane expelled for school rules violations. Dunph feels responsible for dashing Jane's goal of attending [[Brown University]] following graduation. He concludes: Wheeler's acceptance at [[Yale University]] is weighed heavily by a letter of recommendation from Funderburk and Wheeler was caught with marijuana during an earlier raid; therefore Wheeler made his own deal with Funderburk to inform on others which resulted in Jane being expelled. Dunph resolves to see Jane's college plans revitalized by speaking with the Dean at Brown University, as he explains that she was the innocent party in the incident.  Dunph comes to terms with his father's apprehension discussing the death in the family because the latter felt responsible for imposing on her a life that she could not handle; she being too young when they married, depressed and agoraphobic. Dunph refuse to shake Funderburk's hand at the graduation ceremony in the auditorium and exits after asking his classmates for his "luggage". He then meets up with his father and Jackie as they arrive. Pat hands over an acceptance letter from the [[Community College of Rhode Island|Rhode Island Junior College]] where Dunph points out that everyone is accepted although he could then transfer to a "senior college...where people sleep over and shit." Pat congratulates Dunph for being the first of the family to go to college and the younger brother not to be trumped surmises the possibility that it just very well may be that Jackie himself may be the first to graduate.

P.U.N.K.S.
 A research and production company is performing a live human trial for a machine called the “Augmentor 1,000.”  The device is designed for medical use, with an ancillary benefit of enhanced strength.  The machine’s creator, workaholic Pat Utley, objects due to potentially lethal side effects.  Edward Crow, the company owner, overrules him.  The Augmentor is successfully activated but the subject suddenly goes berserk until Pat literally pulls the plug on the device.  Drew, Pat’s teenage son, meets up with friends Miles and Lanny after school.  All three are bullied by jocks; they later commiserate at Drew’s house and decide to form a club to defend themselves.  The next day, Drew and Miles hang out at Pat’s work, and hack into the computer systems for fun.  While Miles browses classified files, Drew overhears Crow demanding that Pat prepare for a motion control Augmentor demonstration.  To ensure his compliance, Pat is ordered to wear the machine for the test or be taken off the project.  Pat reluctantly agrees, despite a problematic heart condition.  Drew concludes they’re trying to get rid of his dad, so Miles tries to find out more about the machine, but they need Crow’s superuser password.  To get it, the three of them recruit Jonny, the school [[hustler]], for their club.  Together, they trick a system supervisor out of the superuser password and download the Augmentor schematics.  Miles determines that an Augmentor user will fry their nervous system in 20 minutes, but Drew’s dad would be dead in only five.  They determine the best way to save Pat is to steal the machine.  To help break into the building, Jonny’s cousin Samantha, a skilled [[Jump start (vehicle)|car boost]] and lockpick, is enlisted.  The team calls themselves the “P.U.N.K.S.,” an acronym formed by the first letters of their surnames, and also stands for their mantra ("to Protect the Underdog with Nerve, Knowledge, and Strength").  During a night raid, they successfully infiltrate the building.  Miles copies and deletes the Augmentor files while Drew and Sam plant an audio bug and tap into a camera feed for surveillance from their “master control.”  A silent alarm attracts guards, and Miles crashes the system with a virus before the teens narrowly escape with the Augmentor.  The day after, they learn from their audio/video feed that Crow has file backups and an Augmentor prototype.  They attempt two public meets to obtain the prototype, but both fail.  Crow organizes an impromptu demonstration for an important investor with Middle Eastern buyer connections which Crow needs, as he has secretly put all of his company’s financial hopes on black market trade.  Frustrated with Pat, Crow decides to test out the prototype Augmentor with the remote control unit personally.  Jonny uses a second motion control suit to embarrass Crow by making him do ridiculous antics.  Furious, Crow threatens to fire Pat unless the real demo goes perfectly.  The victory celebration is cut short when Crow is overheard talking about eliminating the P.U.N.K.S., and mentioning a troublesome FBI agent named “Houlihan.”  Everyone panics and bails except Drew.  He meets Houlihan, falling into a trap set by Crow.  The other P.U.N.K.S. save him at the last minute by radio, and he escapes.  Pat tries to resign, but is drugged and forcibly suited up for the buyer presentation.  Drew returns to “master control,” only to find Crow kidnapped his friends.  He rides in during the demo and rescues his friends and saves his dad.  Crow puts on the Augmentor and fights Drew.  The boy has the upper hand, but runs past his twenty-minute limit and starts losing consciousness.  As Crow prepares to pummel him, Sam intervenes in the motion control suit and has Crow beat himself up.  The police arrive and arrest the criminals.  Back at school, the jocks pick on Miles, but the P.U.N.K.S. unite, and Lanny literally tosses them across the courtyard by using the Augmentor.  On their way home together, Miles reads an article detailing the exposure of Crow’s operation, the arrests, and crediting the “covert team of operatives,” the P.U.N.K.S., for bringing them to justice.  
Padayappa
 Padayappa is an engineer who returns to his village from [[Chennai]] to attend his sister's wedding. His sister is engaged to their maternal uncle's son Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari, her landlady, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. In addition, Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoiled sister, who is madly in love with Padayappa.  Unexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands a share in the family property. Padayappa's father, the chieftain of the village, refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies. Suryaprakash then cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.  Meanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his property is solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother embarrasses Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage proposal made by Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide. When Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her, after which the two marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble and was pulled out by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest keeping the family house, and helps his father's foster brother, who is suffering financially. As a result, Padayappa's father's foster brother becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.  Neelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandraprakash alias Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her to do, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.  Armed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, Padayappa saves her life when he prevents a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.

Peppermint Candy
 At the beginning, the main character Yong-ho wanders to a reunion of his old student group. After causing some general mayhem with his deranged antics, he leaves and climbs atop a nearby train track. Facing an oncoming train, he exclaims "I want to go back again!" What follows is a series of prior events in the main character's life that show how he became the suicidal man portrayed in this scene.  The first flashback takes place only a few days before Yong-ho's death. At this point he is already clearly suicidal, spending the last of his money on a gun and contemplates who he should use it on. After confronting his former business partner and ex-wife Hong-ja, the husband of his teenage crush Sun-im pays him a surprise visit. Yong-ho is taken to visit a [[coma]]tose Sun-im in a hospital, and presents some peppermint candies she used to give him.  The next flashback shows Yong-ho's life five years earlier. At first glance, he seems to be a rather successful businessman, but the problems in his life become clear when he confronts his wife, who is having an [[affair]] with her driving instructor. Yong-ho is unable to claim [[moral high ground]], since he is also shown having an affair, with an assistant from his workplace. Finally, Yong-ho is shown with his wife at their new house, having dinner with his colleagues, where it becomes apparent that the marriage isn't working.  On the third flashback, Yong-ho is shown as a police officer in 1987. At the beginning, he is shown along with his pregnant wife at a mundane scene. After this, he is shown apprehending a witness and brutally [[torture|torturing]] him for information about another man's whereabouts. This leads Yong-ho to [[Kunsan]] where he and his fellow police officers capture the wanted man. While in Kunsan, Yong-ho is distracted from his work by fruitlessly trying to search for Sun-im and instead ends up on a one-night stand with a woman.  The following flashback shows Yong-ho when he is just starting his career as a policeman and is pressured by his peers to torture a crime suspect, presumably a student demonstrator. Shortly afterward, he is visited by Sun-im. Yong-ho coldly and cruelly dismisses her by feigning interest in another woman, his future wife Hong-ja. At the final scene of this sequence, Yong-ho is shown sleeping with Hong-ja, whom it is shown he never truly cared about.  During the next flashback, it's May 1980 and Yong-ho is performing his [[mandatory military service]]. While Sun-im is trying to visit him, his company is taken to quell the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]]. Yong-ho gets shot in the leg and is told to stay behind. This leads to a scene where he confronts a harmless and presumably innocent student, whom he accidentally shoots and kills.  The last flashback shows Yong-ho as a part of the student group that reunited at the beginning of the movie. This is also where he meets Sun-im for the first time. The scene poignantly shows the innocence that Yong-ho had, before his country molded him into the violent and jaded man he is at the start of the film by pitting him against his friends.

His plan to capture the legendary birds [[Moltres]], [[Zapdos]] and [[Articuno]] will ultimately lead to the capture of the "Beast of the Sea" [[Lugia]]. Lawrence sets out in his flying hovercraft to the heart of the Orange Islands to capture the three legendary birds, referred to as the Titans of Fire, Ice and Lightning. He successfully captures Moltres, but this upsets the balance of power the birds have over the world's climate. Weather across the world begins to go haywire, alerting countless Pokémon to the change. [[Ash Ketchum]] and his companions [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]] and [[Tracey Sketchit]] get caught in a freak storm, and are washed ashore on Shamouti, set in the centre of the Orange Islands. Learning that the island festival celebrating the legend is about to begin, Ash is selected as the festival's Chosen One by a girl named Melody, the festival maiden.  At the festival's banquet, Melody explains to Ash he must retrieve three glass balls from each of the legendary birds' islands and take them to Shamouti's shrine, guarded by a talking [[Slowking]], where Melody will end his task by playing the festival's song, actually the song of Lugia. Ash immediately sets out, led by the troubled [[Pikachu]]. Taken to Fire Island by sea captain Maren, Ash and Pikachu find Moltres' treasure, but are interrupted by [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]]. Misty, Tracey and Melody arrive via Melody's multi-purpose boat, followed by Zapdos who has come to claim the island. Lawrence appears overhead, attacking and capturing Zapdos as well as Ash and co. accidentally. Meanwhile, [[Professor Oak]], [[List of characters in the Pokémon anime series#Professors|Professor Ivy]], and Ash's mother [[Delia Ketchum]] fly to the islands but their helicopter crashes on Shamouti. Lawrence frees Ash and the others and attempts to capture Articuno, accidentally awakening Lugia in the process. Trying to foil Lawrence's plans, Ash and the others free Moltres and Zapdos who escape and bring down Lawrence's hovercraft.  Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres engage in all out war, trying to destroy each other. Ash and co. manage to escape, gaining Zapdos' treasure in the process, and are transported back to Shamouti by a mysterious water spout revealed to be Lugia. Lugia at first tries to stop the battle himself, but is outmatched by the birds' powers combined against him. Telepathically he then explains the birds and the weather can be stopped by the legend's Chosen One, actually Ash in reality. Ash agrees to go to Articuno's island to get the final treasure, but his progress is halted by the legendary birds. Team Rocket arrive on a speedboat made from a dingy and the helicopter's discarded propeller, wishing to save the world in order to continue their villainy. The group race up to Articuno's shrine and retrieve the treasure, but before they can escape, the legendary birds appear. They destroy the speedboat before Articuno is knocked out by Moltres and Zapdos. Lugia rescues Ash, Pikachu and Team Rocket, but Team Rocket heroically jump into the sea upon realising they are slowing Lugia down. Lawrence tries to catch Lugia, but Lugia uses its Aeroblast attack to destroy his airship and take out Moltres and Zapdos before collapsing into the sea.  Misty and Tracey rescue Ash and Pikachu, who venture to Shamouti Island's shrine and place the final treasure with the others. Melody plays Lugia's song, ending the storms and bringing peace to the legendary birds. Lugia rises from the sea, bringing the true Beast of the Sea with him, an underwater current that has been altering the climate. Later, after the birds returned to their islands, Lugia departs after thanking Ash. Delia and the professors arrive.  Delia, having witnessed her son's actions, asks him to be more careful which he complies with. Lawrence laments his decisions, deciding to start his collection again. Team Rocket reach the island a day later and are told by Slowking that the [[Breaking the fourth wall|audience]] saw their heroics; the trio contemplates changing their ways but ultimately decide to stay the same when they realize their boss might not like the idea.  
Po Mo Knock Knock
 Two lovers, Knock Knock (Ball) and Who's There (Stiles) confront their difficulties communicating with each other by telling knock knock jokes.  Rather than being puns, as knock knock jokes in the usual sense, the jokes are intended to invoke a sense of postmodern thought, for example, "Knock knock", "Who's there?", "Not only not no one, not even not he" (a parody of "Postmodernism is not only what it is not, it's not even not that", apparently heard by one of Ball's friends in a [[literary theory]] class).  The third member of the love triangle, Vin Knight (played by himself) enters, and the tension rises.  The film ends with Knock Knock asking "Don't you understand that communication is impossible?" and Who's There answering "No".

Play It to the Bone
 Aging [[prizefighter]]s and longtime pals Cesar Dominguez (Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Harrelson) always regretted not getting one last shot. Out of the blue, such an opportunity comes their way — except it is to fight each other.  Boxing promoter Joe Domino (Sizemore) has a problem on his hands. The fighters scheduled to be on his undercard in [[Las Vegas]], a preliminary to a main event featuring heavyweight [[Mike Tyson]], suddenly become unavailable at the last minute. He needs replacements fast, so a call is made to a gym in [[Los Angeles]] to see if Dominguez or Boudreau would be available. Both are. Domino hatches the idea to have them both fight.  The boxers negotiate one condition: the winner will be given a chance to fight for the middleweight championship. Domino agrees, although the untrustworthy promoter is not necessarily a man of his word.  Cesar and Vince have only a day to get to the fight. They decide to drive rather than fly, so they call upon friend Grace (Davidovich) to drive them in her lime green Oldsmobile 442. She has been a love interest of both. Grace's own plan is to pitch her various money-making ideas to Vegas bigshots like hotel and casino boss Hank Goody (Wagner) and raise venture capital. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Liu) whose insults finally result in Grace's flattening her with a solid right cross worthy of her traveling companions.  The fight between the two friends is sparsely attended, ringside fans and celebrities remaining uninterested until the night's main event. Cesar and Vince mix it up so savagely, however, beating each other to a bloody pulp, that fans in the arena begin paying more and more attention, as do commentators on TV.  When the action-packed and dramatic bout comes to an end, Cesar and Vince are paid off, but promptly spend most of their money in the casino. Grace, too, comes away bruised and empty-handed, except for her everlasting relationship between a couple of hard-headed but soft-hearted guys.

Krishna now has to return to Chennai as his mother ([[Ambika (actress)|Ambika]]) breaks her leg and is in hospital. He promises Janaki that he will speak to his father about their marriage. Janaki has one condition: She says that if they disapprove she will not elope with Krishna without her parents' consent. Krishna agrees and goes to see his mother.  The doctor ([[Kovai Sarala]]), who has really bad memory provides comic relief along with her assistant ([[Maadhu Balaji]]), tells Krishna's mother that she will send a nurse to their home to help her. While this is happening Bharathi has a fallout with a prominent music director ([[Karan (actor)|Karan]]) and Kannan is recruited to anger Bharathi. Kannan's music in the movie becomes extremely successful and he becomes an overnight sensation &mdash; gaining fame and being flooded with offers. Bharathi is severely affected by the fallout and loses his prominence and offers. This further angers Bharathi and his hate for Kannan only increases. Seeing this, Krishna tells Janaki that they must separate before he comes with a new idea. He will somehow make Kannan like him and Janaki will make Bharathi like her. As per the plan, Krishna goes to Kannan's house as a driver while telling his parents that he went to Bombay to pursue further studies; Janaki pretends to be the nurse that the family doctor sent and tells her parents that she has an extra class at college.  Krishna assumes the name of Driver Pandi while Janaki assumes the name of Nurse Kalyani. It is not all that smooth as the doctor who is known to both families sees both of them at each other's houses and becomes very confused, providing further comic relief. Due to her severe bad memory, they are able to persuade everyone that she is just confused. The doctor gets extremely confused and believes that they are all separate people that just look alike. Janaki impresses Bharathi and his wife while Krishna does the same at Kannan's house. Problems arise when Krishna is kicked out of Kannan's house when he takes the blame after Kannan's father-in-law accidentally blabs to the media about Kannan's drinking. Janaki is kicked out as she stands up to Bharathi and tells him it is ironic that he is named after Bharathiyaar who fought for women's rights while he doesn't allow his wife who is a singer to sing in public after their marriage.  Bharathi soon after realises his mistake and invites Janaki back. Krishna, however, has to struggle much more to gain back Kannan's trust. Kannan, after a drunken fight with the famous director who introduced him, angers the director &mdash; he refuses to see Kannan leading to a bad image of Kannan in the media. Krishna follows the director day and night and even stays in the rain all night. When allowed to speak to the director, he convinces him to forgive Kannan. When Kannan realised that Krishna helped him out despite his anger he invites him back to his house. Krishna and Janaki tell Kannan and Bharathi respectively that they are in love and that their parents and their lover's parents are against it. They convince them to speak to the parents of their lovers. The families arrive at a beach house and are shocked when they find out who Krishna and Janaki really are and that they have been fooled. Kannan storms off. Bharathi accepts the reunion and so does Kannan's wife who tells them to arrange the wedding and that Kannan will come as he wouldn't miss his only daughter's wedding.  Kannan does not turn up. Janaki and Krishna turn up at his house, and he is devastated that they got married without his consent and feels that no one respects him. Krishna tells him that they are not married and that they won't until he approves. Krishna claims that they will wait and remain lovers until Kannan gives his consent. As Krishna drives away he comes to a sudden halt as Kannan and his family have also arrived by car and blocked his path. Kannan tells him that all fathers will object, but he didn't expect Krishna to do what he did. He tells him that he better marry Janaki or else. Janaki then brings Bharathi while Krishna brings Kannan to him, and the old friends reunite in an embrace. In the final scene the doctor arrives and informs Bharathi and Kannan that Driver Pandi is actually Krishna and that Nurse Kalyani is actually Janaki to which the men act surprised before they inform her that they already know.

He also kept Todd's role as an undercover operative a secret from the other officers. The police suffer major casualties and Todd is shocked. He considers shooting Soong in the back. He sees Guan watching him, however and hesitates. He later ends up saving Soong and all three escape by sea. Todd sneaks back to the police, but by then Ma issued an arrest warrant for him. Tood returned to Soong and says he doesn't remember the cause of the revolution.  A police convoy is blocked by a stalled police car with an officer slumped over the wheel. They find the policeman's neck was slit and a bomb in his lap. Guan triggers the bomb in front of  Todd, who has flashbacks on the way his son died. Ma orders police in the area to comb for more bombs.  At [[Kai Tak Airport]], Guan and Todd enter the airport's restricted area as journalists on an airport tour. They slip away from the group, and are stopped by a pair of [[Airport Security Unit (Hong Kong)|Airport Security Unit]] officers. Guan shoots both policemen to Todd's shock. Meanwhile, Soong manages to recover the chemicals. At ATF headquarters, the files found on Todd are cracked, revealing the plans to unleash the chemicals over Cambodia. Ma realises the terrorists may be planning to hijack a plane to seed the clouds, and orders the [[Special Duties Unit]] to rush to Kai Tak. He discovers, though that most of them were already erroneously deployed to the new airport site at [[Chek Lap Kok]]. Ma orders the remaining 12 officers to the airport hangar.  Guan and Todd successfully infiltrate the hangar, where they kill the technicians and hijack a small plane and crew. Soong transports the chemicals to the hangar, but just as he arrives, another group of ASU officers appear. The officers are shot in an ensuing gun battle, but several of Soong's men were also killed. Guan is badly injured trying to save Todd. She kills herself on the aircraft, and an infuriated Todd makes off with the chemicals while the plane is still in the hangar.  Ma and his team of SDU officers arrive at the airport. Todd fends off Soong's men, escaping into a large drain which leads to a tunnel system. Soong follows right behind him. Ma deploys his men at both ends of the tunnel to trap them and rushes in with his officers. Todd and Soong fight in the tunnel before Ma's arrival. Ma badly injures Soong, but Soong activates the chemical bomb and dies. Ma is able to pull an injured Todd out just as the tunnel gates are shut to contain the blast. Todd mysteriously disappears into the night.  At the new [[Hong Kong International Airport]] Todd leaves Hong Kong under the auspices of Ma, unknown to anyone else.

Pushing Tin
 Nick "The Zone" Falzone ([[John Cusack]]) and his fellow [[air traffic controller]]s at the [[New York TRACON]] pride themselves on their ability to handle the intense stress of being a controller for one of the busiest airspaces in the country, even boasting of the 50% drop-out rate for new additions to the staff who are unable to cope with the pressure. The group is joined by the quiet and confident Russell Bell ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]), a veteran of TRACONs in the Western United States. Russell quickly proves to be exceptionally capable of handling the increased workload by using unorthodox and risky methods. Nick feels challenged by the new controller's ability to out-perform him at seemingly every task and warns his supervisor that Bell is a loose cannon, especially after discovering that Russell once stood on a runway to allow himself to be violently propelled by a landing commercial airliner's [[Wake turbulence|jetwash]].  At a supermarket, Nick encounters Russell's despondent young wife Mary ([[Angelina Jolie]]), who is sobbing over a grocery cart full of alcohol. In consoling her, Nick ends up back at the Bells' house, where he and Mary both cheat on their respective spouses by having sex. Several days later, Mary informs Nick that she immediately told Russell about the affair, and that the confession has actually improved their marriage. Fearing retaliation, Nick confronts Russell at work, and is confused and surprised by Russell's even-tempered response to the situation. Meanwhile, Nick's wife, Connie ([[Cate Blanchett]]), seems to become more and more intrigued by Russell, and Nick becomes increasingly paranoid that Russell will eventually seek revenge by having sex with her. While out of town for his father-in-law's funeral, Nick can't bring himself to lie when a grieving Connie challenges him to say that he has never cheated on her. As their flight home approaches New York, Connie tells Nick that she has indeed slept with Russell. The plane then makes an odd turn, and Nick assumes that Russell is harassing him, or possibly going insane, by purposely directing the plane into a dangerous storm.  Soon after going to TRACON to confront Russell, a bomb threat is called in to the facility. The building is evacuated as both Nick and Russell volunteer to stay behind to handle the daunting task of landing all the planes on approach in their airspace before the alleged bomb is set to go off in 26 minutes. Successfully routing all but one plane that has lost radio contact, Nick leaves the building as the deadline approaches, while Russell instead remains inside to make contact with the plane by calling one of its passengers via [[Airfone]]. Russell is lauded as a hero for making the effort despite the threat, which turned out to be a hoax.  Russell abruptly quits and he and Mary move to Colorado. Connie leaves Nick, and his performance at work suffers; the once cocky, boastful controller is sent home after being responsible for two deals (near mid-air collisions) in one shift. After learning that Russell had ordered the diversion of Nick's flight not to provoke him, but to clear a path to make a plane with a medical emergency on board next in line for a landing, Nick impulsively drives out to Colorado to make amends with Russell. Nick seeks his advice on how to get his personal life back in order, but Russell is unable to make Nick understand with words. He instead brings Nick to a runway so that he too can experience being caught in a landing aircraft's turbulence. The two engage in the stunt together, and it has a profound effect on Nick, who thanks Russell. He returns to New York, where he regains his form at work, and reconciles with Connie.

Ravenous (1999 film)
 During the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846 &ndash; 1848), Second Lieutenant Boyd, who is fighting in the [[United States Army]], finds his courage fail him in battle so he plays dead as his unit is massacred. His body, along with the other dead are put in a cart and hauled back to the Mexican headquarters (throughout this journey blood drips into Boyd's mouth). However, in a moment of bravery, Boyd seizes the chance to capture the Mexican headquarters. His heroism earns him a captain's promotion but when General Slauson learns of the cowardice through which victory was achieved he posts Boyd into exile at Fort Spencer, a remote military outpost high in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].  Shortly after Boyd joins the seven-man garrison at Fort Spencer, a stranger named Colqhoun arrives and describes how his [[wagon train]] became lost in the mountains. A Colonel Ives had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean but instead had led them on a more circuitous route resulting in the party getting trapped by snow. People were reduced to cannibalism to avoid starvation. A rescue party is assembled to get the survivors. But before they leave they are warned by their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Reconnaissance|scout]], George, of the [[Wendigo]] myth: anyone who consumes the flesh of their enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by an insatiable hunger for more human flesh.  When the soldiers reach the party's cave they realise too late that Colqhoun and Ives are one and the same. After eating his five companions, his plan is now to kill and eat the soldiers. Colqhoun quickly kills them one by one, including Colonel Hart, the fort's commanding officer. Boyd escapes the massacre by jumping off a cliff but breaks his leg. He hides in a pit next to the body of another soldier who he eventually eats to stay alive.   When Boyd finally limps back to the fort, he is delirious and severely traumatized. The remaining soldiers (who never met Colqhoun because they were on a supply mission) do not believe his wild tale. A second expedition to the cave finds no bodies or any trace of the man. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort but to Boyd's horror it is Colqhoun, now cleaned up and calling himself Colonel Ives. The men still refuse to believe Boyd because Ives bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the fight at the cave. Secretly Ives tells Boyd that he used to suffer from [[tuberculosis]] but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth he "just had to try" by murdering him and eating his flesh. A process that cured his disease. Ives now planned to use the fort as a base to cannibalise passing travellers because, like the notion of [[Manifest Destiny]], the migrants had a calling just like himself. Boyd is soon suspected of murder after a soldier is mysteriously killed. While chained up, he watches helplessly as the last officer is murdered by Ives' unexpected ally: Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre.  Ives saved Hart by feeding him his own men. But he is now addicted, like Colqhoun, to human flesh. Ives mortally wounds Boyd forcing him to make a choice: eat or die. Eventually Boyd gives in and eats a stew made from the dead officer. However, rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson, Boyd convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Ives. Hart does so but asks to be killed because he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. Boyd and Ives fight inflicting grievous wounds on each other because their recuperative powers sustain them. Eventually Boyd forces Ives into a large bear trap that pins them both together. Ives taunts Boyd by telling him he will eat him but he dies first. General Slauson arrives, and while his aide looks around the dilapidated fort, the general tastes the meat stew left simmering on the fire. Martha, the sister of George the native scout, sees Ives and the dying Boyd together, closes the door, and walks away. Boyd does not eat Ives and dies.

Ride with the Devil (film)
 Jake Roedel and Jack Bull Chiles are friends in [[Missouri in the American Civil War| Missouri]] when the [[American Civil War]] breaks out. During the mayhem, Chiles's father is murdered by Kansas pro-Union [[Jayhawkers]]. The two men join the First Missouri Irregulars, also known as the [[Bushwhackers]]; informal units loyal to pro-Confederacy units of [[Confederate government of Missouri|Missouri]] in 1861. They later meet George Clyde and former slave Daniel Holt, whose freedom Clyde has previously granted.   The Bushwhackers battle Jayhawkers using guerrilla warfare tactics while trying to evade capture. The men manage to hide out in a coarsely-built shelter on the property of a pro-Confederacy family, the Evanses. A young widow in the household, Sue Lee Shelley, becomes romantically involved with Chiles. When Chiles dies of [[gangrenous]] wounds received during a skirmish, Roedel escorts Shelley to a refuge dwelling where another pro-Confederate kindred, the Brown family, reside.   Following the collapse and destruction of a makeshift prison holding the female relatives of guerrillas, a complementary clan of Bushwhackers led by [[William Quantrill]] plot a revenge attack against the Union and [[Lawrence Massacre| raid Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref name="film"/> In the midst of the offense, a quarrel arises between Roedel and fellow Bushwhacker Pitt Mackeson. Roedel, a [[German American]], was born in Germany but raised by his immigrant father in Missouri. He suffers from sporadic [[Anti-German sentiment |anti-German suspicion]] from other Southerners, because the German population in the state is largely sympathetic to the Union. In an episode of hostility, Mackeson purposely shoots Roedel in the leg shortly after the raid on Lawrence, while retreating from a counterattack by Union forces. The perceived prejudice contributes to Roedel's sympathy to the plight faced by Holt, a former slave coping with racism.   Meanwhile, Shelley gives birth to Chiles's daughter. Holt and Roedel, both wounded, recover at the same residence that took in Shelley occupied by the Brown folk. The Browns, who mistakenly suppose Roedel is the child's father, pressure Roedel to marry her, which he is reluctant to do. However, after spending time with Shelley and the child, Roedel begins to have feelings for both of them. At the same time, Anderson and many other Bushwhackers have been killed, taken prisoner or otherwise rendered inactive. Pitt Mackeson has gathered some survivors into a gang which no longer fights the Yankees, but instead robs, murders and plunders Unionists and Southerners alike. Word comes from one of Roedel's compatriots that Mackeson and his gang are headed South and plan on visiting Roedel soon.  One day Mr. Brown takes Holt to town and returns with a reverend and Roedel, after realizing he does love Shelley and she him, marries her in an abrupt wedding. Roedel's feelings toward Shelley are further deepened by a tender wedding night together. Later, proclaiming himself finished with war, Roedel gives up being a Bushwhacker and takes his new family to California. On the way, they meet Mackeson and the last of his men, Turner, who is ragged and injured, the both of them on the run. They report Black John and Quantrill are both dead and agree with Roedel the war is lost. Mackeson tells them of his plan to ride into Newport despite the fact the town is full of Federal soldiers and certain death awaits him and Turner. Mackeson's strange manner causes Roedel and Holt to hold guns on him and Turner, but the two ride off without violence.  Holt rides with Roedel and his family toward California, until their roads part, and then Daniel tells Jake farewell, while Shelley and the baby sleep. Holt leaves for Texas, a free man, to find his long lost mother.<ref name="film"/>  
Ring 2
 After the body of [[Sadako Yamamura]] is retrieved from a [[water well|well]], her uncle Takaishi is summoned by police to identify her. Detective Omuta explains to Takaishi that forensics concluded Sadako may have survived in the well for thirty years. Forensics experts reconstruct her body, giving it to Takaishi, who gives his niece a [[burial at sea]], hoping to be free from the guilt he has carried since her mother Shizuko committed suicide because of his actions. The police search for [[Reiko Asakawa]] following the sudden death of her ex-husband [[Ryuji Takayama]] and her father Koichi a week later. Mai Takano, Ryuji’s university assistant, investigates his death, visiting Reiko’s news office where her colleague Okazaki joins Mai in her search for answers. They find a burnt out [[videotape]] in Reiko’s apartment, Mai sensing Reiko’s father died the same way as Ryuji.  Investigating the [[urban legend]] of the cursed videotape, Okazaki meets a high school student Kanae Sawaguchi, who gives him a copy of the tape but admits she watched it herself. She begs Okazaki to watch the tape before the week is up, but he chickens out and hides his copy in his desk drawer at work.  Mai and Okazaki go to a mental hospital to speak to Masami Kurahashi, a friend of Reiko’s niece Tomoko, but learn she is both mute and has a phobia of televisions, having witnessed Tomoko’s death. They meet Doctor Oisho Kawajiri, Masami’s doctor, and a paranormal researcher, who is trying to expel the psychic energy within Masami through experimentation. Mai steps out for some air, encountering Masami, whose presence causes Sadako to materialise on a television and terrify the patients.  Mai finds Reiko’s son Yoichi alone in a [[shopping mall]] before his mother appears. Mai learns Yoichi has been mute since his father and grandfather’s deaths and his [[psychic powers|psychic abilities]] intensified, and Reiko asks if Kawajiri can help. Returning to the hospital, Mai, Okazaki, and Detective Omuta observe Kawajiri’s experiment to exorcise the psychic energy from Masami by projecting her mental imagery onto a blank tape. However, it causes the cursed videotape’s imagery to appear, killing Masami, and Mai destroys the recording. Upon learning Kanae has died from the curse, Mai surrenders Reiko and Yoichi to the authorities. Realising the two are to be separated, Mai [[telepathy|telepathically]] warns Yoichi, who escapes with Reiko, who is consequentially hit by a truck. Okazaki attempts to delete his interview with Kanae, only for her ghost to materialise and haunt him.  Mai and Yoichi travel to [[Izu Ōshima|Oshima Island]] and stay in the Yamamura Inn. Yoichi has a nightmare, causing Shizuko's and a young Sadako’s ghosts to appear before Mai wards them away. Dr. Kawajiri arrives in the night, offering to exorcise Yoichi as he tried with Masami, with Mai volunteering to act as a conduit to expel Sadako’s hatred into a [[swimming pool]], water being able to neutralise the energy. However, the attempt turns frightening, Sadako’s coffin appearing in the pool. Takaishi drowns himself to stop Sadako, while Kawajiri goes insane and commits suicide by diving into the pool carrying electrical equipment.  Mai and Yoichi fall into the water, appearing inside the well. Ryuji’s ghost appears, absorbing Sadako’s rage from his son, and summons a rope that will guide Mai to safety as long as she doesn’t look down. Mai ends up doing so, causing Sadako’s ghost to appear, who scales the well only to cryptically ask, “Why is it only you were saved?”, before falling back into the well. Mai and Yoichi emerge in the pool, free of their fear. While Okazaki is institutionalised, a nurse takes a picture of him. As she leaves the room she notices something in the photo, seemingly shocked; behind Okazaki is Kanae’s [[yurei|laughing spirit]] looking for revenge.

A 3,000-year-old [[Egypt]]ian [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]], named Afzel, has stolen the [[Immortality|secret of life]], and is fleeing the servants of an evil [[Egyptian god]], named [[Set (deity)|Sutekh]]. Two servants, imbued with magical power from Sutekh, attack him, but are killed easily by Afzel and his own magical power. After dispatching the two servants he begins his journey to [[Paris]].  Meanwhile, Sutekh has given life to three of his oldest servants—Egyptian mummies. After they rise from their chamber they too begin to pursue Afzel.  Cut to [[Paris]], where a young André Toulon is putting on a puppet show of [[Dante's Divine Comedy]].  Watching from the crowd is Elsa, who has left her [[Cruel|cold-hearted]] [[abusive]] [[ambassador]] father and harmless mother to view the wonders of the country and has decided to see the play. In the sewers nearby the three mummies have hired two thugs to kill Afzel.  The thugs are necessary since Afzel has the power to sense the coming of the mummies.  Afzel is beaten brutally until Elsa, leaving the theater, sees them and cries for help. The thugs then scatter, leaving Toulon and Elsa to pick Afzel up and bring him inside. Later, when he stirs from his sleep, he talks with Toulon and reveals that he knows the secret of life, and it's the only thing that can protect humankind when the elder gods rise up in 100-1,000 years, and needs to pass it on to Toulon. Toulon is skeptical until Afzel begins to make the puppets move. Now Toulon realizes he is genuine and begins to learn his powers. Then Afzel starts to make the puppets draw a barrier that's supposed to protect him if the servants come back.  While stepping outside for a brief moment, Toulon begins to talk to a beggar who has sat on the steps since the beginning of the movie.  However, he is dead, and when Andre becomes aware of this he begins to mourn.  Afzel tells him to bring him inside to teach him the true secret of life. After bringing him inside they use a ring to transfer the soul of the beggar to the puppet, "''Pinhead''". The puppet starts to move but, after a few questions the puppet runs away into the theater. Later on, Elsa returns to talk to Toulon, until her father's rude servants come by, and they take Elsa and Toulon back to her house, and after Toulon talks to the father, he gets knocked out, and is then thrown into the woods.  The next day, back at the theater, Valentin storms in as the barrier written on paper falls off the wall. The three mummies see their chance to attack and begin their rampage through the theater. Valentin finishes repairing the door as two of the mummies break in and kill him. Vigo runs backstage to Duval and Latour and falls dead. Duval stabs the lead mummy in his hand as the mummy kills him with his other hand. Latuor gets out a gun and shoots the lead mummy three times as the other mummy comes in through the back door and all three of them use their magic to kill him.  Afzel appears and says Sutekh shall not claim his life, and kills himself with his own magic. Satisfied with victory, the mummies begin to leave. Once Toulon returns from the woods, he sees what has happened and acts quickly by putting their souls inside his puppets.  The men return, having sensed someone with the knowledge of the secret of life, and try to kill Toulon. His puppets, however, kill one of the mummies with Six-Shooter by shooting the chandelier chains, causing it to crush the servant. The two henchmen retreat in order to plot the capture of Elsa to lure Toulon into a trap.  Feeling that he had won the battle, André and his puppets go to a train station to leave [[Paris]] to [[Kara, Togo]] before things start to get bad, not realizing they had already begun. The servants killed her parents, the guards and capture Elsa, and then send a dream to Toulon that shows Elsa tied up, and a train. Knowing the meaning, he quickly changes trains to Merca, Somalia and gets his puppets ready for the showdown. When the train leaves, André looks around, having released his puppets and letting them follow him throughout the train, until finally coming to the last car and finding Elsa tied up like in his dream. The two men appear and ask for the secret of life. André displays the scroll where the secret is written and asks, "''How do you know I haven't copied it?''" to which the leader states he did not have enough time to do so, but still is doubtful he hadn't. André, noticing he is distracted, attacks the leader while his puppets attack the other. A large struggle breaks out, and the other henchman is killed with the final leader of the three being thrown from the car. Freeing Elsa, the group rides away in the train, beginning their adventure. After telling the story, the puppets wonder what happened to the other puppets. Andre tells them that's another story, which he will tell them in the future.

The group reaches the front gates of the amusement park and hops the fence. It is revealed that they are on a mission to find a kid-friendly security guard that can run the amusement rides for them. The group walks through the park, making fun of their group counselor, whom they stole their car from.  Darren and Chloe, who are a couple, sit down on the merry-go-round with Justin and tell him that they are not running away, like they have told him before they left the home.

The teens, fueled by alcohol that they have been sharing, begin to play around on the rides.

Justin, still duct taped to the chair in the security office, sees the events unfold, and tries to escape, knowing that he would have been the victim if Ben had not noticed the kids in the bathroom.  After the event, Ben tries to make casual talk with Stick and tells him "when your friends are done, you come back and see me okay?" Ben then leaves the restroom and returns to security office to find Justin tipped over in his chair. He grabs Justin's belongings and frees him from his constraints.Ben then leads Justin to the Octopus ride. Ben joyfully leads Justin to one of the cars and starts the ride.

Darren states that he wants to ride with Ben. Darren convinces Ben to teach Stick how to run the ride. Reluctantly, Ben gets in the car and the others lock him and Darren in. Stick starts the ride, but Darrin yells for him to bring it down because he is sick. Darren jumps out of the ride and quickly locks the door on Ben. Stick then starts the ride, trapping Ben in.  With the park all to themselves, the group makes snowballs out of snowcones and throws them at the Zipper car Ben is riding in. They then proceed to ride more rides. On the roller coaster, Stick admits to Chloe that he does not want Darren to go through with it because he is his best friend, which Chloe ignores.  After a ride on the bumper cars, Chloe tells Darren that she doesn't believe he is going to go through with their plan because he has too much fun. She then admits that she has had sex with Sanj behind Darren's back and has no idea whether the baby is Darren's or Sanj's. Darren, in a fit of rage, shoves Chloe to the ground and storms out of the park. He destroys a ticket booth. Justin follows him,  and confesses his feelings to Darren about the suicide plot, ending with Justin telling him to not pretend to love Chloe. He also tells Darren to commit suicide if he is going to because he tired of the emotional roller coaster.  Meanwhile, Chloe finds Stick sitting in the merry-go-round. Stick apologizes for calling her fat, and attempts to make a sexual advance on her, leading to Chloe shoving him and walking away. Stick goes to Ben's office and proceeds to destroy it by ripping papers and pouring soda on the desk. He then comes across hundreds of pictures of child pornography hidden in the office, as well as pictures of all of the kids Ben has assaulted. Ben takes all of the pictures back to the Zipper and begins throwing them at the car Ben is in. After a while, the ride stops, and Stick turns around to see Justin at the controls. Justin tells Stick that he saw what happened and lowers Ben's cage to the ground. Ben claims he has nothing to do with the pictures and Stick threatens to kill him. Stick eventually storms away and collapses in tears near a concession stand. Justin approaches and tells Stick that he will help him kill Ben. Justin tells Stick that Ben is "just a faggot" but Stick says he is a pedophile. Stick then admits that he is homosexual, as has been hinted throughout the movie. Stick walks away, and Justin returns to Ben. Justin opens the compartment and walks away, leaving Ben in the cage afraid for his life.  As night sets in, Darren and Chloe have a conversation on the grass about their lives and their suicide pact.

They return to the Zipper to find that Ben has disappeared, and then head to and indoor dance floor, where they all dance and fool around together.

Stick tells Darren he doesn't believe he will go through with it and tells everyone to leave. As the group walks down the hill, the lights lining the side of the rollercoaster are ripped off as Darren jumps from the top and falls to the ground to his death.

 When her [[Probation (workplace)|probationary employment]] ends, Rosetta ([[Émilie Dequenne]]) causes a violent struggle against her manager and the policemen when she refuses to leave the premises. She returns home to "The Grand Canyon", the caravan park shared with her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother who mends worn clothes for her to sell. Rosetta is also seen laying out [[Fish trap|traps]] to catch trout for food. Unable to receive unemployment pay and desperate for work, Rosetta goes around to ask about vacancies until she happens upon a waffle stand. She befriends the worker, Riquet ([[Fabrizio Rongione]]), after an enquiry. Rosetta  treats her period cramps with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] and a hairdryer massaging the area.  Riquet makes an unexpected visit to the caravan park, startling Rosetta. He informs her a colleague was fired and thus she will be able to have a job. Her mother's [[promiscuity]] resulting from alcoholism prompts Rosetta to encourage her to seek [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation clinic]] so they can finally have a better life. However, her persistent [[denial]] causes her mother to run away. Rosetta decides to stay with Riquet for the night. During the awkward evening, she discovers a [[waffle iron]] in his possession. As she lies in bed, she tries to convince herself that her life has started to function normally.  At work, she is replaced after three days by the owner ([[Olivier Gourmet]]) because his son failed school, leading to another violent confrontation. Rosetta is moderately pacified when he tells her she will be contacted if an opportunity arises. She begins a new search for employment while keeping Riquet company during work. Later, Riquet falls into the water when he helps Rosetta with her traps. She watches him thrashing in the muddy water and hesitates before helping him out. Later she discovers Riquet has been selling his own waffles during business hours from his offer of an [[Unreported employment|under the table]] job helping him mix the batter. After some contemplation, she tells the owner. Rosetta looks on as Riquet is thrown out of the stand and is handed his apron. Betrayed and hurt, Riquet chases Rosetta on his [[moped]] as she attempts to evade him. Eventually he catches up to her and demands her motive. She states she wanted a job and had no intention of saving him from the water.  Rosetta encounters Riquet as a customer when she begins her first day in his stead. She returns home to find her mother barely conscious and [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] out the front, dragging her inside and putting her to bed. She calls her boss and tells him she will not be at work the next day. She then turns on the gas to make an egg and leaves the gas running in an attempt to asphyxiate herself and her mother. The gas runs out. She goes to the landlord to ask for another canister of gas. As she hauls the canister of gas with great difficulty, Riquet, on his moped, appears to circle around her. Rosetta walks a short distance before collapsing to the ground and cries. Riquet grabs her by the arm to pick her up. She turns around to gaze at him as she slowly regains her composure.

 Maggie Carpenter ([[Julia Roberts]]) is a spirited and attractive young woman who has had a number of unsuccessful relationships. Maggie, nervous of being married, has left a trail of fiancés. She's left three men waiting for her at the altar on their wedding day (all of which are caught on tape), receiving [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] fame and the dubious nickname "The Runaway Bride".  Meanwhile, in [[New York, New York|New York]], columnist Homer Eisenhower Graham or "Ike" ([[Richard Gere]]), writes an article about her that contains several factual errors, supplied to him by a man he meets in a bar who Ike later learns was one of Maggie's former fiancés. Ike is fired for not verifying his source, but is invited to write an in-depth article about Maggie in a bid to restore his reputation. He travels to Hale, [[Maryland]], where he finds Maggie living with her family and on her fourth attempt to become married. The fourth groom-to-be, Bob Kelly ([[Christopher Meloni]]), is a local high school football coach who uses sports analogies to help Maggie with her concerns. He constantly makes references to Maggie "focusing" on the goal-line in reference to their pending nuptials. As Ike starts going around town to meet her friends, family, and former fiancés, Maggie becomes frustrated and feels he is getting the story wrong again.  Ike begins to cooperate with Maggie on the story, Maggie being interested in getting him to publish the truth, and the two become closer to each other the more time they spend together. During his research for the story, Ike realizes that Maggie is adjusting her interests to mimic those of her fiancés in order to please them. This is signified most prominently by her choice of eggs, which changes with each fiancé. At a pre-wedding celebration for her and Bob, Ike defends Maggie from the public mockery she starts receiving from her family and guests, and Maggie walks outside due to the embarrassment. Ike then confronts Maggie outside about his realization regarding her relationships.  During the wedding rehearsal, Bob tries to quell Maggie's wedding anxieties by walking her down the aisle. Ike is standing in at the altar, playing the groom. After Bob gets her to the altar, Ike and Maggie share a passionate kiss and admit to each other their feelings. Bob is chagrined, becomes jealous and punches Ike in the face before he storms out of the church. In the aftermath, Ike proposes that he and Maggie get married since the wedding is arranged. At the altar, Maggie gets cold feet and flees. Ike pursues her but she hitches a ride away on a [[FedEx]] truck.  Later, we see Ike living in New York and Maggie trying to discover herself, trying different types of eggs, and putting her lighting designs up for sale in New York. She shows up unexpectedly at Ike's apartment one night where he finds her making friends with his cat, Italics. Maggie then explains that she had been running because every other guy she was engaged to was only engaged to the idea she had created for them rather than the real her, but with Ike she ran because, even though he truly understood her, she didn't understand herself. She "turns in" her running shoes just before proposing to Ike. Ike hides his eyes, but she persists. The two are married in a private ceremony outside, on a hill, avoiding the big ceremonies that Maggie notes she never actually liked. In the end, they are shown riding away on horseback while everyone in Hale and New York (clued in via [[cell phone]] by Ike and Maggie's family) celebrates the fact that Maggie finally got married.  A post credit scene shows Maggie and Ike playing in the snow signifying that the relationship is going strong well after the wedding.

Tum draws one of the unlucky numbers and is laid off. Back at her apartment building, she finds the elevator is out of order, and is somewhat bothered by a young man who is a little too helpful. She is nonetheless accommodating and friendly. Once alone, though, she envisions all kinds of [[suicide|suicidal]] scenarios, including drinking household cleaning chemicals or blowing her head off with a handgun.  Her luck changes for the weirder the next morning when she discovers an [[instant noodle]] box in front of her door. It is filled with 500 [[Thai baht|baht]] bills. Apparently it's been left there because the number on her apartment door, 6, is missing a nail, so flips upside down, making it appear she lives in apartment 9, which is actually down the hall. Soon after, a couple of thugs from a [[Muay Thai]] camp ask her if she has seen the box. They force their way into her flat, only to be killed, accidentally.  Tum decides to get rid of their bodies, get a plane ticket, obtain a fake passport and visa, take the noodle box with her and go spend the rest of her life somewhere else. But the gangster, Kanjit, who makes fake passports happens to be the very guy she must stay away from. More men sent by a Muay Thai promoter appears at Tum's apartment, where one quickly hid in her wardrobe when she returned home. A young [[Royal Thai Police|policeman]], who is the lover of her nosy neighbor, Pen, suddenly calls on her and discovers the bodies. The hidden man attracts the policeman's attention when he cocks his gun, and the subsequent firefight kills them both.  As Tum tries to hide the two bodies, Pen comes to visit, believing the policeman was still in her home. Another man arrives at the apartment later to seek out the missing men, and mistakenly thought he has killed the policeman after firing into the cop's body which was hidden behind a door. As Tum tried to clean up the mess and hide the cop's body later, Pen and other neighbours spies on her through the keyhole and mistakenly believe she was having an affair with the policeman.

Tum takes Jim with her to get her passport, and Jim accidentally gets caught in the crossfire. Jim, now dead, has been compromised and Tum makes off with the money. Tum remembers the reference of Pen when Pen was telling her about how the bodies were dumped down the lake and whatever goes down there disappears, and therefore dumps the money, escaping with just guilt.  
Running Out of Time (1999 film)
   Cheung ([[Andy Lau]]) is diagnosed as suffering from late-stage cancer and given four weeks to live by his doctor. He told his doctor to prescribe him with painkillers to tide him over the final weeks of his life. As Chueng eats at a diner, Inspector Ho Sheung-sang ([[Sean Lau|Lau Ching-wan]]), a police negotiator, has been called to the scene of a bank robbery standoff that's being bungled by his inept boss, Wong Kai-fat ([[Benz Hui]]). After listening repeatedly to the taped recordings of the earlier negotiation between Wong and the robbers, Ho assessed that the robbers are professionals and goes in to negotiate with the robbers. After goading the robbers to release the injured hostages first, a man amongst the hostages stands up and shoots the robbers dead. The man flashes his police identification card at Ho and claims to be an off-duty police officer. However, Ho recognizes the man's sniffing as similar to that of the robber's sniffing in the taped recording of the earlier negotiations and realized that the man is the mastermind of the robbery. Just as the man attempts to shot and silence Ho, the latter convinced the man that it is impossible to shoot him and get away with it as his fingerprints would be all over the murder weapon. As Ho leaves the crime scene to grab some breakfast, a shot rings out and Ho tells Wong that the robbery mastermind has committed suicide.  Cheung takes an interest in Ho, who he discovers was a former member of the Special Duties Unit. Cheung then stages his own robbery of a finance company to get in contact with Ho. He scares away the personnel of the finance company and takes the manager hostage using a gun. He gets the manager of the finance company to open up the office safe before tying him up. Cheung then uses the air ventilation ducts of the finance company to access a security company a few doors away. There, he plants a secret surveillance camera in the air ventilation duct of the security company. Cheung is then confronted by a police negotiator Hui and Wong. He told Hui that he does not like his voice and demands that the police send another negotiator to talk to him. When Ho finally appears and confronts Cheung, the latter proposes that they play a three-day long game. Cheung then shoots the finance company manager and Ho and the police give chase until Cheung stalls them enough to make an escape with a bomb, which turns out to be fake.  Cheung makes his escape by posing as a cop. Ho meets with Cheung after posing as a taxi driver. Amazed at Ho's ploy, he'll admit defeat at the game if Ho can take him to the police station before three days are over. Cheung then pulls a gun a starts shooting out the window to test Ho's reaction. When Ho slams the brakes, Cheung flees and jumps aboard to mini-bus. When stopped at a police road block, Cheung avoids them. Having seen his gun, she cooperates. Leaving the road block, he gets off.  Meanwhile, a man known only as Baldy ([[Waise Lee]]) is having a diamond that he had stolen appraised by the old man who was taking pictures of Ho earlier. The two Americans who stole the diamond for him ask for more money. Baldy pulls out his gun and points it at the old man, who confirms its authenticity. Baldy then kills the two Americans and takes the diamond. Ho returns to the finance company for further questioning, and sees Baldy entering the office space next door. He tries to get in, but it stopped by one of Baldy's men.  As Cheung watches a video feed of the vault at Baldy's office, he puts a screw inside a box. As he takes a drink, he coughs out blood, meaning his condition is worsening with internal bleeding. Ho tries to reason why Cheung held up the finance company and not the jewelry or antique stores in the building and why Cheung chose him for his game. As he leaves for the day, Ho receives a Cheung's package. He meets up with his friend, the Head of Interpol, who's given him information on Baldy, who's wanted for possession of explosives, and one Peter Cheung, the old man who took pictures of him and appraised the diamond. Peter Cheung was Baldy's boss until Baldy kicked him out.  More focused on the case, he skips having dinner with her to break into Baldy's office. When trying to get in, he's turned away by security, who's told by Wong that he's not on the case. Ho sneaks in anyway as Cheung watches him on video feeds. Using a packet of dairy creamer he took from security, Ho enters the finance company and finds the grate that Cheung's screw comes from. Going through the vents, he finds men that Baldy had to keep an eye on the diamond and Cheung's video equipment, which Cheung uses to give away Ho's entrance. Ho tries to escape, but Cheung calls him and leads him to an emergency door that turns out to be a dead end. Ho tries to pick the lock on the emergency door, which is opened by the guy who he encountered earlier when he tried to get into the office.  Knowing that Baldy will come down to get the diamond out of there, Cheung reveals a car identical to Baldy's. Cheung takes the diamond, and Ho and Baldy's men give chase. As both Ho and Cheung get fired on by Baldy's men, the two are amazed at each other's resilience. They work together to get out of the predicament, but Ho realizes that now he's the one with a gun and Cheung is the one driving. Cheung reiterates that if Ho can get him to the police station, he wins. However, Cheung drives the car into a wall. After the collision, both men try to get the diamond. Cheung walks away with it, but not before dropping his painkilling pills.  Wong, who thinks the pills are Ho's, tries to talk to him. Ho's Interpol friend comes and brings him more information on Peter Cheung, who died a year ago, and a photo of Cheung, his son. Cheung, who has been masquerading as his father, sends Baldy proof that he has the diamond and will give it back for $20 million HK. Ho meets with Cheung at the diner, asking why he's still playing with him even though he's got the diamond and has avenged his father. Ho gives him a minute to give him a good reason not to arrest him now. Cheung wants to have Ho arrest Baldy, but realizes that Ho isn't doing this for fame or a promotion. Cheung then taunts Ho, saying that he's beating Ho in their little game. Ho lets him leave so they can finish their game.  Cheung takes a bus, where he meets the woman from earlier again. The bus is pulled over by the police, and the woman invites Cheung over like before. She takes him to a restaurant, but he leaves when he starts coughing up blood.  Cheung has set the place to make the exchange for the diamond at a bowling alley, which is being staked out by Ho, Wong and the police. Ho bumps into the same henchman he's been running into, who still doesn't recognize him. Cheung has Ho make the exchange for him, but Baldy has Cheung, who's disguised as a woman, get the money. Ho tries to get Wong to check in on the money exchange, but Wong doesn't get the message. Cheung, who's taken out Baldy's man and the cop while getting the money, takes off his disguise and makes the exchange himself, telling Ho that the "woman" is conning him. Baldy takes Cheung's bag, which holds a bowling ball, and throws it on the floor in rage, revealing diamonds inside. The police move in and arrest Baldy for stealing the diamonds from the finance company next door.  Cheung leaves the scene with the diamond and the money. Ho catches up with Cheung, finally arrests him and prepares to take him to the police station. Cheung reveals another "bomb" and pulls out another detonator like the one before. Ho calls him on his bluff and presses the detonator, which starts a timer on the bomb. Cheung, who knows he's going to die soon, wishes that he not die in a jail cell, so Ho stops and gets out of the car. The timer reaches zero, which starts up the car and Cheung escapes again. When Wong berates Ho for letting Cheung get away again, Ho simply ignores him and goes to grab something to eat. Cheung drives away, smiling.  Ho reads in the newspaper that someone using his name donated HK$20 million to a children's cancer foundation. He hops on a bus and meets the woman Cheung kept running into wearing the diamond. Ho admires the diamond, though she brushes it off as something cheap. He asks who gave it to her, and she says she hasn't seen him in a while. Ho tells her to hold on to it.  
A Saintly Switch
 At the film's opening, Dan and Sara Anderson are experiencing [[Marriage|marital]] fallout. According to their preteen children, Clark and Annette, they both underestimate each other's role in the family. When a new position with the [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]] takes them to [[New Orleans]], they purchase a dilapidated [[mansion]]. Upon arrival, they start fighting worse than ever. The children go up into the attic and discover a book of spells, finding out from their babysitter, the resident [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]], that this house once belonged to the most powerful sorceress in the area. Desperate to save their parents marriage, they cast a spell which inadvertently switches their parents' bodies.  The next morning, Dan wakes up in Sara's body, and she vice versa. They try to act like nothing has changed, which means they must do each other's jobs. After managing for about a day or two, still trying to keep the children (who already know what's going on) from finding out, Dan (in Sara's body) goes to the doctor because he (she) is feeling sick and discovers that he (she) is pregnant. The rest of the movie continues in similar fashion: as they live life in the other's body they grow to understand one another.  Thanks to the secret coaching she is receiving from Dan, Sara starts to get better at football. Her nurturing nature leads to her/him implementing the sort of "reward" list and tactics usually expected in a classroom. Surprisingly, this encourages the team so much that they start winning match after match. On the other hand, Dan is learning how to keep house and, though still rather uncomfortable, is rather enjoying his/her pregnancy and getting closer to the children in the process. As time passes, both parents really begin to understand what the other was complaining about, commenting on this to one another and wondering if they'll ever switch back or if they'll be stuck in each other's bodies for the rest of their lives.  When the [[pregnancy]] is about nine months along, the Saints come to the final game against the Redskins. If they win, Dan and the team go to the Super Bowl, and Dan would never have to worry about money or moving around again. Exhilarated, he and Sara embrace each other at the table and shout jubilantly at each other. This is heard by the children, who use this opportunity to finally confess all to their parents. They try to undo the spell, but fail. They call the babysitter, who translates that the spell will reverse once its purpose is complete: when their parents truly understand each other, they will be restored to their rightful bodies. However, there is a warning clause that implies that unless they manage to undo the spell before the birth of the baby, it will be permanent.  After the babysitter leaves and the Andersons go to bed, Dan and Sara apologize to each other, then kiss, which turns out to be the necessary act of understanding. The next day is the big match, and Dan's teammates instantly notice the difference in his behavior. While Sara goes into labor, his attempts to motivate his teammates with insults causes them to start fumbling. Clark reminds him to forget his old methods of motivation and revert to the "touchy-feely stuff" Sara used. In the hospital, Sara is puffing, panting, swearing, and ordering the nurses to bring her a TV. Around the time Dan wins the championship game, she finally gives in to nature and gives birth to a son. Later on, Dan is offered another job, but turns it down for his family.  
Sacred Flesh
 Sister Elizabeth, the mother superior of a medieval convent, has visions of Mary Magdalene and a skeletal dead nun. Father Henry, the abbot, and his servant Richard are summoned by the convent's abbess to help with the hysteria spreading among the order.  Elizabeth recounts the confessions and fantasies of the nuns, [[whip|flagellating]] herself and becoming excited as she does so: Sister Sarah [[masturbation|masturbates]]; Sisters Mary and Helena flagellate one another and then have [[sex]]. Sister Catherine is violated by Fathers James and Peter. Finally, Sisters Jane, Teresa and Helen engage in [[threesome|three-way sex]] and violate Sister Ann after tying her to a cross. Elizabeth writhes violently in her cell and, as she dies, is tormented by visions of a crucified woman and Christ's beating Sacred Heart.  Mother Elizabeth and an (imagined) demonic [[Mary Magdalene]] (who has relapsed from sainthood, back into the sex worker the church once claimed she was) debate desire and chastity within what seems to be a heavenly antechamber. Mary remarks to Elizabeth that, as her convent is full of repressed female desire, the Mother Superior too is enveloped within this voluptuous fold. Elizabeth details four fantasy vignettes. These are interspersed with conversations between the convent's former abbess, a priest, Abbess Elizabeth, an odd dead [[zombie]] nun and an actress [[Eileen Daly]] playing the spirit of Catechism..  The sex scenes conform to standard pornographic sequencing. They each start simply and culminate in erotic release at the end. There are scenes of the full [[lesbian]] sexual gamut, which extends from episodes of individual nuns' [[masturbation|self-stimulation]] to non-monogamous lesbian sex to a final nun-centered crucifix-[[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] scene, with copious use of the whip and the rope.  
Safe Sex (film)
 The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of Greek actors portraying various characters, each living his own story in [[modern Greece]].

Several professional actors appear briefly or in non-speaking [[cameo appearance|cameo]] roles.  As a result, there is no central plot or prominent protagonist who may be singled out. The major theme of the movie is sex and each character's approach to it, portrayed in a comedic way.

Jorge's friend and mentor, Mastronardi, often visits the magazine HQ asking Roberto for work, but due to his history of courageous confrontation against [[National Reorganization Process|the last military dictatorship in Argentina]], he finds himself [[blacklisting|blacklisted]] and therefore cannot find work.  In the showing of a short film, based on a story by Jorge, he meets Laura ([[Soledad Villamil]]), a passionate, beautiful and charming young girl who works as a waiter in a restaurant. He is instantly smitten by her, and she gives him her card. Days after, he receives news of the death of Mastronardi, and begins to write a story about his deceased friend. However, he experiences writer's block, and cannot get around to finish it. Jorge then finds the card Laura gave him, and decides to go the restaurant where she works. They go on a date to a bar, and they display chemistry and understanding, and Laura reveals that she has a boyfriend, an artist on a tour in Uruguay. Things go awry when the police raid the place and take Laura to jail, as she did not have her documents. Jorge then decides to be taken to jail himself in order to oversee Laura's safety. Upon their release, Laura and Jorge spend more and more time together, and Jorge reveals his feelings for Laura. She then tells him that she currently does not reciprocate, but she will call him if she "figures out any context" in which she could.  Months go by and Jorge buries himself in his work, starts a diary (which he then throws away) and loses hope of receiving Laura's phone call. However, she then calls him and they arrange a date, at which she reveals that she wanted to be sure of not waiting for her boyfriend anymore before starting a new relationship. They kiss, make love and start a relationship. The first months are full of romance and passion; however, when Laura decides to quit her job to work for free at a local radio station, Jorge begins to lose interest in her, and is constantly bothered by the monotony of their relationship. To make matters worse, Laura has decided to make a great writer out of Jorge, and constantly pressures him to stop writing the short and simple-minded love stories and focus on a powerful book.  When Jorge reaches the breaking point and cannot stand the current status of his relationship with Laura, he cheats on her with Carola. Laura finds out and leaves him immediately. Jorge, once again, buries himself in his work, until he receives news from Roberto that, due to restructuring, the magazine will no longer publish his stories. However, he is offered a job as the movie and theatre critic of the magazine, which he angrily refuses. He then finds the inspiration to finish Mastronardi's story and take it to the theatre. However, the play is a failure, and because of the effort he put in it, Jorge is heartbroken. Jorge then receives an emotional visit from Mastronardi's spirit, who asks him to look after his son, Sebastián.  In 1987, things have changed: Jorge has accepted the job offer as the movie and theatre critic, and Roberto is engaged to Marita, a friend of Laura's whom he met in a double date set by Jorge and Laura years before. Jorge is in a relationship with a new girl; however, he finds himself shocked when he receives news that Laura is to be married to her old boyfriend. This prompts Jorge to track Laura and, after spending a day together, they make love, and Laura then decides that she will get married anyway.  Once again, years go by, and in the 1990s, a bitter and disillusioned Jorge, still works as a critic. However, due to his failures and disappointments, and to the loss of his spirit and morals, we learn that he now asks for money in return for writing favourable reviews. This works against him when Laura, one of the producers of the movie he asked money to write a favourable review for, personally delivers him the money, and looks at him with disgust.  One day at the office, due to a disagreement, veteran political journalist Márquez ([[Ulises Dumont]]) has a heated exchange with his boss, young Micky ([[Rodrigo de la Serna]]) and is fired. This then prompts Sebastián, Mastronardi's son, to blame Jorge for his father's death. Unable to cope with guilt, and after realizing how much he has changed, Jorge attempts suicide. This attempt, however, is frustrated by Roberto, who arrives just in time to save him. After the suicide attempt, there is a surprise party, at which the employees of Cosas decide to donate one twelfth of their salaries to Márquez. Laura and Jorge meet once again, and share a long talk about their lives, hopes and crushed dreams.  The movie ends with a hint that Jorge and Laura will give their relationship one last chance. Jorge, reinvigorated, and looking like a happy man for the first time in years, watches her taxi depart with a broad smile. He is then greeted by his friends, Márquez, Sebastián and Roberto, and tells them of the new love story he is planning to write.

 After Ben Ravencroft, a famous horror writer of whom [[Velma Dinkley]] is a huge fan, assists her and the Mystery Gang in solving a case at a museum, he invites them to his hometown, Oakhaven, [[Massachusetts]]. When they arrive, they find the town converted into a tourist attraction by [[Mayor]] Corey, complete with 17th-century replicas and attractions based on the alleged ghost of Sarah Ravencroft, an ancestor of Ben's who was persecuted as a [[witch]] and executed by the Puritan townspeople in 1657. Ben disputes this, claiming Sarah to be a [[Wicca]]n who used natural herbs to heal people and reveals for years he has been searching for Sarah's medical journal to prove her innocence.  [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and [[Shaggy Rogers]] are chased by a witch and run into Ben and the gang. They find broken tree branches at the scene and are drawn to an all-female [[gothic rock]] band, [[The Hex Girls]], led by Sally "Thorn" McKnight. The gang then decides to split up; Fred and Daphne stay to watch the Hex Girls, Velma and Ben go explore an old barn and Shaggy and Scooby follow the Mayor. Fred and Daphne see Thorn doing some sort of ritual and are convinced the Hex Girls are witches. Velma and Ben find a [[cherry picker]] [[truck]] in the barn. Scooby and Shaggy follow Corey, until they encounter the witch and flee to the gang.  The gang, the Hex Girls and Ben meet in the woods. The witch appears and gives chase, but is captured by Velma. The witch is revealed to be Mr. McKnight, who is Thorn's father. Velma locates the truck and explains that the truck's arm made the witch appear to fly, with the townspeople jointly involved. Ben scolds everyone involved for exploiting Sarah's good name. Back at Ben's house, Fred and Daphne apologize to the Hex Girls and Thorn explains the "ritual" was for soothing her vocal cords and that she is actually descended from Wiccans. Corey and Mr. McKnight arrive to apologize to Ben for using his ancestor in their publicity stunt, explaining the witch was to boost the town's failing tourist economy and that they found inspiration from digging up the head marker for Sarah's grave; they kept it secret just not to upset Ben. It is then recalled that Scooby found what appeared to be a shoe buckle earlier, which was actually from Sarah's diary.  Everyone goes to the buckle's location, where Scooby discovers the buried book, which is actually a spell book. Ben reveals that Sarah was indeed a witch, who wielded her terrible and evil magic against many people before the Wiccans used their powers with nature to imprison her within her own spell book. He created the mystery at the museum and engineered the encounters with the gang, as he knew they could lead him to the book. After taking the book from Ben, the gang attempts to flee in the Mystery Machine, but Ben (with his newly acquired powers) renders the Mystery Machine useless by damaging its tires. Ben takes back the book and finally summons Sarah. However, he soon discovers that she has no loyalty to him and her ambitions are to destroy the world, rather than rule it alongside him.  Disillusioned, Ben attempts to imprison Sarah, but she tells him that only a Wiccan can defeat her, and imprisons Ben in a magical sphere. The gang launches an attempt to get the book while Sarah begins to turn pumpkins, trees, and a turkey into monsters in order to stop them. Daphne and Velma free the Hex Girls and Velma convinces Thorn to use her inherited Wiccan power to read the spell to banish Sarah into her imprisonment. However, Sarah manages to pull Ben in to make him suffer her fate with her, and they are both imprisoned inside the book. A burning branch falls onto the book, destroying it, ensuring that the Ravencrofts can never return. All of the monsters that Sarah had created have also returned to normal. The gang and townsfolk celebrate their deliverance with a concert from the Hex Girls with Scooby Doo and the gang (and the still-gigantic turkey) joining in on the performance.

Deeply scarred due to the experience, he is still happy that the Government allows him to live in his palatial residence whenever he comes to India. Gulfam finds a huge fan in Ajay, who used to attend his programs as a child. Despite the age difference, the two bond.  Inspector Salim a Muslim inspector is taken off from the Special Action Team when a notorious gangster Sultan escapes his clutches and he is severely reprimanded his superior for this failure and for causing the death of three other officers in the attempt. Despite being an honest and upright police officer with the best intelligence gathering network in the force, Salim is rueful that he is being given second class treatment because he is a Muslim and is being perceived as having let Sultan escape because he was a Muslim as well. His anger at the system doesn't lessen when Ajay, who was his junior, is told to head the team. Ajay wants Salim on the team, but Salim refuses. It is revealed that Ajay's father was going to testify against some terrorist who had threatened him not to testify, but in an attempt to stop them from doing so, Ajay's elder brother was killed. Ajay's father was kidnapped and by the time the terrorists spared him, the man had lost his voice. This motivated Ajay to join the police force.  Unknown to Ajay, Gulfam is also working for the Pakistani intelligence which is attempting to create havoc in India and create a proxy war between both sides. Since Gulfam likes Ajay, he sees to it that nothing untoward happens to him. Here, Salim finds the location of Bala Thakur along with the information that Sultan, the man who escaped from his clutches, will also be there. Salim gives the information to Ajay who makes peace with Salim and convinces him to join the team again. An encounter at the criminals' rendezvous results in the death of Bala Thakur and Ajay is seriously injured.

While recuperating, Ajay has an epiphany which leads the team to Bahid in Rajasthan and to "Mirchi Seth" Rambandhu Gupt. The investigative team save for Ajay and Salim camp in Bahid and gather all possible information on Mirchi Seth. Ajay comes over to Bahid to investigate and meets Gulfam who is temporarily staying in his ancestral manor near Bahid. Gulfam attempts to derail the investigation through political means and ordering an assault on Ajay to subvert the investigation, but of no avail. The repeated failures on Gulfam's part displease the senior officers in Pakistani Intelligence, who dispatch Major Aslam Baig to take care of the business.  Here, Ajay goes through the information collected so far and realises that he has seen many key suspects near Gulfam, but fails to make the connection. The investigative teams prepares for a final assault on the gun-running operation and in the pursuit of Mirchi Seth land up at Gulfam's mansion. Ajay feels betrayed when he learns of Gulfam's treachery, but is aware of lack of substantial evidence to indict Gulfam for his crimes. He goads and tricks Gulfam into killing Baig and arrests him for the offence. After realising what happened, Gulfam reveals how the incidents that happened during the partition embittered him and why he did those deeds.  In retaliation, Ajay makes him realise that his actions are not benefiting people of any religion. After Ajay makes him see the error in his ways, Gulfam, unable to stand the humiliation and guilt, commits suicide. Gulfam's suicide is hushed up and the team returns triumphant to Mumbai to much accolades for busting the terrorist racket.

Shiri (film)
 In October 1992, an elite group of [[North Korea]]n soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young ([[Choi Min-sik]]), they will be sent into [[South Korea]] as [[sleeper agent]]s, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female [[sniper]] who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years.  Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won ([[Han Suk-kyu]]) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil ([[Song Kang-ho]]). Jong-won is also engaged to a young woman, Lee Myung-hyun ([[Yunjin Kim]]), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Myung-hyun symbolically gives Jong-won a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Jong-won is worried that he cannot tell her about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.  Jong-won and Jang-gil are contacted by an [[arms trafficking|arms dealer]] who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a [[binary liquid]] [[explosive]] developed by the South Korean government. In its [[ground state]], CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1&nbsp;km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.  Mu-young and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Jong-won and Jang-gil suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Bang-hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle. Jong-won meets with Police Chief Ho to borrow outside forces but Ho accidentally stands in the path of a bullet fired by Bang-hee's  sniper rifle.  Mu-young calls Jong-won and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around [[Seoul]], and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. He also mockingly mentions Jong-won's fiancé. It is revealed that Mu-young and Jong-won have a history: Mu-young once [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] a civilian [[airliner]] and killed many civilians, but managed to escape by disguising himself as a wounded member of the flight crew.  The first of the CTX bombs is found on top of a department store, but Mu-young lied about the time factor. The bomb explodes just as the bomb disposal team discover its exact location, resulting in dozens of deaths. Jong-won takes Myung-hyun to hide out at a hotel and she begins drinking again.  Jong-won suspects Jang-gil as the leak - who suspects the same thing, as Jong-won has twice survived encounters with Bang-hee he should have died in, and bugged Jong-won's car and phone to see if he could learn anything. Jong-won sets a trap by telling Jang-gil he has new information - which Mu-young and his fellow agents step into - but the situation quickly escalates into a firefight resulting in police and civilian casualties. Several of the Northern agents are killed while others escape. When Mu-young is cornered, Bang-hee comes in to save him. Jong-won, having survived his stand-off with Mu-young and Bang-hee, follows a wounded Bang-hee. He loses her but notices the light to the aquarium turn on and covertly enters, discovering a bleeding Myung-hyun removing her disguise. Jong-won walks away, shocked, and conducts a solo investigation into her history with the real, sick Myung-hyun. Mu-young confronts Bang-hee about her hesitancy and constant failure to kill Jong-won, reminding her of their primary objective.  Mu-young calls NIS, demanding millions as well as a plane for an escape at 2pm in return for the remaining CTX. Myung-hyun's identity is confirmed by the agency later when electronic surveillance devices are discovered in fish decorating the NIS's office supplied by her. Jang-gil confronts her in her shop, and is shot by Mu-young. Jong-won suddenly appears with officers, who engage in a firefight with Mu-young and his agents. Mu-young and Myung-hyun escape, while a dying Jang-gil hands Myung-hyun's soccer match ticket to Jong-won, set to start at 2pm.  The terrorists aim to detonate a CTX bomb directly over the Royal Box, housing all senior North and South Korean politicians, at a [[soccer]] stadium in the midst of an [[international friendly]] match played by a North and South Korean team. Jong-won attempts to tell NIS of the ruse and the danger in the stadium but is ignored. He defies orders and rushes to the stadium, where Mu-young, Bang-hee, and other terrorists mingle with the crowd. They find a total ban on all liquids, but enter easily as the CTX and weapons were already planted in the stadium beforehand.  Bang-hee retrieves a hidden [[Steyr AUG]] from a restroom cubicle, while Mu-young and his agents tail several patrolling South Korean [[SWAT]] officers who later adjourn to the restrooms. There, the policemen are killed and their bodies quickly dragged away. Myung-hyun advances into the grandstand with her rifle, while Mu-young and three other men, now disguised as South Korean SWAT officers in uniforms stolen from the dead policemen, enter the stadium control room, killing all but one there and forcing the remaining staff to switch on the stadium lights to trigger the CTX. Jong-won arrives at the stadium and notices the lights. Jong-won goes to the control room to have them shut off but is taken captive. Sik, a rookie NIS agent, also notices the lights and soon comes in with backup. A violent confrontation in the control room results in the death of all four terrorists, and the lights are switched off in the nick of time. Myung-hyun notices this, and fires at the VIPs, but misses her target. Chasing after the entourage, she kills several more SWAT officers along the way before being confronted by a large group of officers led by Jong-won. As she makes a last-ditch attempt to complete her mission, she is shot dead by Jong-won.  Jong-won later learns that Bang-hee (whom he knew as Myung-hyun) was pregnant with his child, and had left details of the renegade Northern agents' plan and her planned location on his answering machine before leaving for the stadium but had requested he not confront her himself, professing her love for him. Jong-won then visits the real Myung-hyun, who is at a hospital for chemo therapy, and Myung-hyun reminisces about Bang-hee with Jong-won. Myung-hyun lets Jong-won listen to that song, and while listening to it Jong-won is captivated by the lyrics. The scene then fades, while Jong-won, still listening to the song, shuts his eyes.  
She's All That
 Zack Siler ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) is the [[big man (anthropology)|big man on campus]] at his [[Southern California]] [[high school]]. His popular and narcissistic girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), ditches him for a faded reality TV star from ''[[The Real World]]'', Brock Hudson ([[Matthew Lillard]]), whom she met on Spring Break in Florida. Although bitter over the break-up, Zack consoles himself by claiming that Taylor is replaceable by ''any'' girl in the school. Zack's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. ([[Paul Walker]]), disagrees and challenges him to a bet on whether Zack can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks, a coveted position held by the most popular girl in school. Dean picks out Laney Boggs ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), a dorky, solitary, unpopular art student, as his choice for Zack.  Zack approaches and attempts to befriend Laney in the hope of subsequently transforming her into prom queen material. His first encounter with her is a complete failure, when she pointedly ignores his advance and walks away from him. With help from Laney's friend, Jesse Jackson ([[Elden Henson]]), Zack eventually is successful in getting Laney to take him to a theater lounge frequented by artists and performers. Intending to deter him, Laney arranges for Zack to be called onto the stage and perform to his surprise. Zack manages to improvise a show with the [[Hacky Sack]] he happens to carry in his pocket. Laney is impressed by the performance, but rejects him again after he attempts to charm her.  Zack befriends her brother, Simon ([[Kieran Culkin]]), and in an attempt to stop this, Laney agrees to go to the beach with him once. She starts to make friends in the popular crowd as they get a chance to know her. Zack then successfully persuades her to attend a party at Preston's ([[Dulé Hill]]) house the same night, and he employs his sister Mac ([[Anna Paquin]]) to give her a makeover, transforming her into a stunning beauty. Laney's attendance at Preston's party sparks jealousy in Taylor, who then humiliates Laney, but Laney is consoled by Zack, who has by now developed a true affection for her.  As a result of her new appearance and Zack's interest, Laney is nominated for Prom Queen and begins an uneasy battle with Taylor for the crown. Taylor faces humiliation of her own when Brock informs her their relationship is over, and that he only used her to increase his own popularity (which proves successful with the producers of MTV offering him his own show). In the meantime, Dean begins to show an interest in Laney as her popularity begins to soar and Zack's victory becomes more imminent. Dean tries to invite Laney as his prom partner in an attempt to ruin Zack's attempt to boost Laney's winning chance with his own popularity, but Laney refuses. After falling out with Zack, Dean deliberately tells Laney about the bet and she forces a confession from Zack in public. Feeling objectified and betrayed, Laney refuses to see Zack again.  Unable to reconcile with Laney, Zack ends up attending the prom with his sister, while Taylor arrives alone, thinking that Zack is still interested in her despite his refusal of her advances. A disheartened Laney reluctantly dresses up after some persuasion from her father Wayne ([[Kevin Pollak]]) and goes to the dance with Dean when he shows up at her house in a tuxedo to invite her again to be his prom date.  At the prom, after a dance scene presided over by the school's resident DJ ([[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]]), Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. Dean boasts to Preston and others in the bathroom that he is succeeding in seducing Laney and has rented a hotel room with intention of having sex with her. Jesse overhears this, in a stall, and warns Mac and Zack. Taylor is then crowned Prom Queen with just over half the votes; she begins a long berating speech which is interrupted by the microphone being turned off by a teacher. By now, the students have seen Taylor for who she is, thanks to Mac revealing her actions against Laney and her involvement with Dean to sabotage Zack. As a result, Taylor is further humiliated when she loses her popularity and her friends. Laney leaves the prom with Dean, while Zack attempts to intervene but loses track of them.  When Laney returns to her home, Zack is there waiting for her, along with her father and Simon who are waiting up for her. Laney explains how she fought off Dean's advances by deafening him with an air horn. Zack confesses his true feelings to Laney, and asks for forgiveness as well as the chance to further their relationship, which she grants. Laney tells Zack that she is considering art school after graduation, and Zack jokingly tells her that she has inspired him to pursue a career in performance art. After their first dance and kiss, Laney asks Zack about his bet with Dean (which is now lost), and Zack responds that he will gracefully honor the terms.  At the graduation ceremony, the terms of the bet are revealed, Zack must appear nude on stage because he lost. After his name is called, Zack heads to the stage wearing only a graduation cap and strategically carrying a [[soccer ball]]. In the final shot he is not visible, but we see Laney with the soccer ball being thrown to her and the rest of the students reacting to Zack no longer having it for cover.

Shower (film)
  An aged father known to everyone as '''Old Liu''' (played by [[Zhu Xu]]) and his younger, [[mentally challenged]] son '''Liu Erming''' ([[Jiang Wu]]) run and live in a traditional [[Public bathing|bathhouse]] for men in an old district in [[Beijing]]. The bathhouse provides a variety of peripheral services, including [[haircut]], [[massage]], [[shaving]], [[fire cupping]], even old-style [[pedicure]], to a motley group of regular customers, many of whom are retired old Beijingers. The patrons usually spend their entire day, day after day, in the bathhouse, engaging in a game of [[Chinese chess]] or [[cricket fighting]]. As such, they have formed close bonds not only with one another, but also with Old Liu, who is manager, staff, mediator in squabbles, and marriage consultant all in one. One of the patrons is a man who sings ''[['O Sole Mio]]'' in the shower, but when he goes to sing it in public he loses his ability, until Erming provides him with a shower from a hose. Another patron is Mr. Zhang, whose marriage has been in trouble ever since his wife ran after a thief while naked, and Old Liu arranges a reconciliation by having the man find his wife in the bath. After the bathhouse closes in the evening, Old Liu and Erming go for their daily jog around the neighbourhood, after which they engage in a contest to hold their breath in water as they bathe. Even simple tasks such as cleaning up the bathhouse are tremendous fun for the duo, both of whom behave like little children at these times.  One day, Old Liu's elder son '''Liu Daming''' ([[Pu Cunxin]]), who left many years ago to seek fortunes in the southern city of [[Shenzhen]], abruptly returns home. Now a successful businessman, Daming had received a postcard from Erming with a drawing of their father lying in bed. Thinking that his father has died, Daming rushed home, only to find it a misunderstanding. However, the father-son ties between Old Liu and Daming appear to be strained, and Daming plans to return to Shenzhen three days later.  When Erming accompanies Daming downtown to reserve a plane ticket, Erming mindlessly wanders off from the area and is nowhere to be seen. After a futile search, Daming returns home to his distressed father, who lashes out at him for not being able to take care of his younger brother. Old Liu laments that having already lost one son (referring to Daming), he cannot afford to lose the other. The next morning, however, Erming is able to find his own way home, to the relief of everyone. Having already postponed his flight, Daming decides to stay one more night.  It rains heavily overnight. While up on the roof fixing leaks, Old Liu catches a cold and falls sick the next morning. Daming volunteers to take over the work in the bathhouse, delaying his return once more. In the next few days, Daming stays on to help in the bathhouse. He even joins in the daily evening jog with his father and Erming. One evening, after coming back from jogging, Old Liu passes away peacefully whilst bathing in the bathtub.  Erming refuses to accept the reality of his father's death and insists on opening the bathhouse every day at the usual time. In the meantime, Daming is planning to bring Erming back to Shenzhen to live with him, but he is worried about his wife's reaction regarding the mentally challenged Erming. He decides to leave Erming in a mental hospital for a couple of weeks whilst he goes back to Shenzhen to make preparations. This is not received well by Erming, however, as he struggles to cope at the mental hospital after fighting with the hospital attendants. In response to the situation, Daming decides to bring Erming back to the bathhouse again and temporarily resume operations.  Meanwhile, the entire district is due to be demolished to make way for commercial development. As removalists begin to move old furniture out of the bathhouse, Erming furiously attempts to stop the removalists from moving out the furniture in an attempt to keep the bathhouse. Eventually, he is convinced by Daming to accept the reality of the situation. The film concludes with a group of old customers gathering in the bathhouse for the last time, removing old paintings and portraits from the walls. Simultaneously, Erming begins nostalgically singing the tune of ''[[O Sole Mio]]'' as a final farewell to the bathhouse.

Bachchu Yadav's lackeys trace their boss to a prostitute's abode, where he receives the telephone and is informed that his party has selected another MLA for the ticket this time. Yadav wastes no time, reaches the newly selected MLA candidate's home and pressures him to give up his nomination in lieu of money. When intimidation fails, Yadav's thugs stabbed the MLA-candidate under Yadav's supervision.  Meanwhile, Inspector Samar Pratap Singh ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]) arrives at Motihari, where he has been transferred as an inspector, with his wife ([[Raveena Tandon]]) and daughter. At the railway station he gets into a confrontation with a [[coolie]] ([[Rajpal Yadav]]). The two have a tiff on the payment of Rs. 30/- to be paid to the coolie for his services, which Singh refuses to pay, as he (rightfully) thinks he is being overcharged. As the situation goes to the verge of fisticuffs, a local police ''[[Constable|hawaldaar]]'' intervenes. Not knowing that Singh, too, is a police officer, the hawaldaar tries to manhandle Singh. Infuriated, Singh takes the matter to the police station to which he is posted. As Singh writes a complaint against the hawaldaar for harassing an innocent local (Singh), a sub-inspector, Hussain, intervenes. Hussain asks Singh to forgive the hawaldaar, to which Singh does not relent. Singh later learns that the Motihari police station runs according to the whims of a local politician and criminal, Bachhu Yadav, and his henchmen. Singh is an idealist who respects the constitution and the law, and expects that everyone else should do the same. But no one follows the law in Motihari, especially the policemen who receive [[hafta]] (illicit weekly payments) from Yadav to do his bidding.  One day, the [[Deputy Superintendent of Police]] ([[Shrivallabh Vyas]]) asks Singh to break up a fight between two rival gangs and arrest the people who attacked some of Yadav's men. Singh investigates and finds out that Yadav's men are the real culprits. Among them are Sudhir Vinod ([[Nagesh Bhosle]]) and Lallan Singh ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]), so Singh arrests them instead. When the D.S.P. orders Singh to release them, he refuses, saying that he has already registered the case. This is the first time Singh's superior learns of his real character and expresses concern over his future. Sub-inspector Hussain, who shamelessly admits to subjection to Yadav, declares that Singh won't last long in his current job if he continues in his ways. Singh sadly learns the limit of his official prowess, when the court releases Yadav's men.  Yadav demonstrates his limited education when he speaks in the [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]] against the construction of a hydro-electric dam on the river [[Ganges]], as it would be "stealing" electricity from the water to the disadvantage of the farmers; he misquotes the famous political slogan "[[Jai Jawan Jai Kisan".  Singh finds himself alone in his fight and against the odds of a corrupt and rotten system. One day, while buying vegetables in the local market, he sees three young men sitting on a wall teasing passing girls by singing lewd [[Bhojpuri]] songs; when he confronts them they react defiantly to Singh (who is in plainclothes). However, on learning that he is the [[S.H.O.]], the two become defensive and tell him meekly that they are students of M.S. College, but the third declares proudly that he is younger brother of an influential politician Pranav Thakur (not Yadav), hoping that Singh will be impressed, but Singh retorts with a slap and forces him to apologise to the girls.  On his way home, Yadav decides to give an interview to a female journalist who boldly asks him if he is a murderer. Yadav, understandably, gets annoyed and tries to confuse and intimidate her, and upon failing to do so, simply asks her to get out of his car.  Yadav gets irritated by Singh's methods, particularity because he arrested his men. He decides to annoy him and organises his own marriage anniversary and arranges a folk dance by hiring a beautiful [[nautch]] girl ([[Shilpa Shetty]]) late into night. Singh reaches the scene and asks to see the permission papers that are required in India for operating [[loudspeakers]] late into the night. When no such official papers are produced, Singh seizes the music system and disrupts the party. Yadav confronts him and asks to be forgiven (in a patronising and satiric manner). The inebriated D.S.P. who is also present at the party tries to cool Singh's tempers by telling him such rules are inconsequential in small villages. Singh refuses to yield, which angers the D.S.P. who gives Singh a direct order to let the matter go. Singh stands firm, and states that he will let the situation go only if is given written orders. The following morning, the act of defiance by Singh causes a heated debate between Singh and the D.S.P., who, with the help of the corrupt sub-inspector Hussain, falsely frames Singh for a physical attack on his senior (D.S.P.). Tiwari ([[Vineet Kumar]]) tries to help Singh but in vain. Singh gets suspended from his post.  Yadav and his men decide to land the final blow on Singh and finish him once and for all. One day, when Singh takes his daughter to a sweet-shop, Yadav's goons begin passing disgustingly indecent comments towards Singh's daughter, which causes Singh to lose his temper, who single-handedly beats them. One of the henchman attacks Singh with a heavy wooden club, but instead bludgeons Singh's daughter on her head, killing her.  When the badly injured Laljee goes to Yadav and tells him that Singh has beaten them badly, Yadav, who cares next to nothing even about his most loyal men, finds it a golden opportunity to accuse Singh. He immediately takes a shotgun from the wall and hits Laljee on the head forcefully enough to kill him, and then orders his henchmen to register a complaint that Laljee actually died because of the beating by Singh. The police waste no time and arrest Singh while he is still grieving over his daughter's dead body. Singh's parents come to help him, and his father ([[Virendra Saxena]]) pleads with Yadav to get him released. Yadav uses this situation to his advantage and gets Singh released by asking one of his henchmen to testify. When Singh realises that Yadav was behind his release, he insults Yadav.  A few days later, Singh's parents leave, and he has a big fight with his wife and she says that his idealism is to blame for the quagmire they find themselves in and for the death of their daughter. She asks him why he doesn't just go and kill Yadav if he's as brave as he pretends to be. Singh tells her he's afraid for her sake. That if she had not been in his life, Yadav would be dead and buried by now. Then he leaves in a huff. His wife tries to commit suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills. Singh's only true friend in town, the honest sub-inspector Tiwari, informs Singh about his wife's suicide attempt and both rush to the hospital. Singh manages to speak a few sentences of comfort with her, where she absolves him of his guilt and asks him to avenge her and their daughter, before she dies.  Singh, having lost the woman he loved; feels he has lost everything and has nothing to live for anymore. He goes home, readies himself and wears his police uniform, visits the police station and snatches his [[service weapon]] in spite of sub-inspector Hussain's warning. Singh kills Hussain, then makes way to Patna where the state legislature is in session, enters the well of the house, defying heavy security. Singh finds Yadav and drags him by his collar to the Speaker's dais. After an emotional appeal to members of parliament on the leadership crisis and [[Corruption in India|criminalisation of politics]] that is rotting and consuming the entire system in India, he shoots Yadav in the head, declares his patriotism and yells "[[Jai Hind]]" twice.

The Sixth Sense
 Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in [[Philadelphia]], returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. A young man then appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself.  The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe in the iconic line: he sees [[Ghost|ghosts]], who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.  At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, Vincent begins crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to attempt helping.  Cole talks to one of the ghosts, a young girl named Kyra who recently died after a chronic illness. He goes with Crowe to her funeral reception at her home, where Kyra directs him to a box holding a videotape, which he then gives to her father. The tape shows Kyra's mother poisoning her daughter's food. By proving she was a victim of [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], Cole has saved Kyra's younger sister, the mother's next victim.  Learning to live with the ghosts he sees, Cole begins to fit in at school and is cast as the lead in the school play, which Crowe attends. The doctor and patient depart on positive terms and Cole suggests to Crowe that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep. Later, while stuck in traffic, Cole confesses his secret to his mother, saying that someone died in an accident ahead of their traffic and he knows because the person is next to him. Although his mother at first does not believe him, Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him. He describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance, even though Lynn thought her mother was not there. He further relays the answer to a question his mother privately asked at her mother's grave: "Every day." When Cole asks what question she asked, his mother tearfully answers, "Do I make her proud?" They hug.  Crowe returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing. While still asleep, Anna asks her husband why he left her, and drops Crowe's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. He remembers what Cole said about ghosts and realizes that he has actually been dead the whole time, having been killed by Vincent. Because of Cole's efforts, Crowe's unfinished business – rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent – is finally complete. Crowe fulfills the second reason he returned; to tell his wife she was never second, and that he loves her. His goal complete, he is free to leave the world of the living.  
Sleepy Hollow (film)
 In 1799, [[New York City]] police constable Ichabod Crane is deployed to the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] hamlet of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], which has been plagued by a series of brutal slayings in which the victims are found [[Decapitation|decapitated]]: Peter Van Garrett, a wealthy farmer; his son Dirk; and the widow Emily Winship. Crane learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] [[mercenary]] from the [[American Revolutionary War]] who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.  Crane begins his investigation, remaining skeptical about the paranormal elements until he actually encounters the [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]], who kills the town [[magistrate]], Samuel Phillipse. Boarding at the home of the town's richest family, the Van Tassels, Crane is taken with their daughter, Katrina. Crane and Young Masbath, the son of one of the Horseman's victims, go to the cave dwelling of a reclusive witch. She reveals the location of the Tree of the Dead, which marks the Horseman's grave, as well as his portal into the natural, living world.  Crane discovers that the ground is freshly disturbed and the Horseman's skull is missing. That night, the family of the village midwife is killed by the Horseman and Katrina's suitor, Brom van Brunt is also killed trying to stop the Horseman. The Horseman doesn't attempt to interact with or harm van Brunt until he has no choice; from this, Crane hypothesizes that the Horseman is attacking select targets, and that whoever dug up and stole the skull is the person controlling the Horseman.  Crane starts to believe that a conspiracy links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovered was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman, and that Katrina's father and Van Garrett's relative Baltus Van Tassel, who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.  Shortly after the suicide of the town's notary, James Hardenbrook, a council is held in the church. The Horseman seemingly kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, and heads off to the church to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter the church due to it being [[holy ground (religion)|holy ground]]. A fight breaks out between the surviving village elders in the church, resulting in the deaths of Reverend Steenwyck and Dr. Thomas Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina to be the one who controls the Headless Horsemen.  Crane later becomes suspicious when he realizes the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is really one of protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound that seems to have been caused post-mortem.  Lady Van Tassel then emerges, alive and well, and ambushes Katrina, revealing that she murdered a servant girl to fake her death. She finally reveals to Katrina her past: her family (née Archer) became impoverished after her father died, and was driven from their ancestral home they rented from the Van Garretts due to lack of rent income; Van Garrett then sold their home to the Van Tassels. Her mother could not find employment or housing due to rumors of [[witchcraft]], forcing the family to take refuge in the woods. Lady Van Tassel and her twin sister were then left orphaned following their mother's death, but the former discovered an opportunity to exact revenge when she witnessed the death of the Hessian. She then proceeded to [[Deal with the Devil|pledge her soul]] to [[Satan]] and become a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. After secretly killing Katrina's ailing mother and marrying her father, she summoned the Hessian horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, in order to be able to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested; in the process, she also used fear, blackmail, and lust in order to draw the village elders into her plot. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates. She also reveals that she had recently murdered her sister, who is revealed to be the same witch who had earlier aided Crane in locating the Hessian's grave, as retaliation for going against her.  Following a fight and a stagecoach chase, Crane eventually thwarts Lady Van Tassel by throwing the skull to the Horseman, who reattaches his head to his body and breaks Lady Van Tassel's curse. The Horseman, no longer under her control, hoists Van Tassel up on his horse and gives her a bloody kiss against her will.<ref></ref> He then rides to [[Hell]], taking her with a smile, fulfilling her end of her bargain with the Devil. Crane returns home to New York City with Katrina and Young Masbath, just in time for the [[19th century|new century]].  
SLC Punk!
 The film outlines the daily lives of two punks in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] in the fall of 1985: Stevo and his best friend, "Heroin" Bob; Stevo narrates the film. The nickname "Heroin" is [[Irony|ironic]], as Bob is [[Trypanophobia|afraid of needles]] and actually believes that any drug (with the notable exception of alcohol and cigarettes) is inherently dangerous.  Stevo and Bob go from party to party while living in a dilapidated apartment. They spend much of their time fighting with members of other subcultures, particularly [[rednecks]]. Stevo has a casual relationship with a girl named Sandy, while Heroin Bob is in love with Trish, the manager of a [[head shop]], but reluctant to ask her to become his girlfriend.  The two of them are shaped by their experiences with their parents. Stevo's parents, now divorced, are former hippies who are proud of their youthful endeavors; however, Stevo is revolted by what he perceives as their "selling out" by becoming affluent [[Reagan Republican]]s, which they lamely try to justify. Stevo's grades are excellent, and when his father—a lawyer with a [[Porsche]] and a penchant for younger women—sends an application to [[Harvard Law School]] and Stevo is accepted, he nevertheless rejects it because of his beliefs. By contrast, Bob's father is a paranoid, drunken wreck who mistakes his son and his friend for [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operatives, and chases them away with a shotgun when they visit him on his birthday.  Stevo begins to see the drawbacks of living the punk life. Sean, a fellow punk, is a drug dealer who once attempts to stab his mother while under the influence of an entire 100-dose sheet of acid, before being taken away by the police; Stevo later finds him [[Begging|panhandling]] on the streets with some obvious mental issues.  While Stevo understands that his relationship with Sandy is casual, he's still enraged when he discovers her having sex with another man, and savagely beats him, later loathing himself because his action contradicts his own belief in [[anarchism]]. His social circle begins to drift away, as Mike leaves Salt Lake City to attend the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Stevo falls in love with a young rich girl named Brandy ([[Summer Phoenix]]), who points out that his anarchistic clothing and attitude are more of a fashion choice than an actual political philosophy. Rather than being offended, Stevo takes the criticism thoughtfully and they passionately kiss.  At the same party, Heroin Bob complains of a headache (induced by [[Spandau Ballet]]'s "She Loved Like Diamond" playing on a stereo), and is given [[Percodan]], which he consumes after being told the pills are simply "vitamins" that will help his headache. The accidental [[drug overdose]] kills him in his sleep, seemingly justifying the aversion to chemicals he previously espoused in a diatribe delivered to Stevo. When Stevo discovers that his best friend is dead, he breaks down completely. At the funeral, he appears with a shaved head and changed clothing, and decides that he's done with his punk lifestyle. He decides to go to Harvard, and suggests in the narration that he marries Brandy. He notes in his closing narration that his youthful self would probably kick his future self's ass, wryly describing himself as ultimately just another [[poseur]].  ===The "Tribes"=== The film features several cliques presented as "tribes." The film focuses primarily on the punk tribe, but includes several others as well: * [[Punk subculture|Punk]]s: Stevo, Bob, Sean, Megan, and Mike belong to this tribe, although Mike doesn't dress the part. The punks are rivals of the [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Neo-Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Redneck (stereotype)|rednecks]]. * [[Mod revival|Mods]]: Mods wear suits and ties, and they ride scooters. They're generally the rivals of the punks, but the character John the Mod acts as a diplomat who freely moves between the tribes. In the beginning of the movie, the mods are trying to buy acid from Sean. * [[Redneck]]s: Rednecks are rural Utah folk who wear trucker caps and flannel, and drive around in big trucks. Punks hate them for their conservative views. * [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]]s: Neo-Nazis are [[white power skinhead]]s who wear pseudo-military fatigues and Nazi armbands. Punks and mods are shown to be predatory towards the Nazis. * The [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] Guys: They have long hair and flannel. Not much else is known about them, except that Stevo explains that they are predatory toward the New Wavers. * [[New wave music|New wavers]]: They are people who dress like [[New Romantic]]s and are said to be the least threatening of the tribes. They are described as being "the new [[hippie]]s." Every Tribe is predatory to the New Wavers.

Snow Falling on Cedars (film)
 Set on the fictional San Piedro Island in the northern [[Puget Sound]] region of the [[Washington state]] coast in 1950, the plot revolves around the murder case of Kazuo Miyamoto ([[Rick Yune]]), a [[Japanese American]] accused of killing Carl Heine, a [[White American|White]] fisherman.  The trial occurs in the midst of deep [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s following [[World War II]].  Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, Ishmael Chambers ([[Ethan Hawke]]), a World War II veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese in the [[Pacific War]].  Ishmael struggles with his childhood, and continuing, love for Kazuo's wife, Hatsue ([[Youki Kudoh]]), and his conscience, wondering if Kazuo is truly innocent.  Spearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran ([[Richard Jenkins]]), and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks ([[James Rebhorn]]).  Leading the defense is the old, experienced attorney Nels Gudmundsson ([[Max von Sydow]]).  An underlying theme throughout the trial is prejudice.  Several witnesses, including Etta Heine ([[Celia Weston]]), Carl's mother, accuse Kazuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. This stance is not without irony, as Kazuo (a decorated war veteran of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]]), experienced prejudice because of his ancestry, following the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].  By the same standard, Etta, a [[German American]], could be blamed for Nazi war crimes.  Also involved in the trial is Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sold his strawberry field to Carl.  The strawberry field is a contested issue during the trial.  The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr.  The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Carl Sr.  Kazuo and Carl Jr. were close friends as children.  Kazuo's father, Zenhichi, eventually approached Carl Sr. about purchasing  of the farm.  Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed.  The payments were to be made over a ten-year period.  However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the U.S. and Japan, and [[Japanese American internment|all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps]].  In 1944, Carl Sr. died and Etta sold the land to Ole.  When Kazuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter toward Etta for reneging on the land sale.  When Ole suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Jr., hours before Kazuo arrived, to try to buy the land back.  During the trial, the land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder.  Ishmael's search of the maritime records reveals on the night that Carl Heine died a freighter had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42am, five minutes before his watch had stopped.  Ishmael realises that Carl was thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake.  Despite the bitterness he feels at Hatsue's rejection, Ishmael comes forward with the new information.  Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head, then fallen into the sea.  The charges against Kazuo are dismissed. Hatsue thanks Ishmael by allowing him to hold her "one last time."

 ''Solas'' (''Alone'') tells the story of María (Ana Fernández) and her mother Rosa (María Galiana). María is one of four adult children, all of whom moved as far as they could get from their parents and the farm where they grew up. Before the movie starts, the father (later revealed to be a violent, cruel, abusive man) has fallen ill and been brought to a hospital in [[Seville]], where María lives. Rosa has been staying at the hospital with him, but the doctor tells her to leave before she falls ill herself. María takes Rosa to stay with her in the rundown suburban apartment where she lives, and Rosa rides the bus every day to visit her husband.  María is intelligent and wanted an education, but her father wouldn't allow it. Now, at 35, she works for a cleaning service; she is lonely, poor, angry and bitter. She discovers she is pregnant by a man who doesn't want a baby and tells María to get an abortion. When she tells him she wants to have the baby and raise it with him, the man rejects her. In her anger and despair, María starts drinking heavily.  As her mother Rosa returns from shopping one day, she meets María's neighbor (''vecino'') Don Emilio (Carlos Álvarez-Nóvoa), a kind old widower living alone with his dog. A friendship blossoms between them: he lends Rosa some money when she runs short at the supermarket, and she cooks for him after he burns a stew he forgot was cooking. He falls in love with Rosa, but Rosa is faithful to her abusive husband. (At one point she says to María about her father, "He must not have an easy conscience. I do.")  Rosa's husband recovers and she returns with him to the country, not knowing about María's pregnancy. María tells Don Emilio about the baby and tells him she plans to abort it. In a long, emotional scene, he offers to be like a grandfather to the child if she decides to keep it, but María has been so badly treated by the men in her life that she has trouble believing him.  The movie ends with María visiting her parents' grave with her baby girl and Don Emilio. He is going to sell his apartment in Seville and the three of them will move into Rosa's house in the country to raise the baby.  
Soccer Dog: The Movie
 The movie begins with a now grown-up Alden (James Marshall) telling the story of his childhood in an orphanage, and how his parents set him on the steps of the Pelton Orphan home. He says that 'soccer was the only thing that made his life easier'. When he was too old to stay in the orphanage, he went out and married his wife Elena (Olivia d'Abo).   Alden misses his days of soccer, so he reasons that the only way to enjoy it was to have a son to play it with. Alden and Elena go to the Pelton Orphanage, where Alden has to face the mean headmaster. He and Elena adopt Clay (Jeremy Foley). They bring Clay home, and Clay isn't really into the spirit of things. Meanwhile, the setting shows a little boy playing with his dog, Kimble (who actually turns out to be Lincoln) in the park, then throws the ball over the fence of a construction site.   The evil dogcatcher, Damon Fleming (Billy Drago) catches 'Kimble' and takes him to the pound. The next day, Alden learns that Clay doesn't know how to play soccer. Clay goes to practice and is confused that his coach, Coach Shaw, who doesn't really know anything about soccer. He tells the team he wants 100% from each of them from each ''quarter'', and Sonny (whose father is a rich fat guy with two bodyguards) points out that in soccer there are no quarters, just two halves. Coach Shaw gets irritated and tells Sonny that there is no A in team, then spells it T-E...go take a lap. (Coach Shaw has a nasty habit of telling his players to go take a lap when he says something wrong and he knows they are right.)   Behind the scenes, when the dogcatcher goes to take a head count of the dogs, he finds Kimble isn't there, and finds he has escaped through a sewage hole in the floor under his mat. Kimble is seen running away and removing the orange tag on his right leg. After that, the coach is explaining that soccer is a game of 'hand eye coordination'. Clay raises his hand to ask a question, but is deterred by Vince (Kyle Gibson), who tells him not to bother and that 'daddy has a feeling baby was dropped on his head when he was a baby'.  Meanwhile, the dogcatcher sets out to find Kimble and, while eating a blade of grass, finds the orange tag Kimble tore off. On the other hand, Clay is walking back home from practice when Vince catches up with him. They talk a little, but Clay doesn't really understand Vince because he calls people 'baby' and calls himself 'daddy'. That's when Clay spots Kimble digging in a flower bed and calls to him, and Kimble comes. Later that night, at dinner, Elena wants Clay to take violin lessons, and she and Alden argue. Clay excuses himself to go feed Kimble, who he has named Lincoln and hid in his bathroom. Alden thinks that Clay is not feeling welcome, so he comes into Clay's bedroom to find he was hiding a dog.  In the middle of the soccer season, Sonny's dad thinks that Vince is getting too 'hot' and that if he keeps showing off, Sonny was to give him a food poisoning pill. Sonny drops it in Vince's drink and Vince can't play. Lincol, runs out on the field and the Coach appoints him to play. The referee tells a really old lady to check the book of soccer rules, which is a 7 inch tall book. The rules state that Lincoln can play for the team. Lincoln scores a goal minutes afterwards. At the end of the season, the team wins the championship. Lincoln's original owners take their dog back, but Clay gets a puppy at the end that looks exactly like Lincoln. The dogcatcher disappears, and Alden becomes the coach of the Stampede.

However, the boys are refused entry due to the film being [[MPAA|R-rated]], so they pay a homeless man to accompany them.  The following day, the boys begin [[profanity|swearing]] in class, and are sent to Mr. Mackey, the school counselor, who informs their mothers. Later, the boys see the film again, and Kenny bets Cartman $100 that he can set his fart on fire like Terrance in the film. Kenny immolates himself and ultimately dies, leading to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman being grounded. Kenny is sent to [[Hell]], where he is tormented by [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]. Back on Earth, the parents of South Park organize a boycott against Canada and Terrance and Phillip, which is led by Kyle's mother, Sheila. Terrance and Phillip are arrested as [[War crime|war criminals]]. When the United States refuses to release the duo, Canada retaliates by bombing the residence of the [[Baldwin brothers]].  Sheila and President [[Bill Clinton]] announce that the United States will go to war with Canada and have Terrance and Phillip executed at a [[USO]] show. After overhearing Cartman leading the children in a song degrading her, Sheila has Dr. Vosknocker implant a [[V-Chip]]. The device gives Cartman an electric shock every time he swears. Back in Hell, Satan declares that if the blood of the two innocent Canadians touches American soil, he will invade Earth. Later, Kenny's ghost visits Cartman to warn him of the consequences of executing Terrance and Phillip. After failing to convince their parents, the boys decide to take matters into their own hands. They form ''La Resistance'' and Gregory tells Stan to recruit a God-hating French expert on covert operations named "The Mole".  ''La Resistance'' infiltrate the USO show, but The Mole is discovered and killed by guard dogs. The remaining boys attempt to warn their mothers about what will happen if Terrance and Phillip are killed, but they are laughed at, and Mr. Garrison activates the electric chair. A Canadian force attacks the base and a battle ensues between the two armies. In the confusion, the boys are able to free Terrance and Phillip, though Cartman's V-chip begins to malfunction. The mothers, seeing the destruction their movement has incited, decide to give up and look for their children.  Stan leads the kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. ''La Resistance'' forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but after he insults Cartman and Cartman yells profanity back at Saddam, a bolt of energy shoots through his pointing finger and kills some of the minions. Realizing his power, and with Kyle's encouragement, Cartman starts using profanity to power himself up and shoot even more powerful electrical bolts at Saddam (sort of like [[Emperor Palpatine]] of [[Star Wars]]). During this Saddam demands Satan help him and calls him vile words for not, which finally drives Satan to throw him back to Hell and die on a stalagmite. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how it was before the war, even though it means he will have to go back to Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.

Sooryavansham
  The story is set in the backdrop of rural India. Thakur Bhanupratap Singh ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is the head of the "Sooryavansh" kinfolk, an aristocratic family in the village of Bharatpur where he is also the distinguished [[Sarpanch]] of the local [[Gram panchayat]]. Thakur Bhanupratap's has 3 sons and strained relationship with the youngest one, Heera, ([[Amitabh Bachchan]], in a dual role) since he is illiterate. However, Heera has intense respect for his father.  One day, Radha ([[Soundarya]]), whose brother is engaged to Heera's sister, visits the house. She notices that although Heera is son of Thakur Bhanupratap Singh, he is treated as a servant in the house. She gets gets to know from Dharmendra ([[Anupam Kher]]) that in his childhood, Heera was a [[dunce]] and always earned very poor marks in his school examinations, to face his strict father's wrath. Heera actually did not go to school for knowledge, his sole purpose of attending school was meeting his classmate Gauri – the girl adopted by Thakur Bhanupratap after the demise of her parents. Once a teacher severely punished Gauri, and Heera, in a fit of rage, struck the teacher and bolted away along with Gauri. Heera thus became a [[High school dropouts|school dropout]] and never continued his studies, whereas Gauri proceeded with her studies while maintaining a well-disposed relationship with Heera.   Thakur Bhanupratap, being aware of the love affair of Heera and Gauri ([[Rachana Banerjee]]), arranged the marriage of the two. However, when Gauri came to know about this marriage arrangement, she attempted suicide, only to be rescued by Heera. In reality, Gauri's "love" for Heera was mendacious. She would never marry Heera, whom she considered worthless because of his illiteracy. In order to protect her righteousness in the eyes of Thakur Bhanupratap, she made Heera declare before Thakur Bhanupratap that the decision of their [[breakup]] and cancellation of their marriage was Heera's own. A docile Heera, for the sake of Gauri's happiness, did so and added to the displeasure of his father for him. Later, Heera, with tearful eyes, watched the marriage of Gauri with a well-off man and he developed antipathy for love because of the distress caused by all these happenings.  Listening to Heera's sad past from Dharmendra, a compassionate Radha acquires fascination for Heera and she exhibits indications of love for him many a time, which Heera does not reciprocate to. However, a persistent Radha convinces Heera to overcome his past and they fall in love.  Later one day, Heera receives a letter from Radha in which she writes that her parents are arranging her marriage with Deshraj/Kevada Thakur's ([[Mukesh Rishi]]) son (Emraan Khan) against her will. Radha resolves either to unite with Heera or hang herself to death. Kevada Thakur is an arch-enemy of Thakur Bhanupratap and he has a plan of bringing the ruin of the Sooryavansh family by establishing familial relationship with Radha's family, and subsequently by obliging Radha's wealthy lawyer father ([[Shivaji Satam]]) to act in Kevada Thakur's favour. Radha's mother ([[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]]) vehemently censures of her daughter's decision of marrying an illiterate man like Heera and pleads Thakur Bhanupratap to make Heera steer clear of Radha. Thakur Bhanupratap sends for Heera and says to him that if he abandons Radha, he will be received by Thakur Bhanupratap as his son. On the other hand, Dharmendra persuades Heera to accept Radha by saying that Radha's love for Heera is real and heartfelt; only a few fortunate men receive true love and that ire of Thakur Bhanupratap for Heera is short-lived which will eventually melt away. Heera heeds Dharmendra's advice and, on the day of Radha's wedding with Kevada Thakur's son,  Heera gatecrashes into the ceremony and carries Radha away with him and marry in a temple. This act of Heera stirs up great anger in Thakur Bhanupratap who terminates his relationship with Heera and Radha.  Heera and Radha start living on the village outskirts. Both form an ideal husband-wife couple and eventually receive the acceptance of Radha's family. Heera starts eking out a living by working in a transport company, and later, with the financial assistance of Radha's uncle Major Ranjit Singh ([[Kader Khan]]) and by dint of his diligence, launches a bus service under the name of his father, which soon flourishes into a booming transport company. Radha teaches Heera [[the three Rs]] while she pursues her [[Indian Administrative Service|I.A.S.]] studies. Soon the hardships caused by poverty and the disgrace of Heera being illiterate cease and in due course of time, Heera becomes an affluent businessman and Radha becomes the [[District collector]] and soon a son is born to them.  One day, Thakur Bhanupratap incidentally comes across Heera and Radha's son and is very much gladdened by the child's principles and behavior. Soon he learns that the boy is Heera and Radha's son – a progeny of Sooryavansh. Thakur Bhanupratap develops a friendly relationship with his grandson unbeknownst to Heera, Radha or any member of his family. Heera eventually learns to his surprise and delight that his son has been in communication with his father Thakur Bhanupratap. One day all of Heera's family secretly attend the opening of a charitable hospital for the poor which Heera has set up, which was his father's dream, during the speech Heera solely praises his father who listens on in shock, that despite all he has done, Heera still respects him so much and leaves although his wife sees him.   As a mark of affection for and devotion to his father, Heera gives his son some canned [[kheer]] to be offered to Thakur Bhanupratap upon his next meeting with his son. On the other hand, Heera's mother, Sharda ([[Jayasudha]]) too discovers Thakur Bhanupratap secretly meeting his grandson, and she urges Thakur Bhanupratap to accept Heera back into their family. She says to him that earlier Heera was known by his father Thakur Bhanupratap whereas nowadays Thakur Bhanupratap is is known by his son Heera. She reminds that nowadays children drive their parents out of home, whereas Heera is the son who has been expelled by his father. These words of Sharda make Thakur Bhanupratap comprehend the virtue of Heera and he rings him up. Before Thakur Bhanupratap speaks a word to Heera over the phone, he throws up blood, apparently because of consuming the kheer offered by Heera. A critically ill Thakur Bhanupratap is hospitalized.  The hospital is swarmed by Thakur Bhanupratap's well-wishers. When Heera arrives at the hospital, Kevada Thakur proclaims before the crowd that it is Heera who has attempted to kill his father because of his elimination by Thakur Bhanupratap from his family, with the poisoned kheer being an evidence against Heera. When Kevada Thakur and his men proceed to kill Heera, Thakur Bhanupratap arrives for Heera's rescue. It is then when Thakur Bhanupratap testifies against Kevada Thakur in presence of the crowd how Kevada Thakur, with artifice, poisoned the kheer offered to him by Heera. An impassioned Thakur Bhanupratap gives up all the hatred for Heera, unifies with him and decides to pass his final verdict on this long-standing enmity with Kevada Thakur. Both Thakur Bhanupratap and Heera fight Kevada Thakur and his men until Kevada Thakur confesses his guilt and begs Thakur Bhanupratap for his forgiveness.  In the final scene of the movie, the kith and kin of Sooryvansh convene. Heera's son sings the song "Kore Kore Sapne Mere" when Thakur Bhanupratap arrives and continues with the following line of the song as he embraces Heera – "Waada Hai Waada, Chaahenge Tumko, Jeevan Se Zyaada", meaning, "It's a promise that I will love you more than my life".

The Republic's leader, [[Supreme Chancellor Valorum]], dispatches [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to negotiate with Federation Viceroy [[Nute Gunray]]. [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]], a [[Sith|Sith Lord]] and the Trade Federation's secret adviser, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of [[battle droid]]s. The Jedi escape and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, Qui-Gon saves a [[Gungan]] outcast, [[Jar Jar Binks]], from being run over and killed by a droid transport. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to an underwater Gungan city. The Jedi unsuccessfully try to persuade the Gungan leader, [[Boss Nass]], into helping the people of Naboo, though they are able to obtain transportation to Theed, the capital city on the surface. They rescue Queen [[Padmé Amidala]], the ruler of the Naboo people, and escape the planet on her royal starship en route to the Republic capital planet of [[Coruscant]].  Amidala's ship is damaged as they pass the Federation blockade and becomes unable to use its [[hyperdrive]], landing for repairs on the desert planet [[Tatooine]]. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], and Padmé – disguised as one of her handmaidens – visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase new parts at a junk shop. They meet the shop's owner, [[Watto]], and his nine-year-old slave, [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], who is a gifted pilot and engineer, and who has created a [[protocol droid]] called [[C-3PO]]. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of [[the Force]] within Anakin, and is convinced that he is the "chosen one" of the Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force.

Undaunted, Qui-Gon wants to relieve Obi-Wan from his tutorship and take up Anakin as his new disciple. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator [[Palpatine]] persuades Amidala to make a [[vote of no confidence]] in Valorum to elect a more capable chancellor to resolve the crisis on Naboo.

Stigmata (film)
 In the [[Brazil]]ian village of Belo Quinto, Father Andrew Kiernan, a former scientist and a [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] who investigates supposed miracles, examines a statue of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] weeping blood at the funeral of Father Paulo Alameida, who had previously experienced [[stigmata]]. While Andrew is collecting evidence, a young boy steals a rosary from the father's hand. The boy later sells it to a woman in a marketplace, who sends it to her daughter, Frankie Paige, living in [[Pittsburgh]].  Shortly afterward, Frankie is attacked by an unseen force while bathing, and receives two deep wounds on her wrists. As the wounds are treated, doctors cannot find the cause. Frankie asks a priest if he is Andrew Kiernan, the scientist, priest and investigator. When the priest says he is Father Derning, the lights in the train flash and Frankie is whipped from behind by an unseen force. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and Andrew is sent to investigate.  Andrew interviews Frankie, believing her wounds may also be [[stigmata]]. When she tells him she is an [[atheist]], Andrew tells her that stigmata is when the deeply devoted are struck with the [[Holy Wounds|five wounds]] that Jesus received during the crucifixion. Frankie begins to research on her own what the cause could be. Her head begins to bleed, the third stigmata wound caused by the [[Crown of Thorns]]. Frankie runs home, where Andrew is waiting, and then runs into an alley. As Andrew pursues her, Frankie smashes a glass bottle and uses the shards to carve symbols on the hood of a car: when Andrew approaches her, she yells at him in another language.  Andrew takes Frankie to Father Derning's church, and the Vatican translates what she was yelling in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The next morning, Andrew returns to her apartment to find her writing on the wall, now covered in Aramaic. Frankie talks in a male voice, speaking [[Italian language|Italian]]. Wounds appear in her feet, the fourth wound of stigmata. Andrew emails photographs of Frankie's apartment wall to the Vatican, where Brother Delmonico recognizes the words and deletes the pictures. He tells Andrew the words are from a document the church found that looked to be an entirely new [[gospel]]. Father Dario shows the pictures to Cardinal Daniel Houseman, who also recognizes them. Delmonico phones Marion Petrocelli and tells him the missing gospel has been found in Pittsburgh.  Andrew goes to Frankie's apartment to find the wall she wrote on painted over, and Frankie attempts to seduce him. When Andrew rejects her, she attacks him and denounces his beliefs in a male voice, ending with Frankie [[levitating]] off the bed, crying tears of blood. Houseman and Dario arrive with Derning and take Frankie to another church, sending Andrew to Derning's. At Derning's church, Andrew meets Petrocelli, who tells him the words Frankie has been writing are part of a document found outside [[Jerusalem]] they believed to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus. Petrocelli, Delmonico and Alameida were assigned to translate it, but Houseman ordered them to stop. Alameida refused and stole the document to continue translating it alone, having been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by Houseman.  Petrocelli tells Andrew that the document was Jesus telling his disciples that the [[Kingdom of God]] is in all of us and not confined to churches. Petrocelli tells Andrew that Alameida suffered from stigmata. Andrew races to the church where Frankie is, while Houseman and Dario attempt to perform an [[exorcism]] on Frankie. Frankie shouts at them in a male voice, and Houseman attempts to strangle her. Andrew stops him, and the room is set on fire. Now believing Frankie is possessed by Alameida's spirit, Andrew offers to be Alameida's messenger instead. He walks unharmed through the fire to retrieve Frankie, bidding Alameida's spirit to depart in peace. Some time later, Andrew returns to Belo Quinto and finds the original documents for the lost gospel in Alameida's church.  Text describes the discovery of the [[Gospel of St. Thomas]], believed to be the closest to the actual words of Jesus stating that the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the document as a gospel and considers it [[heresy]].

At a party one evening, Tom challenges Lisa, Maggie's sister who is a believer in [[paranormal activity]], to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] in Tom urging him to "be more open-minded". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior.  While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the [[Chicago "L"|'L' station]] where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an [[intellectual disability]]: having the mental capacity of an eighth-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions.  Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie withholds her conversation with Neil from Tom and goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit that contacted Tom has asked for something and will grow upset if it does not get done. As predicted, Samantha begins plaguing Tom, eventually leading to his insomnia. He goes back to Lisa and demands she undo what she did, but when she hypnotizes him, Samantha tells him to dig. Tom complies and digs holes in the backyard and eventually tears up the house in a desperate attempt to appease Samantha.  While Maggie and Jake attend her grandmother's [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] at a relative's house, Tom inadvertently knocks down a shoddy brick wall in the basement and discovers Samantha's decomposed remains. He receives a vision showing him that before his family moved in, Adam and Kurt lured Samantha into the house to rape her. When she resisted, they unintentionally suffocated her and hid her body. Tom brings Frank back to the basement to disclose to him the crime. Frank breaks down and admits that Adam and Kurt had already confided their secret to him and Harry. Frank pulls out a gun and demands to be alone. As Tom leaves the basement, he hears a single shot.  Harry and Kurt suddenly show up. Harry, in his capacity as landlord, voices displeasure with the torn up house. They corner Tom with the intention of killing him, but Maggie interrupts them when she arrives back home. As Harry takes her hostage, Frank emerges from the basement and fatally shoots both Kurt and Harry to save Tom and Maggie. Tom notices Samantha's spirit put on her glasses and coat, smile as she walks down the road, and disappear. Afterwards, the family packs up a U-Haul and moves out of the house. Meanwhile, Samantha's mother and sister are finally able to give her a proper funeral and burial. Tom and Maggie smile happily as they drive away to a new neighborhood, but Jake covers his ears as they approach their new home, overwhelmed by the spirits that linger in all of the houses they pass by.

The Straight Story
 Alvin Straight has not shown up to his regular bar meeting with his friends. He is eventually found lying on his floor at home, although he insists that he "just needs a bit of help getting up". His daughter Rose takes her reluctant father to see a doctor, who sternly admonishes Alvin to give up tobacco. He also tells Alvin that he should start using a walker. Alvin refuses. Alvin then learns that his brother Lyle has suffered a stroke. Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin gradually develops a plan to travel to Mount Zion on his riding lawn-mower and towing a small homemade travel-trailer, to the consternation of his family and friends.  Alvin's first attempt fails: after experiencing difficulty starting the old mower's motor, he doesn't get far before the machine breaks down. Alvin arranges for his mower to be transported back home on a flatbed truck, where he takes out his frustrations on the mower with a shotgun blast. At the [[John Deere]] dealer, he purchases a newer lawn tractor from a salesman who is generous but describes Alvin as being a smart man, "until now."  Alvin continues on his quest. He passes a young female hitchhiker who later approaches his campfire and says that she could not get a ride. In conversation, Alvin deduces that she is pregnant (although this is not physically obvious) and has run away from home. Alvin tells her about the importance of family by describing a [[Fasces|bundle of sticks]] that is hard to break. The next day Alvin emerges from the trailer to find that she has left him a bundle of sticks tied together.  Later, a huge group of [[RAGBRAI]] cyclists race past him. He later arrives at the cyclists' camp and he is greeted with applause. He speaks with them about growing old. When he is asked about the worst part of being old, he replies, "remembering when you was young."  The next day, Alvin is troubled by the massive trucks passing him. He then interacts with a distraught woman who has hit a deer, and is being driven to distraction by the fact that she continually hits deer while commuting, no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. She drives away in a tearful huff, and Alvin, who had started to run short of food, cooks and eats the deer, then mounts the antlers above the rear doorway of his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the sustenance it had provided.  Alvin's brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill; he struggles to maintain control of the speeding tractor and finally manages to bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Some people help get Alvin's mower and trailer off the road. They later discover that the mower also has transmission problems.  Now beginning to run low on cash, Alvin borrows a cordless phone from a homeowner – gently refusing an invitation to come indoors – and calls Rose to ask her to send him his [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] check. He then leaves money on the doorstep to pay for his telephone call. A local motorist offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle's, but Alvin declines, stating that he prefers to travel his own way. An elderly war veteran takes him into town for a drink, and Alvin tells a story about how he is haunted by a memory of accidentally shooting one of his military comrades.  Alvin's tractor is fixed and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down, and explains his mission, which he calls "a hard swallow to [my] pride," but "a brother is a brother." The mechanic twins seem to relate to this.  Later, Alvin camps in a cemetery and chats with a priest who recognizes Lyle's name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention he had a brother. Alvin replies that "neither one of us has had a brother for quite some time." Alvin wants to make peace with Lyle and is emphatic that what happened ten years ago does not matter. "I say, 'Amen' to that, brother," the priest replies.  The next obstacle Alvin must overcome is apparent engine trouble, just a few miles from Lyle's house. Alvin stops in the middle of the road, unsure of how to proceed. A large farm tractor driving by then stops to help, but fortunately this time the problem was evidently just a few drops of bad gas, because the lawn-tractor's engine sputters to life again after sitting for a few minutes. The gracious farmer then leads the way on his own tractor, to make sure he gets there okay.  Lyle's house is dilapidated. Using two canes, Alvin makes his way to the door. He calls for his brother. Lyle invites Alvin to sit down. Lyle looks at Alvin's mower-tractor contraption and asks if Alvin had ridden that thing just to see him. Alvin responds simply, "I did, Lyle." The two men sit together silently and look up at the stars.

After the generator is ready, General Roberts orders the team to launch it into the weather front off the [[U.S. West Coast]] to generate the hurricane and steer it to [[Mexico]]. The hurricane is successfully generated but the control of the generator is lost so Dr. Platt is sent airborne to try to re-establish a connection with the generator. When he succeeds, Dr. Platt decides to steer it away from Mexican coast. This enrages General Roberts who orders the immediate execution of Dr. Platt. With the death of Dr. Platt the control over the generator is lost and the hurricane steers to the north towards Los Angeles.  After Ron discovers the General Roberts plans he starts to uncover more data about the experiment and also passes some secret information to Brian and Andrea McIntyre, a weather reporter working in L.A. who was dating him in the past. Soon after that Major Goodman invites Ron to dinner. They both get drunk and Ron falls asleep. The next morning Brian's wife informs him that Brian has died in a car accident. Immediately after the call the police arrives and orders Ron to go with them because he is framed for killing of a woman and her daughter in the car accident. Believing that both Brian's death and the charge he is facing are a revenge of General Roberts for sharing the top-secret information outside the team he escapes and infiltrates the company. He faces Major Goodman but is beaten down by Holt who brings him to General Roberts.  It is revealed that Holt is a rogue CIA agent who staged both Brian's death and blamed Ron for a hit-and run accident he didn't commit. General Roberts then tells Ron about the coming destruction of L.A. and asks him for the help to recover the storm generator. He boards a plane piloted by Major Goodman and finds the generator. After a risky operation Ron manages to intercept the generator and switches it off manually. General Roberts then orders that the generator is released again and reactivated to steer the hurricane towards Mexico. Refusing to do so, Ron is first assaulted by Holt and later by Major Goodman. As she holds Ron at gunpoint, the plane hits the storm generator which destroys both plane and the generator. Ron manages to bail out with the parachute and is reunited with Andrea who reports from a nearly saved Los Angeles.  
Summer of Sam
 It is the summer of 1977, and New York City lives in fear of the ".44 Caliber Killer", who shoots young women and their male companions. The killer, David Berkowitz, later identifies himself as "Son of Sam" in a note left at a murder scene. Berkowitz lives in a messy apartment, where he is driven crazy by the barking of a neighbor's large black dog and has a vision of the dog directing him to kill.    In an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx (likely [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]], [[Throggs Neck]], or [[Pelham_Bay (neighborhood), Bronx|Pelham Bay]]), hairdresser Vinny and his pretty wife Dionna go [[Disco#Disco_dancing|disco dancing]] at a local nightclub, where they meet Dionna's attractive cousin Chiara. Vinny offers to drive Chiara home while Dionna remains at the club. Vinny and Chiara then park on a residential street and have sex in the car. Son of Sam watches them, but he is scared off when the couple accidentally set off the car horn during sex and, embarrassed, quickly drive away. After they leave, Son of Sam kills another couple who had parked behind Vinny. When Vinny picks up Dionna back at the club, she notices the smell of [[vaginal lubrication]] on his face and realizes he had sex with Chiara, but does not let on that she knows.   On the drive home, Vinny notices police near the location where he had parked with Chiara, and sees the dead bodies of the slain couple. The religious and guilty Vinny, realizing he could have been a victim, decides that God spared him in order to give him a chance to reform his ways and stop cheating on his wife. Although Vinny loves Dionna, their sex life is suffering because Vinny enjoys [[anal sex]], [[69 (sex position)|"69"]] and other sex acts that he considers kinky, but he cannot bring himself to discuss or perform these acts with a wife. He is also having an affair with Gloria, the owner of the hair salon where he works.   The next day, while Vinny is hanging out with neighborhood drug dealer Joey T and his friends, Vinny's old friend Ritchie, who has been away for some time, suddenly reappears, sporting a punk spiked hairdo and clothing and affecting a British accent. Vinny, Joey T, and the others dislike the change in Ritchie, and he soon finds himself unwelcome in the neighborhood. However, Ruby, a promiscuous local girl, is attracted to Ritchie, and the two begin a relationship. Unlike other men, Ritchie takes an interest in Ruby as a person, not just as a sexual outlet. She learns that he makes money by erotic dancing and prostituting himself at a gay theater, but remains loyal to him and over time begins to dress in punk fashion herself.  As the Son of Sam killings continue, tension rises in the neighborhood. A police detective from the neighborhood asks the local mob boss to help him find the killer; Joey T and his friends also make a list of possible suspects, including Ritchie whom they regard as "a freak". Ritchie and Ruby invite Vinny and Dionna to come see their punk band perform at [[CBGB]], but once there, Dionna feels intimidated by the punk crowd and refuses to go in. Vinny and Dionna instead go to [[Studio 54]], where they are denied entry, and finally end up at [[Plato's Retreat]] where they take drugs and participate in an orgy. Vinny becomes upset when he sees Dionna appearing to enjoy the experience of having sex with another man, even though he himself is having sex with other women. He berates Dionna in the car on the way home, causing her to get mad and reveal that she knows he cheated on her with Chiara. She storms off to stay at her father's house. Vinny begins to drink and use drugs heavily, and makes a scene at Gloria's hair salon, causing her to angrily throw him out and then inform Dionna about their affair. Upon hearing from Gloria, Dionna leaves Vinny for good.   Joey T and his gang decide that the latest eyewitness sketch of Son of Sam released by the police resembles Ritchie, and unsuccessfully attempt to track him down at CBGB. Joey persuades the unstable Vinny, who is high on drugs he has taken to dull the pain of his impending divorce, to help them lure Ritchie out of his house, since Vinny is the only local friend Ritchie still trusts. Unbeknownst to Vinny and his friends, the police have already arrested David Berkowitz, the real Son of Sam. Vinny goes to Ritchie's family home, where Ritchie and Ruby are packing up to leave town, and lures Ritchie out on the pretext of talking about his failing marriage; once he has gotten Ritchie outside, he warns Ritchie under his breath to run, but Ritchie does not heed the warning and is attacked and severely beaten by Joey T and his gang. Ritchie's stepfather, Eddie, emerges from the house brandishing his gun and rescues the badly injured Ritchie, telling the attackers that Ritchie is not the Son of Sam and that the TV news is reporting that the police have just arrested the real killer. Unable to face Ritchie, Vinny walks away.  
Stuart Little (film)
 Eleanor and Frederick Little and their young son George are intending to adopt. While George is at school, his parents go to an orphanage where they meet an  anthropomorphic teenage mouse named Stuart. Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper, they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat Snowbell, who is disgusted at having a mouse for a "master". Despite Eleanor and Frederick's intentions, Stuart quickly feels like an outsider in the large Little family, especially when the family's unknowing relatives bring Stuart large presents and George snaps at his family, claiming out loud that Stuart is not his brother. When Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his parents, they ask Mrs. Keeper to do some background research on Stuart's biological family.  After accidentally stumbling across George's playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George's remote controlled boat, the ''Wasp'', for an upcoming boat race in [[Central Park]]. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell's alley cat friends, Monty, visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell meets with Monty's leader, Smokey, a mafia don-like Russian Blue, and plots revenge to have Stuart removed from the household without harming him.  Stuart and George finish the ''Wasp'' in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the control is smashed when a bystander accidentally steps on it. Stuart pilots the ''Wasp'' himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat belonging to George's rival, Anton, who has already smashed the rest of the boats without being disqualified. Stuart snaps the wires of Anton's boat and manages to win the race, at the same time finally winning George's acceptance and respect. During the family celebration, however, the Littles are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout, who claim to be Stuart's parents who gave him up to the orphanage years ago due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts, George presenting him with his toy car as a farewell gift. A few days later, however, Mrs. Keeper comes to visit and tells the Littles that Stuart's parents actually died many years ago in a supermarket accident. Realizing their son has been kidnapped, the Littles call the police and stick posters of Stuart's face across the city.  Meanwhile, Snowbell meets with Smokey and the alley cats: he had actually conspired with them to have the Stouts pose as Stuart's parents in order to remove Stuart from the household. Fearing retribution should the Littles discover Snowbell's deception, Smokey orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them. But the Stouts, having grown to love Stuart like their own, tell him to flee. Smokey subsequently orders a manhunt for Stuart. They corner him in Central Park and a chase ensues. Despite losing his car and almost falling down a storm drain, Stuart manages to evade Smokey and return home, unfortunately, while the Littles are out putting posters up. The only one present is Snowbell, who lies that the Littles have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart's departure, and uses Stuart's removed face from the family photograph as proof (which they had actually used for the posters). Heartbroken, Stuart leaves again, but Snowbell begins to question his actions when he sees the pain the Littles are going through.  The alley cats locate Stuart and bring Snowbell for the hunt. Snowbell finds Stuart in an empty bird's nest and saves him from the cats, but they catch up and eventually corner Stuart hanging on a branch. The cats almost catch him, but Snowbell breaks the branch they are standing on, sending them falling into the river below. Smokey ambushes Snowbell from behind, but Stuart hits him off the tree with another branch. All but defeated, Smokey leaves angrily, but is chased off by stray dogs.  Stuart and Snowbell return home and share a happy reunion with the Little family.

The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)
 Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s [[New York City]] with his "talents": telling lies, forging signatures and impersonating people. While working at a party, he is approached by the wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley attended [[Princeton University|Princeton]] with his son, Dickie. Greenleaf recruits Ripley, for $1,000, to travel to [[Italy]] to persuade Dickie to return home. During the trip to Italy, Ripley strikes up a friendship with an American socialite, Meredith Logue, while pretending to be Dickie.  In the Italian seaside town of Mongibello, Ripley charms himself into the lives of Dickie and his fiancée, Marge, partly through pretending to be a fellow jazz lover. Ripley becomes infatuated with Dickie's life; he also becomes obsessed with Dickie himself. Eventually, however, Dickie tires of him and starts spending more time with his Princeton friend Freddie Miles, a womanizer who treats Ripley with contempt.  When Dickie impregnates a local woman, he rejects her and she drowns herself. Only Ripley knows what happened, and promises to keep it a secret. Meanwhile, Dickie catches Ripley dressed in Dickie's clothes and pretending to be him in front of a mirror, which further alienates him from Ripley.  When Dickie's father cuts off Ripley's travel funds, Dickie cancels a planned trip to [[Venice]] and tells Ripley they should part ways, but offers to take him on a short, final trip to [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. They take a boat out, but when Ripley suggests they move in together, Dickie becomes angry, accusing Ripley of mooching. The two fight, and Ripley beats Dickie to death with an oar. Ripley scuttles the boat in a nearby cove.  Realizing that people easily mistake him for Dickie, Ripley decides to impersonate him. He forges a letter to Marge, convincing her that Dickie has left her to live in Rome. He creates the illusion that Dickie is still alive by checking into one Roman hotel as Dickie and another as himself, creating an exchange of communications between the two. Through forgery, he is able to draw on Dickie's allowance, which allows him to live lavishly. He runs into Meredith, and pretends to romance her to gain access to her wealthy circle of friends. His ruse is threatened when Marge arrives in Rome, so he breaks it off with Meredith to prevent being discovered.  Freddie shows up at Ripley's apartment looking for Dickie, and is immediately suspicious. When the landlady addresses Tom with "Ciao Dickie", Freddie realizes the fraud, but Ripley beats him to death with a stone bust. After disposing of the body, Ripley is forced into a cat-and-mouse existence between the Italian police and Marge. Realizing that the police suspect Dickie of murdering Freddie, Ripley forges a suicide note to dispose of the Dickie persona once and for all. He then travels to Venice, where he meets Marge's friend, Peter Smith-Kingsley, and they develop feelings for each other.  Herbert Greenleaf travels to Italy to meet with the police, bringing along a private detective, Alvin MacCarron. Ripley prepares to kill Marge when she discovers Dickie's rings in Ripley's possession, but Peter interrupts them. Mr. Greenleaf dismisses Marge's suspicions, and MacCarron reveals to Ripley that the police are convinced that Dickie, who had a history of violence, murdered Freddie before killing himself. MacCarron further indicates that out of appreciation for Ripley's loyalty to Dickie, Mr. Greenleaf intends to bequeath Dickie's trust fund to him.  Free and clear of his crimes, Ripley boards a ship to Greece with Peter; it is implied that they are now lovers. He is surprised to encounter Meredith, who knows him as Dickie. He realizes he must kill Peter to prevent being exposed as an impostor; killing Meredith would attract too much attention because she is traveling with members of her family. Sobbing, he strangles Peter, and returns to his cabin.  
Tarzan (1999 film)
  In 1864, an English couple and their infant son escape a shipwreck, ending up near uncharted [[tropical rainforest|rainforest]]s off the Congolese<ref></ref> coast of [[Africa]]. The couple build themselves a [[treehouse]] from the ship's wreckage, but are killed by [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]], an evil [[African leopard|leopardess]]. [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], a female [[western gorilla]], who recently lost her own child to Sabor, hears the cries of the orphaned infant, and finds him in the treehouse. Kala encounters Sabor, and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action of which the leader and her mate, [[Kerchak]], grudgingly approves. Kala raises the human child, naming him Tarzan.  In 1869, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece, [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid male [[African forest elephant|elephant]], [[Tantor (Tarzan)|Tantor]]. Tarzan is treated differently due to his different physique, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. In 1884, Tarzan manages to kill Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's reluctant respect.  The gorilla troop's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of [[Professor Porter (Tarzan)|Professor Porter]], his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their hunter-guide [[Clayton (Tarzan)|Clayton]]. The explorers are looking to study gorillas. Jane accidentally becomes separated from the group and is chased by a [[baboon]] troop, with Tarzan saving her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is human, just like he is. Jane leads Tarzan back to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Despite Kerchak's warnings to be wary of the humans, Tarzan continues to return to the camp, where Porter, Clayton, and Jane teach him how to speak English as well as what the [[civilization|human world]] is like. As time passes, Tarzan and Jane begin to fall in love. Still, Tarzan refuses to lead the explorers to the gorillas due to his fear of Kerchak.  The explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him forever as long as he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to avoid having him attack the humans. Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns, and when he sees the humans, he attacks them. Tarzan holds Kerchak at bay while the humans escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse, where she first found him, shows him his true past, and says that she wants him to feel satisfied whatever he decides. In the end, Tarzan puts on a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England.  When Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter the next day, they are all ambushed by Clayton and his traitorous band of stowaway [[Hooliganism|thugs]]. Clayton hopes and plans to seize the gorillas, now that he knows where the nesting grounds are, and locks Tarzan, Jane, and Porter away to prevent them from interfering. Tarzan manages to escape with the support of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle. Clayton shoots Kerchak and battles Tarzan across the treetops. Tarzan spares Clayton's life and traps him with vines, but Clayton attempts to free himself. In the process, he falls from the tree with a vine tangled around his neck, [[hanging]] him and killing him. Kerchak, with his dying breath, forgives Tarzan and names him the new leader of the gorillas and accepts him as his foster son. The rest of the gorillas are freed after fending off the rest of Clayton’s henchmen.  The next day, Porter and Jane prepare to leave on the ship, while Tarzan stays behind with the gorilla troop. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with Porter shortly following. The Porters reunite with Tarzan, and embark on their new life together.

Teaching Mrs. Tingle
 In Grandsboro, [[Northern California]], Leigh Ann Watson is a [[high school]] student living with her single mother Faye, who works as a [[waitress]]. Leigh Ann's aim is to achieve top grades to become [[valedictorian]] and leave town. However, her grade in history class is threatened by her sadistic and thoroughly vindictive teacher, Mrs. Eve Tingle. Mrs. Tingle has a special dislike for Leigh Ann and downgrades Leigh Ann's well-designed project.  Fellow student Luke Churner takes the final exam papers from Tingle and makes a copy. He offers Leigh Ann the papers, but she insistently refuses to cheat. Ultimately, Luke stashes the papers in Leigh Ann's backpack. Tingle discovers the papers in Leigh Ann's backpack, and threatens to expel her for cheating. Mrs. Tingle heads to Principal Potter's office, but he has left for the day and decides to tell him in the morning. This gives Leigh Ann, her best friend, Jo Lynn Jordan, and Luke time to think of a plan to stop Mrs. Tingle.  The trio head to Mrs. Tingle's house that night and try to convince Mrs. Tingle that Leigh Ann is innocent. Mrs. Tingle, however, refuses to listen and hints that she believes them but does not care. Luke picks up a loaded [[crossbow]] and aims it at Mrs. Tingle, threatening her. A physical struggle ensues, the crossbow goes off, and in the ensuing mêlée, Mrs. Tingle is accidentally knocked unconscious. The students panic and tie Mrs. Tingle to her bed. Leigh Ann returns to her house and promises to return in the morning, while Luke and Jo Lynn are left to watch Mrs. Tingle in the bedroom. While under Jo Lynn's watch, Mrs. Tingle regains consciousness, and playing on her guilt, asks to be untied. Mrs. Tingle immediately attacks Jo Lynn, but is restrained by Luke and is retied and gagged.  The trio gathers together at Mrs. Tingle's house the next morning. Jo Lynn then calls the school and impersonates Mrs. Tingle, calling in sick=. Leigh Ann and Luke go to school, leaving Jo Lynn to watch Mrs. Tingle. When they return home, the trio devises a plan to blackmail Mrs. Tingle by using fake photos of Luke and Mrs. Tingle in bed together. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tingle plays mind games with Jo Lynn, concerning her jealousy about Leigh Ann's supposed relationship with Luke. Later that day, the plan goes awry when the school's gym teacher, Coach Richard Wenchell arrives and is revealed to be having an affair with her. Jo Lynn, again, impersonates Mrs. Tingle and blindfolds Coach Wenchell to hide her identity. When Wenchell passes out after a high intake of alcohol, Leigh Ann, Luke, and Jo Lynn decide to blackmail Mrs. Tingle by producing photographic evidence of her love affair with Wenchell.  While Leigh Ann and Luke leave to have the pictures printed and take an unconscious Coach Wenchell home undetected, Mrs. Tingle manipulates Jo Lynn into turning against Leigh Ann by revealing to her that Leigh Ann and Luke spent the night together at a party. Distraught, Jo Lynn leaves. When Leigh Ann and Luke arrive back, Mrs. Tingle eventually reveals that she hates Leigh Ann because Leigh Ann has, unlike herself, the potential to leave their small town and experience life. In response, Leigh Ann and Luke have sex downstairs. Later, the two find Mrs. Tingle's history grade book. Leigh Ann marks down her rival Trudie Tucker's top A grade down to a B, and upgrades her own C to an A+.  The next day at school, Jo Lynn ignores Leigh Ann, still hurt over her betrayal. Leigh Ann tries to make amends with Jo Lynn, but admits that she had sex with Luke, further infuriating Jo Lynn, who accuses Leigh Ann of being just like Mrs. Tingle.  Mrs. Tingle escapes from her bonds, ties Luke down in her place, and using the loaded crossbow, once again threatens Leigh Ann. Jo Lynn returns, now saying she will help blackmail and ruin Leigh Ann, but is revealed to be lying. After a violent fight, Mrs. Tingle picks up a crossbow and fires it wildly, trying to hit Leigh Ann. Trudie Tucker walks through the door, gets hit in the chest by the bolt, and collapses. Leigh Ann checks her pulse and says she is dead. Principal Potter arrives to check up on Mrs. Tingle and is horrified by the scene. Guilt-ridden, Tingle confesses that she shot Trudie while trying to kill Leigh Ann and wanted to make her fail. However, Trudie was protected by the thick textbook she was holding to her chest and is completely unharmed, which Leigh Ann already knew. Tingle is fired by Potter, who then calls the police. The film ends with Leigh Ann being named as valedictorian at graduation.  
Tea with Mussolini
 The film begins in 1935 in [[Florence]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]], where a group of cultured expatriate [[English People|English]] women – called the "[[the Scorpioni|Scorpioni]]" by the Italians – meet for tea every afternoon. Young Luca (Charlie Lucas) is the illegitimate son of an Italian businessman ([[Massimo Ghini]]) who shows little interest in his son's upbringing; the boy's mother, a dressmaker, has recently died. Mary Wallace ([[Joan Plowright]]), who works as the man's secretary, steps in to care for him, turning for support to her Scorpioni friends, including eccentric would-be artist Arabella ([[Judi Dench]]). Together, they teach Luca many lessons about life and especially the arts. Elsa Morganthal ([[Cher]]), a brash rich young American widow whom Scorpioni matron Lady Hester Random ([[Maggie Smith]]) barely tolerates, sets up a financial trust for Luca when she learns of the death of his mother, whom she was fond of and to whom Elsa still owes money for her dressmaking services.  One day when the ladies are in a restaurant for afternoon tea, it is vandalised by [[Italian fascism|Fascists]], reflecting the increasingly uncertain position of the expatriate community. Lady Hester, widow of Britain's former ambassador to Italy, retains an admiring faith in [[Benito Mussolini]] (Claudio Spadaro) and takes it upon herself to visit him, receiving his insincere assurances of their safety, and proudly recounts her "tea with Mussolini". But the political situation continues to deteriorate and the Scorpioni find their status and liberties diminishing. Luca's father decides that Italy's future is with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] rather than [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and sends Luca to an [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian]] [[boarding school]].  Five years later, Luca (now played by Baird Wallace) returns to Florence with the intention of using Elsa's trust fund to study art. He finds that most British nationals are fleeing the country, anticipating [[Military history of Italy during World War II#Italy enters the war: June 1940|Mussolini's declaration of war on Great Britain]], and that Mary has moved in with Lady Hester and the other English hold-outs. He arrives at the house just as they – and Hester's ineffectual grandson Wilfred ([[Paul Chequer]]), disguised as a young woman for his safety – are being rounded up and put onto a transport truck, which he follows to the nearby [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] town of [[San Gimignano]]. Because the United States is not at war, Elsa and her American compatriot Georgie Rockwell ([[Lily Tomlin]]), an openly lesbian [[archaeologist]], remain free. Elsa uses Luca to deliver forged orders and funds to have the ladies moved from their distressingly barracks-like quarters to an upper class hotel. Believing that Mussolini himself issued the orders, Lady Hester is delighted, proudly brandishing the newspaper photo of her tea with ''Il Duce''.  [[File:Piazza cisterna 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Piazza Cisterna in [[San Gimignano]], where many of the film's scenes were shot.]]  As the war progresses, oppression of Jews increases and Jewish Elsa – protected somewhat by her citizenship and wealth – provides a group of Italian Jews with fake passports, enlisting Luca – who has become enamored with her – to deliver them. However Luca becomes jealous when she forms a romantic alliance with Vittorio ([[Paolo Seganti]]), a shrewd Italian lawyer.  When the United States enters the war in 1941, Elsa and Georgie are interned with the British women. Elsa falls for Vittorio's scheme to embezzle her art collection and money, which would deliver her to the German [[Gestapo]] in a phony escape to [[Switzerland]]. Luca is aware of the deception but does not tell anyone out of jealous spite against Elsa. Mary learns of it from Elsa's art dealer, (Mino Bellei), and scolds Luca. His attitude changes and he gives his trust fund money to members of the [[Italian resistance movement]], which Wilfred has joined. Elsa still refuses to believe Vittorio's betrayal and is ultimately convinced only when Lady Hester, informed by Mary and Luca of what Elsa has secretly done for all of them, repents of her contempt for Elsa and offers her gratitude and help. Elsa consents to an escape plan hatched by Mary, Luca and Wilfred. Before she departs, Elsa tells Luca how she once helped his young mother choose to go through with her pregnancy, thus allowing him to be there for her.  In July 1944, as the [[British Army]] advances toward [[San Gimignano]], Arabella frantically defends her beloved frescoes from demolition by German troops and is heroically joined in the line of fire by Georgie and the English women, including Lady Hester. They are saved when the Germans receive orders to retreat, leaving the women and the towers untouched. The city rejoices as the Scots arrive, with Luca now serving as their commander's Italian interpreter. The major has orders to evacuate the Scorpioni but Lady Hester refuses to cooperate, resolved that they will resume their former lives in Italy. Mary is delighted to see that Luca – now in British uniform – has become the "English gentleman" his father wished him to become.  Closing texts explain the mostly happy fates of the characters, concluding with the remark that Luca went on to become an artist and "helped in making this film" – in other words, as writer and director.  
Tempting Heart
  Sylvia Chang plays a director who intends to make a romance film and begins to wonder about the role fate plays in relationships. She ends up re-examining her own [[first love]] in a completely different light. The story is set in two different periods of time, one in the 1970s where Gigi plays the teenage Xiao-rou, and the other in the 1990s where Sylvia plays the older Xiao-rou.  Takeshi Kaneshiro plays the role of a shy teenager, Ho-jun, who falls in love with Xiao-rou (played by Gigi Leung). Their relationship turns intimate but faces fierce objections from their parents. [[Karen Mok]] plays Chen-li, Xiao-rou's best friend, whom Xiao-rou confides in.  This teenage love soon fizzles out owing to misunderstandings and Ho-jun, after many years, turns to marry Chen-li. One day, Chen-li reveals that she is a lesbian and that they both love the same girl - Xiao-rou.  Ho-jun meets Xiao-rou on a trip to [[Japan]] and upon knowing that Ho-jun is already married, Xiao-rou returns home and gets herself engaged. Ho-jun manages a last attempt to reunite with Xiao-rou by flying to Hong Kong and telling her that he is already a [[divorce]]e, but it is to no avail.  Years later, Xiao-rou finds out that Ho-jun's wife was actually Chen-li. She discovers this only after Chen-li has died. Chen-li leaves a message for Xiao-rou asking her for forgiveness. As Xiao rou prepares to fly back to Hong Kong from Japan, she receives a present from Ho-jun. In the box were photographs, taken when Ho-jun was thinking about Xiao-rou and of their brief moments of happiness.  It is only at the end of the film when it is tactfully revealed that the director Sylvia Chang was actually re-enacting her own teenage romance.  
Tenchi Forever! The Movie
 The movie opens with a scene that fans know all too well: Ryoko and Ayeka begin to fight over chores, and Tenchi runs into the forest after they demand he makes a choice between the two of them. He stumbles upon a huge tree covered in strange flowers, and suddenly vanishes without a trace.  Tenchi has a strange dream of floating through nothingness while surrounded by the flowers he saw before, and wakes up to find himself a completely different person. He's several years older, has long hair, and lives with a beautiful young woman named Haruna. Tenchi shrugs off his old life as a dream and enters a new one with Haruna.  The film jumps ahead six months. Tenchi's family and friends have been searching in vain for him, and the stress is building. His father [[Nobuyuki Masaki|Nobuyuki]] has filed a missing-person report, [[Mihoshi Kuramitsu|Mihoshi]] and [[Kiyone Makibi|Kiyone]] have infiltrated the Science Academy to look for clues, [[Sasami Masaki Jurai|Sasami]] has returned to Jurai, and Ryoko and Ayeka have moved to Tokyo to continue the search.  Ayeka and Ryoko have become shadows of their former selves: depressed, brooding, and sometimes angry. To pay for their food and lodgings, they've become waitresses at a small diner during the day, and every spare moment is spent showing Tenchi's picture to passersby, looking for some glimmer of hope.  After a chance encounter with Tenchi and Haruna, the girls report back to [[Washu Hakubi|Washu]], who realizes that Tenchi has been drawn into a parallel world very close to ours. A plan to find and bring him back is set into motion.  Meanwhile, Tenchi is beginning to get severe headaches, which for some reason coincide with his fleeting memories of his real life. Haruna becomes very upset when he starts to subconsciously draw crude pictures of Ryoko. To comfort her, Tenchi takes her out to buy engagement rings for one another, and stops for dinner at Ryoko and Ayeka's restaurant. When Ryoko tries to address them, there is no response, and her attempts to touch Tenchi pass right through him, making his headache worse. Tenchi and Haruna fade away to nothingness, leaving Ayeka and Ryoko confused and upset.  Washu and Katsuhito have an encounter in the wilderness, and the old shrine master admits he knows what's happening. Haruna was the name of the woman he left Jurai with, but she died on the way to Earth. The huge tree that Tenchi encountered before he vanished grew from the spot that Haruna's body was buried. Katsuhito explains that her soul must have been very lonely, and drew Tenchi into another world to recapture the love she had lost. With this new information, Washu finalizes her plan.  With the power of the trees Katsuhito planted over the years, Washu creates a doorway into Haruna's world, and Ryoko and Ayeka enter. Confronting Haruna and Tenchi, they try to bring him back, but his altered memories confuse him, and Tenchi sternly rebukes the two. With her power over the parallel world, Haruna banishes them back to our Earth. Devastated by Tenchi's rejection, Ryoko begins to cry.  Haruna has been draining Tenchi's Jurai Power to keep her world stable, and he begins to feel the effects. The world begins to fade away when Tenchi remembers more about his past, and Haruna cannot hide discrepancies of the "perfect world" from him (such as a maxed-out bank account despite her meager earnings and his lack of a job). Her method of restarting the day (and Tenchi's memories) after something goes wrong stops working just as Katsuhito confronts his past and slashes into Haruna's tree with his lightsword, channeling his essence into her soul.  Haruna recognizes her true love Yosho, and remembers why she took Tenchi away in the first place: as a substitute for Yosho. Yosho and Haruna leave together, Katsuhito reappearing in front of the ruined tree, and Tenchi finally remembers who he is. Without Haruna's presence, her world begins to vanish, and Tenchi has no way of escaping.  Washu can only send one person to rescue Tenchi, and Ayeka tells Ryoko to go. After a bit of relieved banter, Ryoko lifts Tenchi into the sky to teleport them back to the real world, and he looks back down on his false life, "ready to leave it behind". A shot of Haruna's table shows the rings they purchased together, left behind by both individuals as they leave the charade she kept up for so long.  The movie closes as we examine the Masaki household returning to normal life. Tenchi has become young again, his hair short and spiky as it was. Though he does not remember his experiences in the parallel world, he has taken up drawing like his older alter ego, because he likes the way it makes him feel. Just before the credits roll, Tenchi and Ryoko enjoy a quiet moment together as the wind shakes the trees, mirroring a scene involving Tenchi's parents in ''Tenchi Muyo in Love''.  
Terror Firmer
 The film is the story of a New York low-budget film crew, led by their insane and egotistical [[blindness|blind]] film director, Larry Benjamin, who is trying to create a work of art. In addition to the typical trials and travails of a Troma set, the crew is preyed upon by a sexually conflicted, bomb-toting [[serial killer]]. Among the large poorly paid film crew, the movie centers mostly on production assistant Jennifer, who struggles to do her job while deciding between the two men in her life; the straight-laced boom operator Casey, and the rebellious special effects operator Jerry. The love triangle intensifies as the dead bodies mount with increasingly brutality. At the climax, the entire film crew bands together (both physically and sexually) against the mortal threat in their midst.  
Thakshak
 A poetic romance between Ishaan ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and Suman ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) set against the concrete Mumbai cityscape opens the film.  Ishaan, the only son of an affluent business family, and his contemporary peer Sunny ([[Rahul Bose]]), the grandson of the head of the business house, are being groomed to take over the business. They share a strong male bonding, Ishaan's controlled and silent strength acts as an anchor to Sunny's flamboyance and recklessly violent streak. The business, a construction empire built by Ishaan's father Nahar Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]) and Sunny's grandfather, is rooted in violent and unlawful activities.  Ishaan, sheltered in comfort and security, begins to question his environment as his relationship with Suman, an idealistic young woman, opens a new world to him. As his love for her grows, so does his fear of losing her. Ishaan is caught between a life steeped in violence and his love for Suman who abhors violence.  Torn by his desire to leave the world of crime, and his sense of loyalty to his father and his friend, Ishaan unwillingly gets drawn deeper into violence, and finds himself a participant in an act of gruesome cold-blooded massacre. The image of a young girl disabled by this violent act haunts his conscience. His quiet, but firm resolve, to withdraw from the business clashes with Nahar Singh's pragmatism (to build power at any cost and to legalise crime with that power), and with Sunny's refusal to release him from his oath of loyalty.  The events escalate with Ishaan's arrest, and Nahar Singh's murder. Ishaan is finally forced to make a choice between personal loyalty and a larger allegiance to society and truth.  The story is parallel to [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Last Don]]''.

The Thirteenth Floor
 In late 1990s Los Angeles, Hannon Fuller (Mueller-Stahl) owns a multibillion-dollar computer enterprise and is the inventor of a newly completed [[virtual reality]] (VR) [[simulated reality|simulation]] of 1937 [[Los Angeles]], filled with [[Artificial Intelligence|simulated humans]] unaware they are computer programs. When Fuller is murdered just as he begins premature testing of the VR system, his friend and protégé, Douglas Hall (Bierko), who is also the heir to the company, becomes the primary suspect. The evidence against him is so strong that Hall begins to doubt his own innocence.  Between interrogations by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective Larry McBain (Haysbert), Hall meets Jane Fuller (Gretchen Mol), the estranged daughter of Hannon Fuller, who is busy with the shutdown of the new VR system. Hall then romances her. When a local bartender is murdered after he claims to have witnessed a meeting between Hall and Fuller on the night Fuller was murdered, Hall is arrested. He is released when Jane gives him an alibi.  With the assistance of his associate Whitney (D'Onofrio), Hall attempts to find a message that Fuller left for him inside the simulation. Entering the virtual reality, Hall becomes a bank clerk named John Ferguson. Fuller left the message with a bartender named Jerry Ashton (D'Onofrio), who read the message and discovered he is an artificial creation. Earlier, Ashton notices that Ferguson switched places with Hall in the men's restroom of the hotel where Ashton works, and began to realize that something was wrong. Frightened and angry, Ashton tries to kill Hall. Hall barely survives to escape the VR.  McBain informs Hall that Jane does not exist, as Fuller never had a daughter. Hall tracks her down only to discover her double, Natasha Molinaro, working as a grocery store clerk, but Molinaro does not recognize Hall. This leads Hall to perform an experiment outside the VR system, something that Fuller’s letter instructed him to try: drive to a place where he never would have considered going otherwise. He does so, and discovers a point beyond which the world becomes a crude [[wireframe model]]. Hall grasps the revelation behind Fuller's message: 1990s Los Angeles is itself a simulation.  Jane Fuller explains to Hall the truth: his world is one of thousands of virtual worlds, but it is the only one in which one of the occupants have developed a virtual world of their own. Jane Fuller lives in the real world outside the 1990s simulation. After Fuller's death, she entered the virtual version to assume the guise of Fuller's daughter, gain control of the company, and shut down the simulated 1937 reality, a plan foiled by Hall being made the company heir. The virtual Hall is modeled after David, Jane’s real-world husband, though Jane has since fallen in love with Hall. David committed the murders via Hall’s body, being driven to increasingly jealous and psychopathic behavior from prolonged use of VR to live out his dark fantasies.  Whitney enters the 1937 simulation, assuming the body of bartender Jerry Ashton, who has kidnapped Ferguson (Hall’s 1937 identity) and bound him in the trunk of his car. When Whitney is killed in a car crash inside the 1937 simulation, Ashton’s consciousness takes control of Whitney’s body in the 1990s simulation and takes Hall hostage. Hall tells Ashton that he is not in the real world, and that they are both products of a VR simulation. Hall takes Ashton to the place where he was 'born': a computer lab. David assumes control of Hall again to kill Ashton and then attempts to rape and murder Jane. Jane is rescued by Detective McBain, who shoots and kills David. McBain at this point has realized the nature of his own reality, and jokingly asks Jane, "So, is somebody going to unplug me now?" She answers "no", so McBain follows with the request "Look, do me a favor, when you get back to wherever it is you come from, just leave us the hell alone down here, okay?"  David's death as Hall in the 1990s simulation allows Hall’s artificial consciousness to take control of David’s body in the real world. He wakes in 2024, connected to a VR system. He disconnects the system and finds Jane and her father, the real Hannon Fuller. Jane wants to tell Hall more about the simulation, but as she begins the film ends, the screen image collapsing to a thin line of light before going dark like a computer monitor being turned off.  
The Thirteenth Year
 Cody Griffin is an adopted teenager; his birth mother is a [[mermaid]] who left him on the Griffins' boat when he was a baby to avoid being captured. As she left, she was spotted by Mr. Wheatly, a fisherman who became obsessed with finding mermaids. Cody establishes himself as a quick swimmer in the town he lives in, and has a girlfriend named Sam. He's under a lot of pressure from a big swim meet coming up and because he's failing biology, he's partnered with Jess Wheatly, the class geek who is a marine biology expert.  After Cody's 13th birthday, he begins to feel strange. As he wakes up in the morning, he turns off his alarm clock and zaps it. Ignoring it, Cody drinks from a milk container, which he notices is stuck to his hand; he later also drinks large amounts of water. He goes to Jess for help, who agrees to figure out what's going on with him as long as Cody teaches him to swim in return. Jess runs various tests, learning Cody can generate electricity, climb walls (like [[Spider-Man]]) talk to fish, swim extremely fast, and when sometimes wet, scales appear on his hands and arms. Jess concludes that Cody is turning into a merman.  Despite all the odd things happening to him, as well as the objection of his adoptive parents when they found out, Cody decides to attend the swim meet. He not only wins the meet and beats Sean, but breaks the state speed record, with his scales appearing. Sean sees the scales and surmises Cody cheated, following him into the locker room. Cody avoids him by sticking to the ceiling, but Sean says he saw something and will find out what. Cody safely makes it out of the stadium and goes home with his parents after they find out he wasn't in his room; however, the scales are lasting longer now.  Cody tries calming his parents by claiming nobody saw him change, but Jess shows up and tells them he saw everything and that people are talking about Cody. Sam arrives and faints at the sight of Cody's scales. When she comes to, she is freaked out. Cody tells her he's still the same guy and to not be afraid. While sworn to secrecy for Cody's safety, Sam is disturbed by the discovery and leaves. The next morning Cody takes a swim, and meets his mermaid mother; however, Jess's father, who is the obsessed fisherman, spots them and ends the reunion.  Later that day, Cody meets Sam at the beach. She apologizes and they share a kiss. Cody then walks into the water with her, saying there's something he wants to show her. Cody's mother appears, with Sam complimenting her beauty; however, Cody suddenly gasps in pain and stumbles back to the shore. Writhing on the ground, he tells Sam to get his parents. After she leaves, Cody's feet turn into flippers. Thinking Sam came back, Cody is surprised when someone throws a blanket over him.  Jess comes down to where Cody is, but sees he is gone. He then sees his father's boat and panics because his father had seen Cody's fins at the swim meet earlier. Jess's father is planning on using Cody to lure in his mother to prove he's not crazy. Jess comes on board the boat, and Cody asks him for help. Despite trying to warn the mermaid away, Cody and Jess are unable to stop a fishing net from trapping her. Cody asks Jess to help his mother, so he takes a knife and jumps into the water to cut the net. He frees the mermaid, but his leg gets caught in the net, pulling him under. Jess passes out, but Cody jumps in and brings him to the dock where Jess's father, Cody's parents, and Sam are. Sam performs CPR, but is unsuccessful. Cody decides to zap Jess's heart, which successfully makes Jess come to. Jess then wonders if Cody's girlfriend was kissing him.  Cody's mermaid mother shows up again. She discovers her son is still alive and watches him and his family from afar. Cody explains she wants him to go with her because she's the only one who can help him with his changes. Cody's adoptive mother doesn't want him to leave, but the mermaid telepathically promises to send Cody back before school starts. After goodbyes, Jess asks Cody to tell him and his dad about the aquatic life he sees, and Sam makes Cody promise not to betray her by falling for mergirls. Cody dives into the water and completes his merman transformation with his mermaid mother's help. He swims back up and leaps through the surface, and waves goodbye to his friends and adoptive parents. Cody and his mother then swim off into a life below the surface.

Three to Tango
  Architects Oscar Novak ([[Matthew Perry|Perry]]) and Peter Steinberg ([[Oliver Platt|Platt]]) have just landed a career-making opportunity to design of a multimillion dollar cultural center for wealthy businessman Charles Newman ([[Dylan McDermott|McDermott]]). In a ploy for publicity, Newman has pitched Oscar and Peter in a neck-and-neck competition with their archrivals and former colleagues, the hugely successful Decker and Strauss ([[Bob Balaban]] and [[John C. McGinley]]). When Newman meets Oscar and Peter, he assumes that they are lovers, even though Oscar is straight. (Peter is in fact [[gay]], but his relationship with Oscar is strictly platonic.) Under the mistaken impression that Oscar is gay, he asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress Amy ([[Neve Campbell|Campbell]]) and make sure that she doesn't talk to his wife. Oscar falls for Amy virtually on sight, but she thinks he's gay. He is forced to maintain the charade to avoid getting into trouble with Newman, and losing the commission.  Matters become complicated when a news article about Oscar and Peter's supposed relationship is published in a newspaper, leaving Oscar in the increasingly frustrating position of having to fend off advances from various gay men while convincing his friends and family that he is simply ''pretending'' to be gay. Amy even sets him up on a date with her ex-boyfriend, football player Kevin Cartwright ([[Cylk Cozart]]), but Oscar manages to defuse the situation by saying that he's in love with someone else. Despite the embarrassing misconceptions, Oscar forms a close bond with Amy as they continue to spend time together-to the extent that Amy moves in with him after she is kicked out of her apartment. At the final presentation for the cultural center, Oscar and Peter receive the commission, but Oscar is simultaneously told that he has won the award for Gay Professional Man of the Year, with Newman deciding that he will reveal his decision after the ceremony.  After an awkward meeting between Amy and Newman's wife at the party, she and Oscar go to a bar. Amy leaves in frustration after she nearly kisses him, prompting a brief argument between her and Oscar where Oscar states that her relationship with Newman has no future. After spending the day alone, Oscar attends the award ceremony for Gay Professional Man of the Year. Although he initially continues his charade, while looking out at the people before him, he instead makes a passionate speech about how he admires all the men and women here who were able to tell the truth to their families about how they feel, ending the speech by "[[coming out|coming out of the closet]]" as he admits that he's straight and in love with Amy. As he is applauded for having the courage to admit the truth, he runs after Amy, only for her to punch both him and Newman and storming out. Peter then awkwardly accepts the prize that comes with the award: a date with Kevin. However, as Oscar sits in a restaurant where he and Amy ate together on the night they met, Amy comes to see him. She says that she loves him too, and they kiss.  In a post-credit sequence, Newman's wife Olivia ([[Kelly Rowan]]) convinces him to go with Oscar and Peter's design, revealing that she knew about him and Amy and informing him bluntly that Oscar and Peter did the better job.  
Three Kings (1999 film)
 Following the end of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], U.S. soldiers are sent over to clean up loose ends. The soldiers are bored over the lack of action and as a result throw parties at night. [[Major (United States)|Major]] Archie Gates, a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] soldier, is trading sex for stories with a journalist, Cathy Daitch, when he is interrupted by Adriana Cruz, the television reporter he is assigned to escort.  While disarming and searching an Iraqi officer, [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]] [[Sergeant First Class]] Troy Barlow, his best friend [[Private First Class#United States|Private First Class]] Conrad Vig, and their unit find a map between the officer's buttocks. Troy goes to [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] Chief Elgin to help translate the map. Major Gates appears, after tracking down a lead from Adriana. Archie convinces them that the document is a map of bunkers near [[Karbala]], containing [[gold bullion]] stolen from Kuwait, which they decide to steal. To keep Adriana off his back, Gates sends [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Walter Wogeman to aid her on a false lead.  They set off the next day and, among other goods plundered from Kuwait, find the gold, and stumble on the interrogation of Amir Abdullah. As they are leaving, Amir's wife pleads with them not to abandon the [[1991 uprising in Karbala|anti-Saddam dissidents]], but she is executed by the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Iraqi Republican Guard]]. The group decides to free the Iraqi prisoners, triggering a firefight. They pull out just as Iraqi reinforcements arrive, and as they try to evade a [[CS gas]] attack, they blunder into a [[minefield]] and get separated. Iraqi soldiers capture Troy while a group of rebels rescue the other Americans and take them to their underground hideout. There, Conrad, Chief and Archie agree to help the rebels and their families reach the [[Iran–Iraq border|Iranian border]], after they rescue Troy.  Troy gets taken back to the bunker, and is thrown in a room full of Kuwaiti cell phones. He manages to call his wife back home and tells her to report his location to his local Army Reserve unit. His call is cut short when he is dragged to an interrogation room where he is interrogated by Iraqi [[Iraqi Army Ranks Insignia#Officer ranks|Captain]] Saïd.  The Americans with the rebels go to a band of Iraqi Army deserters, who are persuaded to sell them luxury cars stolen from Kuwait. The cars are outfitted as Saddam's entourage, in a ruse to scare away the bunker's defenders. After storming the bunker, they free Troy, who spares Saïd, and find more [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'ite dissidents]] held in a dungeon. A few of the soldiers who ran away return, and shoot Conrad and Troy. Conrad dies; Troy's [[pneumothorax|lung is punctured]], but he survives.  Archie radios Walter and Adriana and arranges transport, while the hapless officers in the camp try to locate the trio after getting the message from Troy's wife. Each of the rebels is given a bar of gold and the rest is buried as they wait for the transport to arrive. The convoy goes to the Iranian border, where the three Americans intend to escort the rebels across to protect them from the Iraqi soldiers guarding the crossing. But the American officers arrive and stop the group, arresting the trio while the rebels are recaptured. Archie offers the buried gold to the American officers in exchange for letting the refugees through. The commanding officer acquiesces to assisting the rebels get into Iran, but still states that charges (of being [[absent without leave]] and disobeying orders by contradicting American post-war policy) and [[court martial|courts-martial]] will be convened against Archie, Troy, and Chief Elgin.  As an epilogue, the film states that the three surviving soldiers (Archie, Troy, and Chief Elgin) are cleared of the charges and honorably discharged, thanks to Adriana's reporting. The epilogue goes on to show that Archie goes to work as a military adviser for Hollywood action films, Chief leaves his airport job to work with Archie, and Troy returns to his wife and baby to run his own carpet store. The stolen gold was returned to Kuwait, which claimed that some was missing, implying that some pilfering of the gold took place.  
Three Seasons
 In the misty mornings of Saigon, young girls wake up to pick [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotuses]] from a flower pond, to later sell to [[United States of America|American]] [[tourist]]s and fellow [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] alike.  To pass the time, the girls sing rich folk songs that touch the heart of a poet (Teacher Dao) who lives in an old temple overlooking the pond.  Teacher Dao ([[Manh Cuong Tran]]) suffered [[leprosy]] at the age of 26 and had consequently lost his fingers.  The girls (one of them a newcomer named Kien An ([[Nguyen Ngoc Hiep]]) are trucked off to the bustling streets of Saigon where they sell the lotus in bundles for 5,000 đồng [[VND]] (roughly 30 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s [[USD]]).  In Saigon, we meet different aspects of its inhabitants.  Woody is a 9- to 10-year-old street peddler who sells cigarettes, chewing gum, and various other things in a box that hangs on a strap to his shoulder.  Hai ([[Don Duong (actor)|Don Duong]]) is a [[cycle rickshaw|cyclo]] driver who hangs out with his buddies near a grand hotel.  Through a chance meeting, Hai eventually falls in love with Lan ([[Zoe Bui]]) who works as a prostitute in big hotels.  Even seemingly happy after receiving every American dollars from her clients, she carries a silent resentment of herself and her clients.  She tells Hai that she won't be doing this job for long and dreams of sleeping in an air-conditioned room, with no one to bother her.  Lan tries to embrace the capitalist invasion by re-inventing herself and though she resents the lifestyle, she promises to one day live like them.  Hai respects her and sees through her pain.  After winning $200 USD in a cyclo race, he treats her to her dream.  Lan feels guilty and rejects Hai's advances.  She feels that she is incapable and doesn't deserve Hai's special treatment.  During one of the last scenes of the film, Lan finally comes to terms with herself and Hai as he takes her to a place streaming with red ''phượng vĩ'' ([[Royal Poinciana]]) blossoms.  Lan, dressed in a beautiful [[white]] [[áo dài]] (traditional Vietnamese dress), marvels at her surroundings.  Hai's encounter with Kien An is a ridicule of the western embrace of "[[convenience]]".  Kien An's flowers, hand-picked and real, are being driven out by mass-produced plastic flowers.  Hai comments that they are even sprayed with perfume to imitate the smell.  The only difference is that the plastic flowers never wilt and die.  Hai wants no part in this and asks Kien An for two.  Kien An respects him and gives him the lotus for free.  Kien An's tale involves various personal tragedies and how poetry can triumph and provide respite for the human soul.  Teacher Dao is particularly interested in Kien An's song because it reminds him of his days as a small boy (when he was "light and pure") along the river markets.  Teacher Dao also tells Kien An of a recurring dream.  He dreams of being able to visit the river markets and drop white lotuses, letting them float downriver.  Kien An remarks that Teacher Dao's pain involves his inability to leave the seemingly abandoned temple.  Teacher Dao corrects her and says that even though he never leaves the place, in spirit, he yearns for the songs of the birds, the scent of the lotus, and the freedom of the clouds that lazily float in the sky.  In his prime, he was a successful poet.  After losing his fingers to [[leprosy]], Teacher Dao had given up hope of ever writing again.  Kien An wants to help him and so she promises to lend him her fingers.  From time to time, Kien An would visit his home in the temple to copy whatever the poet recites.  Soon, ill health as the result of old age and leprosy takes away the poet's life.  Huy ([[Hoang Phat Trieu]]), Teacher Dao's headman, carries out one of his final wishes and gives Kien An Dao's poetry book, which contains a never-before seen picture of Dao.  The two remarks that he was very handsome before being overtaken by leprosy.  Kien An asks Huy for help to make the late Dao's dream come true.  She visits the river market and drops lotus flowers, just like in Dao's dream.  James Hager is an American [[GI (military)|G.I.]] who returns to Vietnam to look for his daughter, in hope of "coming to peace with this place".  Hai and his buddies jokingly say that Hager probably lost a few screws in his head.  They witness him sitting in front of a hotel for weeks, smoking,  staring at a restaurant across the street.  They watch him with curiosity but never approach him.  His story ends with him meeting his daughter.  He gives her a bundle of lotus buds he has bought from Kien An and tries to talk with her.  Through these intertwining tales, Tony Bui is able to portray the struggles of a vanishing culture.    Kien An represents the country's old ways, living as if untouched by time.  Lan represents the country's present, re-inventing herself and hoping to embrace the capitalist invasion.  Hai (the cyclo driver) acts as a bridge between the past and the present, living care-free yet observing the "improvements" of westernization with a silent resentment.  Woody, the young peddler, acts as the country's future, naïve, innocent, and easily fooled.  Woody's story ends with him playing soccer with his friends in the rain.  
The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)
 }} At the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], an attempted robbery of precious paintings fails when museum employees discover imposters posing as staff who have been smuggled in using a Trojan Horse. In all the confusion of locking down the museum and capturing the robbers, billionaire Thomas Crown ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) slips into an adjacent room and steals the painting of ''[[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk (Monet)|San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk]]'' by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. The insurers of the $100 million artwork send investigator Catherine Banning ([[Rene Russo]]) to assist [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Detective Michael McCann ([[Denis Leary]]) in solving the crime. McCann is annoyed that he has a civilian involved in the investigation, but is attracted to Banning. He asks his second in command to do a background check on her.  The next morning as the police are reviewing video of the robbery, Banning shows up. They notice that the room containing the Monet couldn't be seen on the screen. In discussing why with a museum employee, they deduce that something caused the temperature to rise in that room so the new cameras couldn't differentiate between people and walls. She goes back to the room with Michael where she realizes that one of the benches only has two legs when in the video it had three. They then brainstorm over what could have been in the briefcase to cause the change in temperature. Crown not only shows up to finger one of the detained robbers, but donates one of his own personal paintings that fits the same space as the Monet. After watching Crown, she looks up who has been attempting to buy Monets and finds his name on the list again and again. She convinces Michael to let her begin surveillance on him and finds that he is someone who would steal the painting not for the money, but for the excitement. After the press conference donating the new painting, Catherine attracts Crown by intimating that she knows what he did. On her way out, he asks her for a date and she accepts.  Before the date, Crown goes to see his therapist ([[Faye Dunaway]]), who notices a change in her patient. On their first date, Crown takes her to the museum and then to dinner, all while being tailed by the police. Their attraction is evident as is their intimate knowledge of each other's background. Catherine gets her hands on his keys and has a copy made for later. When he drops her off, he reveals he knows she has no furniture in her apartment and she returns his keys without him knowing they were ever gone. They both feel a palpable change is about to occur in their lives and press on with the cat and mouse game.  The next day, she illegally enters into Thomas' house and searches for the painting. Along with her team they search the entire house to no avail until she enters his study. She presses a button under the desk that opens a panel in the wall and finds the Monet. She triumphantly enters the police station where an expert is waiting to authenticate it. They find that it was a witty copy, painted over the kitschy ''[[Dogs Playing Poker|Poker Sympathy]]''. Enraged, she asks where to find Crown. He is at a Black and White Ball and she crashes, interrupting a dance with his beautiful young date. She angrily tells him she doesn't need him to lend her clues, and he responds that he can't be arrested for a joke. After a hot dance, they kiss and end up at Crown's home where they have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] in many rooms (and the stairs). At breakfast, his valet brings her the distinct drink she had her first day in New York, causing her to bemoan that he knew she would sleep with him (which she denied would happen on their first date). They begin to date regularly and he even takes her to his home on a Caribbean island that he claims he's never taken anyone to. When they arrive, both a painting and clothes that fit her exactly are there. He teases her about seeing the painting to the point that she puts it in the fire, only to find out that it wasn't what she thought. The next morning after a serious talk, she wakes to find him having a meeting with some serious looking men. When he finds her on the beach later, she confronts him with the knowledge that she knows he's preparing to run. He offers her a lot of money to throw the case (yet admits no wrongdoing) and come with him. When they return, a jealous Michael confronts Catherine with pictures of Crown and what he has been doing since they returned. At first she pretends she doesn't care, then folds and asks to see the pictures. They are of Crown with the same beautiful young woman again. Feeling betrayed, she hands Michael pictures of the borders of the Monet, stating that they are photographed before being insured so a forgery can be discerned.  Catherine is not the only one with mixed feelings. Crown has seen his therapist throughout the relationship and she warns him that they are very much alike, so Catherine won't realize that he truly cared for her until she's lost him. They continue to date and he asks her to leave with him. When she is slow to respond, he asks her if it is because of the young lady he had been photographed with, Anna. He then confesses that he purposefully allowed the police to see them together, knowing she'd find out. She then commands that his valet stop the car and she gets out, with Crown close behind. She is angry that he tried to hurt her and he responds that he only did it to insure that he was not the only one with feelings involved. He then asks her to leave with him again.  When she returns to the police station, Michael reminds her of the border pictures and that they found some likely forgers in the city. They go to visit them, but they each blame the other. The second (who is in jail) sparks curiosity in Catherine and she thinks there is something he knows, but isn't saying. She then goes to see Crown, and finds him packing with Anna. Feeling used, she turns to leave and he attempts to stop her so he can explain. He promises that there is nothing going on between him and Anna and that she merely wanted to be paid for a job she did for him. Catherine doesn't believe it, so he promises to return the painting so they can be together. Incredulous, she asks if he expects her to believe him. He gives her a date, time and location to meet him after he returns it and kisses her, giving her the option of leaving with him or turning him in. She breaks away in tears and leaves. She ends up at Michael's and gives Crown up.  The next day, the police have staked out the museum and are waiting for him to show so they can arrest him. Michael gets a phone call and divulges that the forger was Anna, the daughter of one of the forgers they visited, Heinrich Knutzhorn. Her father had owned a gallery with Crown and he had become her guardian when her father had gone to prison. Catherine is mortified at her mistake and even more so when Crown shows up dressed as the man in the painting, ''[[The Son of Man (Magritte)|The Son of Man]]''. Michael asks if she warned him and when she insists she did not, he responds that Crown knew she would betray him. He quickly blends into the crowd while sending the police on a wild goose chase when other men matching his description and dress flood the museum passing identical briefcases. The room where the Monet was is heavily guarded, so they have no idea how he is going to return it. After disposing of his Son of Man clothes, Crown throws a few tear gas shells into the room where the original Monet painting was hanging. The fire sprinklers open up and to avoid any damage the covers start to close over the paintings. However, the door in front of the Pissarro Crown donated is stuck. The water washes away the paint to reveal the Monet. When they look to see what stopped the doors, they find a pencil stamped with, "Crown Acquisitions".  What occurred is now clear; immediately after stealing the original Monet painting, Thomas had Anna forge a Pissarro over it with watercolor and replaced it via the donation two days later. However, when the shields retract, they find another painting is missing. It is the painting Catherine told Crown on their first date she would have taken instead of the Monet. Her people are not responsible for it and theirs has been recovered, so it is no longer her business. Michael says he has more important crimes to concentrate on, so Crown is free to do whatever he wants. When Catherine goes to the location she was supposed to meet Thomas, she encounters a man she thinks is him. However, when he turns around, it is one of the men from the museum dressed as the Son of Man with a gift from Crown for her: the newly stolen Manet. Devastated, she goes to the airport and asks the clerk to mail the painting to Michael at police headquarters before she catches a flight to Britain.  Visibly shaken on the plane and clutching a shot of hard liquor, Catherine falls apart. A hand reaches through the seats from behind her and gives her a handkerchief while using a voice that doesn't quite sound right. She looks in the seat behind her to find Crown. She leaps at him, furious at his actions. The stewardess comes to see what the commotion is, but by then Thomas has calmed her by kissing her. She then whispers in his ear, "If you pull a stunt like that again, I'll break both your arms".  
Thrill Seekers (film)
 Tom Merrick (Van Dien) is a TV reporter filming a live segment on a fire at a power plant. He spots a creepy-looking man (Richings), causing him to move away from his crew. This accidentally saves his life as the crew is killed in the partial collapse of a building. After the accident, Merrick gives up his job as a reporter and begins working for a magazine.  While researching catastrophes, he finds several pictures of the man from the power plant, who appears to turn up in different disasters ([[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of Titanic]], [[Hindenburg disaster]] and [[hurricane Hugo]]), but who still looks the same in all the pictures.  Merrick's boss Eleanor books him a flight to [[Washington, D.C.]] to get the original photographs. On the plane, he spots the man from the power plant and checks his luggage. He finds a flyer and discovers a future enterprise-—Thrill Seekers-—will make time travel possible in the year 2070 and will sell trips to the past. These trips allow travellers to visit a catastrophe before it happens, but are able to travel back in time again before they get killed. Merrick finds out that the flight he is on will be involved in a mid-air collision, killing everyone on board.  Merrick forces the pilots to change course, which saves the plane from crashing. The mysterious man disappears before landing. Merrick is arrested by the FBI on the charge of hijacking. Agent Baker is sure about the hijacking attempt while his younger assistant Agent Stanton believes Merrick's story. The averted disaster causes changes in the future, so Grifasi (Sheen), the head of Thrill Seekers, sends agents Cortez and Felder to the past to stop Merrick. The agents kidnap Merrick, but he is able to escape and hide.  Merrick contacts his colleague Elizabeth (Bell) for help. They head to the [[Chicago subway]] where, according to the future itinerary, the next catastrophe will take place. They spot the man from the previous events and board the same train. Merrick confronts the man and takes his time-travel device. The engineer suffers cardiac arrest and the train accelerates uncontrollably. Merrick manages to disconnect the locomotive from the rest of the train, but the time traveller remains behind and is killed.  Cortez and Felder are informed by Grifasi that the prevention of the train wreck has had a huge impact on the future. The agents, whose own time lines are protected by a containment field around the time machine in the future, are warned that these changes may even prevent them from returning to their own time.  While checking the time-travelling device, Merrick learns of another catastrophe:  a fire at [[Copps Coliseum]] that will kill over 11,000 people, including his ex-wife and son. Unable to convince them not to go, Merrick tells the FBI about the coming disaster. While Baker is still suspicious, he decides to be cautious and has firefighters dispatched. They manage to put out a fire in the stadium restaurant which was the probable cause of the disaster.  Felder and Cortez are now informed by Grifasi that the timeline has been severely altered and the world they know no longer exists with millions of people in California, including Cortez herself and her family, being killed when a nuclear reactor melted down 22 years earlier in the new timeline. The agents are also unable to return because they learn that one of the surviving passengers from the averted plane crash killed the inventor of the time travel device in a car crash before he could invent it. The only way to reset the timeline is to make sure the Copps Coliseum fire happens in order to prevent the timeline from altering too much to be recoverable and then to travel to the past to prevent Merrick from saving the lives of the people who will go on to cause the California disaster in the future.  The agents pursue Merrick and blow up his car with Elisabeth in it, then travel to the stadium and plant multiple explosive devices.  The explosions kill Merrick's ex-wife and son.  Merrick uses the time-travel device and returns to the time before Elisabeth is killed. Merrick and Elizabeth manage to partially evacuate the stadium before the agents set off the explosions. Felder, who now regrets his actions, kills Cortez but is then killed by falling rubble.  As he dies, Felder recognizes Stanton as the inventor of the time machine and tells him not to invent it, but Stanton appears not to understand the warning.  Merrick, along with Elizabeth, his ex-wife and son survive the accident.  Merrick and Elizabeth share a kiss while a group of time travellers watch the scene.  
Time Regained (film)
 The movie starts off with Marcel Proust on his death bed. He is dictating something for Céleste to write out for him. He calls for her to bring him some pictures from his drawer. He dismisses her and he begins to flip through the pictures naming each person in the photos. We then cut to Charlie who is playing the piano at a party. Odette de Crécy leads the guests in the room to observe Marcel, however in this period he is even younger.  The room doors emit a blinding heaven-like light. Marcel tips his hat off to Gilberte and both are called to take a picture. It returns to Marcel in his deathbed asking Celeste about roses. As she is leaving the room, we see yet again another door way that is emitting a blinding heaven-like light.  Gilberte and Marcel are sitting down having lunch while discussing some books. Marcel requests to borrow [[The Goncourt Journals]] while Gilberte keeps The Girl with Eyes of Gold. Marcel recalls a relationship he had with Albertine in which he was heartbroken that she had been unfaithful with not only women, but men as well. Marcel breaks a tea cup and Gilberte has the pieces cleaned and put in her mahogany box.  Marcel is suffering from a nightmare and as he tries to pull the service bell, something stops him. He wakes up to a ghostly Albertine stroking his face. He wakes up again to realize that he had been dreaming about his ghostly encounter. Marcel and Gilberte are walking down the street discussing Robert as it starts to storm.  A younger Marcel is examining a picture of the younger Gilberte. There is a note on the back of the photograph, however Marcel and another woman are playfully arguing about the signature being signed at the bottom. It flips from Gilberte, to Albertine, to Libertinage.  Robert is reading an excerpt to Charlie. Charlie dismisses himself to attend an algebra class and Robert becomes upset and throws his paper and a picture frame of Charlie onto the floor. Charlie comes home to Madame Cottard who is holding up a picture frame of a woman. She slaps him in fear that he is being unfaithful.  Robert and Marcel are discussing Robert’s second woman until Giblerte arrives. She is dressed in a red evening gown and with a decorative headdress on. She walks down the staircase twice. As the woman’s face is pictured, it goes back and forth between Gilberte’s and Rachel’s. Gilberte bursts into tears. Marcel and Gilberte make eye contact which prompts him to check the mahogany box that is on the fireplace. He discovers the tea cup that he had broken. He is then surrounded by people at a dinner table where they are telling stories. He is then riding a train when he stops to see a younger version of himself in the window.  Going back to the party where Charlie is playing the piano, Madame Verdurin requests for him to play a song. He claims he has enlisted for the front because of boredom and to uphold his reputation. He starts to play Beethoven. Odette de Crécy and Marcel take a carriage to another party. A siren then sounds which prompts the lights and music to turn off. The guests are then kicked out of the party. There are sounds of missiles and explosions in the background.  Marcel makes his way back into the building and moves from a room with guests around a dinner table to the kitchen where Le Prince de Foix and some other men are playing a game with food. The flags in the food represent war zones as they are studying the German troop movements. Robert is in conversation with a gentleman as they hear another siren. This time it is the all-clear siren.  The people at the party watch a projected screen showing soldiers at war. Marcel reads a letter to himself as the room is evolving around him. He is joined by his younger self operating the projector.  Odette visits a man who is sick and in his bed. He instructs her to open a gift on the table which reveals many francs. She closes the box and walks towards the bed to caress the man. It then cuts to a funeral in which Marcel attends. The widow reveals her anger that she feels from finding letters from her husband’s, Robert de Saint-Loup, mistress. Marcel comforts and soothes her.  Robert and Marcel then discuss the war. It then cuts to Marcel inside of an elevator is conversation with the bellhop. We then see Robert and Marcel again, in a different time where Robert is dressed in his military uniform.  Rachel and Charlie are seen having lunch. She speaks of being written a prescription for croissants as it cures her headaches. She asks about the Charlie and Charlus’ encounter. Charlie turns down his invitation to spend the night and day with Charlus to which Charlus replies, “Charlie! Look out. I’ll get even!”  Marcel walks down a street at night time and suffers from flashbacks of his childhood. He encounters Le Prince de Foix where they discuss Saint-Loup who has wrongly been implicated in a spy scandal. Marcel seems to be staying in a hotel full of soldiers. He discovers a room where he hears the cries of Charlus who is being tortured. As he is being tortured the screen turns red with blood. The whipping turns out to be erotic roleplaying as Charlus is putting on a robe and engaging in conversation with another man. Marcel is still spying on him through the window. Marcel joins other soldiers in the common room where he sits in a chair. All the men then tell him not to sit in that chair as it is the place where Prince de Foix died and nobody can sit in that chair. The soldiers all line up as Charlus enters the room. Charlus walks by each of the soldiers and addresses them.  Sirens sound throughout the city once more, signaling raids. People are seen fleeing the city carrying their belongings. Francoise discovers that Marcel is still alive and expresses her gratitude towards Robert who rescued them from the cellar. Marcel reads a note from Charlus explaining the location of Morel, who is hiding at 25 Avenue du Bois.  Marcel travels to said location and meets with Morel. Morel says that the police are after him. Marcel persuades Morel to settle his differences with Charlus. Morel explains that he fears the man.  We cut back to the funeral of Robert de Saint-Loup where you see the women mourning his death. We then go back to Robert having conversation with a teenage Marcel. Marcel points out towards the beach and asks if it is Robert de Saint-Loup. To which the woman replies yes. At the funeral Robert’s mother thanks Marcel for attending. Accompanied with a few others, they start to leave. Oriane de Guermantes leaves with another older gentleman. A carriage led by a single horse transports Marcel to what seems to be a park. The war is over and he is met by Charlus who is limping along with his cane. He appears to have not aged well as his hair is unkempt and his speech is slowed. He starts to list his family members that have passed: Antoine de Mouchy, Charles Swann, Adalbert de Montmorency, Boson de Talleyrand, and Sosthène de Doudeauville. A carriage pulls up carrying Mrs. De Saint-Eurverte, to which Charlus bows. Jupien then tells Charlus who was in the carriage and that he hates her. Jupien helps Charlus to another carriage that is waiting for them, leaving Marcel.  A teenage Marcel is being called by his grandmother. Charlus then scolds him about his inability to answer his grandmother. The Marcel that was just left in the park starts walking in somewhere. We are transported to another time, though he is still walking. He trips and is in a stationary position. He does not move as other people are passing him by. A younger Marcel passes by the older Marcel in this same position. He returns to present time and corrects his position.  Marcel is lead into a room where he tries to find a comfortable position to sit in. He moves from chair to chair until he is back on the same seat he started in. He is served tea by a server. With the sounds of the spoon stirring in the cup we are transported to a train station in which the train operators are banging on the wheels on the train. He holds a handkerchief up to his face which prompts a cut to the teenage Marcel overlooking his oceanfront balcony. There is a statue on the beach which is carried off by six gentlemen. We see the same statue, only smaller, in the room where Marcel is drinking tea. He picks up a book which reminds him of the time he had been crying and his mother read that same book to him to help him sleep.  A ballroom filled with many guests opens and the crowd moves towards a room filled with sweets and treats. Oriane de Guermantes walks towards Marcel, not knowing it is him. She finally recognizes him and they exchange their hellos and memories. She warns Marcel of Gilberte being a tramp; not being worth his time to bring up conversation with. She explains Gilberte’s infidelity was the reason that Robert enlisted. She says, “If you ask me, he wasn’t killed. He got himself killed.” He is then introduced to Madame de Farcy by Jacques de Rozier (Austin Bloch). Marcel then introduces him to Prince de Guermantes. Marcel then bumps into Marquis de Cambremer who is worried that he does not recognize him. He asks of the symptoms that Marcel is experiencing due to his illness, as Marquis is in the later stages. The piano being played causes Marcel to revisit the time when Albertine was playing the piano in their room.  Marcel beings to tell Albertine a story, but she does not seem to be listening. Albertine mentions Morel, which ensues jealousy in Marcel. She tells him of Charlus accidentally opening a letter addressed to Morel by Leá. She says that Leá and Gilberte were together. He asks if she was with Leá. Leá would send carriages to Albertine’s house to pick her up. She asked Albertine if she really liked girls, to which Albertine replied yes just to mess with Leá.  Marcel is moved to tears as the violin and piano play in the ballroom. He smiles as he weeps. We observe the pianist and violist play their ballad as the seating arrangements in the room start to shift back and forth as if they are sliding in the room. He is then greeted by Gilberte and her mother. She reminisces of the way that Robert spoke and his signature remarks. Oriane then asks Marcel if Gilberte was just playing a grieving widow act when they spoke. She is angry at her nonchalant attitude despite her husband passing away. Madame de Farcy engages in conversation with Marcel and Jacques once more. Despite Madame de Farcy being related to Mrs. de Forcheville, she feels close to her, however still dislikes her very much. She describes Mrs. de Forcheville as being like a rose that has been pickled. Throughout the dinner party you seen Madame Verdurin drifting in and out of the frame, each time coming back as either a younger version of herself or the older version of herself. Finally, we see Odette pass up Marcel, but come back apologizing for not recognizing him. Her husband asks her to leave with him, to which she responds that she has better plans. Gilberte comes back to talk with Marcel asking about his conversation with Oriane. Jacques urges Marcel to talk with him of something of great importance. Odette speaks with Marcel about her overprotective husband who takes away her freedom.  A younger Marcel meets with Odette and compliments his ability to be a gentleman. The grown-up Marcel finds himself in the same position as his younger self. A room full of hats on the floor, but it quickly becomes apparent that that is a dream as well. The older Marcel visits the younger Marcel and tells him of his love with Albertine and Gilberte. We then find both the younger Marcel and older Marcel travelling through different spaces in time throughout his life. Their last destination is the beach. We are read a quote from the sculptor Salvini. “My life has been a series of extraordinary adventures. To revisit them would only make me sadder. I’d rather use my remaining time to review my last work, Divine Nemesis, otherwise known as The Triumph of Death.” As the angel of death revisited to claim his life, he exclaimed, “What a paradox! You gave me enough time to revisit my whole life, which lasted sixty-three years. The same length of time was too short to review an object I made in 3 months.” The Angel replied, “In this work is all of your life and the life of all men. To review it would take an eternity.” We end with the present day Marcel walking towards the younger Marcel on the beach.  
Thulladha Manamum Thullum
 The film begins with Kutty ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) waiting at the Pune rail station for the train back to Chennai. As he continues waiting, he tears off a paper scrap from a pillar that reveals a carving of the name "Rukmani". The train arrives and Kutty boards a cabin that is boarded by college students from Chennai who are musicians. During the train journey, Kutty starts singing "Innisai Paadivarum", which catches the attention of everyone and they all begin to sing along with him. After finishing the song, the students applaud Kutty for his singing and ask him whether he's a professional musician and his reason for coming to Pune. Kutty denies this and reveals that he's an ex-convict, having been released from jail after 8 years. When asked why he was imprisoned for so long, Kutty explains the reason for his conviction as the film goes for a flashback.  Kutty is an aspiring singer while working as a local cable provider run by Mani ([[Manivannan]]) in Chennai. His songs are appreciated by a college student Rukmani alias 'Rukku' ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]) and she wishes to meet him. But every time they meet, circumstances place Kutty in situations where Rukku dismisses him as a rowdy, unaware that the person she hates and is accusing of being a rowdy is the same person whom she admires. Kutty learns about Rukku's admiration for him and tries to reveal his identity to her, but he still ends up in situations that portray him as a transgressive element. One day while chasing after a pickpocket who stole his wallet, Kutty ends up in Rukku's college where he locates the pickpocket at the other side of a lab room that Rukku happens to be in. Kutty runs into the lab room in front of Rukku, and accidentally knocks over a flask containing reactive chemicals that fall into the ground, causing Rukku to go blind. Kutty doesn't learn about Rukku's loss of sight until one rainy day, when he sees her and tries to reveal his identity.   After learning that he became the cause for Rukku's blindness, Kutty is wracked with guilt and decides to devote himself to her from then onwards attending to her every need. Kutty begins to fall in love with Rukku and he regularly writes to his mother about the development of love he has for her. Rukku in turn learns to respect and love Kutty too, thinking that he is the singer she admires and not knowing that he is the same person she thought was a rowdy and the one who caused her eyesight loss. When Kutty's mother dies - much to his grief - she offers her eyes to Rukku. To meet the cost of the eye transplant, Kutty offers his kidney to a [[Pune]]-based rich man and travels to Pune with Rukku promising that she will never forget him and will wait for him to return. While at the Pune rail station waiting for the train back to Chennai, Kutty carves Rukku's name on one of the pillars (the same carving that was seen in the beginning of the film). Unfortunately, Kutty is arrested by the police after unknowingly agreeing to look after the luggage - which turned out to contain explosives - of another man.   Back in the present day, the students ask Kutty whether he was able to get in touch with Rukku during the past 8 years to which Kutty replies he wasn't able to and misses her a lot. The students assure Kutty that he will find Rukku and wishes him the best of luck as the train arrives to Chennai. When Kutty arrives to the area he used to live, he finds that everything has changed during the past 8 years save for a shrine. While contemplating where Rukku might be and the changed environment around him, Kutty sees a passing ambassador car and finds that Rukku is riding in it. Kutty chases after the car while calling out to Rukku and ends up at a Collector's office where it is revealed that Rukku, who had studied for IAS, became a Collector. Kutty calls out to Rukku while being held by an officer whom he accidentally bumped into. However Rukku, having regained her eyesight, still thinks of Kutty as the rowdy who caused her eyesight loss and orders her officers to arrest him. A shocked Kutty is then knocked unconscious and dragged into the police jeep by the officers. As the jeep reaches the office gates, it collides with a rickshaw that happens to contain Kutty's father Mani. Finding Kutty at the back of the jeep and learning that Rukku gave the order to arrest him, Mani goes to the Collector's office entrance and angrily questions Rukku about Kutty's arrest. During the confrontation, a travelling bus full of people, who accompanied Kutty during his trip back from Pune, sing "Innisai Paadivarum". Rukku hears them and orders the officers to stop the bus chasing after it with Mani tailing behind. As Rukku boards the bus, she asks the passengers if any of them are Kutty. One of the students then reveals to Rukku that Kutty has come back from Pune and is looking for her. Just then Kutty, who regained consciousness and got out of the police jeep, begins singing "Innisai Paadivarum". Everyone hears him and runs towards him. As Kutty continues singing, Rukku realizes that the person who she accused of being a rowdy and accidentally caused her blindness and the person who she admired as a singer and took care of her when she was blind has been Kutty this whole time. After Kutty finishes singing, a guilt stricken Rukku expresses her joy of finally being able to meet him after so long and tearfully begs for his forgiveness. Kutty forgives her and the two reunite

  Andy prepares to go to cowboy camp with Woody,  but while playing with Woody and Buzz, he accidentally tears Woody's arm. Andy's mom puts Woody on a shelf, and Andy leaves without Woody. The next day after Woody has a nightmare of being thrown away, he finds that [[Wheezy]] has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a [[garage sale|yard sale]], but Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. [[Buzz Lightyear]] and the rest of Andy's toys identify the thief from a commercial to be [[Al McWhiggin]], the owner of Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]], [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog]], and [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]] set out to rescue Woody.  At Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is based on a 1950s<ref></ref> television show called ''Woody's Roundup'', and that along with the other Roundup toys – [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], [[Bullseye (Toy Story)|Bullseye]], and [[Stinky Pete (Toy Story)|Stinky Pete the Prospector]] – he is set to be sold to a toy museum in [[Tokyo]], Japan. While the others are excited about going, Woody intends to return home to Andy. Stinky Pete explains that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage.   When Woody's arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape, but is foiled when Al's television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next morning, Woody's arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist and he learns that Jessie once belonged to Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.  Meanwhile, Buzz and the other toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a [[List of Toy Story characters#Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear|Utility Belt Buzz]], who believes that Buzz is a rogue space ranger; he joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After discovering Al's plan, they go to his apartment, while Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an [[List of Toy Story characters#Evil Emperor Zurg|Emperor Zurg]] toy, who follows him with the intent of destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home.   Buzz reminds Woody that a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy play with him on television, Woody realizes that Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and Andy's toys. However, Stinky Pete declines and stops them from leaving, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase and leaves for the [[airport]].  Andy's toys pursue Al, but are caught by Zurg, who battles Utility Belt Buzz, until Rex inadvertently knocks him off the [[elevator]]. Utility Belt Buzz then chooses to remain behind with Zurg, who has revealed himself as Buzz's father. Accompanied by [[List of Toy Story characters#Squeeze Toy Aliens / Little Green Men|three toy Aliens]], Andy's toys steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to the airport, where they enter the [[baggage handling system]] and find Al's suitcase. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm during a struggle, but Andy's toys stuff him into a little girl's backpack. They free Bullseye, only for Jessie to end up on the plane bound for Japan.

Titus (film)
 A boy eating lunch in a 1950s-style kitchen plays war with his surrounding toys. A bomb blast outside the window frightens him under the table from where he is rescued and taken to an [[Amphitheatre]], where an invisible audience cheers. An army resembling the [[Terracotta Army]] enters; Romans under the command of [[Titus Andronicus (character)|Titus Andronicus]], the general at the center of the play, return victorious from war. They bring back as spoils Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her sons, and Aaron the [[Moors|Moor]]. Titus sacrifices Tamora's eldest son, Alarbus, so the spirits of his 21 dead sons might be appeased. Tamora eloquently begs for the life of Alarbus, but Titus refuses her plea.  Caesar, the Emperor of Rome, dies. His sons Saturninus and Bassianus squabble over who will succeed him. The [[Tribune]] of the People, Marcus Andronicus, announces the people's choice for new emperor is his brother, Titus. He refuses the throne and hands it to the late emperor's eldest son Saturninus, much to the latter's delight. The new emperor states he will take Lavinia, Titus' daughter, as his [[bride]] to honor and elevate the family. She is already betrothed to Saturninus' brother, Bassianus, who steals her away. Titus' surviving sons aid in the couple's run for the Pantheon, where they are to marry. Titus, angry with his sons because in his eyes they're being disloyal to Rome, kills his son Mutius as he defends the escape. The new emperor, Saturninus, dishonors Titus and marries Tamora instead. Tamora persuades the Emperor to feign forgiveness to Bassianus, Titus and his family and postpone punishment to a later day, thereby revealing her intention to avenge herself on all the Andronici.  During a hunting party the next day, Tamora's lover, Aaron the Moor, meets Tamora's sons Chiron and Demetrius. The two argue over which should take sexual advantage of the newly-wed Lavinia. Aaron easily persuades them to ambush Bassianus and kill him in the presence of Tamora and Lavinia, in order to have their way with her. Lavinia begs Tamora to stop her sons, but Tamora refuses. Chiron and Demetrius throw Bassianus' body in a pit, as Aaron directed them, then take Lavinia away and rape her. To keep her from revealing what she saw and endured, they cut out her tongue as well as her hands, replacing them with tree branches. When Marcus discovers her, he begs her to reveal the identity of her assailants; Lavinia leans towards the camera and opens her bloodied mouth in a silent scream.  Aaron brings Titus' sons Martius and Quintus and frames them for the murder of Bassianus with a forged letter outlining their plan to kill him. Angry, the Emperor arrests them. Later on, Marcus takes Lavinia to her father, who's overcome with grief. He and his remaining son Lucius begged for the lives of Martius and Quintus, but the two are found guilty and are marched off to execution. Aaron enters, and tells Titus, Lucius, and Marcus the emperor will spare the prisoners if one of the three sacrifices a hand. Each demands the right to do so. Titus has Aaron cut off his (Titus's) left hand and take it to the emperor. Aaron's story is revealed to have been false, as a messenger brings Titus the heads of his sons and his own severed hand. In Renaissance semiotics, the hand is a representation of political and personal agency.  With his hand chopped off, Titus has truly lost power.<ref>"Dismembering and Forgetting in Titus Andronicus", by Katherine A. Rowe, Shakespeare Quarterly, 45.3 (Autumn 1994), pp. 279-303</ref>  Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths.  Titus' grandson (Lucius' son and the boy from the opening), who helped Titus read to Lavinia, complains she will not leave his books alone. In the book, she indicates to Titus and Marcus the story of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]], in which a similarly mute victim "wrote" the name of her wrongdoer. Marcus gives her a stick to hold with her mouth and stumps. She writes the names of her attackers on the ground. Titus vows revenge. Feigning madness, he ties written prayers for justice to arrows and commands his kinsmen to aim them at the sky so they may reach the gods. Understanding the method in Titus' "madness", Marcus directs the arrows to land inside the palace of Saturninus, who is enraged by this added to the fact Lucius is at the gates of Rome with an army of Goths.  Tamora delivers a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. To hide his affair from the Emperor, Aaron kills the nurse and flees with the baby. Lucius, marching on Rome with an army of Goths, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. To save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire plot to Lucius, relishing every murder, rape and dismemberment.  Tamora, convinced of Titus' [[Insanity|madness]], approaches him along with her two sons, dressed as the spirits of [[Revenge]], [[Murder]], and [[Rape]]. She tells Titus she (as a supernatural spirit) will grant him revenge if he will convince Lucius to stop attacking Rome. Titus agrees, sending Marcus to invite Lucius to a feast. "Revenge" offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora and is about to leave, but Titus insists "Rape" and "Murder" stay with him. She agrees. When she leaves, Titus' servants bind Chiron and Demetrius. Titus cuts their throats, while Lavinia holds a basin with her stumps to catch their blood. He plans to [[Cannibalism|cook them into]] a pie for their mother.  The next day, during the feast at his house, Lavinia enters the dining room. Titus asks Saturninus whether a father should kill his daughter if she is raped. When the Emperor agrees, Titus snaps Lavinia's neck, to the horror of the dinner guests, and tells Saturninus what Tamora's sons did. When Saturninus demands Chiron and Demetrius be brought before him, Titus reveals they were in the pie Tamora enjoyed, and kills Tamora. Saturninus kills Titus after which Lucius kills Saturninus to avenge his father's death.  Back in the Roman Arena, Lucius tells his family's story to the people and is proclaimed Emperor. He orders his father Titus and sister Lavinia to be buried in the family monuments, Saturninus be given a proper burial, Tamora's body to be thrown to the wild beasts, and Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron is unrepentant to the end. Young Lucius picks up Aaron's child and carries him away into the sunrise.  
Topsy-Turvy
 On the opening night of ''[[Princess Ida]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in January 1884, composer Sir Arthur Sullivan ([[Allan Corduner]]), who is ill from [[kidney]] disease, is barely able to make it to the theatre to conduct. He goes on a holiday to [[Continental Europe]] hoping that the rest will improve his health. While he is away, ticket sales and audiences at the Savoy Theatre wilt in the hot summer weather. Producer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] ([[Ron Cook]]) has called on Sullivan and the playwright W. S. Gilbert ([[Jim Broadbent]]) to create a new piece for the Savoy, but it is not ready when ''Ida'' closes. Until a new piece can be prepared, Carte revives an earlier Gilbert and Sullivan work, ''[[The Sorcerer]]''.  Gilbert's idea for their next opera features a transformative magic potion, which Sullivan feels is too similar to the magic lozenge and other magic talismans used in previous operas<ref>Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877) involved a magic love potion, and several of Gilbert's other works involved various magic devices that transform the possessor. See, e.g., ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866).</ref> and appears mechanical in its reliance on a supernatural device. Sullivan, under pressure to write more serious music, says he longs for something that is "probable" and involves "human interest", and is not dependent on magic. Gilbert sees nothing wrong with his [[libretto]] and refuses to write a new one, which results in a standoff. The impasse is resolved after Gilbert and his wife visit [[Japanese Village, Knightsbridge|a popular exhibition of Japanese arts and crafts]] in [[Knightsbridge]], London.<ref>This scene in the film is anachronistic: Gilbert is shown in the film visiting the exhibition and getting inspiration for his play, but the real exhibition did not open until 1885, which is long after Gilbert sent the first plot sketch of ''The Mikado'' to Sullivan in May 1884.</ref> When the [[katana]] sword he purchases there falls noisily off the wall of his study, he is inspired to write a libretto set in exotic Japan. Sullivan likes the idea and agrees to compose the music for it.  Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte work to make ''The Mikado'' a success, and many glimpses of rehearsals and stressful backstage preparations for the show follow: Cast members lunch together before negotiating their salaries. Gilbert brings in Japanese girls from the exhibition to teach the ladies' chorus how to walk and use fans in the Japanese manner. The principal cast react to the fittings of their costumes designed by [[William Charles John Pitcher|C. Wilhelm]]. The entire cast object to Gilbert's proposed cut of the title character's Act Two solo, "A more humane Mikado," which persuades the playwright to restore the solo. The actors face first-night jitters in their dressing rooms. Finally ''The Mikado'' is ready to open. As usual, Gilbert is too nervous to watch the opening performance and paces the streets of London. Returning to the theatre, however, he finds that the new opera is a resounding success.  
To Walk with Lions
 Tony Fitzjohn (John Michie) has just come to work on Kora, a lion preserve, for two elderly brothers, George and [[Terrence Adamson]] ([[Ian Bannen]]).

Being informed this is how the last person to fill his position came to be killed, he writes the whole place off as crazy and decides to leave. With a last minute change of heart, and a lion cub brought in from a zoo for him to train and reintroduce into the wild he soon discovers his life’s true calling.   Years pass and Kora’s lions are being picked off by herdsmen one by one with bullets and poison and the elephants and rhinos are being poached at an alarming rate for their tusks and horns. The Adamson brothers are expending all of their energies in protecting the wildlife but can hardly compete; as Fitzjohn observes “A ranger may make 800 shillings a month but a poacher will pay him 10,000 just to turn his back for a day”. The odds seem to be insurmountable as the poachers pile in and the animal death toll rises while the local government decides that it doesn’t really want a wildlife preserve at all.

True Crime (1999 film)
 Steve Everett, an [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] [[Journalism|journalist]] recovering from [[alcoholism]], is assigned to cover the execution of convicted murderer Frank Beechum following the death of Everett's colleague, Michelle Ziegler, who had originally been assigned to the story.  Everett investigates the background to the case and comes to suspect that Beechum has been wrongly convicted of murdering Amy Wilson. He gets permission from his editor's boss to investigate, and is told that the top editor would call the Governor, and that would do the job, if Everett gets hard proof. He thus has a little over 12 hours to confirm his hunch and save Beechum.  Everett interviews a prosecution witness, Dale Porterhouse, who saw Beechum at the store with a gun. Everett questions Porterhouse's account, saying that, because of the layout of the store, he could not have seen a gun in Beechum's hand.  Everett confronts D.A. Cecelia Nussbaum, who reveals that, a young man, Warren, was interviewed and claimed he had stopped at the store to buy a soda and saw nothing. Everett decides that Warren, never called as a witness, is probably the real killer. He breaks into the deceased reporter's house, suspecting that she had been onto something and finds her file on Warren. Meanwhile, Warden Luther Plunkett also starts to have doubts about Beechum's guilt.  Everett falls out with his bosses and is fired on the spot, but he points out that his contract entitles him to adequate notice. They ask him how much notice he requires, and, looking at his watch, he says 6 hours and 7 minutes. He tracks down Angela Russel, Warren's grandmother. She tells him that her grandson could not have been the murderer, and berates him for the lack of interest from the press when Warren himself was killed in a mugging two years after Amy's murder.  The prison chaplain misrepresents an exchange with Beechum as a confession to the crime. Everett hears about this on the radio and loses heart; on top of this, his wife Barbara has found out about his affair with his editor's wife and has turned him out of the house. He is about to start drinking again when he sees a piece on TV that shows a photograph of Amy wearing a locket, a locket he realizes he has seen before, being worn by Angela Russel.  Everett drives back to Angela's house. When he tells her about the locket she realizes the truth: her grandson was the killer. Everett now has to get Angela to the Governor's house in order to persuade him to order a stay of execution. As they approach the Governor's mansion, the first of three drugs used in the execution has already been injected into Frank's bloodstream and he has lost consciousness. The Governor calls, and the doctors try to revive him, while his wife Bonnie bangs on the window calling out for him to wake up.  Six months later, a week before Christmas, Everett is out buying a stuffed hippo for his daughter, and the store's proprietor mentions that he is famous and may even win a Pulitzer. He catches sight of Frank and his family doing their Christmas shopping. Steve and Frank acknowledge each other, but Frank's daughter shouts for him to "come on," which Frank does.

After getting into a scuffle, a British passenger Elliot ([[Jeffrey Nordling]]) - claiming to be an [[MI6]] agent - and an FBI officer tie the Pole down. An aerospace engineer, Martin Messerman ([[Craig Sheffer]]), notices that Elliot had placed the detonator in his pocket. When asked to hand it over, he kills the Pole and the FBI agent. Elliot says to the captain that he's in charge now. After knocking the captain unconscious, he takes control of the plane and the passengers hostage. Martin attempts to warn about the hijack from an airphone but Elliot turns them all off.  Martin, with the help of another passenger Jessica ([[Jennifer Beals]]), goes down to the cargo bay and notifies a fellow Seattle [[air traffic controller]] Robert Sikes ([[Tom Berenger]]) of the hijack via a [[Voice-operated switch|VOR]] system which Elliot doesn't notice. He is notified that the aircraft will be shot down if it flies over a populated area and must drop the toxin over water within seven minutes. He is told that the toxin is in cargo box A45114 but only hears "A45..." before Elliot switches off the VOR. Martin opens the [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] to slow the 747 to make it descend to 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,000 m) to open the cargo door without getting sucked out by the decompression and to get a signal for his cellphone. After reaching his intended altitudes and acquiring a signal, he retracts the spoilers and opens the cargo door. He finds the toxin in cargo box A45114. Elliot comes down and tries to shoot at the duo but can't get a clear shot as the bins are preventing the door from opening completely, expending all of his ammunition in the process. The ground controllers order the aircraft shot down by a missile from the ''USS Bremerton''. Elliot activates the detonator to blow up the toxin but Martin and Jessica manage to drop the toxin out the plane before it detonates over water. They notify Seattle that the toxin has been dropped and the missile from the ''Bremerton'' is redirected away from the 747-200 and self-destructed.  Elliot takes one of the passengers, Wilcox, into the cockpit to accompany him and finds Martin and Jessica hiding in the crew compartment. He is about to shoot Martin but Martin says that he is an aerospace engineer and can land the plane. Martin grabs the control but is ordered by Elliot not to try anything or else he will kill Jessica. Martin broadcasts Elliot's demands: no police, no armed personnel, await further instructions. Martin is forced to make a flyby over Sea-Tac Airport, but objects due to fuel levels. Elliot throws Wilcox he brought upstairs out of the plane and ties Jessica to one of the seats using the handcuffs that were used to tie up the Pole. He lands in the airport control tower and is apparently knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital. Martin manages to land the plane with two engines and stop 300&nbsp;ft from the end of the runway. [[Delta Force]] snipers and police officers surround the aircraft. Elliot, accompanied by Martin, staggers down the airstair and retorts that he's "already halfway home". Martin uses his cellphone to record his conversation to the air traffic controllers and federal agents in the control tower, who hear this via speaker. Martin's son Trevor (Dillion Moen) is seen in terminal with one of Elliot's henchmen wielding a gun. As Martin and Elliot enter an ambulance, Trevor runs out on the tarmac which Elliot's henchman pursuing and being killed by [[Delta Force]] snipers. A fight ensues when Elliot shoots and injures a paramedic but is killed with his wrist-equipped spike when Martin breaks it and stabs Elliot with it, killing him instantly when the ambulance stops. Martin reunites with Trevor and Jessica, after she breaks free of her handcuff. He meets Robert Sikes in person and the three go home while the passengers disembark the 747-200.

Two Women (1999 film)
  The film starts at some fourteen years after Fereshteh ([[Niki Karimi]]) and Royā ([[Merila Zarei|Merilā Zāre'í]]) became friends, while studying [[architecture]] at a university in [[Tehran]]. Fereshteh's husband is in the ICU and she needs Roya's help. The events in the life of Fereshteh over the course of the preceding fourteen years are revealed through a series of flashbacks that represent Feresheh's and Royā's reminiscences.   Fereshteh, whose family lives in reduced circumstances in [[Esfahan]], is an excellent student who brims with hopes and expectations for her future and what she would do for her family on graduating. A voracious reader, she seems to know almost everything and is ready to face any difficulty, she has no interest in marrying just yet but instead wants to build a successful career. Fereshteh supports herself financially through giving private tuitions to fellow students. Royā's family, on the other hand, are wealthy. She becomes one of Fereshteh's private pupils and through this a deep friendship develops between the two.   Fereshteh is stalked by an obsessive young man, named Hassan ([[Mohammad Reza Foroutan|Mohammad-Rezā Foroutan]]), who stops at nothing for gaining her attention and, as he puts it, marrying her. He stirs up many problems, including inflicting serious bodily harm by throwing acid to Fereshteh's cousin on mistaking him as Fereshteh's boyfriend. This prompts Fereshteh's father (Rezā Khāndān) forcing her to return to their home in Esfahan (although Fereshteh lives independently in a university dormitory, she is formally in the care of her uncle, her father's brother, who lives in Tehran); through some inverted logic, the father believes that the actions of the stalker must have been provoked by some impropriety on the part of his daughter.   These events take place at the time when the universities are being closed by the government of [[Iran]] (which in reality took place in the second half of 1979 &mdash; see [[Iranian Cultural Revolution of 1980-1987]]) so that Fereshteh does not see her departure from Tehran as life-changing, but as a temporary event with no consequence for her studies and her future plans. The stalker follows Fereshteh to Esfahan and during a motorcycle-car chase causes a fatal accident involving two children playing [[association football|football]] on street. The ultimately causes the stalker to be sentenced to 13 years in prison - as he's dragged away to prison he vows to kill Fereshteh when he's released.  A man, named Ahmad (Atila Pesiani), who helps Fereshteh and her family with the legal case and fees ensuing this accident, asks Fereshteh's hand and despite Fereshteh's initial fierce opposition to the proposal, by promising to be supportive of Fereshteh's plan to pursue her studies following the opening of universities, succeeds in gaining Fereshteh's consent and the two marry. After the marriage, he proves to be an utterly jealous husband who bars Fereshteh from having any contact with the outside world that he does not approve of, including association with Royā; although he does not know Royā at all, he feels a visceral hatred towards her, believing that she represents the liberal society that he finds so detestable.   When Fereshteh applies to court for divorce, the presiding judge dismisses the case outright, stating that none of the actions of her husband, that suffocate her both emotionally and intellectually, were sufficient for the court to grant divorce. The judge's decision is based on Fereshteh answering a series of questions, such as whether her husband was violent, whether he was unfaithful, whether he had drugs additions, etc., in the negative; in response to Fereshteh's repeated pleas and appeal to her being a human being, the judge retorts not to waste the time of the court. It is remarkable that although one never sees Ahmad beating Fereshteh, in reality he is a violent man, as he constantly verbally abuses Fereshteh and often brandishes a kitchen knife while doing so; this is Milāni's sutbtle way of showing how domestic violence is often not recognized even by its very victims. Fereshteh and her husband have two sons (both in their teens when Fereshteh and Royā meet after fourteen years) who outwardly love both parents equally, but inwardly stand on the side of their mother, who, amongst others, teaches them to the best of her ability.   Fereshteh tries to leave her husband multiple times but events conspire against her and she's unable to do so, until 13 years have passed and the stalker is once again at her doorstep. Finally after yet fight with her controlling husband (he finds out she's been secretly acquiring and reading books, including those about childcare) she runs out of her home, chased by Ahmad. She's able to temporarily make headway, but runs into her old stalker instead. Giving up, she tells the stalker to kill her like he wants to - Ahmad intervenes and is stabbed instead. This is the incident that has landed him in the ICU at the beginning of the movie.  As Fereshtah finishes telling her story to Roya, the phone rings and they are informed of Ahmad's death. Fereshteh is upset yet for the first time in years she sees a hopeful light ahead. She says she didn't want Ahmad to die despite all he did, but now that he is dead she has so much to do - go back to university, earn and be both parents to her sons. With increasing excitement she talks about reading books, learning to drive, learning computers. Finally she asks Roya to help her find books about single mothers raising their children alone.

A young boy named Tsutomu Niiboshi, is failing in school from his obsession to Ultraman Gaia. One day, while watching an ''Ultraman Gaia'' episode, he gets teleported into hyperspace where he sees a girl and behind her a scene of mass destruction. He later sees that same girl, named Lisa Nanase, in his class. Later on, he finds a mysterious glowing ball (Also from the dream) that tells him it can make any wish come true. The one thing Tsutomu wants more than anything else is to meet Gamu Takayama, Ultraman Gaia's human host. After his wish is granted, Gamu actually appears, but a bully takes the ball and makes the second wish; for a monster, Satan-Bizarre, to fight Gamu. After a Gamu transforms into Ultraman Gaia, he finds he is losing power quickly, but manages to defeat the monster regardless. Afterwards, reverting into Gamu, he is chased by kids through the neighborhood until he finally manages to elude them by hiding in a toy shop. Once inside though, Tsutomu and his friends find Gamu and Tsutomu explains to Gamu just how he was brought to their world. Tsutomu tries hiding Gamu in an abandoned hanger, and during this time, Gamu sees that Tsutomu has a present for Lisa, a book called "Gulliver's Travels", which was a favorite of Gamu's as a child. While scanning the ball for the answers, not only do the police find him, but Gamu suddenly finds himself back in his own world, and accidentally takes the book with him. He is soon able to recall the events and checks the data he scanned from the ball, and gets a vision telling him that Tsutomu's world will soon be destroyed.  Unfortunately, during the whole ordeal, Tsutomu loses the ball, and the bully finds the wishing ball and wishes for a giant monster to appear. King of Mons is created and starts destroying their suburban Tokyo neighborhood. Gamu becomes determined to open a gateway between the two universes to stop the monster and save the world Tsutomu lives in. Gamu is soon able to find his way there with the aid of a new mecha, the Aventure, and transforms into Gaia to battle the giant monster. Soon, Gaia is in a deadly battle against the monster. The monster then spawns two more monsters that are equally as strong as the original, one who's specialty is in water and the other who's specialty is sky. Tsutomu, knowing that Gaia is in trouble, tries to wish for help only to be sent flying into the air by one of the monster's stray beams. Just as all seems lost he is rescued by Ultraman Tiga and Ultraman Dyna, who have come via "The Light" into the battle to help Gaia. The three Ultramen battle the monsters. Tiga and Dyna destroy King of Mons' spawns. Gaia manages to oblitirate King of Mons with a highly powerful laser blast and saves the day. Gaia then turns back into Gamu and reveals Lisa's secret to Tsutomu: She is the human-interface of the ball. Even though Lisa will disappear forever, she urges Tsutomu to wish for the ball to vanish forever, repairing all of the damage that had been caused by it to that world. Before returning to his world, Gamu returns Tsutomu's book to him and tells him "Thanks to this book, we were able to meet again."  At the end of the film, Tsutomu relives the day Lisa appeared in his class, but is unable to recall the events of this film. During the credits, though, as he shows Lisa the book, there is an autograph and a message to him from Gamu, as he sees the XIG Fighter EX flying through the air before disappearing.

[[Naanu]] comes to her rescue and it is revealed that Swathi is Naanu's wife.  Rathi meets him in person and confirms the facts. She threatens to kill both the women and commit a suicide if Naanu leaves her for anyone of those two women. He agrees, and Swathi leaves.

He curses himself for pursuing all the three who never gave him any happiness. He realises the importance of "Us" instead of "I" and decides that ego is the root cause of all issues.

Varsity Blues (film)
 Jonathan "Mox" Moxon ([[James Van Der Beek]]) is an intelligent and academically gifted backup [[quarterback]] for the West Canaan High School football team. Despite his relative popularity at school, easy friendships with other players and smart and sassy girlfriend Jules Harbor ([[Amy Smart]]), he is dissatisfied with his life. He wants to leave Texas to go to school at [[Brown University]]. He is constantly at odds with his football-obsessed father, Sam ([[Thomas F. Duffy]]), and dreads playing it under legendary coach Bud Kilmer ([[Jon Voight]]), a verbally abusive, controlling authoritarian who believes in winning at all costs. He has a strong track record as coach: in 30 years of coaching at West Canaan, he has won two state titles and 22 district championships, and only cares about winning his 23rd. His philosophy finally takes its toll on all-state starting quarterback, Lance Harbor ([[Paul Walker]]), Mox's best friend and Jules' brother, who has earned a football scholarship to play for [[Florida State University|Florida State]]. He is manipulated by Kilmer into taking anesthetic shots on an injured knee that finally succumbs to failure and results in even greater injury after getting sacked during a game. He is rushed to the hospital, where doctors are appalled at the massive amount of scar tissue found under his knee and determine that the effects of the injury are permanent and will prevent him from being able to play football for a year and a half, costing him his FSU scholarship.  Mox, who has accompanied Lance to the hospital, is shocked when Kilmer feigns ignorance to Lance's doctors about his knee problems, when in fact Kilmer ordered the trainer to inject the shots. In need of a new quarterback, he reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as [[team captain|captain]] and starting quarterback. The move brings unexpected dividends for him, one of them being Darcy Sears ([[Ali Larter]]), Lance's cheerleader girlfriend, who is interested in marrying a football player in order to escape small-town life. She even goes so far as to attempt to [[seduce]] Mox, sporting a "[[bikini]]" made of [[whipped cream]] over her otherwise naked body, but he rebuffs her as politely as he can and helps to cheer her up by telling her that she can get out of West Canaan on her own without anyone's help.    Disgusted with Kilmer and not feeling a strong need to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer's approval and takes his group of friends and teammates, including Lance, out to a strip club on the night before a game, which they subsequently lose due to poor play from still being hungover. He also chides his father, Sam, screaming at him, "I don't want your life!" Sam had been a football player at West Canaan under Kilmer and although Kilmer dismissed him as having no talent nor courage, he still respected and obeyed him. When Kilmer becomes aware that Mox has earned a full academic scholarship to Brown, he threatens him that if he continues to disobey and disrespect him, he will alter his transcripts in order to reverse the decision on his scholarship.  Kilmer's lack of concern for his players continues, resulting in an emotional breakdown of offensive guard, Billy Bob ([[Ron Lester]]), who had suffered a head injury weeks earlier (Billy Bob had missed a block when he passed out on the field as a result of this injury after Kilmer pressured him out onto the field, which allowed the hit on Lance that crippled his knee, in which Kilmer blames him for). When starting tailback Wendell Brown ([[Eliel Swinton]]), another friend of Mox's, is injured on the field during the final game of the season, Kilmer pressures him during halftime into taking a shot of cortisone, as he had done with Lance, to deaden the pain from his injury and allow him to continue at the risk of permanent injury. Desperate to be recruited by a good college, Wendell agrees. Mox intervenes and threatens Kilmer that he'll quit the team if the needle enters Wendell's knee. Undaunted, Kilmer reminds him about altering his transcripts and orders Charlie Tweeder ([[Scott Caan]]), starting wide receiver and friend of Mox, Lance and Wendell, to replace Mox, but he also quits. Billy Bob also steps in to defend his teammates. Mox tells Kilmer that the only way they will return to the field for the second half is without him. Realizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game, he loses control and physically assaults Mox. The other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field. Knowing his loss of control has cost him his credibility, Kilmer tries in vain to rally support and spark the team's spirit into trusting him, but none of the players follow him out of the locker room. He continues down the hall, and upon seeing that no one following him, turns the other direction and into his office. After an inspiring speech from Mox to rally the team, they take the field under the leadership of Lance, who takes over coaching duties for the second half, and manage to win the game.  In a voice-over [[epilogue]], Mox recounts several characters' aftermaths, including the fact that Kilmer left town and never coached again despite his statue still standing (only because it was too heavy to move). Lance became a successful coach (presumably Head Coach for the Coyotes after Kilmer's departure), Wendell earned a football scholarship to [[Grambling State University|Grambling]], and Mox took his scholarship and would graduate from [[Brown University]], but he never played football again.

The Virgin Suicides (film)
 In the suburb of [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]], during the mid-1970s, a group of neighborhood boys—now grown men—reflect upon their memories of the five Lisbon sisters, ages 13 to 17. Unattainable due to their [[Catholic]] and overprotective parents, math teacher Ronald and his homemaker wife, the girls—Therese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux, and Cecilia—are an enigma that fill the boys' conversations and dreams.  During the summer, the youngest sister, Cecilia, slits her wrist in a bathtub, but survives. After her parents allow her sisters to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make her feel better, she excuses herself and jumps out of her second story bedroom window, dying when she is impaled on an iron fence below. In the wake of her act, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from the community and heightens the air of mystery surrounding the girls, to the neighborhood boys in particular.  At the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine, the school heartthrob. Trip comes over one night to the Lisbon residence in hopes of getting closer to Lux and watches television with the family. Trip persuades Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take Lux to the upcoming Homecoming Dance by promising to provide dates for the other sisters. After winning king and queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch the group and have sex on the football field. Afterwards, Lux falls asleep, and Trip abandons her. At dawn, Lux wakes up alone and has to take a taxi home.  Having broken curfew, Lux and her sisters are punished by a paranoid Mrs. Lisbon by being taken out of school and confined to the house. The sisters contact the boys across the street by using light signals and sharing songs over the phone.  During this time, Lux rebels against her repression and becomes overtly promiscuous, having anonymous sexual encounters on the roof of her house late at night; the neighborhood boys spy from across the street. After weeks of confinement, the sisters leave notes for the boys. The boys call the girls and reach them by phone, and the two groups take turns playing songs over the line. When the boys arrive that night, they find Lux alone in the living room, smoking a cigarette. She invites them inside to wait for her sisters, while she goes to start the car.  Curious, the boys wander into the basement after hearing a noise and discover Bonnie's body hanging from the ceiling rafters. Horrified, they rush back upstairs only to stumble across the body of Mary in the kitchen. The boys realize that the girls had all killed themselves in an apparent [[suicide pact]]: Bonnie hanged herself; Mary died by putting her head in the gas oven; Therese overdosed on sleeping pills; and Lux died of carbon monoxide poisoning after she left the car engine running in the garage.  Devastated by the suicides, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon leave the neighborhood. Mr. Lisbon has a friend clean out the house and sell off the family belongings in a yard sale. Whatever did not sell was put in the trash, including the family photos, which the neighborhood boys collect as mementos. The house is sold to a young couple from the [[Boston]] area. The adults in the community go about their lives as if nothing happened. The men acknowledge that they had loved the girls, and that they will never know why the sisters took their lives.

The next day, Leon tells the men of an armory located nearby. Using handmade spears, the three kill two guards and severely injure one before taking off with their weapons.

Karl then drowns him in a nearby puddle while Senius listens and licks his lips. Then Karl deploys a heavily trained gang of assassins called the ''Black Demons'' to hunt down the remaining traitors and kill them. After briefly confronting the ninjas and killing them, Son, Giang and Leon plan a full-scale attack on the camp at sundown.  After reaching the main gates disguised as Black Demons with a prisoner, the two guards on patrol demand to know why Leon's still alive. Son and Giang then kill them both and advance on the camp. After slitting a soldier's throat, Leon steals his RPG and oversees the fight from on top of a hill and assists the two others in killing off the soldiers. After running low on ammo, Leon joins Son and Giang on the ground below. Leon confronts a soldier wielding a machete and is impaled. With what energy he has left, Leon takes his killer's revolver and shoots him. Leon drops dead. Son hides outside of Senius's tent and slices off his nose with a sword. Senius stumbles back into his tent where an unfinished super soldier asphyxiates him in his open torso and subsequently tears off his head. Senius is finished when his headless body runs outside headless and Giang performs a coup de grâce with an Uzi. Both Son and Giang find Leon's body and, in an act of vengeance, hunt down Karl Sr. and Karl. When they are found trying to escape the disaster, the two Karls are confronted by Son and Giang, who kill their remaining troops. Son and Giang then engage in hand-to-hand combat with Karl Sr. and his son. After Son gets the best of him, Karl Sr. calls upon his bodyguard, a hockey-masked commando with a mechanical arm. After a short scuffle, Son detaches the bodyguard's artificial arm and impales him with it. Giang and Karl continue to fight until Giang back flips over him, rams his fist through Karl's body from behind and places a hand grenade in his mouth.

Wakko's Wish
 In the town of Acme Falls within the kingdom of Warnerstock, all the people (and a Mime) live happily together. However, upon the death of their beloved king, Sir William the Good, Warnerstock enters a state of civil war. Taking advantage of the situation, the neighboring kingdom of Ticktockia, led by King Salazar the Pushy, takes over Warnerstock, and makes all its people poor and miserable due to overtaxing (which, ironically, is a parody of the 1989-1990 merger of [[Time, Inc.]], publishers of the "Time" magazine, and [[Warner Communications]], owners of the [[Warner Bros]] studio, forming the [[Time Warner]] media conglomerate). Three orphans, [[Yakko, Wakko and Dot|Yakko, Wakko, and Dot Warner]], are particularly troubled, as Dot needs an operation. Wakko finds work in another town to pay for it, but Plotz takes his pay – a half penny – from him, lying that it is for taxes.  Wakko, saddened about Dot's illness and finding no other choice, wishes upon a star. A fairy (who calls himself a "desire fulfillment facilitator" or "Pip") falls from the star and explains that Wakko had just chosen the only wishing star in the sky. The star itself [which Rita and Runt witness] falls shortly after in the mountains and the fairy tells Wakko  whoever touches the star first gets one wish. The following morning, the siblings tell the whole town about the star in their excitement, and all rush towards the glow in the mountains. King Salazar finds out about the star, orders Taxman Plotz to stop the Warners from reaching the star alive, and orders his troops to secure it.  Plotz does not stop the Warners from reaching the star at the same time as all the other townsfolk. However, the King's army has already built a military base around the star, and a small ice palace to the side of it, and the townspeople (including Plotz) are all captured and locked up so that the King may have his wish. The Warners hint that the wishing process is not as simple as the king thinks in a desperate bluff. The King captures the Warners and tortures them in outlandish ways (from a terrible singer, a filthy gas station bathroom, and Baloney the Dinosaur (who is a parody of [[Barney & Friends|Barney the Dinosaur]]). The Warners tell the King any wish he makes could have an ironic twist and demonstrate this to his annoyance. He orders the Warners executed, but Dot uses her charms to save them. The Warners escape.  As the King is about to make his wish (for the Warners to leave him alone), the Warners show up, and he tries shooting them himself with a cannon. The cannonball explodes after he dodges it, injuring Dot. Wakko seizes his chance to head to the star, and Yakko drops behind, trying to convince Dot that she can make it. Yakko then tells Dot the story of how Dot was born one last time. Dot appears to die, causing the people of Acme Falls to cry in sorrow, along with some of the royal army, who become furious with King Salazar for his cruel nature. As everyone turns on the King (who seemingly appears a little remorseful), Wakko reaches the star. Dot reveals that she had been acting and was not actually injured/dead; the two were buying time for Wakko. Wakko wishes for two ha'pennies.  Wakko uses the second of these to buy food and "season tickets for [[Los Angeles Lakers|the Lakers]]". The first one pays for Dot's operation, which is revealed to be a plastic surgery to give her a [[beauty mark]]. Wakko's first half penny, however, returns prosperity to the town as the butcher, the baker, and the grocer spend the money they earned, and [[Circular flow of income|the people from whom they make purchases in turn do the same]].  The hospital finds Yakko, Wakko, and Dot's birth certificates, and reveals they are the heirs to the throne. Their parents, seen for the first and only time in a portrait, were the king and queen of Warnerstock. They (literally) boot Salazar out of their palace, and he is attacked by his own dogs. The Warners use their newfound royal authorities to grant the citizens of Acme Falls their wishes - except for the town Mime (who is promptly crushed by a safe and Yakko stating, "I don't know about him, but that sure was my wish!"). Yakko then spins the Wheel of Morality, which specifies the moral of the story is "just cheer up and never ever give up hope".  
Virus (1999 film)
  ''Akademik [[Vladislav Volkov]]'', a [[Russia]]n research vessel in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], communicates with the orbiting space station ''[[Mir]]''. A large energy source traveling through space strikes ''Mir'', killing the [[cosmonaut]]s and beaming itself down to ''Volkov''. The electrical surge takes over the ship and attacks the crew.  Seven days later, the [[tugboat]] ''Sea Star'', captained by alcoholic Robert Everton ([[Donald Sutherland]]), loses its uninsured cargo while sailing through a [[typhoon]]. ''Sea Star'''s crew, led by navigator and ex-[[Navy]] officer Kelly Foster ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) and engineer Steve Baker ([[William Baldwin]]), discover the engine room taking on water. When ''Sea Star'' takes refuge in the eye of the storm to make repairs, ''Volkov'' appears on their radar. Realizing that it could be worth millions in [[marine salvage|salvage]], Everton orders his crew aboard.  On ''Volkov'', most of the electronics have been destroyed and the Russian crew are seemingly missing. Everton orders Steve to help a fellow crewman, Squeaky ([[Julio Oscar Mechoso]]), restore power to the ship. Immediately afterward, the ship's anchor drops on its own, sinking ''Sea Star'' with deckhand Hiko ([[Cliff Curtis]]) and first mate J.W. Woods, Jr. ([[Marshall Bell]]) on board. Steve leaves Squeaky to guard the engine room, where he is lured to his death by a robotic, spider-like creature. Steve rescues an injured Hiko, while Woods comes out unscathed.  As Foster treats Hiko in the sick bay, Chief Science Officer Nadia Vinogradova ([[Joanna Pacuła]])—the sole surviving member of ''Volkov'''s crew—shoots at the crew and is subdued by Steve. Nadia is hysterical about "it" needing power to travel through the ship and implores the crew to shut down the generators. She attacks Everton and Foster, who subdues her and takes her to the bridge. Steve, Woods, and crewman Richie Mason ([[Sherman Augustus]]) go to the engine room to look for Squeaky, but instead stumble upon an automated workshop producing more of the strange robots.   The three are attacked by the robots and what appears to be a gun-wielding Russian crew member. The Russian is revealed to be a [[cyborg]], but the three bring it down with salvaged munitions and take its seemingly dead body to the bridge. Nadia explains that the sentient electrical energy beamed from the ''Mir'' took over the ship eight days prior, scanned the ship's computers to find information on killing humans, then used the automated workshops to convert ''Volkov'''s crew into cyborgs; the one brought to the bridge was the ship's captain and Nadia's husband.  As the storm resumes, the crew head for the computer room. On the way, they are ambushed by a converted Squeaky and a giant robot that kills Woods. The survivors barricade themselves in the communications room, where Richie sends out a [[mayday]]; however, Everton shoots out the radio, unwilling to give up his salvage. Foster punches Everton and removes him from command. Richie uses the computers to talk to the alien; it tells them that it is "aware" and sees mankind as a "virus" which it plans to use as "spare parts." This drives Richie insane, causing him to gun down Squeaky and flee. When the remaining crew leave the room, Everton takes the opportunity to talk to the alien, which recognizes him as the "dominant lifeform."  The crew discovers that the alien has moved ''Volkov'' 's computer elsewhere in the ship. Realizing that the ship is moving, they return to the bridge by going outside, where Hiko is lost to the typhoon. Meanwhile, Everton is guided to one of the workshops, where he makes a bargain with the alien. Foster identifies [[Lord Howe Island]] as ''Volkov'''s destination, with Nadia surmising that the alien wishes to seize a [[United Kingdom|British]] intelligence station from which it could seize control of the world's military forces. As they decide to sink ''Volkov'', the survivors are confronted by the now-cyborg Everton, which they defeat with a [[thermite]] hand grenade. They empty the ship's fuel tanks and set explosive charges.  Foster, Steve and Nadia run into Richie. A giant robot suddenly appears and attacks Nadia, Richie and Steve. The robot captures Foster and tortures her for the location of the detonator. A mortally wounded Richie informs Steve that he prepared a jury-rigged ejection seat that can be used for escape. Nadia and Steve rescue Foster, and Nadia sacrifices herself by shooting a [[flaregun]] at nearby gas tanks to kill the robot. As Foster and Steve make it out safely by using Richie's ejection seat, which triggers an explosion and sinks ''Volkov'', causing the sentient electricity to disperse in the seawater. Foster and Steve are rescued by a U.S. naval ship.

Frustrated at the offenders having escaped justice, Ivan sells his [[dacha]] and buys a silenced [[Dragunov sniper rifle|SVD]] sniper rifle from an illegal weapons trader. A neighbour has left him the keys to her flat directly in front of and overlooking the offenders’ flat, so that he can look after the parrot. From there he begins to administer vigilante justice. Taking care not to kill the offenders, he instead cripples them. First, he shoots Zvorygin's genitals through a bottle of sparkling wine (which diverges from the book, where he shot the student's leg). Secondly, he explodes Chukhanov's [[BMW 5 Series (E34)|car]], which the latter has just bought, by shooting the gas tank: although Chukhanov survives, the lower half of his body is severely burnt.  Vadim's father figures out that Ivan must be behind both accidents, ordering the search of Ivan's house and the second flat. However, police find nothing (Alexei, the local police watcher, had found and hid the rifle in his own house a day before that). Still, the father threatens Ivan, saying that should anything happen to his son, he will face severe consequences. Ivan interrupts him, saying that something has already happened (meaning that Vadim becoming a rapist clearly shows something has happened to him). The father, however, takes his words literally, and rushes home, shooting out the door lock to open it (not knowing paranoid Vadim has barricaded the door). Following the shot, Vadim shoots back through the door with a shotgun, wounding his father and, after days of fright, losing his sanity.  In the epilogue, Ivan finds Katya (not knowing anything of Vadim's fate) back at home, as she recovers completely. Alexei tells Ivan of the hidden rifle and unofficially confiscates it.

Pearl got pregnant at the age of 17 and she feels she missed enjoying her youth. With the absence of Marty, Pearl is attracted to the new "Blouse Man" Walker Jerome ([[Viggo Mortensen]]). Meanwhile, Alison is neglected and she experiences her first [[menstruation|period]], her first date, and her first kiss as she enters a relationship with another boy at the camp, Ross Epstein.  Marty is unable to visit the family because he has to repair more TV sets than usual, due to the impending [[Apollo 11|moon landing]]. While the whole town celebrates the historic moonwalk, Pearl has sex with Walker. Marty's mother Lillian learns of the affair and tries to persuade Pearl to break it off. The affair continues when Marty cannot get up to visit on the weekend because of the traffic jam caused by the [[Woodstock festival]], which is within walking distance of the bungalow colony. Pearl goes to the festival, and unbeknownst to her, Alison goes as well with Ross and her friends despite her mother previously forbidding it. Alison becomes upset after seeing Pearl and Walker carousing while on [[LSD]].  Marty learns of the affair and confronts Pearl while Alison confronts her mother in an emotional scene. Pearl is forced to deal with her love of her family and her conflicting yearning for marital freedom.   Pearl finally makes her decision to stay with Marty and tells Walker she cannot go away with him. Walker says he understands.

Filming through a hole in the wall he witnesses Dad sodomizing Jessie against her will.  Tom walks off and, devastated, throws the camera into the sea.  Tom accuses Jessie of being sick because of her actions with their father.  Jessie lets him burn her breast with a lighter to make him feel better.  Later she takes Tom on a trip to London to see her friend Carol, who attempts to seduce him at Jessie's behest, but stops when she walks in on them.  One night, Tom is woken up by Mum, who tells him that there is a problem with the baby and that they must go to the hospital.  At the hospital, Dad and Jessie go home, leaving Tom with Mum and the baby.  Tom decides to tell Mum what he saw, but becomes scared.  Mum takes Tom to see the baby, who is bleeding.  He tells Mum never to let Dad near the baby, but leaves before she can respond.  When Tom returns home, Dad tells him that Mum called from the hospital and told him what Tom had said to her.  While Dad confronts him, Jessie begins crying.  Dad asks Tom why he would lie to the family, but Tom says he is telling the truth.  Dad demands to know why he said such horrible things about him. Jessie sobs at the table, while Dad shouts at and hits Tom for trying to break up the family.  Dad then leaves.   Tom and Jessie lie next to each other and Jessie thanks him for standing up to Dad.  Tom and Jessie enter Dad's room after he returns.  He continues to deny his behaviour and claims that Tom is making things up because he misses London and is unhappy threatening to send him into care.   While in mid-speech, Tom stabs him in the stomach with a kitchen knife. Dad screams in pain on the floor, Tom and Jessie watch him dying then Tom runs from the house to go to the bunker.  Jessie follows him there to comfort him silently.  Tom asks what they will do now to no response.  He walks over and closes the door to the bunker.

A Wicked Ghost
 Ming, Annie (Ming's girlfriend) and three other friends (Rubbish, Big B, and Biggie) play a game of "contacting ghosts". They mix their blood with water, drink from the mixture, form a circle by holding hands, and inhale fumes from the burning of oil extracted from a dead body. Ming backs out before the game starts. While the others are playing, Ming sees a long-haired female ghost in a blue dress appearing near them, and immediately stops them. The three friends meet their ends not long later: Rubbish dies from a heart attack on the same day, Big B falls to his death from a rooftop, and Biggie strangles her mother to death before committing suicide.  Ming's sister, Cissy, is worried that something will happen to her brother after hearing about the incident. They seek help from Fa-mo, a drama teacher who knows a lot about the supernatural. They attempt to trace the origin of the oil but to no avail because Rubbish, the only person who knows, is already dead. In the meantime, Annie gets possessed by a ghost, who tells Ming that she has only three days to live. Cissy's fiancé, Jack, who is sceptical about the supernatural, encounters a ghostly old man in the toilet. After doing some research, Fa-mo learns that Rubbish and Jack live in the same town, which is situated near a village where a bizarre incident happened nearly 100 years ago: 66 villagers died mysteriously over three days.  Ming and Fa-mo find Lee Keung, a bearded old man who lived in the village in his childhood. He reluctantly tells them the story of Cho Yan-may, a [[Cantonese opera]] singer who treated him like her nephew and gave him a bracelet. Cho's husband framed his wife for adultery so that he could get rid of her and marry another woman. The villagers believed that Cho was guilty so they beat her to death and abandoned her body in the wilderness. Lee approached her dead body, cried and told her the truth about her husband. Cho's hands suddenly sprang up and stretched towards the sky. Over the next three days, Cho's [[vengeful ghost]] caused 66 villagers (including her wicked husband) to die in unnatural ways. On the third day, Lee pleaded with her to spare everyone and attached the bracelet to her wrist. Her arms fell back to the ground and she became peaceful.  Lee then brings Ming and Fa-mo to Cho's burial site to find her remains but the area has been dug up to make way for construction works. On the way back, they drink from a freshwater pool and see Cho's ghost in the water. Ming believes that Cho's remains have been accidentally dumped into the pool. Later, while walking along the streets, Lee hears Cho's voice calling out to him and follows it to an alley, where a metal bar falls on him and kills him. One night, Jack has a terrifying encounter with Cho's ghost at home. In the meantime, the possessed Annie attempts suicide by overdosing on drugs but Ming stops her in time and brings her to hospital.  By then, Fa-mo has figured out that the problem lies with the water from the freshwater pool, which is also the water source for the village. Cho can channel her vengeful aura through water and cause people who drank the water to experience hallucinations and die in unnatural ways. Ming and Fa-mo go to Jack's home and see him, in a trance, trying to force Cissy to drink a glass of the "polluted" water. After knocking him unconscious, they tie up him and Cissy to prevent them from hurting themselves or each other before returning to the pool. Ming dives in, finds the bracelet, and dives in again to search for Cho's remains. On the second dive, he passes through a supernatural portal and finds himself in the wilderness beside Cho's dead body. After seeing his [[doppelgänger]] among a procession of ghostly figures, he tries to attach the bracelet to Cho's wrist but her outstretched hands strangle him to death before he could do so.  Upon seeing Ming's dead body surfacing, Fa-mo rushes back to Jack's home and drinks the "polluted" water so that he can see Cho's ghost and confront her. When he hugs Cissy, whom he has a crush on, she transforms into Cho. He realises that this is an illusion so he embraces her even more tightly. Thinking that they truly love each other, Cho's ghost spares them and disappears. Jack regains consciousness and becomes unhappy when he sees Fa-mo embracing his fiancée. Cho's ghost suddenly appears beside him and he screams. The end credits start rolling against a background of a ghostly hand emerging from the water surface.

Wild Wild West
 In 1869, 4 years after the end of the [[American Civil War]], U.S. Army Captain James West ([[Will Smith]]) and U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon ([[Kevin Kline]]) hunt for Confederate General "Bloodbath" McGrath ([[Ted Levine]]), who is wanted for mass murder, throughout the Southern United States. This is due to McGrath ordering a massacre in a settlement called New Liberty, where many of the freed slaves were murdered, including West's biological parents. The search leads to a brothel where the two try (unsuccessfully) to arrest him. It leads to a huge brawl and a cart of nitroglycerin crashing into the building, starting a fire. Both West and Gordon—Gordon dressed as a woman—escape. Later, in Washington, D.C., West and Gordon meet at the [[White House]] with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ([[Kevin Kline]]), who tells them about the disappearance of America's key scientists and a treasonous plot by General "Bloodbath" McGrath. Grant charges the two with finding the scientists before he inaugurates the [[first transcontinental railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah]].  On board their train, Gordon examines the head of a murdered scientist, using a projection device to reveal the last thing the scientist saw. Finding McGrath and a clue in the image, they head to New Orleans, pursuing a lead about Dr. Arliss Loveless ([[Kenneth Branagh]]), an ex-Confederate scientist in a steam-powered wheelchair, who is hosting a party for the elite of Southern society. West mistakes a female guest for a disguised Gordon and makes an error that results in the guests wanting to lynch West. Meanwhile, Gordon roams the mansion and comes across a caged Rita Escobar ([[Salma Hayek]]), rescuing her. Gordon frees West from the lynching with an elastic rope, and the three escape to their train ''The Wanderer.'' On board, Rita asks for their help in rescuing her father, one of the kidnapped scientists, Professor Escobar.  Later, Loveless hosts a reception to demonstrate his newest weapon: a steam-powered tank. The tank uses General McGrath's soldiers as target practice, which angers McGrath. When McGrath demands an explanation, Loveless accuses him of "betrayal" for surrendering at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], then shoots McGrath and leaves him for dead. As Loveless and his troops head over to Utah, Gordon, West and Rita find the dying McGrath, who reveals that he was framed by Loveless for the massacre of New Liberty, explaining that Loveless used the tank to kill the people there. The three then pursue Loveless on ''The Wanderer'', but having expected their arrival and using steam-powered hydraulics, Loveless maneuvers his train behind ''The Wanderer''. West manages to disable Loveless's train, but not before Loveless uses a cannon-launched grappling hook to stop ''The Wanderer''. Rita, afraid of being recaptured by Loveless, grabs one of Gordon's explosive rigged pool balls and accidentally releases sleeping gas that knocks out West, Gordon, and herself.  West and Gordon wake up as Loveless and his posse pull away in ''The Wanderer'' taking Rita hostage, announcing that he intends to capture President Grant at the "[[golden spike]]" ceremony and also that West and Gordon will be killed should they step outside of the trap they are in. Escaping the trap, the two stumble across Loveless's private rail line, which leads them to his industrial complex, hidden in Spider Canyon. Here, they witness Loveless's ultimate weapon: a gigantic mechanical spider armed with two nitroglycerin cannons. Loveless uses the spider to capture President Grant and Gordon at the ceremony at Promontory Point, while West is seemingly shot by one of Loveless's bodyguards.  At his industrial complex, Loveless reveals his plan: to destroy the United States with his mechanized forces unless President Grant agrees to divide the states among Great Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, the Native American people, and himself. When Grant refuses to surrender, Loveless orders Gordon to be shot. However, West, who had survived thanks to a [[chain mail]] vest Gordon gave him, disguises himself and manages to distract Loveless, allowing Gordon to free the captives. Unfortunately, Loveless escapes on his spider in the ensuing battle, taking the President with him.  To save the President, Gordon and West build a flying machine to overtake the spider as Loveless attacks a small town in an attempt to force Grant to sign the surrender. Gordon and West crash onto the spider, but manage to grab on the beam before they can fall and Munitia, one of Loveless's henchwomen, falls to her death after the collision. After West defeats the henchmen below, throwing one off the spider after tying him to a chain, a fight ensues between him and Loveless, now on mechanical legs. Gordon shoots a hole in Loveless's hydraulic line, allowing West to gain the upper hand. This allows Gordon and Grant to defeat Loveless's guards, and pleading for his life, Loveless drags himself back to his wheelchair as the spider approaches a cliff. Loveless attempts to shoot West with a concealed gun, but hits the spider's steam pipes, stopping it just before it plunges into the canyon. The abrupt stop leaves West and Loveless hanging precariously from the spider. Loveless tries to decide whether he should pull the chair's lever that will release them or not, knowing it will send both him and West to their deaths if he does so. Loveless taunts West so much that West pulls the lever himself and survives by grabbing the ankles of the henchman he threw out earlier, while Loveless falls to his death.  Grant promotes Gordon and West as Agent #1 and Agent #2 of his new [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]]. Gordon asks which of them is 1 and 2, but the President brushes off the question as unimportant and tells them they will have plenty of time to talk about it on the way back, as he takes "The Wanderer".  Gordon and West meet Rita again, both planning to court her, but she crushes their hopes, announcing that Professor Escobar is actually her husband.  Gordon and West ride through the desert together. Gordon asks West "Mind if I ask you a question?" West replies "Actually, I do, Artie." The camera pans out to show they are actually riding the mechanical spider.  
Wing Commander (film)
 It is the year 2654 and an interstellar war is raging between the [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]] and the Kilrathi Empire, whose people, the cat-like [[Kilrathi]], seek the complete eradication of the human race. Lieutenants Christopher Blair ([[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]) and Todd Marshall ([[Matthew Lillard]]) are pilots fresh out of training and traveling aboard the small supply ship ''Diligent'', commanded by Captain James Taggart ([[Tchéky Karyo]]), to their new posting aboard the carrier TCS ''Tiger Claw'' in the Vega Sector. En route, the ship gets pulled into a gravity well and loses their navigation computer. While Taggart repairs it, Blair is able to space-jump them to safety, calculating the jump in under ten seconds, a notable feat as Taggart notes the computer couldn't have done it that fast.  While this is happening, a massive Kilrathi armada attacks Pegasus Station, a remote but vital Confederation base and captures a navigation computer, through which it will be able to locate Earth. Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) directs Blair, whose father he knew from a previous conflict of the Confederation known as the Pilgrim Wars, to carry orders to the ''Tiger Claw'', under the command of Captain Jason Sansky ([[David Suchet]]), to fight a suicidal delaying action to let the rest of the Terran fleet reach Earth since it is two hours behind the Kilrathi. Along with the awkwardness of joining a new unit, and continual pranks that require discipline from his wing commander Lieutenant Commander Jeanette Deveraux ([[Saffron Burrows]]), Blair fights the distrust of Commander Paul Gerald ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]) and his crewmate Lt. Hunter ([[Richard Dillane]]) because of the drastic orders he brings from the Admiral, and because his mother was a "Pilgrim", a strain of humans who were the cause of the Pilgrim Wars. Pilgrims were the first human explorers and colonists and had developed the innate ability to navigate space by feel despite obstacles such as black holes. Marshall finds a kindred spirit in Lieutenant Rosie Forbes ([[Ginny Holder]]) and falls in love with her, but she dies when her fighter is damaged after a battle with an advance group of Kilrathi vessels and crashes on the flight deck during landing as the result of friendly competition with Marshall. The incident enrages Deveraux and shakes Marshall's confidence.  Despite several setbacks, the ''Tiger Claw'''s personnel successfully attack and board a Kilrathi communications ship with the ''Diligent''. In the attack, they also find the stolen navigation computer and learn the coordinates the Kilrathi fleet will use to approach Earth.  The ''Tiger Claw'', however, is heavily damaged and can do nothing more to prevent the assault, except to send Deveraux and Blair in fighters to find their way back to Earth. While it would normally be impossible for fighters to make such a jump without a navigation computer, Blair's Pilgrim heritage can afford him the ability to calculate such a jump himself. If alerted to the Kilrathi's plans, Earth forces can destroy each Kilrathi ship before it can get its bearings after the space-jump; if not, Earth's defenses will surely be overwhelmed. Before Blair leaves, Taggart, who is in reality a Naval Intelligence officer, reveals himself to be a Pilgrim as well, shocking Blair.  Deveraux's fighter is disabled in combat after destroying a missile, but she convinces Blair to continue his mission despite his objections. Blair uses his Pilgrim ability to make the jump to the vicinity of Earth. As his fighter begins to run out of fuel, he transmits the information Earth needs to defeat the Kilrathi assault. He is followed by the Kilrathi command ship, endangering the plan by impossible odds, but as it turns out, his position allows him to bait the Kilrathi into the gravity well he encountered at the start of the movie. Pulling his fighter away at the last minute, the command ship is pulled in due to its larger mass. Unprepared, the Kilrathi fleet is destroyed by the Earth fleet without being able to put up a fight. A search and rescue team from the Earth fleet rescues Blair while Taggart rescues Devearux in the ''Diligent''. Blair and Deveraux are reunited on the ''Tiger Claw'' and share a kiss as Deveraux is taken to get medical attention.  
The Wind Will Carry Us

The Winslow Boy (1999 film)
 It is Christmas 1911 and Arthur Winslow, a London banker, is making final preparations for a dinner to seal the engagement between his daughter Catherine, an outspoken supporter of the cause of women's suffrage, and Captain John Watherstone. The family and guests are toasting the upcoming marriage when Arthur discovers that his youngest son Ronnie, a 13-year-old [[cadet]] at the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], is unexpectedly home. Ronnie has been accused of the theft of a postal order. An internal enquiry, conducted without notice to his family and without benefit of representation, finds him guilty and Mr. Winslow is "requested to withdraw" his son from the college (the formula of the day for expulsion). Ronnie proclaims his innocence and his father believes him—enough so that he demands an apology from the College. When the college refuses to reinstate Ronnie, Arthur decides to take the matter to court. With the help of his daughter and Desmond Curry, a [[solicitor]] and friend of the family, Mr. Winslow decides to hire the most highly sought after [[barrister]] in England at the time, Sir Robert Morton, known also to be a shrewd opposition [[Member of Parliament]].   The government is unwilling to allow the case to proceed. The Naval College is a representative of the Admiralty and the Crown, and as such British law presumes they are infallible and above question; their judgment can be legally questioned only with the permission of the Attorney General. However, after heated debates in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], the government yields, and the case does come to court.  Catherine had expected Sir Robert to decline the case, or at best to treat it as a political tool; instead, he is coolly matter-of-fact about having been persuaded of Ronnie's innocence by his responses to questioning (in fact, a form of cross-examination, to see how young Ronnie would hold up in court) in the presence of his family. Catherine, a left-wing suffragette, is not enthusiastic about Morton, whom she considers cold and heartless. Catherine is also disturbed by Sir Robert's establishment views: he is a conservative opponent of women’s suffrage. "He always speaks out against what is right," she observes to her father, though she admires his legal skills. Morton, for his part, obviously is quite taken with Catherine from the moment he meets her in his offices; later he stares at her as she arrives at the House of Commons and as she watches the proceedings from the ladies' gallery.  In the meantime, the case creates media hysteria and puts a heavy toll on the Winslow family – their funds are rapidly depleted in order to cover legal expenses. Mr. Winslow's physical health deteriorates under the strain and the happiness of the Winslows' home is destroyed. Arthur's wife, Grace, begins to wonder if the real issue is justice or a father's stubborn and foolish pride. Forced to make economical sacrifices, Grace  Winslow is unwilling to take the drastic measure of dismissing Violet, who has been the family’s maid for over twenty years. The eldest son, Dickie Winslow, has to leave Oxford due to the lack of money destroying his chance at a career in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]]. Instead, he is compelled to find employment in his father’s bank. Catherine's marriage settlement is also gone. Her fiancé John Watherstone breaks off the engagement in the face of opposition from his father (an Army Colonel), forcing her to consider a sincere and well-intentioned offer of marriage from Desmond, whom she does not love. Sir Robert has also declined appointment as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], rather than drop the case. The least affected is Ronnie, who happily has been transferred to a new school.  At trial, Sir Robert (working together with Desmond Curry and his firm) is able to discredit much of the supposed evidence.  The Admiralty, certainly embarrassed and presumably no longer confident of Ronnie's guilt, abruptly withdraws all charges against him, proclaiming the boy entirely innocent.  When their resounding victory arrives, not a single member of the  Winslow’s family is present at court. It is Violet, the maid, who tells Mr. Winslow and Catherine what has happened at court.

Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies
  During an attempted robbery of a museum, the [[fire opal]] that contains the Djinn is accidentally released by a stray gunshot. One of the burglars, a beautiful young woman named Morgana Truscott (Holly Fields), steals the gem and is forced to abandon her partner during the escape. The Djinn escapes and kills the remaining burglar when he accidentally wishes he'd never been born. As the police enter the museum, the Djinn finishes forming into full size, revealing the Djinn (Andrew Divoff). The Djinn surrenders to the police and is led away.  That evening, Morgana is shown sleeping very restlessly, her left arm dangling over the edge of the bed. In the meantime, Demarest is in a holding cell waiting to be transferred to prison, where he kills a fellow prisoner who wishes to get out the cell. In her dreams, she sees glimpses of the Djinn in his true form. The next day, Morgana goes to Church to visit the priest tending the church, a man named Gregory (Paul Johannson) - a former lover of Morgana's before he found God and joined the priesthood.  In prison, Demarest continues to kill prisoners and other personnel through purposely misconstrued wishes, and is confronted by Butz (Rhino Michaels) and his two henchmen, the Tiger brothers (James Kim and Simon Kim). Butz runs all "underground business" at the prison and gives Demarest a "friendly" warning that he is going to be watching him. Eventually they meet again with Butz wanting to join forces with him, but Demarest rejects. Soon after, he asked for drugs that can waste him dead, in which was then granted, with Demarest controlling the Tiger Brothers to beat him to death without him taking any self-defense towards them, similar to how powerful drugs controls someone, and soon Demarest was temporary sent to solitary for being a Suspect.  Morgana is up at dawn, screaming out to her unseen tormentor, demanding to know who he is. She goes to her computer and does an internet search on Persian Mythology. A voice-over from Morgana recites the contents of a web site she is reading on the Persian deity Ahura Mazda. He was known as a deity of both light and dark, symbolizing the duality of good and evil. He was also known as the keeper of the Stone of the Sacred Fire. Gregory arrives at her loft, he says that Father Dimitri from the church noted that she had passed by, and she seemed unwell. Morgana opens up just a little, telling Gregory she hasn't been sleeping well, and experiencing confusing nightmares about a voice telling her to "fulfill the prophecy" and confesses to the robbery and the murder of the guard.  Morgana goes to the prison to visit Demarest. She demands to know why he confessed to the robbery, and he says it was so she wouldn't have to, and admits to not having to be in prison long, before showing his true form, driving Morgana away. Morgana is at home, doing more research on the internet on Persian mythos. She finds references to the Djinn, a powerful being that laid waste to the Persian court before the King's alchemist created the Stone of the Sacred Fire and imprisoned the Djinn inside it. The Persian deity Ahura Mazda was enlisted to keep the Djinn imprisoned in the "space between worlds" so that he cannot escape and bring about worldwide apocalypse. Morgana is startled as her window is abruptly blown open by a sharp gust of wind, papers flying everywhere.  Morgana goes to see Gregory the next day to tell him about her findings. Gregory rides to the prison with Morgana and confronts Demarest, demanding he leave Morgana alone. Demarest knows exactly who Gregory is, and about his past relationship with Morgana. He even perfectly duplicates Morgana's voice, speaking seductively to Gregory.  Later that evening, Morgana, alone in her loft, begins undergoing a number of rituals aimed at purifying her soul, as only someone pure of heart can banish the Djinn back into his prison.  Back at the prison, Demarest kills the prison warden who wishes to "Slow dance with him", and escapes the prison when one of the prisoners, a Russian inmate he befriended named Osip (Oleg Vidov), wishes to be released.  Osip brings Demarest to Pushkin, a Russian-American Mob boss whose Osip despises, and tells him that Demarest is a Wishmaster who can give Pushkin anything he wants. But Pushkin brushes them off, saying he already has great wealth and power, and he doesn't need or desire fame. As he is leaving, Demarest asks if Pushkin has any enemies he would like to see eliminated, and Osip quickly pounces. Pushkin's greatest enemy is a rival crime boss named Moustafa. The mere mention of Moustafa's name sends Pushkin into a rage. Demarest assures Pushkin that he can do what Pushkin himself might not be able to, like take care of Moustafa. Carelessly, fueled by his anger, Pushkin wishes to have Moustafa's head, in which unexpectedly he gotten his appearance which shows that Pushkin no longer exists, and soon Osip took the replacement as the ruler of his criminal empire.   Just then, Morgana rushes into the club room, shooting Demarest twice in the chest with her gun. Both she and Osip freeze in horror as the attack only causes the Djinn to assume his true form. He laughs at Morgana's foolishly thinking she could kill him.  Gregory finds Morgana praying feverishly at the church altar, and sobbing inconsolably. She confesses to Gregory that she tried to kill Demarest and then saw the Djinn's true face. She laments that her guilt, the blood of the innocent man she killed at the art gallery heist, can never be washed away, and so she can never hope to fight the Djinn. Gregory patiently counsels her, promising that God can cleanse any and all burden she carries if only she allows Him to, and that while the Djinn might be too powerful for them to fight, God can win the battle using them as His instruments. During this, they find Morgana is invulnerable when she attempts suicide so the Djinn can not grant her the three necessary wishes.  Morgana and Gregory are preparing for the trip in pursuit of the Djinn. Gregory has compiled more notes, including the incantation used by the alchemist who imprisoned the Djinn; "As was prophesied, the alchemist took the stone into his hand as a woman pure of heart takes the light of God unto her soul, and spoke the words, Nib Sugaroth Baheim". Morgana points out that unlike the two of them, the alchemist knew what he was doing. But as Gregory points out, these notes are the only solid plan they have on how to defeat the Djinn. Morgana begins to kiss Gregory, and despite his initial reticence, she makes love to him. In Vegas, the Djinn begins granting wishes to the casino patrons in order to collect the remaining required souls.  As Morgana and Gregory ride a cab through Las Vegas to the casino Demarest is operating out of, the Djinn stands in his office in his true form. Holding up the fire opal, he intones a deep growl and calls in all the debts owed him—he claims the souls everyone gave up through their wishes.  Noting that Demarest has left the fire opal on his desk, Gregory quietly inches toward it while Demarest is speaking to Morgana. Rushing forward, he grabs it and recites the incantation used by the alchemist. Demarest merely smiles again, noting the two of them have studied the legends well, before gesturing, and the fire opal vanishes from Gregory's hand into Demarest's. He warns them about playing with forces they don't understand. Gregory wishes for the Djinn to be sent back to hell. The Djinn grants his wish- with the caveat that they come along with him, and they're transported inside the fire opal where Gregory is tortured upon the cross like Jesus. Gregory is killed after she wishes for him to be released.  She screams in grief at the Djinn, angrily wishing for a world free of evil. But the Djinn reminds her that evil is but half of a perfect sphere—without it, good cannot exist. He warns her that he is losing his patience with her. Morgana tries desperately to resist the Djinn's will.  Morgana's fears suddenly quiet and she asks the Djinn the meaning of fulfilling the prophecy. She reminds him that he himself told her that she would know when the time was right. The Djinn impatiently recites the prophecy to her, that the one who wakes the Djinn shall have three wishes; upon the granting of all three, the race of Djinn will reign over the Earth. Due to a slip of the tongue, Morgana realizes the meaning of the prophecy, and wishes for the guard she killed to be alive again.  After receiving a vision of the guard alive and well, she takes the Djinn's fire opal and intones the alchemist's chant, "Nib Sugaroth Baheim". The Djinn is again banished and all the victims returned to life.

The World Is Not Enough
  [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] arrives at a [[Swiss bank]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]] to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of [[M (James Bond)|M]]. Bond tells the banker that King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it, and wants to know who killed him. The banker is killed by [[Giulietta da Vinci (Cigar Girl)|his assistant]] before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes from the banker's office with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped; Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside [[MI6]] headquarters back in [[London]]. Bond gives chase to the assistant/assassin on a Q-modified speedboat on the [[River Thames|Thames]] to the [[Millennium Dome]], where she attempts to escape via [[hot air balloon]]. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses and blows up the balloon, killing herself.  Although injured falling from the balloon, Bond is cleared by the MI6 doctor, and traces the recovered money to Viktor "Renard" Zokas, a [[KGB]] agent-turned-[[terrorist]]. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain until he dies. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter Elektra against Renard, who had previously abducted her. Bond flies to [[Azerbaijan]], where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, [[paragliding|paraglider]]-equipped [[snowmobile]]s. Despite being unarmed, Bond is able to dispatch the snowmobiles by using the terrain to his advantage.   Bond visits [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]] at a [[casino]] to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he deduces that Elektra's head of security, [[List of James Bond henchmen in The World Is Not Enough#Sasha Davidov|Davidov]], is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] base in [[Kazakhstan]]. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the [[GPS]] locator card and weapons-grade [[plutonium]] from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.  Back in Azerbaijan, Bond discloses to M that [[Stockholm syndrome|Elektra may not be as innocent]] as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an [[Pipeline inspection gauge|inspection rig]] heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the [[Maiden's Tower]].  Bond accosts Zukovsky at his [[caviar]] factory in the [[Caspian Sea]], which is then attacked by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a [[submarine]], currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to [[Istanbul]], where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting [[nuclear explosion]] would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the [[Bosphorus]]. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, [[List of James Bond henchmen in The World Is Not Enough#Bullion|Bullion]] blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a [[garrote]]. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his [[cane gun]] as his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.  Bond dives after the submarine, boards it, and frees Jones. Following a fight, the submarine hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and kills him after a lengthy fight in the submarine's reactor room. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine via the torpedo launcher, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater.

Women Talking Dirty
  The story begins with Cora ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]) and Ellen ([[Gina McKee]]), two women in their thirties who are living in [[Edinburgh]]. While they are getting ready at a mirror they begin to discuss life and romance. The story then catapults itself into the past before the two women met and where their story really begins.  Quirky Cora is an aspiring biochemist with intention to go to university but ends up taking a jump towards late teenage rebellion in which she tries drugs and drinks excessively.  After moving in with her boyfriend, Cora discovers she's pregnant and immediately all her dreams are shattered as she becomes a pregnant housewife who is eventually dumped by her passionate but slovenly boyfriend.  Ellen on the other hand is strait-laced and level-headed; a budding cartoonist with prospects to run her own business alongside her colleague Stanley ([[James Nesbitt]]). While out for a drink at her local pub, womanizing Daniel ([[James Purefoy]]), makes a pass at her and she is instantly smitten. Ellen invites Daniel to meet her very prim and proper mother who is instantly reviled by Daniel's revelation that he is writing a dissertation on the post-coital discussions women have with men after sleeping with them. Despite her mother's attempt to talk Ellen into dumping Daniel, Ellen decides to accept Daniel's marriage proposal and soon weds him, delighted with his wedding gift of a purple velvet Victorian style couch.  Not long into their marriage Ellen's hopes of having a family are forced out of the picture when Daniel reveals he doesn't want children. Despite being married, Daniel is still womanizing and gambling excessively (even stealing money from Ellen's purse). After a confrontation with Daniel after she discovers he has been cheating on her, Ellen walks out and goes to the pub to think things over. There she meets a heavily pregnant Cora. Despite their obvious differences, they immediately become friends and Ellen even becomes Cora's coach as she goes into hospital to give birth to her son Sam.  A year and a half later, Cora is given a night of freedom from her children when her parents offer to babysit. She goes to the pub and calls Ellen, hoping to convince her friend to join her. Daniel, however, picks up the phone, as Ellen is out. Daniel shows up at the pub where he deliberately and successfully seduces Cora, fully aware that she doesn't know what he looks like. After the one-night stand, Cora is horrified when Daniel turns up at the café where she works and kisses Ellen in front of her. Even more horrifying is the realization she has become pregnant once again, this time with her best-friend's husband. Although Cora decides to keep the child, Daniel decides he wants nothing to do with her, and refuses to even pay maintenance, leaving Cora once again a single mother with no additional income.  Years pass, and Ellen and Daniel are going through a rather messy divorce which is left slightly easier by the fact he has taken off to Barbados. Regardless of the hurt he has caused her, Ellen is still undeniably in love with him and still fully unaware that her best friend's youngest son Col is the son of her husband. Cora, on the other hand, is struggling with life still, and is still depressed over the horrible guilt she feels. She has never been able to reveal to her friend the truth of her son's paternity. After Daniel's return, Cora realises that she is running out of time to tell Ellen the truth, and all of her friends and neighbours who know her secret urge her to be honest.  While throwing a dinner party at her loft home, Ellen, Cora and some close neighbours become blindingly drunk, and Cora finally confesses the truth at the dinner table. Humiliated, Ellen throws everyone out including Cora, and locks herself in her flat for days, becoming horribly depressed over the fact Cora had the son with Daniel that Ellen had always wanted. Daniel returns to Ellen following the dinner party and finds immediately that he is unwelcome and Ellen doesn't want anything to do with him anymore. In the meantime, Cora develops a relationship with Ellen's co-worker, Stanley, and, after a near-death experience, begins to feel more confident within herself and about what she wants from life. Finally she works up the courage to go to Ellen and apologise.  Regardless of their row, the two women manage to come to a mutual understanding just as Daniel bursts into the flat with a friend to remove the velvet couch he had given Ellen as a wedding present. An argument between the women and Daniel ensues, resulting in Ellen forfeiting the couch and throwing Daniel and his friend out. Immediately afterwards, Ellen retrieves a bag from a cupboard that contains £25,000 that Daniel had won from gambling and stashed in the flat. Ellen splits the money, giving £13,000 of it to Cora to pay the maintenance Daniel had never paid for Col, and taking the remaining money to the book-keepers where she bets the lot on a no-chance horse. Seconds after leaving the book-keepers, Daniel confronts her, having realised his mistake and demanding his money back. Ellen hands him the betting slip and walks away with Cora, having finally gotten her revenge on him.

Although he is faced with several corrupt business owners who frequently attempt to thwart his efforts, Tilghman quickly wins over the more intimidated or skeptical townsfolk with his honesty, wit and fair dealing.

Before long, Cromwell becomes a quiet and genteel town.  The new order does not sit well with Lynn, who dismisses Tilghman as a relic whose time has long passed. Having previously murdered three other men in cold blood, Lynn sets his sights on Tilghman.

Zeus and Roxanne
 One morning, a dog named Zeus goes to the pier, spots a dolphin, and becomes fascinated by its movements. Afterwards, he returns home to his owner, Terry Barnett, an aspiring musician, and his son, Jordan, who appears to be taking care of him. Later that morning, Zeus chases a cat and subsequently destroys the outdoor garden of Mary Beth Dunhill, a marine biologist and the Barnetts' next-door neighbor. Terry calms Zeus down and apologizes to Mary Beth, although she is agitated by him.  Mary Beth later goes to her workplace and is followed by Zeus, who notices her photo of the same dolphin from earlier. Upon arriving, she is met by her research partner, Becky, and her rival, Claude Carver. Mary Beth and Becky travel out to the ocean on a boat to follow the dolphin they are researching, whom they name Roxanne, and Zeus stows away with them. However, while in the middle of the ocean, he slips off. Roxanne saves him from a shark and gives him a ride back to the boat on her back, which surprises and fascinates Mary Beth and Becky, who find that Zeus and Roxanne can do "inter-species communication". While stopping over on the way home with Zeus, Mary Beth spots her two impossible daughters, Judith and Nora, skating against her wishes. Arriving home, she asks Jordan if she could borrow Zeus for her research on Roxanne, who she hopes to release back into the wild. Jordan agrees, and he and Terry accompany her on her research.  During the following days, Terry begins to fall in love with Mary Beth as he manages to find inspiration for his music, while Jordan bonds with Judith and Nora. After Terry saves Judith and Nora while they are skating in a factory, Mary Beth asks him out on a date. After spending the night at a local beachside resort, they awkwardly kiss. Meanwhile, Claude, wanting research grant money to come to his research and not Mary Beth's, tries to steal hers, but winds up getting comically thwarted by Zeus. Then, he tries gaining the lead in her interspecies communication study, although his attempts to have one of his research dolphins bond with another animal fail one after another.  Through the conniving of Jordan, Judith, and Nora, Terry decides to move into Mary Beth's house with Jordan and Zeus, but after seeing a photo of his late wife, he decides to pursue his original plan of traveling to another town to continue writing his music. This causes both Zeus and Roxanne distress. While staying at a hotel with his owners, Zeus runs away back to Mary Beth's research center. Noticing his disappearance and realizing where he was going, Terry and Jordan return to town, while Mary Beth uses a [[submersible]] to go down and investigate the seabed after Claude claims Roxanne was caught in an illegal fishing net and killed.

However, Zeus and Roxanne work together to trap him and his assistant in a net, where they are arrested by police.  While exploring the seabed, Mary Beth's submersible's propeller is tangled in the fishing nets, and when she opens the main hatch thinking she'd escape through it, water begins flooding the interior. Roxanne leads Terry to Mary Beth, and he manages to free her from the trapped submersible. Afterwards, Jordan, Judith, and Nora convince him to marry her. During the wedding, she is given a grant for her research on Zeus and Roxanne. Immediately afterwards, a pod of dolphins appears, and Zeus convinces Roxanne to join them.
