15 Minutes
 Ex-convicts Emil Slovak ([[Karel Roden]]) and Oleg Razgul ([[Oleg Taktarov]]) arrive in the United States to claim their part of a bank heist in [[Russia]] (or in the [[Czech Republic]]). Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. At the rundown apartment of their old partner, they are denied their share, so Emil fatally stabs him and his wife as Oleg tapes it with the camera. [[Czech American|Czech immigrant]] Daphne Handlova ([[Vera Farmiga]]) witnesses the murders from the bathroom, then escapes before they can kill her as well. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment.  Jordy Warsaw ([[Edward Burns]]) is an arson investigator assigned to the case. Eddie Flemming ([[Robert De Niro]]) is a flamboyant New York City detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity that he is followed around by a reporter from a tabloid TV show, ''Top Story'', hosted by the arrogant Robert Hawkins ([[Kelsey Grammer]]). Everywhere he goes, citizens cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw agree to work the case together. While checking out the crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention, but she disappears.  Emil calls an [[escort service]] and asks for a "Czech girl." One calling herself Honey (Noelle Evans) arrives, whom he kills but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. He continually films everything, claiming he wants to be the next [[Frank Capra]].  Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder, visiting the escort service. Rose Hearn ([[Charlize Theron]]), who runs it, tells them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for her but rather a hairdresser. She mentions a couple of other guys having just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep quiet. Flemming notices someone filming them from across the street. A foot chase begins, Flemming's regular partner Leon Jackson ([[Avery Brooks]]) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen. Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address. He is jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can get away with anything.  On the night Flemming is to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas ([[Melina Kanakaredes]]), Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and bind Flemming to a chair. While Oleg is recording, Emil explains his plan to Flemming: He will kill him and sell the tape to ''Top Story''. After being committed to an [[insane asylum]], he will declare that he is actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting royalties from his books and movies. Fleming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming with a pillow.  The entire city is in mourning. Emil calls Hawkins to offer a tape of the killing that he is willing to sell to ''Top Story''. Hawkins pays him $1 million for it. Warsaw and the entire police force are furious, unable to believe that the TV show would air it, especially since Hawkins's main reporter is Nicolette.  Emil and Oleg sit in a [[Planet Hollywood]] to watch the show in public. Halfway through the broadcast, customers realize that Emil and Oleg are right there with them and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escapes. Instead of delivering his suspect to the police station, Warsaw takes Emil to an abandoned warehouse to kill him. Other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody. Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity. His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story. Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving.  While the lawyer is leading Emil away, surrounded by the media, Warsaw provokes an argument, with the ''Top Story'' crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time. Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Emil grabs a policeman's gun, shoots Oleg and grabs Nicolette, who is covering the story, threatening to shoot her. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest to avenge Flemming's murder.  An officer observes that Oleg is still alive. Hawkins rushes to his side, where Oleg says a final few words about the movie that is still being taped,  just before he dies. Hawkins attempts to get a comment from Warsaw, who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval.  
12B
 The film begins with a young man named Shakthi ([[Shaam (actor)|Shaam]]) leaving his house one morning for a [[job interview]], when he spots a beautiful girl Jothika ''"Jo"'' ([[Jyothika]]) walking down the street. He's both attracted to and distracted by her. He begins to follow her, and in the process, accidentally misses his bus and is mugged. The film then pauses at this point as a voiceover begins to tell the viewer that we are about to examine how Shakthi's life will be impacted, by missing the bus or by catching the bus.  The Shakthi who makes the bus gets to the job interview on time and gets the job of a bank manager, and a beautiful young colleague Priya ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]) falls in love with him. The catch there is that this Shakthi is still in love with the same woman who his alternate self (who missed the bus) loves, but try as he may, something keeps preventing him from getting to her. That thing turns out to be his alternate self (the Shakthi who missed the bus). He is well off in life, but miserable because he can't get the girl he loves.  The Shakthi who missed the bus arrives late at the interview and is thrown out. On his way home, he passes by a junkyard where he spots an old friend Madhan ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]), who gives him a job as a mechanic, and life goes on. The next day, while crossing the street, he spots the girl from the day before and begins to follow her again until he is able to get her attention and they begin a relationship. One day, Aravind ([[Sunil Shetty]]) comes to visit, and it is revealed that he too is in love with her and wants to marry her.  Due to some miscommunication, Jo and Shakthi (who missed the bus) separate. On the other end, Priya expresses her love for Shakthi (who made it to the bus). The climax scene is cliched and Shakthi (who makes the bus), while reciprocating his love for Priya, meets with an accident. At the same moment, Shakthi (who missed the bus) is also grievously hurt in the same freak accident while he tries to patch up with Jo. Shakthi and his alternate self are admitted in the hospital.  The film ends with Priya wailing over Shakthi's (who made it to the bus) death, and catching a glimpse of Shakthi (who missed the bus) patching up with Jo at the hospital.

The 51st State
 [[File:Fifty first state ver2.jpg|thumb|220 px|Alternate poster and title for the film ''The Fifty First State'']] In 1971, a policeman catches Elmo McElroy, a recent college graduate with a [[Academic degree|degree]], smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Due to his arrest and conviction, he is unable to find work as a [[Pharmacology|pharmacologist]]. In the present day, a drug lord called "the Lizard" calls a meeting of his colleagues, hoping to sell a new substance invented by Elmo. The meeting goes badly when Elmo, in a bid to escape from the Lizard's control, blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard. Infuriated, the Lizard contacts Dakota, a contract killer, who previously killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota initially refuses the hit, but accepts when the Lizard offers to clear her gambling debts and give her a $250,000 bonus.  Elmo escapes to [[Liverpool]], [[England]], where he meets Felix DeSouza, a local "fixer" who has been sent by Leopold Durant, head of a local criminal organisation, in exchange for two tickets to a sold-out football match. At the meeting, Elmo pitches POS 51, a synthetic drug that can be produced with minimal facilities and is 51 times as potent as other drugs. A second opinion from Pudsey, Durant's [[chemist]], confirms Elmo's claims, and Durant gives him over a million dollars in bonds. Since it is $18&nbsp;million short of the agreed payment, Elmo begins to leave.  In a room across the street, Dakota is about to take a shot at Elmo's head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula. Instead of killing Elmo, she is to kill anyone who meets with him. She switches rifles to an automatic weapon and kills everyone but Elmo and Felix, who is shot in the buttocks. As Elmo and Felix leave the hotel, a gang of [[skinhead]]s who want the drug surround them. Elmo protects them with a golf club. Detective Virgil Kane arrives on the scene and gives a chase. He is soon lured into a game of [[Chicken (game)|chicken]] by Elmo, who escapes. Kane returns to the crime scene and demands 50% of Durant's deal with McElroy. A miscommunication leads to Durant's death.  Felix contacts a gun dealing club owner and drug distributor named Iki, promising him the formula for £20&nbsp;million. As Elmo and Felix acquire the ingredients necessary for the drug's manufacture, all of which are [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter products]], the now-armed skinheads capture them. Elmo is unfazed, as the skinheads claim they have a lab, though it turns out to be a broken-into animal testing facility. Elmo makes two batches of the drug; one blue and one red. He claims that the red pill is the stronger version, and after he takes one, the skinheads try it. While they are partying, waiting for the effect of the drug, in the next room Elmo spits out his red pill. He tells Felix it is a powerful [[laxative]]; Elmo and Felix leave after throwing rolls of toilet paper to the incapacitated skinheads.  At Iki's rave club, Elmo initiates his deal and delivers the drug to the waiting crowd. Kane and the police interrupt the deal and arrest Felix. When Dakota appears, she reveals that her real name is Dawn and that she and Felix were romantically involved. She captures Elmo and leaves with him via the roof. Elmo overpowers her, suspending her over the edge of the roof. Having no choice, she strikes a deal with him and they evade Kane. Meanwhile, Kane blackmails Felix during a police [[interrogation]] and forces himself into the deal with Iki, which Felix sets up for him.  Felix also enters a pub full of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] supporters and goads them before letting off a rocket flare inside; the United fans give chase but his friends rescue him in their car.  Felix, Elmo and Dawn meet Iki in a private viewing box at the football match in [[Anfield]]. This time, the deal is interrupted by the Lizard, who shoots Iki dead and demands the formula to POS 51. The Lizard celebrates with a drink, as Elmo reveals that the drug is a [[placebo]] and POS stands for Power of Suggestion. Kane interrupts them as Elmo's cocktail, an explosive ingested by the Lizard, takes effect. Kane is knocked [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] and arrested, while the main three exit unscathed. Dawn and Felix give their relationship another chance, and Elmo purchases a castle once owned by the man who owned his ancestors.  
3000 Miles to Graceland
 Outside of Las Vegas, Michael Zane, a recent parolee, stops at a run-down desert motel. There, he catches a boy, Jesse, stealing the death's head wheel nuts off his car's wheels and chases him, meeting his mother, Cybil Waingrow, whom he later beds. The following morning four men dressed in Elvis costumes arrive to pick him up: Murphy, Hanson, Gus, and Franklin. Together they set off into Vegas to a casino holding an [[Elvis impersonator|Elvis convention]] intent on robbing it — dressed as Elvis impersonators. Michael rigs the elevator while the others rob the cages and counting room, and after a grotesquely violent firefight, Franklin is killed during their escape.  Back at the motel, Hanson starts an argument about who gets Franklin's share and Murphy shoots and kills Hanson. Michael hides the money in the [[Basement#Crawl space|crawl space]], unaware that Jesse is observing him from the next room. The three thieves drive out to the middle of the desert to bury Hanson. Offscreen, Murphy shoots Gus and Michael as well. It is later revealed that Michael was wearing a bulletproof vest and played dead. He starts running back to the motel hoping to get there before Murphy does. Driving from the scene, Murphy hits a coyote, skids off the road, and is knocked unconscious after crashing his car.  Michael gets back to the motel. Discovering the money is missing, he storms into Cybil's place and finds the money where Jesse has hidden it. Michael gives Cybil $100,000 in exchange for her silence, but is eventually manipulated into taking Cybil and Jesse along with him.  Michael explains to Cybil that the money is marked, but that Murphy has found a money launderer in Idaho to help them. Murphy, who has since returned to the motel and discovered that the money is missing, has decided to go to Idaho to wait for them. Cybil sneaks away from Michael and her son at a restaurant, stealing Michael's wallet and car. Cybil calls the money launderer, using the password that she has extracted from Michael's wallet. Murphy suddenly appears at the money launderer, Peterson, ([[Jon Lovitz]]), using the same password. Peterson explains that Cybil called first, so they wait for her.  Finally, Cybil arrives, and finds only Murphy, whom she assumes is Peterson. Soon afterwards, Michael and Jesse, who have been stealing money and cars to survive, arrive and find Peterson and his secretary dead in the bathroom. Realizing that Murphy killed the two and remembering that Murphy is driving Michael's car, Michael reports his car stolen. Murphy is then arrested. However, Michael is arrested as well when police discover that Michael is also driving a stolen car. The men are then put in adjoining cells and the two have a confrontation.  Michael makes bail, thanks to Jesse, who hired a lawyer, under the agreement that Michael make him his partner. Murphy calls a man named Jack ([[Howie Long]]) and arranges to get out as well. Michael, who has been allowed to retrieve his car, finds Cybil tied up and gagged in the trunk. Murphy makes bail and is picked up by a passerby while [[hitchhiking]], he then kills the man and takes his clothes and vehicle. Murphy sees Cybil and Jesse pass by in a car. He runs them off the road, and grabs Jesse, to hold as collateral, telling Cybil to find Michael and the money. Cybil finds Michael and begs him to help her. After initially disbelieving her, Michael decides to help her, reporting Murphy to the authorities.  Murphy has met up with Jack, who has enlisted the help of a shadowy figure named Hamilton ([[Ice-T]]). Michael appears with the money and convinces Murphy to hand Jesse over. Just as Murphy realizes that Michael tricked him by replacing the money with cut up newspaper, he is stung by a scorpion that Michael hid in the bag. Suddenly, a [[SWAT]] team surround the warehouse. Murphy puts his hands up, but quickly grabs a nearby shotgun and shoots Michael. A gunfight ensues; Jack and Hamilton are killed. Murphy, getting weaker from the scorpion sting, refuses to lose, and he is shot and killed by the police. Michael is rushed by ambulance to the nearest hospital. However, the ambulance is stolen by Cybil and Jesse. It's then revealed that Michael, once again, wore a bulletproof vest, and is only slightly injured.  
61*
 In 1998, the family of the late Roger Maris goes to [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] to witness [[Mark McGwire]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] break their father's record with a 62nd home run. Maris' widow, Pat, is hospitalized due to complications from arrhythmia and watches the game on television from a hospital bed.  Decades earlier in 1961, Maris is presented with the Most Valuable Player award for the 1960 baseball season, but Mickey Mantle remains the [[New York Yankees]]' superstar. Mantle starts off hot while Maris struggles. Maris suspects he may be traded, but new manager [[Ralph Houk]] has Mantle and Maris switch places in the Yankees' batting order to see if it helps. It does, and Maris begins to hit home runs at a record pace. Mantle keeps pace and it becomes clear that both "[[M&M Boys]]" will make a run at [[Babe Ruth]]'s record of 60 homers in one season.  Mickey's life off the field is taking a toll on his playing. He drinks, enjoys the Manhattan nightlife and arrives at the ballpark hung over. More than once, pitcher [[Whitey Ford]] has to bail him out or sober him up. To keep Mantle out of trouble, Maris and teammate/roommate [[Bob Cerv]] invite him to move in with them in a modest home in Queens, with one condition: no women.  New York's fans and media pull for the popular and personable Mantle, a long-time Yankee. The quieter Maris is viewed as an outsider, aloof and unworthy. As the two men close in on the record, [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|MLB Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]], who was Babe Ruth's ghostwriter, makes a decision: unless the record is broken in 154 games (the same number Ruth played in 1927), the new record would be listed separately from Ruth's record, because MLB has just begun using a new 162-game season.  It appears Mantle is not going to make it; his health deteriorates and he plays in constant pain. Maris, meanwhile, is unaccustomed to such a high level of public scrutiny and is uncomfortable interacting with the media, who dissect and distort everything he says or does. The fans heckle Maris and even throw objects at him on the field. Soon he begins receiving hate mail and death threats. His wife lives far from New York, usually available only by phone. The stress becomes so intense that Maris' hair begins to fall out in clumps. The Yankees owner also tries to favor Mantle by asking Houk to switch Mantle and Maris in the batting order, but Houk refuses, because the redesigned lineup has been winning a higher percentage of games.  Chronic injury and alcohol abuse catch up with Mantle, and an ill-advised injection by a doctor infects his hip and lands him in a hospital bed. With Mantle gone from the lineup, the stage becomes set for Maris. He fails to break the record in the 154th game of the season, but he does finally hit the record-breaking 61st home run during the final game of the season.

ABC Africa
 Set in a refugee camp in Kampala, Uganda, Kiarostami intersperses scenes of women and children dancing, singing, and laughing with somber images of the death rampant from numerous diseases. Sometimes critiqued as touristic, there are several scenes of the children laughing, making faces at the camera, and being astounded as they watch their friends be recorded.<ref>http://sensesofcinema.com/2013/feature-articles/the-appearance-of-appearance-absolute-truth-in-abbas-kiarostamis-abc-africa/</ref> Although this film is likely not the somber reflection on AIDS and civil war originally envisioned by the United Nations, it is a documentary of Kiarostami and Samadian's trip to Uganda, and the earnest reactions of the impacted women and children.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/may/12/artsfeatures.cannes2001</ref> The candid and often silly scenes of the children contrast sharply with quiet images of death that speak to both the true tragedies occurring as well as the everyday joys that allow the women and children to continue.

Chander's father ([[Anupam Kher]]) is an advocate and loves his only son since only two of them live together in their house, hence their relationship was really good. Chander's father helped him to find out who was "dream girl" by tricking her to come to a wedding of another man named Chander. Chander was happy when he learned that the dream girl is Pooja; from then on they start dating.  When Pooja's parents learn about their relationship, they don't approve and force Pooja to get engaged to somebody else. Chander finds out about her wedding arrangements and goes to her house to speak to her father who starts to abuse Chander and physically assault him, which leads to Chander striking back at him when Pooja arrives. This leads to a misunderstanding between Pooja and Chander that causes them to have a fallout and Chander returns to his home where Pooja calls him to tell him that she learned the truth and wants to meet him. However Chander is enraged and does not want to speak to her. Then Chander's childhood friend Jai takes the call for him and asks her to meet him at a deserted area with Chander, to which she agrees.  After Pooja and Jai meet, a gang of men abduct Pooja as per Jai's instructions who tricked her and reveals to have sold her to one of the city's most feared pimps, Baburao. As time passes, Chander misses Pooja after recalling the moments they had on her birthday and decides to go meet her but is intercepted by Mathur and a squad of policemen and is then taken to the police station for interrogation where Pooja's father reveals that she has been missing for two days. Mathur and his officers try to assault Chander but he fights back and escapes from the police station. After that, Chander starts searching for Pooja and meets his friend Jai who tells him that he can helping him to find her.  Jai contacts Mathur and tries to set up Chander to get him arrested in a dance bar. Chander figures out the set up in the dance bar after he sees an earring that he had given to Pooja in Jai's glass, but Jai manages to escape. Jai goes to the police station and requests inspector Mathur for protection and offers his help in apprehending Chander. They send Mathur's informer, Badru to give Chander the wrong information about Jai's whereabouts. Chander goes there where it is very dark and kicks Jai down from behind. It turns out to be Mathur in Jai's clothes who reveals to him that Jai is safe in his informer Badru's house. Chander is surrounded by many policemen, but as Mathur knocks off his hat it turns out to be his friend instead who was disguised as Chander wearing tall boots and a tape recorder with Chander's voice. He reveals that Chander now knows where Jai really is from a phone which he had with him. Chander eventually finds Jai and beats him out in the street and makes Jai take him to the brothel where he sold her. However Chander gets involved in a fight with Baburau's men outside the brothel and gets stabbed by one of them.  It is shown that an Arabic man from Dubai had agreed to purchase Pooja for 50 lakh rupees and wants to take her with him to Dubai. Meanwhile, Chander is injured seriously after being stabbed and is being treated by his father and friends in Sapna's house, when Badru finds out about it he informs inspector Mathur about it. When Mathur goes along with his constable Bawander Singh and other policemen to apprehend Chander, he learns that Chander escaped after Bawander Singh had tipped Chander's friends about the raid which infuriates Mathur and leads to Bawander resigning from the job due to Mathur's partiality towards his job duties and personal vendetta against Chander.  Chander later finds out that Pooja had been taken by the Arabic man and goes to the airport to save her where she almost boarding the plane. However, Chander met Baburao who gives him a chance to fight him and take Pooja away.

The movie ends with Pooja and Chander embracing each other.  
About a Girl (2001 film)
 ''About a Girl'' opens with a striking shot of a silhouette &mdash; against a skyline of clouds above a field &mdash;  of a girl singing the [[Britney Spears]] song "[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]" and doing the dance routine. It cuts abruptly to a close-up of the girl talking in a strong [[Manchester dialect|Mancunian accent]] to the camera: "If [[Jesus]] were alive today &mdash; right, he'd probably be a singer." She is walking against a backdrop of Manchester's industrial landscape, talking non-stop, mixing wry statements about stardom and singers with random quotes from her parents and descriptions of her life: her relationship with her dad, her frustrations with her mum, her desire to become a famous singer, and the band she has formed with her friends. Her monologue is interrupted and intercut with different scenes of her with her family and her dad; her in a perfume department, sitting on a bench singing "Stronger" again, and on the back of a bus with her girlfriends singing "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" by Britney Spears and doing the dance routine featured in the music video for the song.   As she goes on walking alongside a canal, the girl's stories become more and more underlain by an uncomfortable feeling that the gravity of her experiences does not match her flippant retelling of her everyday life: her descriptions of her pop idols and her favourite ice cream are mixed with hints about family troubles, poverty and [[domestic violence]].   The 'underside' to her light-hearted storytelling is revealed in a shocking scene when, stating that she has become "good at hiding things", she throws the plastic bag she has been carrying into the canal. A camera shot from under the water reveals a baby surrounded by blood.

The Accidental Spy
 A news reporter covers a story in a village within [[Turkey]] where many people have mysteriously died, seemingly from [[pneumonia]] while a scientific team tries to find a cure. Unbeknownst to them, a terrorist group disguised as farmers in the area fire at the scientists and the news crew, killing them all. Shortly after the attack, members of the South Korean embassy in [[Istanbul]] discuss the attack before one of their longtime missing agents return.  Meanwhile, in [[Hong Kong]], Buck Yuen ([[Jackie Chan]]) works as an [[exercise equipment]] salesman. After an unsuccessful day at work, he eats at a shopping mall and intuitively suspects that a robbery is about to take place. Buck thwarts the robbers plans and attracts much media attention for his actions. Later, a stranger approaches Jackie, eager to speak to the hero who foiled the robbery. The stranger goes by the name of Manny Liu and he tells Buck that he is rounding up several men of Jackie's age and description, one of whom could be the son of a wealthy Korean man known as Park Wong Jung (aka Mr. Park), who is looking to leave his fortune to his real son. After Manny is beaten up by his debtors, Buck saves Manny and brings him back to his apartment. Manny directs Buck to an associate for an interview. As a child, Buck had been an orphan, but he has vague dreams of his parents cooing over him, with his father clutching a shiny object.   After speaking to Manny's associate, Buck is taken to South Korea to meet Mr. Park, who is dying from terminal brain cancer and does not have long to live. Buck notices that they are being followed by mysterious men in an unmarked vehicle. Before speaking to Mr. Park, Buck meets a Korean reporter named Carmen Wong who is eager to ask him questions about Mr. Park. Carmen reveals that Park Wong Jung was a Korean double-agent who recently defected (as shown in the earlier scene). She asks him to find out why he defected, as such Buck returns to the hospital and witnesses thugs trying to interrogate Mr. Park while physically assaulting him in his hospital bed. Buck fends off the attackers, and Mr. Park gives Buck the opportunity to play a "game" with him. He gives Buck a crucifix pendant (which appears to be the shiny object of his dreams), confirming this man to be his father. When Mr. Park passes away, Buck is requested to scatter his ashes by his wife's grave as a final wish. At the grave, he finds the first clue to the "game" engraved on the tombstone – a message saying "wait for me" in [[English language|English]]. After leaving the cemetery, Buck & Carmen narrowly escape from the same thugs who assaulted Mr. Park earlier. Buck eventually realizes that the letters of the phrase correspond to a telephone number and calls it, and it turns out to be Istanbul Bank.   Once in Turkey, Buck impersonates his father at the bank to retrieve the contents of Mr. Park's safety deposit box. The shiny crucifix pendant turned out to have a stamp on the bottom, which was necessary for him to get the safety deposit box. Opening the safety deposit box, Buck finds a large sum of money and a bible, leading him to believe the "game" to be over. Shortly after leaving the bank, he is accosted by a group of thugs who have commandeered a fleet of taxis. Buck fends them off but is eventually overpowered with his briefcase of the money exposed. Fortunately, police come to his aid and the thugs flee. Buck and the police believe that they wanted Jackie's money. While enjoying his time in Turkey, Buck comes across a mysterious Chinese girl who has "wait for me," the very same words Mr. Park left on his grave, embroidered on her scarf. Buck tails her and eventually they meet. The girl, known as Yong, agrees to meet Buck again soon on a specific date.  Buck then visits a Turkish bath before meeting Yong on their date. While washing up, he is accosted by another group of Turkish thugs, with the leader demanding that he hands them over "the thing". Buck fends them off and narrowly escapes but arrives late for his meeting with Yong, where she leaves a note telling him to meet her later at a temple. Just then, Carmen and her associate Phillip Ashley appear. Carmen turns out to be working for the CIA and she together with Ashley inform Jackie that the item everyone seems so keen to get their hands on is a new biological weapon, Anthrax II, many times more powerful than regular [[anthrax]]. It had already killed many Turkish people as Turkey had been chosen as the testing ground. Park Wong Jung had been involved in the case and thus developed brain cancer as a result. Jackie also learns that crime lord Lee Sang Zen, known as the 'fixer', or 'Zen', wants to buy the new Anthrax and had used Yong to get in contact with Buck whom he feels has information.  When Buck meets up with Yong, she confirms her boss is Zen, and a deal had been brokered between him and Buck's 'father'. Moments later, Buck and Yong are captured by the Turkish thugs and brought back to their village. The thugs are revealed to be the Turkish gang; they want the Anthrax back to prevent further bloodshed since the testing of it was done in their village. The leader, from the Turkish bath earlier, again asks Jackie where "the thing" is. Jackie is tortured but still has no idea what they're talking about. Moments later, a mercenary force attacks the village. In the ensuing confusion, Jackie makes his escape and frees Yong. He destroys the dock to prevent pursuit, makes a makeshift raft and together with Yong escape into the sea. Later the pair are picked up by Zen who sent his men (that was the mercenary force) to rescue Buck and Yong. Buck learns that Yong is a drug addict, a slave to Zen and her life is in grave danger. Later, as they part, Zen offers Buck a new deal; more money and Yong's freedom if he gives Zen what he wants - the Anthrax II. Buck bluntly refuses, saying he knows nothing about it, but Zen gives him time to find its location.  Remembering that there was a bible in the safety deposit box, Buck's intuition leads him to a nearby church. While in confession, he meets a priest who was an associate of Mr. Park. He leads Jackie to a basement room where Mr. Park temporarily stayed and gives him the item that everyone has been trying to get their hands on – 2 vials of Anthrax II. Jackie reluctantly hands over the vials over to save Yong, knowing that handing them over could lead to more deaths. However, Zen has double-crossed him; Yong had already been given a fatal dose of drugs and soon dies at a train station. Buck is arrested for suspicion of involvement in Yong's death. Carmen and Ashley then secure his release. Buck tells them that he gave up the vials for Yong's life. The CIA will now have to pay Zen to get them back, and Buck is determined to set things right. Carmen later informs Jackie on Zen's plans, which will be conducted the next day and the opportunity to strike will be then.  As the CIA attempt to intercept Zen, Buck manages to ruin Zen's plane getaway and trap most of his men in a burning building. Zen escapes with a henchman in a car. Buck gives chase and combats the two on their car, defeating them, but the car becomes lodged into the rear of a large oil tanker, which catches fire. Buck rendezvous with Carmen on the road, and she explains the tanker must keep a speed of 80km/h or else the tanker will explode. Buck demands that they help him to rescue the tanker driver (and the driver's son) before he hands over the Anthrax II. Buck pulls them from the tanker to safety one by one, but cannot escape himself. Out of nowhere, Manny Liu reappears in a helicopter to help get Jackie out, but is unsuccessful. At the last moment, as the tanker heads towards the edge of a disused bridge, Jackie leaps from the tanker, grabs the plastic bridge barrier, which is quickly torn, sending him swinging down. Buck rolls down a hill after the jump, becoming severely injured. As Buck loses consciousness, Manny searches Buck's body for the Anthrax II, takes it, and runs away.  When Jackie wakes up in the hospital recovering from his injuries, Manny comes along, and reveals that his entire adventure was actually an intelligence mission arranged for an undisclosed American intelligence agency, performed by Jackie as an informal, non-official agent (thus the labeling of an accidental spy). His background as an orphan, combined with his talents of extremely sharp intuitions and excellent martial arts skills, had made him a perfect candidate for a freelance agent who could perform special missions. The mission was set as a "game" for Jackie since he was not an official agent and therefore cannot be briefed about it. His sharp intuition enabled him to interpret his "clues" correctly, thus enabling him to perform his mission with success. All the while, the dreams of his parents were illusions, which Manny helped to create by drugging Jackie's drink when he was brought to Buck's place. Buck acknowledges the whole case, smiling.  In a post-credits scene, Buck is now an agent and is in Italy, disguised as a bearded courier. He delivers a briefcase to a man, then tips the police off for an arrest.

  In the late 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Venice]], and [[New York City|New York]], and drastically reduced the world's population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of thoughts and emotions, have been created.  David, a Mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for its owners, is sent to Henry Swinton, and his wife, Monica, as a replacement for their son, Martin, who has been placed in [[suspended animation]] until he can be cured of a rare disease. Monica warms to David and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear, who cares for David's well-being.  Martin is cured of his disease and brought home; as he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He makes David go to Monica in the night and cut off a lock of her hair. This upsets the parents, particularly Henry, who fears that the scissors are a weapon.  At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, activating his self-protection programming. David grabs Martin and they fall into the pool. Martin is saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creator for destruction. Instead, Monica abandons both David and Teddy in the forest to hide as an unregistered Mecha.  David is captured for an anti-Mecha "Flesh Fair", where obsolete and unlicensed Mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds. David is nearly killed, but tricks the crowd into thinking that he is human, and escapes with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder. The two set out to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]], whom David remembers from ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and believes can turn him into a human, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.

There, David meets a copy of himself and destroys it. David then meets his creator, Professor Hobby, who tells David that he was built in the image of the professor's dead son David, and that more copies, including female versions called Darlene, are being manufactured.  Disheartened, David falls from a ledge, but is rescued by Joe using their amphibicopter. David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater and wants to go down to meet her.

They find David and Teddy, and discover they are original Mecha that knew living humans, making them special.  David is revived and walks to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David’s memories to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from [[DNA]] in the lock of hair. The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy.

They concoct a plan to earn her enough money to purchase the property.  [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] had commissioned [[Paris]]ian [[jewellers]] Boehmer and Bassenge to create an opulent , 647-diamond necklace to present to his mistress [[Madame du Barry]], but the king died before it was completed. Hoping to recover the high cost of the necklace, its creators try to persuade Marie Antoinette to purchase it. Knowing its history, she declines.  Jeanne approaches debauched libertine [[Louis René Édouard|Cardinal Louis de Rohan]] and introduces herself as a [[confidante]] of the Queen. For years the Cardinal has yearned to regain the Queen's favor and acquire the position of [[Prime Minister of France]], and when he is reassured by [[occultist]] [[Alessandro Cagliostro|Count Cagliostro]] that Jeanne is legitimate, he allows himself to be seduced by her promise to intervene on his behalf.

Jeanne advises the Cardinal the Queen has decided to purchase the necklace but, not wanting to offend the populace by openly buying such an expensive item, she wishes him to do so on her behalf, with a promise to reimburse him for the cost by the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]]. The Cardinal gladly agrees and presents the necklace to Rétaux de Villette, believing him to be an emissary from the Queen. Nicholas de Lamotte sells some of the diamonds, and Jeanne uses the profits to buy her family home.  The Cardinal begins to panic when Jeanne disappears and his correspondence with the Queen comes to an abrupt end. His concern is put to rest by an invitation to visit the palace on the Feast of the Assumption, at which time he assumes he will be repaid in full and named Prime Minister. Instead, [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], who has been made aware of his machinations by Minister Breteuil, has him imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. Soon to follow are everyone else involved in the plot. A trial finds the Cardinal, Count Cagliostro, and Nicole Leguay d'Oliva innocent of all charges. Rétaux de Villette is found guilty and banished from France. Jeanne is found guilty and [[flagellation|whipped]] and [[Branding persons|branded]] before being imprisoned; she later escapes to [[London]] where she publishes her [[memoir]]s and regales the locals with her tales.

He decides to search Vikram's house, only to be interrupted by Vikram, who calls the police and then reveals that everything was planned in advance. Raj escapes in Vikram's car with Priya.  Raj finds a boarding pass that belongs to Sonia Bajaj, which states that Sonia arrived in [[Zurich]] on 29 December — however, Sonia was supposedly murdered on that night. Raj suspects her to be the woman he saw with Vikram, traveling to [[Geneva]] together. In Geneva, Raj meets an insurance officer who is trying to find evidence that Vikram was involved in the death of his wife, in order to receive her life insurance payment of $100 million. Working with the insurance agent, Raj traces Vikram to a cruise ship. There, he sees Vikram dancing with a woman who is revealed to be 'Sonia', alive and well.  Raj confronts Vikram, who finally explains the whole devious plan - the woman whom he kissed in Mauritus was his actual wife Sonia Bajaj ([[Mink Brar]]), while the woman with him that Priya and Raj were introduced to in Switzerland is his girlfriend Neeta (Bipasha Basu). Vikram, a struggling musician, married the wealthy and glamorous Sonia, and convinced her to take out an insurance plan of $100 million on herself. He then formulated a plan with Neeta to have Sonia killed so that they could collect the money.  Vikram boasts about having pinned the murder on Raj. However, Raj takes Vikram to a computer and shows him his empty bank account. Raj says that he had guessed the password, "Everything is planned", something that Vikram used to say a lot, and used it to transfer the money back to the insurance company. Raj also reveals that everything Vikram said had been recorded. A fight erupts between the two and Neeta dies in the conflict. Angered at losing Neeta, Vikram gets aggressive, killing the insurance officer and seemingly kills Raj. He chases Priya to kill her too, but Raj is able to save her. Vikram dies when he is impaled by an anchor from the cruise ship. Now proved innocent, Raj and Priya move back to [[India]].

All About Lily Chou-Chou
 ''All About Lily Chou-Chou'' follows two boys, Shūsuke Hoshino and Yūichi Hasumi, from the start of junior middle school when they first meet, and into second grade. The film has a discontinuous storyline, starting midway through the story, just after the second term of junior high school begins, then flashes back to the first term and summer vacation, and then skips back to the present.  In elementary school, Hoshino was one of the best students in school, but was picked on by his classmates. Hoshino and Hasumi meet and become friends when they join the [[kendo]] club, and Hoshino invites Hasumi to stay over at his house. Hoshino's family is wealthy in comparison to Hasumi's family. Hasumi mistakes Hoshino's attractive young mother for his sister.  The kendo club summer camp training is tough, and Hoshino, Hasumi and some other first-grade boys decide to take a trip to [[Okinawa]]. Once there, Hoshino has a traumatic [[near-death experience]] and his personality changes from good-natured to dangerous and manipulative. Back at school in September for second term, he takes his place as class bully and shows his newfound power by ruining the lives of his classmates. An alternative voice, that of the character Sumika Kanzaki, attributes Hoshino's personality change to the collapse of his family's business and his parent's divorce; this matches several scenes connecting the decline of Hoshino – who has had to change his name – to divorce.  Hasumi, the confused and shy former friend of Hoshino, finds himself sucked into his now-tormentor's gang. He is ridiculed and coerced into doing Hoshino's dirty work, and finds solace only in the ethereal music Lily Chou-Chou makes, and acting as web editor for his fan website. Things become far worse for everyone when Hasumi is assigned to supervising Shiori Tsuda, whom Hoshino has blackmailed into [[enjo kōsai]], and another girl is raped by Hoshino's lackeys after unwittingly offending the school's girl gang. The whole quagmire comes to a head when Hasumi heads to Tokyo to see a Lily Chou-Chou concert, where he encounters the last person he thought would be there.  The story of Hoshino and Hasumi is paralleled by messages posted to a Lily Chou-Chou message board which are displayed on screen. Until the meeting at the concert, it is left up to the viewer to figure out which characters in the story are posting under what names.

Sonia has been brought up by her father (the Austrian Ambassador) ([[Saeed Jaffrey]]) since her mother mysteriously abandoned the family to return to Malaga. Although Sonia knows her father will be very angry with her&nbsp;– he hates India and Indians due to his wife leaving him&nbsp;– Sonia wants to see her mother's grave for the first time. She convinces her father to let her stay in Malaga for a few days to fulfill her wish.  Upon arrival in Malaga, Sonia meets Tony and hires him to show her the area and to help her find her mother's grave. As Sonia and Tony see the sights of Goa and find her mother's grave, Tony begins to fall in love with Sonia and it appears Sonia is very fond of him. Unbeknownst to Tony, his childhood friend, Neena ([[Namrata Shirodkar]]) is in love with him and she does not take kindly to him spending all his time with Sonia.  One day when Sonia is traveling with Tony, she sees a man in the distance. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]]s show that the man is Prem Arya ([[Jackie Shroff]]), an Indian journalist who Sonia met in Austria when he was interviewing her father. Prem and Sonia became friends, fell in love and hoped to marry. When Sonia's father found out, he forbade them to marry because Prem is Indian, and although they are deeply in love, they agree to separate.  Returning to the present, Sonia is shocked to find Prem is in Malaga. When she sees that Prem has written an article about Tony and that they are good friends, she asks Tony to organize a lunch on the pretense of meeting the author of the article. Prem agrees to the meeting and is startled to see Sonia. When Tony goes to order lunch, Sonia reveals to Prem that she is still in love with him and is sorry about having to leave him to keep her father happy. Prem tells her that there is no point in having these feelings as there is nothing either of them can do about it and, overcome by emotion, he leaves. When Tony returns from ordering lunch, Sonia says she wants to leave too, resulting in a very confused Tony.  The next day, Sonia calls Prem and admits he still loves her and has not been able to stop thinking about her. They begin to spend time together and after returning from one outing with Prem, Sonia admits to her nanny that she still is madly in love with Prem and that he is a wonderful and kind person. Tony overhears this and believes Sonia is referring to her feelings for him. On another occasion, Tony and Neena join Prem and Sonia on their outing. It is obvious to both Prem and Sonia that Neena loves Tony, so Sonia attempts to tell Tony that Neena loves him. Tony mistakes her comments and, in combination with what he has already overhead, believes that Sonia is trying to tell him that she loves him.  As Sonia and Prem spend time together, Sonia realizes that her true happiness lies in being with Prem. Unfortunately, Sonia's father travels to Malaga to surprise her and discovers that Sonia has been seeing Prem again. He believes that she intentionally traveled to Malaga to see Prem and does not believe that it was a coincidence. He forbids Prem to see Sonia and orders Sonia to pack, intending to take her back to Austria straight away.  Sonia tells Tony that she will be returning to Austria and he is devastated. Sonia invites Tony to join her in Austria and Tony willingly accepts. Neena is extremely upset, but Tony thinks this is because he is leaving her alone in Malaga&nbsp;– he assures her that he will find a job for her once he is settled in Austria and continues happily packing in preparation for his journey.  Sonia makes one last trip to the cemetery and is met by a priest, who tells her the true reason of her mother's return to Malaga. When she gets to the airport, she is met by Tony, who tells her that he cannot go with her to Austria anymore. He has discovered a message left for him by Neena, revealing her feelings and wishing him happiness in his new life. He tells Sonia that he knows she loves him and although he loves her in return, he realizes that Neena relies on him and will not cope if he leaves. Achieving his dream of being with Sonia will be at the expense of Neena, and he is not prepared to do this.  Sonia tries to tell Tony that she does not love him, but he leaves quickly, not wanting a sad farewell. Sonia's father makes derogatory comments about Indians and about Tony not joining them, but Sonia defends Tony and tells her father of his sacrifice. After seeing this sacrifice, Sonia realizes that she cannot give up Prem just to keep her father happy and begs him to let them marry. Her father still refuses and makes further derogatory comments about Indians and her mother, and this is when Sonia reveals the truth&nbsp;– that her mother was diagnosed with a contagious disease, so made the sacrifice to leave the two of them and die alone in India, so that they would not get sick. She gives her father letters written by her mother (but never sent) and he apologizes to Sonia and tells her to go to Prem.  Tony and Neena are happily sitting in a restaurant when Tony notices Sonia at another table with Prem. Tony believes Sonia has not left Malaga because she wants to be near to him (Tony). Tony comments that although she looks quite pale and sad, Sonia will eventually get over her feelings for him. At Sonia and Prem's table, Sonia suggests to Prem that they should thank Tony because it was he who brought them together, and she also wants to clarify with Tony that she never had feelings for him. Prem stops her and advises that some dreams are so beautiful that they should not be broken – that it is better for Tony to believe that he gave up a princess for an ordinary girl.

Just before they leave Germany, they realize they were tricked—the British government already had the device, but wanted to make the Germans think they were still after it. They were specifically chosen as the team most likely to fail. Leaving Germany with an Enigma machine would, in fact, destroy the usefulness of the machine, as the Germans would know it was stolen and switch to a different code system.

After he is captured, the team retrieves him and returns safely to England, leaving the Germans with the impression they have all the Enigma machines and the British are still desperate to obtain one.

He correctly recalls the boy's name as "Bretodeau". Amélie quickly finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau ([[Maurice Bénichou]]), and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Amélie happily embarks on her new mission.  Amélie secretly executes complex schemes that affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the Métro station, giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his [[garden gnome]] and having a flight attendant friend [[airmail]] pictures of it [[Travelling gnome prank|posing with landmarks from all over the world]]. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette ([[Isabelle Nanty]]) and Joseph ([[Dominique Pinon]]), one of the customers in the bar. She convinces Madeleine Wallace ([[Yolande Moreau]]), the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She uses [[gaslighting]] tactics on Collignon ([[Urbain Cancelier]]), the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien ([[Jamel Debbouze]]). A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand.  Mr. Dufayel, having observed Amélie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations Amélie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this, and uses the girl in the painting to push Amélie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix ([[Mathieu Kassovitz]]), who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Amélie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Amélie retrieves it.  Amélie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Amélie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina ([[Clotilde Mollet]]), concerned for Amélie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Amélie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. Amélie finally finds happiness for herself.  
American Pie 2
 After their freshman year at college, the four friends regroup for a party held by Stifler ([[Seann William Scott]]), their overtly sex-crazed class clown and good friend. His party is shut down thanks in part to the neighbors calling the police. Kevin ([[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]) is inspired by his brother to make his summer with his friends count by renting a beach home. He, Jim, Oz, and Finch plan to take off to a beach house together, where they intend to spend the summer. Kevin realizes a problem and worked out that they can only afford the house if they have a fifth member to work along with them. Stifler takes charge of much of the organizing, often ending up leading the group in their misadventures.  Oz ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]) is miserable, being away from his girlfriend Heather ([[Mena Suvari]]), who is in [[Spain]]. During the stay at the beach house, they proceed to start having [[phone sex]] to vent some of their loneliness, which ends up being interrupted by Stifler. Heather later shows up early to the party, ending the short storyline that Oz is involved in.  After arriving in Grand Harbor they settle in, they manage to find work painting a house (based on the ''Tuition Painters'' franchise) in the area together, mistaking the owners for lesbians. Jim ([[Jason Biggs]]), Stifler and Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]) end up performing "like for like" sexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls doing the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the [[neighbourhood|neighborhood]]. Finally at the end of the last party, Stifler manages to have a wild threesome with the owners of the house.  After this, many concurrent stories run at the same time, some interacting with each other, others staying mainly separate.  Nadia ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) is coming to visit Jim in August. When she arrives early, Jim asks for help from [[band geek]] Michelle ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), humiliating himself in front of the audience when he pretends to be Petey, a mentally challenged boy who plays the trombone. They pretend to be in a relationship so that Nadia will not expect Jim to have sex (Jim is involved in an incident involving a tube of super glue he mistook for lube; he accidentally glued his hand to his penis while watching a porno film and injured himself, leaving him wounded and unable to perform). Jim and Michelle break the mock relationship off once he is ready to have sex with Nadia, but by then Michelle has really fallen in love with Jim, and soon Jim realizes that he has found his soul-mate in Michelle. Nadia also realizes this and tells him, "Go, get your band geek, and I will find mine". Jim goes and plays the [[trombone]] once more whilst Michelle is playing the flute at a major recital in order to show her that she is the one he wants to be with.  Finch has become involved in the sexual art of [[Tantra]], and claims that through Tantra he can "make an [[orgasm]] last for days". He is waiting for Stifler's Mom ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]), who he had sex with in the first film, hoping she will show up and be willing to do it again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be his little brother Matt ([[Eli Marienthal]]), the star of later films. He spends the night talking with a few girls, but he doesn't sleep with any of them.   The geeky Sherman ([[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]]) gives up on getting anyone after he is turned down by the experienced and sharp-tongued Jessica ([[Natasha Lyonne]]), but the rejected Nadia, who wanted Jim because he was a geek, is turned on by his "Sherminator" gimmick, and they end up in bed together. Kevin doesn't end up "getting off" with anyone, but he does seem to succeed in getting over Vicky ([[Tara Reid]]) after making advances on her throughout the film.  The next morning, after the party, a [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[coupe]] with darkened windows turns up, Finch approaches and it turns out Stifler's Mom has come after all. He jumps at the chance and they drive off together, Stifler not realizing until after the car has driven off that it was Finch and his mother. After being asked, she reveals her name is Jeanine, but also instructs Finch to resume calling her "Stifler's mom" as per usual.  
America's Sweethearts
 Film publicist Lee Phillips is tasked with promoting a film featuring a husband-wife acting team, Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas. His job is complicated by the fact that the eccentric director of the film, Hal Weidmann, refuses to show anyone a cut of the film, demanding the first viewing take place at a [[Movie junket|press junket]]. To promote the film and to save his job, Lee decides to focus on the two stars: Gwen and Eddie, once known as "America's Sweethearts". Unfortunately, they are now going through an ugly split. Gwen had an [[Adultery|adulterous]] affair with her co-star Hector Gorgonzolas, who she now lives with, driving Eddie to an emotional breakdown. His actions after their split led Gwen to take out a restraining order against Eddie, and he is now living at a New Age retreat. Lee decides that his best chance to promote the film is to convince the press that the couple has reunited.  Lee enlists the help of Gwen's sister and personal assistant, Kiki, to convince Gwen to come to the junket. Gwen's career and public image have been severely tarnished by her broken marriage, and the pair play on Gwen's ego by telling her she will look better to the press and her fans if she attends (and she will be able to serve Eddie with divorce papers in a neutral setting). Lee then bribes Eddie's spiritual guide to convince Eddie he is well enough to leave the retreat.  As the junket begins, tensions rise quickly between Eddie and Gwen. While they are frequently at each other's throats, Lee plants stories to convince the press that they are in the process of reconciling. Gwen encourages Kiki to be her go-between with Eddie, and as they spend more time together they begin to develop strong feelings for each other. Hector, having seen the fake stories, believes that Eddie is trying to win back Gwen and they have a public confrontation in the hotel restaurant, ending with Eddie getting knocked out. A sympathetic Kiki cares for Eddie, and they spend the night together, having passionate sex. The following morning Kiki becomes enraged after Eddie drops everything to talk to Gwen when she asks to see him, and refuses to admit to being in any other relationships. He later regrets what he did in not stopping Gwen from manipulating the situation and admits to Lee. He also confesses that he's in love with Kiki and has always liked her for the selfless and kind person she is. Eddie believes it wouldn't matter because he lost his only chance and that he was never happy with Gwen. Feeling remorse for his part in the drama, Lee encourages him to tell Kiki and end his marriage to Gwen. Meanwhile, Weidmann arrives by helicopter with the finished film.  When the film is shown, the press, cast and crew discover that Weidmann junked the script for ''Time Over Time'' believing the movie script is terrible and made a "reality movie" instead. The footage, mostly shot with hidden cameras and without the actors' knowledge, shows Gwen as self-centered, conniving and manipulative, while Eddie is a decent man who becomes paranoid as he begins to suspect that his wife is having an affair. Eddie is portrayed as the protagonist, while Gwen is the main antagonist for her affair with Hector and Kiki is Eddie's love interest. The cast and crew—particularly Gwen and the studio's owner, Dave Kingman,—are offended by the direction that Weidmann went with instead of sticking to the movie's script and they confront him for it. Weidmann admits it was all his plans to humiliate Gwen and ruin her career for an earlier incident on set, while reviving Eddie's own. Enraged, Gwen announces she will sue Weidmann for both humiliating her and invasion of privacy, along with Kingman Studios for not preventing his actions. Eddie is the only cast member pleased with Weidmann's direction since the film characterized him favorably and wants to work with him again for another reality film project. Gwen's problems continue to compound when an angry Hector calls her out for both humiliating and insulting him in the film. The director's daughter, Leaf, comes to his defense and revealing that she also had an affair with Hector.  Humiliated by Weidmann and Hector's actions, Gwen tries to salvage the situation by announcing that she is reconciling with Eddie. Disillusioned with Gwen, Eddie announces that he is finally through with Gwen, and declares his love for Kiki. She reciprocates and stands up to Gwen for the first time. Kiki reveals dirty secrets about Gwen's personal life that no one else except her knows including how much her sister has mistreated Eddie and herself. Kiki tells Gwen off that she's tired of putting her sister's career over her own personal life and is fired for it. After the junket Gwen admits to the press that she and Eddie are through, claiming she was having a reaction to medication. She tries to claim that she loves Hector and that he is well-endowed. However, their relationship is seen to be disintegrating in front of the press. Despite defending his case, Hector doesn't believe Gwen and is angered over her humiliating him that he announces that they're also over. Kiki and Eddie prepare to leave the hotel together. Lee tells Eddie and Kiki that because of the praise from the press, the studio is forced to release the reality movie. Moments after they leave, Lee gets jumped on by Gwen's dog.  
American Desi

The American Astronaut
 The film is set in a fictitious past, in which space travel is pioneered by [[roughneck]]s. The logic of space travel is not addressed, and most technology was designed for the film to appear as if "it could be repaired with a hammer". Samuel Curtis, an interplanetary trader, is approached by an acquaintance of his, the Blueberry Pirate, with a mission. He is to provide the women of [[Venus]] with a new king for mating. In exchange for this new stud, they will relinquish their currently deceased king, whose family is offering an immense reward for his body. Curtis sets off in search of the perfect replacement, the Boy Who Actually Saw a Woman's Breast, and soon discovers that his old nemesis Professor Hess is hot on his trail.  
American Outlaws
 A group of Confederate guerillas are trying to raid the [[Union Army]], very late in the [[American Civil War]]. The southerners are ambushed, but thanks to the sharp-shooting of [[Frank James]] (Gabriel Macht) and the distracting and at the same time clever antics of [[Jesse James]] (Collin Farrell), the guerillas manage to survive and pull through. The James brothers, along with their war buddies, the Younger brothers, congratulate themselves, but (during the ride to reconnect with their unit) are surprised to learn that their army has pulled out, General [[Robert E. Lee]] had surrendered the previous day at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]], and the war is over. The group decides to return home to their families and farms.  Things have changed when they get back to Missouri. The town is occupied by the Union Army, Jesse's childhood friend, Zee (Ali Larter), has grown up into a very attractive young woman, and there is a man hanging in the town square, ostensibly for treason against the North.  In actuality, those farmers with large amounts of land are being pressured to sell their farms to the railroad company, who are pushing across North America. If they don't sell their land to the well-groomed, suit-wearing Thaddeus Rains, (Harris Yulin) and his secret-service organizer, Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) the farmers are burned out of their homes, or killed outright.  Frank James finds that the railroad doesn't even need their land—they're just buying it as cheap as they can get, to push the railroad through. The James and Younger brothers don't want to sell, and Cole Younger (Scott Caan) loses his temper when several 'railroad men' approach him about selling, and kills two of them. The army decides to hang him (since they were working for the government, he faces charges of treason), but his brothers Bob (Will McCormack) and Jim Younger (Gregory Smith), along with Jesse James and Frank James, decide to rescue him, with some help from Zee. During the rescue, Jesse is shot in the shoulder, and has to hide out at Zee's farm.  A few weeks later, when Jesse has recovered, the railroad sets fire to the James' home, killing Jesse and Frank's mother (Kathy Bates). The James and Younger brothers ride out for revenge against the railroad men—but instead focus on the bank's payroll, reasoning that 'you could kill a hundred railroad men and they won't care', but if they steal the payroll and attack supply trains, the army will sit up and take notice.  Dubbing themselves the 'James-Younger' gang, they set out robbing banks, with Pinkerton and Rains struggling to stop them. The impact of the James gang is only increased when they commit the first daylight bank-robbery in history, turning themselves into folk heroes in the process.  Eventually, the gang comes to blows over leadership, with Cole Younger feeling that Jesse is getting an overblown ego from the publicity of 'his' gang's activities. Jesse backs down, after a bitter argument, and lets Cole plan and execute a robbery; Cole's chosen target proves to be a trap set by Pinkerton and Rains. Jim Younger is shot and killed, and Jesse and his brother (who are tired of the killing and fighting) leave the gang, with Jesse later marrying Zee.  The gang does not do as well without the James brothers. People don't respect the Younger brothers as much as they did the James-Younger Gang, preferring Jesse's easy-going 'nice guy' personality and his warm, friendly and accommodating manner, which had won the affection of the townsfolk in previous robberies.  When Jesse and Zee attempt to start a new life, Pinkerton finds and arrests Jesse. During the train ride to the jail, Jesse is chained in a rear car, but manages to trick one of the deputies into showing his gun, which he uses to escape to the top of the train car.  Meanwhile, Zee and the remainder of the Gang shoot a cannon at the locomotive, stopping the train and rescuing Jesse. Confronted in the final moments by the two men he's come to hate, Jesse shoots neither Rains nor Pinkerton, but rather Rains' prized watch, a treasured gift from his father.  Pinkerton tells Jesse, through gritted teeth, that he should go to Tennessee, as 'the railroad has no interest in Tennessee', and therefore, neither does Pinkerton (since Pinkerton's being paid by the railroad).

The Animal
 Marvin Mange ([[Rob Schneider]]) is an awkward, clumsy nice-guy who dreams of being a police officer like his dad was. He continuously attempts to pass the physical test to become a full-fledged police officer, but despite his repeated attempts, he is unable to finish the obstacle course. Marvin gets constantly mistreated by heartless and sleazy Sgt. Sisk ([[John C. McGinley]]). He works in the police station as an evidence clerk.   One day, while alone at the station, he receives a robbery call. With no other officers responding to the call, he attempts to take it himself but ends up driving off the road, tumbling down a mountain and seriously injuring himself. When the car finally comes to a stop, he passes out.  Days later, Marvin returns to his normal life with no memory of what had happened. Suddenly, he's full of life. He can outrun horses, mean dogs are now scared of him, and he does not need his asthma medicine. He thinks it is due to his late-night TV purchase of "Badger Milk", which is guaranteed in the ads to make him stronger.  One day at the park, Marvin meets Rianna ([[Colleen Haskell]]) while she's out walking her dogs. His animal-like tendencies are slowly taking him over. When a frisbee is thrown in his direction, he cannot control himself, and he jumps to catch it in his mouth.  He goes to the airport to talk to his friend, Miles the security guard ([[Guy Torry]]) about his problem. While there, Marvin sniffs out a man trying to hide heroin in his rectum. For uncovering a drug smuggler, Marvin is declared a hero and is made a full-fledged police officer.  As days go by, Marvin's animal instincts are becoming stronger. He often wakes up in strange places, and subsequently, hears about animal attacks that occurred in the middle of the night. Because of these attacks, Dr. Wilder believes that Marvin is out of control. The mad scientist confronts him, takes him to his laboratory, and explains about the grafts and transplants that saved Marvin's life and gave him remarkable animal powers with certain troublesome side effects.  Later at a party thrown by the Mayor ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]), Marvin chases after a cat and destroys everything around him and is fired on the spot. During his reprimand, he hears something, jumps into the nearby lake and rescues the mayor's son using powers derived from a sea lion and a dolphin. He is swiftly reinstated.  Chief Wilson ([[Ed Asner]]) questions Marvin about the late-night attacks on farm animals because one of the witnesses made a police sketch, and it looks like Marvin.  Rianna goes to Marvin's house, where he has barricaded himself inside. They spend the night together, but Marvin wants to be tied up so he cannot hurt anyone. In the morning, he finds himself untied, courtesy of Rianna. Suddenly, the police show up outside. Another attack had happened that night, and the police have come for Marvin. Rianna convinces him to run.  Marvin escapes to the woods, where a huge chase ensues; the police have organized an angry mob as a search party to capture Marvin. While running through the woods, Marvin finds Dr. Wilder. The scientist tells him that there was another "patient" of his that is out of control, and he is in the woods looking for it.  Sergeant Sisk confronts Marvin and is about to shoot him. Suddenly, the other "animal" jumps from a tree and attacks Sisk. The beast is Rianna. Now, the crowd finds them both together but Miles is there and takes the blame for everything. He has been claiming that there is reverse racism towards him since he's black (a concept he explained in the beginning of the movie while out to eat with Marvin) and no one wants to hold him accountable for anything. Sure enough, once the mob thinks a black man was responsible, they don't care anymore and leave.  Marvin and Rianna get married and have a litter of children that each look like Marvin. While watching television, they see Dr. Wilder win the [[Nobel Prize]]. He says he owes it all to his fiancée, who is the same woman from the Badger Milk commercial. When she turns around to kiss him, there are large scars shown on her back, implying that Wilder performed the experiment on her as well.  
The Anniversary Party
 Sally Nash and Joe Therrian are a Hollywood couple celebrating their sixth wedding anniversary shortly after reconciling following a period of separation. He is a novelist who is about to direct the screen adaptation of his most recent bestseller; she is an actress he has opted not to cast in the lead role, despite the fact it's partly based on her, because he feels she's too old for the part. This decision, coupled with an ongoing dispute about their barking dog Otis with their strait-laced, non-industry neighbors, clean-and-sober writer Ryan and interior decorator Monica Rose, has resulted in an undercurrent of tension between the two as they prepare for the arrival of their guests.  Among them are aging actor Cal Gold, Sally's co-star in the [[romantic comedy]] film she presently is shooting, his wife Sophia, and their two young children; director Mac Forsyth, who is helming Sally and Cal's film, and his [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], [[Neurosis|neurotic]] wife Clair; photographer Gina Taylor, whose relationship with Joe prior to his marriage and ongoing close friendship since troubles Sally; business manager Jerry Adams and his wife Judy; eccentric [[violin]]ist Levi Panes; Jeffrey, Joe's roommate - and lover - at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; and up-and-coming actress Skye Davidson, whom Joe has cast in the role Sally believes deservedly is hers. In an effort to dispel the simmering animosity between them and their neighbors, Sally and Joe have invited the Roses as well.  The early part of the evening is devoted to [[charades]] and lighthearted entertainment. Following a series of toasts offered by the guests, Joe distributes the [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] Skye brought them as a gift. As it begins to take effect, the night deteriorates, accusations are made, secrets are revealed, and relationships slowly unravel. Complicating emotions triggered by the drug are the disappearance of Otis and a phone call from Joe's father bringing tragic news about his beloved sister Lucy.  
Another Life (2001 film)
 Chiefly set in [[London]] during the [[First World War]] and in the early 1920s (primarily 1921 and 1922) and based on a [[Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters|true story]], the film concerns a daydreaming young woman, Edith Graydon (Little), who attracts, then marries, an ordinary shipping clerk, Percy Thompson (Moran), who reminds her of a character in books. Later, Edith carries on an affair with Frederick Bywaters (Gruffudd), a young [[merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] and childhood friend of her younger brother. The Thompsons' marriage had been a failure for years when Edith became reacquainted with Bywaters, who by then was dating Avis (Stirling), Edith's younger sister. Over the course of their tempestuous affair, Edith writes to Bywaters during his extended absences at sea about her growing boredom and frustration with the dull Percy, who has grown jealous and violent at times. These letters burst with Edith's vivid imagination, including her hopes for a romantic future with Bywaters and her alleged attempts to kill her husband through feeding him glass and poisons. Edith's fantasy-driven promises to leave Percy stir Bywaters to a frenzy; he also resents the way Percy deprecates and even injures Edith. Finally, Bywaters attacks Percy with a knife, as the couple walk home from the theatre. The resulting trial and conviction of the lovers creates a sensation across Britain, as Edith maintains her innocence of any part in her husband's murder. Her letters paint a different picture, despite Bywaters' insistence he acted alone and impulsively. Despite a massive number of signatures on a petition protesting Edith's death sentence, the lovers hang on the same day. To the end, Edith conjures up dreams of her sentence being commuted to life imprisonment, so her captors must sedate and carry her off to the scaffold.

Antitrust (film)
 Working with his three friends at their [[Startup company|new software development company]] Skullbocks, [[Stanford University|Stanford]] graduate Milo Hoffman is contacted by [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] Gary Winston of NURV (Never Underestimate Radical Vision) for a very attractive programming position: a fat paycheck, an almost-unrestrained working environment, and extensive creative control over his work. Accepting Winston's offer, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson, move to NURV headquarters in [[Portland, Oregon]].  Despite development of the [[flagship product]] (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent [[source code]] Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code's origin.  After his best friend, Teddy Chin, is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world—including Chin—and then killing them to cover their tracks. Hoffman learns that not only does NURV employ an extensive [[surveillance]] system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and most of the mainstream media. Even his girlfriend is a [[Plant (person)|plant]], an ex-con hired by the company to manipulate him.  While searching through a secret NURV database containing surveillance dossiers on employees, he finds that the company has information of a very personal nature about a friend and co-worker, Lisa Calighan. When he reveals to her that the company has this information, she agrees to help him expose NURV's crimes to the world. Coordinating with Brian Bissel, one of Hoffman's friends from his old startup, they plan to use a local [[public-access television]] station to hijack Synapse and broadcast their charges against NURV to the world. However, Calighan turns out to be a [[double agent]], foils Hoffman's plan, and turns him over to Winston.  Hoffman had already confronted Poulson and convinced her to side with him against Winston and NURV. When it becomes clear that Hoffman has not succeeded, a backup plan is put into motion by Poulson, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and the incorruptible internal security firm hired by NURV. As Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, the second team successfully usurps one of NURV's own work centers—"Building 21"—and transmits the incriminating evidence as well as the Synapse code. Calighan, Winston and his entourage are publicly arrested for their crimes. After parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks.  
Apocalypse IV: Judgment
  The film begins with Helen Hannah waking up in a jail cell, praying to God. A flashback reveals that she did not die at the [[Apocalypse III: Tribulation|end of the previous film]].  At the O.N.E. Headquarters, Macalousso asks Vicky Thorne to be the prosecutor in what he heralds as "the biggest trial in history". Thorne then visits Mitch Kendrick, a lawyer and her ex-lover, informing him that he has been appointed as Hannah's defence attorney.  At the hideout of the Christian Underground, J.T. Quincy and the remaining cell members decide to rescue Hannah.  The trial begins. Kendrick tells the court that Helen Hannah is a pawn of God, and decides, in a publicity stunt, to put God himself on trial. Thorne and Judge Wells hate the idea, but Macalousso - eager to repair the recent blows to his reputation - approves the idea.  J.T. visits Colin McMahon, an underground doctor, to have a fake 666 mark imprinted on his hand. J.T. then visits his old friends Dawn and Dave, fugitives hiding in an old warehouse. He offers them food in return for their assistance.  Later that evening, Kendrick watches a tape at his house. The tape is one of the illegal broadcasts of the Christian Underground, which claims that O.N.E. is responsible for various atrocities blamed on 'The Haters'. Thorne comes upon Kendrick looking at an old abandoned church. She orders him to gain Hannah's trust so as to expose the key Resistance. Kendrick silently stays to witness the church be burnt down by agents of O.N.E. Kendrick then returns home, where he finds Macalousso waiting for him. The Antichrist tells Kendrick not to allow Helen Hannah to testify on God's behalf, and that he wishes to be called to the stand when the trial ends.   Doctor McMahon is shot in his home by a group of agents of O.N.E, who then have his hand cut off and taken to a laboratory.  Kendrick visits Hannah in her cell, having taken care to scramble the security camera. Kendrick reveals that his mark is a fake, which he procured from the black market. However, he only believes in himself, denying both Macalousso and any 'Father in Heaven'. Hannah futilely attempts to persuade him of the existence of God and the Rapture.  At the trial, Thorne calls various damning witnesses in favour of O.N.E to the stand.  First come General Tyson Kennan, head of O.N.E. Peace Corps. Kennan denounces the world prior to Macalousso as a hotbed of war, prejudice and hatred - but that since Macalousso's takeover, [[Apocalypse (film)|World War III has been averted]], and a general euphoria has gripped the globe's population.  Next comes Willie Spino, much to the surprise of Hannah, [[Apocalypse II: Revelation|who believed him dead]]. Spino claims that accepting the mark has freed him from being bound to a wheelchair, [[Apocalypse III: Tribulation|and granted him supernatural powers shared by the human race]]. Spino explains that Hannah was his stepsister, and denounces her for claiming that he should have forsaken his regained mobility and newfound powers. At this point, Kendrick objects by asking if Spino loves Hannah. Spino denies it - but admits loving her as his sister prior to taking the Mark. Judge Wells abruptly adjourns the trial in the face of this reversal.  Kendrick again meets Hannah in her cell. Hannah confides in him that belief in Christ does not remove fear. Kendrick reveals he has been through a precedent - Thorne blackmailed him into defending his own father, accused of being a Hater, so as to force him to choose a side. He lost the trial and had to witness his father's execution. Hannah begins to trust Kendrick, and gives him the location of the Haters.  The trial resumes. Helen is called to the stand by Thorne. The cross-examination is severely rigged - Thorne discredits Hannah's every answer by claiming they do not fit with the world which stands behind Macalousso.  Kendrick visits the Christians and claims to believe their innocence, but the trial can only be won if O.N.E is finally exposed for all of its crimes. Soon after he leaves, agents of O.N.E. invade the hideout, killing many haters including Mrs Quincy. Some Christians barely escape - J.T, Jake Goss and Selma Davis among them. Conferring with Hannah, Kendrick realises that the O.N.E had a surveillance chip implanted into his arm.  The outcome of the trial seems bad for Hannah, but Selma Davis shows up unexpectedly as a witness. Selma tells Thorne about Simon Greenleaf, a pre-Rapture expert on the Second Coming. Thorne and Judge Wells are displeased about Kendrick calling her to testify, as she was an undisclosed witness.  In Hannah's cell, Kendrick argues with her one last time about his father and God. Kendrick is angered, as he believes his father chose God over his son. During the argument, Kendrick drops his scrambling device, which Thorne notices from the security camera. The prosecutor orders the guards to search Kendrick, but fortunately they find nothing - possibly an act of God.  J.T, Dave and Jake Goss arrive at the court plaza in their broadcast van. J.T sends Dave to infiltrate the court building, but Dave fails when the alarm is raised and he is killed by guards. In a miracle, J.T. receives a call from Kendrick, who tells him how to disguise himself to enter the court.  Kendrick calls Macalousso to the stand, as requested by the Antichrist. Macalousso explains that the trial is a question of faith - Helen Hannah refused to accept his Mark, choosing to believe the lie of Christ. Hannah barely has time to denounce him as the liar when Judge Wells orders her to be removed from the court for her outburst.  Kendrick reveals his ace in the hole. Refusing to conclude the trial, he interrogates Macalousso - before pulling out a gun with one bullet. [[Mexican Standoff|The guards cannot intervene]]. Kendrick tells the crowd he will call to the stand anyone willing to die for Macalousso. Nobody steps forward.  Kendrick then lays his gun in front of Thorne, telling her he forgives her. To die for someone is the greatest sacrifice of all, and the paradise that Macalousso has created will someday pass away, but simple belief will open the doors to an eternal paradise. Undefeated, Macalousso tells Kendrick that so long as there are still people who bear the Mark, he is master of the Earth.  J.T. tries to release Hannah from her cell, where she awaits execution with Selma. J.T. is noticed by a real guard and prepares to pull his gun out, but Selma whispers to him there is a better way. In the third miracle the guard is called away to the courtroom, and the cell door swings open.  Macalousso watches as Thorne comes up to Kendrick. Knowing he has finally chosen his side, she tells him he will take a bullet for his new god - whereupon she shoots him. As Kendrick lays dying, Thorne tells him he is a fool, just like his father.  As J.T, Hannah and Selma leave the building, J.T. tells Helen that Kendrick knew that O.N.E. were not the only ones listening to her prayers. The last shot of the film is a newspaper headline saying that Helen has escaped.

As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me
 Clemens Forell is a German soldier who is captured by the Soviets in 1945.  Forell is sentenced to 25 years hard labour for "crimes against the partisans" and sent as part of a large group of prisoners to a far northeast labour camp in the Soviet Union. After a huge cross-continent railway journey on starvation rations, and a long-cross-country trek by foot into the bleak wilderness, they arrive at the gulag. This is run by a cruel commander, Lieutenant Kamenev. After one unsuccessful attempt, Forell ultimately does escape with the aid of the camp doctor, Dr. Stauffer. Stauffer had planned to escape himself, but is terminally ill with cancer, so he gives Forell warm clothes and a loaded pistol, and explains where he has hidden supplies for a long journey. Forell promises to visit the doctor's wife in [[Magdeburg]] and tell her that he is already dead. Forell heads north to avoid the guards, who would expect him to go west. When the supplies given to him by Dr. Stauffer run out, he kills a seal for food.  Over the winter, he wanders across northern Siberia, until he meets Anastas and Semyon, two gold prospectors. Although initially suspicious of them, Forell eventually joins them. After Semyon falls in a river and Forell rescues him, Semyon kills Anastas when he suspects him of stealing his gold. Semyon and Forell then continue their journey. When Semyon can no longer continue, Forell offers to carry his pack for him, but a suspicious Semyon throws him down a slope, thinking he too will try to steal his gold. Beset by wolves, Forell is rescued by nomadic [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] herders, one of whom, named Irina, falls in love with him.  After he makes a successful recovery, the Chukchi find out the Soviets are looking for Forell. Much to Irina's chagrin, Forell leaves, with the dog the Chukchi give him for companionship. When he runs into a logging operation, Forell is sent on the train with the freight as a brakeman. Betrayed, he is nearly captured by the Soviets, led by Kamenev.

Atlantis: The Lost Empire
   Many centuries ago, a [[tsunami]] threatens to drown the island of [[Atlantis]]. In the midst of an evacuation from the capital city, the Queen of Atlantis is caught by a strange, hypnotic blue light and lifted up into the "Heart of Atlantis", a powerful crystal protecting the city. The crystal consumes her and creates a dome barrier that protects the city's innermost district. She leaves behind her young daughter, Princess Kida, as the island sinks beneath the ocean.  In 1914, Milo Thatch, a cartographer and linguist at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] who is marginalized for his research on Atlantis, believes that he has found The Shepherd's Journal, an ancient manuscript that contains directions to the lost island. Though the museum board declines his proposal to search for the journal, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it.  The expedition departs with a team of specialists led by Commander Lyle Rourke, who also led the journal recovery expedition. They set out in the ''Ulysses'', a massive [[submarine]]. During the journey, they are attacked by the monstrous [[Leviathan]], a robotic lobster-like creature that guards Atlantis' entrance. The ''Ulysses'' is subsequently destroyed, but Milo, Rourke, and part of the crew escape to an underground cavern, described in the journal as the entrance to Atlantis.  After traveling through a network of caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis, where they are greeted by Kida. However, Kida's father, the King of Atlantis, is not pleased with the team's visit, but agrees with Rourke to stay for one night. Kida enlists Milo in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By diving deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.  Returning to the surface with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, intending to bring the crystal to the surface and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds it himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat and merges with Kida, whom Rourke and the mercenaries lock in a crate, and then prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates the crew for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted to use it as a weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Milo rallies the crew and Atlanteans to stop Rourke.  In the ensuing battle inside the volcano, Rourke, Helga, and his accomplices are all killed. Milo and the others successfully fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises into the air and creates a [[Force field (fiction)|protective shield]]. The lava freezes and breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo becomes the new king of Atlantis, along with Kida as the new queen, and stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire.

They are on the run from the Kingdom of Kalinga along with their faithful protector Bheema ([[Rahul Dev]]) and are being chased by soldiers of the Kingdom. After saving their lives, Asoka introduces himself as Pawan, hiding his true identity. Kaurwaki and Arya are the Princess and Prince of Kalinga, who fled from their kingdom when the Prime Minister assassinated their parents and took over power. Later, Asoka and Kaurwaki get secretly married.  Soon, Asoka is summoned by his mother who sent a messenger to tell him she has fallen ill and to come to capital. The Emperor dispatches Asoka to quell a rebellion in [[Ujjain]]i. Before marching to the west, Asoka travels to Kalinga to meet Kaurwaki and Arya. Unable to find them, and not knowing they have gone into hiding, he is informed by General Bheema that they were slaughtered. A heartbroken Asoka attempts suicide, but is saved by Virat ([[Danny Denzongpa]]), who later swears to protect him. Mad with grief and anger, Asoka leads a brutal crackdown in Ujjaini. The assassins sent by Susima injure Asoka in a battle and Virat saves him. He is taken to a [[Buddhist]] monastery at Vidisa to recover.  There, he meets a Buddhist maiden, Devi ([[Hrishita Bhatt]]), who cares for him. Asoka also survives another assassination attempt at Vidisa, this time with the help of Devi. Asoka marries Devi and returns in splendour to [[Patna|Pataliputra]]. Susima and his brothers are wild with anger from their futile attempts to eliminate Asoka. Emperor Bindusara, who favoured Susima over Asoka, becomes ill and dies. In another vigilante attack, Queen Dharma is stabbed to death by assassins sent by Susima. Angered, Asoka wants to kill Susima but has second thoughts and Susima is killed by Virat when he tries to kill Asoka behind his back and is appointed emperor.  A few months later, princess Kaurwaki and prince Arya return to Kalinga with Bheema and have the Prime Minister executed for treason. Asoka declares war on Kalinga, not knowing that Kaurwaki is alive. Kaurwaki still does not know that Asoka is Pawan, and both sides prepare for war.  A terrible war is fought in Kalinga. The Maurya army inflicts a crushing defeat on Kalinga. Not content with mere victory, Maurya soldiers butcher everyone in sight. General Bheema is killed after failing to assassinate Asoka realizing that he is Pawan and Kaurwaki is wounded. Asoka later visits the battlefield, where he discovers his horse, who was supposed to be in Kaurwaki's possession. With a surge of hope, he frantically searches for Kaurwaki and finds her. They have a heart-to-heart talk and he apologises deeply for his actions. He is interrupted by Arya, who is dying after being pierced with arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly realises that his enemies, his family, and even Arya, are all dead because of him. His grandfather's warning about the sword had been correct.  The film ends with Asoka throwing the sword into the water at the same spot as his grandfather, and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace throughout the empire.  
Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner
 At [[Igloolik]] ("place of houses") in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium, Qulitalik bids goodbye to his sister Panikpak, wife of Kumaglak, promising to come if she calls for help in her heart. She gives him her husband's [[rabbit's foot]] for spiritual power.  In a flashback, the community is visited by the strange [[Shamanism|shaman]] Tungajuaq. During a spiritual duel with the visitor, the camp leader Kumaglak dies. The visitor removes the [[walrus]]-tooth necklace from Kumaglak's body, and puts the necklace around the neck of Kumaglak's son Sauri, who thus becomes camp leader. Much later, the shaman’s magic has poisoned the community with hatred. Tulimaq, the laughing stock of the camp, is having bad luck hunting and can barely feed his family, but Panikpak brings meat for Tulimaq's children, Atanarjuat and Amaqjuaq, hoping that one day they will make things right.  Atanarjuat grows up to be a fast runner, Amaqjuaq is strong, and they are rivals with Sauri and his son Oki. During a game of ′wolf [[tag (game)|tag]]′ Atanarjuat pursues the beautiful Atuat, provoking jealousy in Oki. Oki’s sister Puja also shows interest in Atanarjuat. In a punching duel with Oki, Atanarjuat wins the right to marry Atuat. Later, Atanarjuat leaves his wife Atuat at a camp to hunt caribou, but he stops at Sauri’s camp, where he is persuaded to take Puja on the hunt. Camping by a lake, Atanarjuat and Puja sing, flirt, and have sex.  Later, Atanarjuat is in an unhappy marriage with Atuat and Puja. He catches his brother having sex with Puja and strikes Puja. She runs to Sauri's camp and tells them that Atanarjuat tried to kill her, so Sauri and Oki decide to kill Atanarjuat, Panikpak however remains skeptical of Puja's accusations. Puja returns to Atanarjuat’s camp apologizing, and is accepted back. One day the women decide to go find eggs, but first Puja places a boot outside the tent where the men are resting. Oki and two henchmen sneak up and plunge their spears through the tent wall. Amaqjuaq is killed, but Oki is startled by a vision of his grandfather Kumaglak, and Atanarjuat, naked and barefoot, bursts out of the tent and runs for miles across the ice, pursued by Oki’s gang. Atanarjuat escapes by following a vision of Qulitalik and jumping a wide open crack in the ice. Eventually he collapses in exhaustion with bloody feet. He is rescued by Qulitalik and his family, who conceal him when Oki arrives in pursuit.  Back at Igloolik, Sauri refuses to let Oki have Atuat, but Oki rapes Atuat, who is comforted by Panikpak. During a hunt, Oki stabs Sauri and claims it was an accident, and takes over as camp leader. In her heart, Panikpak summons her brother Qulitalik to come, as they agreed years ago. Qulitalik feels her call and makes magic with the rabbit foot: at Igloolik Oki catches a rabbit with his bare hands, eats it, and falls under a spell that makes him forget his grievances. Qulitalik and the family make the long sled journey back to Igloolik with Atanarjuat, who has healed. Atanarjuat is joyfully reunited with Atuat but rejects Puja. The spell-happy Oki just wants to have a feast. But Atanarjuat prepares an ice floor in an igloo and invites Oki and his brothers inside. He slips antlers on his feet to grip the ice and subdues them, declaring that the killing is over. It is now time to confront the evil that has plagued the community for so long. With everyone gathered together, Qulitalik calls forth the spirits, and the evil shaman Tungajuaq appears, grunting like a [[polar bear]]. Qulitalik confronts the shaman with the powerful spirit of the walrus and magic soil, Panikpak shakes the walrus tooth necklace, and the shaman is destroyed and vanishes. Panikpak tells the group it is time for forgiveness: Oki and Puja and their friends are forgiven for their evil deeds, but are exiled from Igloolik forever.

The Attic Expeditions
 :''Note: The story is explained here in its chronological order, rather than the way it unfolds in the film.''  Trevor and Faith are a happy couple who decide to buy a home together.  After purchasing their new house, Trevor is cleaning the attic and discovers a chest.  In the chest there is a staircase, under which he finds a book of black magic that only he can read.  He begins studying the book, and starts to perform rituals with Faith.  In an effort to gain even greater power, he and Faith perform a ritual in an attempt to merge their two consciousnesses.  The ritual goes wrong, and Faith suffers a violent death.  Trevor calls the police.  Years later, Trevor appears in a hospital.  Apparently having been found insane, he is now under the care of Dr. Ek. The doctor has learned about the book Trevor found, and wants to use it for his own means - one of which, he later admits, is to cure all mental illness.  It is around this time that Dr. Coffee comes to stay at the sanitarium and study under Dr. Ek. Trevor seems to have forgotten much of his past including practicing black magic and killing Faith.  Dr. Ek talks with Trevor, trying to help him regain any previous memories about where Trevor may have hidden the book.  At first Ek is very coy about his intentions.  He worries that if Trevor knows the value of the book and his intent, he won't willingly surrender it.  Dr. Ek sends Trevor to be rehabilitated at "The House of Love."  While Trevor thinks he's being sent to a recovery facility filed with other patients, he is actually being sent to his former house which is now filled with actors pretending to be patients.  He interacts with the other patients, and eventually befriends Douglas.  While he thinks Douglas is just as oblivious to the strange happenings in the house, Douglas is actually trying to get Trevor to sneak around the house (including the attic) and expose the location of the book.  Ronald pretends to confess secrets of the house, hoping it will motivate Trevor to explore more.  As Douglas and Trevor's conversations and expeditions continue, Trevor develops an interest in Amy - another supposed patient.  While Amy seduces and has sex with Trevor, the first "murder" takes place. As time goes on, several more fake murders are orchestrated in an attempt to build urgency and get Trevor to continue exploring.  Unhappy with his results so far, Dr. Ek commits further surgery on Trevor.  As Dr. Coffee's skepticism builds, Dr. Ek also subjects Trevor to several medications and hallucinogens.  In his drugged state, Trevor communicates with Faith who now appears to be searching for the book as well.  She explains to Trevor his past, the truth about the House of Love, and Dr. Ek's actual intent.  She has sex with Trevor and tries to manipulate him into giving her the book.  Dr. Ek has another conversation with Trevor, and sends him back to the House of Love.  Previously murdered characters are seen alive, just as they were the first time Trevor came to the house.  While Trevor remembers his previous time here, the actors continue to pretend he has never been here before.  The charade breaks down and actors begin to confess the ruse.  Trevor suspects Faith will attempt to possess one of them in a final attempt to find the book.  Observing all of this on the monitors, Dr. Coffee and Dr. Ek have a fight over Dr. Ek's methods.  Dr. Ek drugs Dr. Coffee in a fit of rage.  Dr. Ek eventually accepts the experiment's failure.  He sends two orderlies to the house and begins to pack up and leave the sanitarium.  Thinking Faith has possessed Amy, he kills her.  As the orderlies arrive at the house, Douglas (who is the one actually possessed by Faith) kills them and goes looking for Trevor.  They run through the house, and Trevor eventually knocks Douglas down and makes his way to the attic.  Douglas follows him down the stairs within the chest, and Trevor kills him.  Trevor begins to see the situation playing out the way it did when he killed Faith in her own physical body.  He attempts to make his way out of the Attic while another version of his consciousness is knocking on the chest.  In the final scene, Trevor is seen pulling himself into the chest.

Thomas Howell), who manage a game reserve. Conflict ensues when a decision is made by Joss's superior Patrick Khumalo ([[Menzi Ngubane]]) to conduct an elephant cull, complicated by the appearance of [[poacher]] Ripshaw ([[Ian Roberts (South African actor)|Ian Roberts]]) and his aide Ndlovu ([[Ken Gampu]]) who, it turns out, have a secret agreement with Joss's superior to share the proceeds of an illegal sale of the tusks.

 A 20-year-old man named Joseph "Jody" Summers  ([[Tyrese Gibson]]) lives with his 36-year-old mother Juanita ([[Adrienne-Joi Johnson]]),<ref></ref> in South Central Los Angeles. He spends most of his time with his unemployed best friend Sweetpea ([[Omar Gooding]]), and does not seem interested in becoming a responsible adult. However, he is forced to mature as a result of an ex-con named Melvin ([[Ving Rhames]]), who moves into their home. Another factor is his children—a son Joseph "JoJo" Summers Jr. with his girlfriend of five years, 25-year-old Yvette ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) and a daughter with an 18-year-old girl that he cheated on Yvette with named Peanut (Tamara LaSeon Bass) who also lives with her mother.  At the beginning of the movie, Jody waits for Yvette at the clinic and it is found out that she was pregnant.  Yvette constantly asks Jody if he will ever come live with her and their son so they could be like a family, but Jody avoids the subject and comes and goes as he pleases. Jody also continues seeing and having sex with other women, including Peanut. Jody also nearly has sex with 23-year-old Pandora (Tawny Dahl), Yvette's colleague and co-worker, but manages to rebuff her advances. This becomes an issue between him and Yvette as well, especially since Yvette doesn't get along with Peanut nor Pandora. When she discovers his cheating, they get in a heated argument which results in Yvette punching Jody in the face and Jody slapping Yvette in the face. After this, Yvette changes the locks on the door. This infuriates Jody and they get into an argument, which JoJo witnesses.   Eventually, Yvette's gangster ex-boyfriend Rodney ([[Snoop Dogg]]) is released from [[San Quentin State Prison]] and returns to the neighborhood to move in with Yvette, much to her dismay. Rodney doesn't care for JoJo and wants to impregnate Yvette himself. Rodney attempts to rape Yvette in front of her son, but reconsiders after being guilted by Yvette and JoJo. Despite their previous differences, Yvette begins to realize she is still in love with Jody. For the next couple of days, Yvette lives in fear and disgust of Rodney being there. Juanita finds marijuana in her garden and blames Jody for planting it. Jody becomes angry at his mom and blames Melvin for the marijuana.  Melvin comes home and admits to Juanita that he planted it. Jody and Melvin get into a heated argument, which results in Melvin punching him in the face and breaking the table. Jody leaves the house to see Sweetpea. After this, Yvette kicks Rodney and his friends out of her apartment. Eventually, after some more bickering, Yvette and Jody reconcile at Sweetpea's house, and Yvette tells Jody that Rodney attempted to rape her in front of JoJo. Rodney steals the money and keys from her wallet and takes off in her car to go and find Jody. Rodney tries to kill Jody in a drive-by shooting; however, he is unsuccessful.   Later that night, Jody and Sweetpea confront Rodney, and as he attempts to escape, Jody shoots him in the back of the legs. Sweetpea urges Jody to kill Rodney, but he refuses, at which point Sweetpea shoots Rodney anyway. Horrified by Rodney's death, Jody prepares to commit [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head, but Melvin catches him in the nick of time and takes the gun. After reflecting on the death of Rodney and how he put Yvette and his son in danger by not being around consistently, Jody finally moves out of his mom's house and in with Yvette.   Jody has now become a mature man, realizing that Juanita's relationship with Melvin is a stable one and that he has a family of his own that he needs to protect and take care of. Afterward, Jody and Yvette get married and look forward to the birth of their unborn child.  Sweetpea decides to turn over a new leaf and gets baptized, putting his old life as a thug behind him.  
Avalon (2001 film)
    In an alternate universe, many people are addicted to [[Avalon]], a military-themed virtual reality shooter. In the game, solo players or [[Party (role-playing games)|parties]] raid [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] populated with AI-controlled enemies and opposing players. Winners are rewarded with [[experience point]] and in-game money, which can be exchanged for cash, allowing skilled players to make a living. As their brains [[Brain–computer interface|interact with the game directly]], Avalon places significant mental strains on players, and has rendered players [[catatonic]] in many cases.  Ash is a famously skilled player, who only plays solo after her party ''Team Wizard'' was disbanded. After a Class A mission, the GM (Game Master) warns her of the next level's danger, and suggests she joins a party. The next day, Ash watches a Bishop-class character break her record time on the same mission. Intrigued, Ash tries but fails to learn about him or his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. As she leaves the game terminal, the Bishop player watches her.  Ash runs into a former teammate, Stunner, who mentions Murphy, her former team leader. As the two visit Murphy at a hospital, Stunner tells her Murphy went after a hidden NPC in Avalon, a young girl nicknamed "ghost". The girl is allegedly the only gateway into the rumored ''Special A'', an extremely rewarding but incredibly challenging mission where players cannot "reset" (a mechanic allowing players to abort mission without [[Permanent death|their avatars being killed]]). Players who went after "ghost" never wake up from the game and became "Unreturned". As Ash walks through the corridor, a girl looking similar to "ghost" watches her. Ash looks at Murphy, who has now become comatose.  At home, Ash searches for words regarding Avalon, Unreturned, and the ghost. The search leads her to the [[Nine maidens (mythology)|"Nine Sisters"]], another Arthurian legend reference. Further researching and questioning the GM proves fruitless. Upon entering the game, Ash receives an invitation to a meeting, and is ambushed by a group of [[griefer]]s, who lured her there to rob her equipment. After she overpowers a player, the group leader reveals that only the real ''Nine Sisters'' - Avalon's creators - know how to access ''Special A''. They are interrupted by an attack helicopter which kills most of the players. Due to a [[lag]], the helicopter's missiles teleport in front of Ash. She "resets" and leaves the game, narrowly avoiding losing her avatar. On the way home, Ash notices people around her are immobile, with the exception of a dog. At home, after she finishes preparing a meal for her dog, she realizes that it has disappeared. She hears the helicopter from the game flying pass.  The next day, Stunner meets Ash. He tells her of a high-level Bishop player who can make the ghost appear, and is sought out by parties seeking to enter ''Special A''. Before becoming an Unreturned, Murphy himself was a Bishop player. At her house, Ash finds the Bishop player waiting. He offers to form a party with her and she accepts. Ash arrives at the game terminal and tells the receptionist that she plans to enter ''Special A'' to look for Murphy. She enters the game, despite warnings from the receptionist and the GM.  In the game, Ash meets the Bishop player, whom she suspects is working for the ''Nine Sisters''. Stunner arrives, revealing he has been helping Bishop recruit Ash all along. The party confronts the Citadel, an enormous [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. Stunner, Bishop and his summoned dummy players distract the giant, while Ash attacks its weak point. After the Citadel is destroyed, Stunner spots the ghost. He is then shot by an enemy. Before being forced out of the game, Stunner tells Ash of the only way to kill the ghost. Ash goes after the ghost and manages to kill it, turning it into a gateway. Ash steps into the gateway and disappears.  Ash "wakes up" from the game booth, which is put in her apartment, wearing civilian clothing and without equipment. Bishop contacts her and tells her she is in ''Class Real''. The only way to exit the game is to complete the objective: defeat the Unreturned staying here. Ash takes the provided gun and proceeds to her destination, an Avalon-themed concert by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]]. On the way, she is stunned by the vibrant and bustling world, which is in stark contrast to the previous levels and to the world outside the game. At the concert hall, Ash sees Murphy, and they walk outside to talk. As she confronts Murphy about his decision to stay in the game, he states he prefers the "reality" within Avalon. Ash mortally wounds Murphy, who urges her to stay, then disappears. Ash enters the now empty concert hall, and sees the ghost on the stage. Ash trains her gun on the ghost, who flashes a smile. The text "Welcome to Avalon" is blended in.  
Bad Guy (2001 film)
 A young lady named Sun-hwa is sitting on a bench when an unusual man comes and sits by her side. She realizes that he is constantly looking at her and walks away, irritated. Her boyfriend comes and while they are talking, the silent man grabs and forcefully kisses her. Her boyfriend tries to pull him away to no avail. When he stops, the woman demands an apology. He starts walking and some soldiers among the crowd that gathered due to the spectacle beat and restrain him. The woman insults him and spits on his face. He remains silent.  Later, the woman is shopping in a bookstore where we see her tear a page from an art book she cannot afford to buy. She notices a wallet left on a book beside her and furtively tucks it into her purse, not knowing that it was planted by an associate of the man who kissed her. She hides in the toilet, takes all the money out of the wallet and leaves the store. She is accosted by the owner of the wallet, who demands his stolen wallet, claiming it had 10 million [[Korean won|won]] (the rough equivalent of ) in it. As the wallet didn't contain that much money she is unable to give it to him, and he proposes a solution – a loan secured on her face and body. After a short time, she is unable to pay the loan shark and is at this point conveniently rescued by the silent man.   She is forcefully taken to a small [[brothel]] where she is to work, never leaving until her debt is paid.   She asks the madam for permission to see her boyfriend so that she can give her virginity to him, but when the boyfriend does not respond, the silent man attacks the boyfriend in their car. Adjustment to her new life is hard and her innocence is quickly taken away. The silent man, a [[pimp]] enforcer named Han-gi, watches her through the one-way mirror installed in her room. When she later sees him and recognizes him she attacks him, realizing that he is the one who trapped her into this life.   One of the silent man's fellow pimps also develops a crush on the woman, paying to sleep with her and apologizing for ruining her life. She convinces him to help her escape, then he pulls the iron bars from her window and she sneaks away. Her freedom is short-lived, however, as the silent man finds her (through ingenious use of a T-shirt) and seizes her, taking her back to the brothel. First, though, he takes her to a beach, where they witness a woman committing suicide by drowning. In the sand the woman finds a torn-up photograph.  Back in the brothel the woman reconstructs the photo, taping it to her mirror; she has all of the pieces except the faces of the couple it depicts.  An attack by a rival nearly kills the silent man, but when he returns from the hospital he forbids any retaliation. One of his men kills his attacker anyway; Han-gi confesses to the police to save the man from certain execution. But the man for whom he has taken a fall is consumed by guilt and commits a crime so that he can be sent to the same prison. On the scheduled day of execution he escapes from his cell, finds the silent man, attacks him viciously, but confesses everything to the guards, winning his boss's release.  Eventually the woman realizes that she is being spied upon in her room, smashing the mirror to reveal the silent man. It is revealed that the faces of the couple in the photograph are those of Han-gi and Sun-hwa. Han-gi pays the debt of the woman and she decides to stay with him, selling herself to fishermen in the back of a truck to earn them money. The film ends with them sitting by the waterfront, and then driving away, while the Swedish hymn [[Blott en dag]], written by [[Lina Sandell]], is sung in Swedish in the background by [[Carola Häggkvist]].  
Auggie Rose
 Life insurance salesman John Nolan ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) goes to the liquor store where he witnesses the fatal shooting of Auggie Rose ([[Kim Coates]]), an ex-convict on his second day as a stock boy. Auggie was returning from the back of the store with a bottle of wine John had requested – since the only bottle out front had a torn label – and he surprised the robber, who shot him in the stomach. John tries to comfort him, riding with him in the ambulance, but Auggie dies at the hospital.  Feeling responsible, and offended that the police show little interest in investigating and finding Auggie's next of kin, John finds out everything he can about Auggie, who was just released from prison after serving 20 years for armed robbery. Decker, the LAPD officer investigating the case ([[Richard T. Jones]]), warns him to back off. However, John becomes more and more engrossed with Auggie and disconnected from his own life, causing strain with his live-in girlfriend, Carol ([[Nancy Travis]]). After finding a stack of letters, he discovers that Auggie had a [[Southern United States|Southern]] pen pal named Lucy ([[Anne Heche]]) who is coming to meet him for the first time, unaware of Auggie's death, and is due to arrive the next day.  John tells his secretary, Noreen ([[Paige Moss]]), that he is taking a leave of absence. When John goes to meet Lucy, she greets him as Auggie, and he decides to pretend to be him. He lives in his apartment and starts a relationship with Lucy, and even applies for jobs as Auggie, getting a job as a stock boy at a small market. He meets ex-con Roy Mason ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), who knew Auggie through his cellmate but had never met him. Roy asks John to help him rob the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|L.A. Transit Authority]], which he says has $200,000 in cash daily and only two guards. John says he will consider it.  John trades in his [[Volvo]] for a motorcycle to complete his look. He happily spends his days at the market and nights with Lucy. Unbeknownst to him, however, both Roy and Decker are suspicious and tailing him. Roy retrieves John's business card from his Volvo at the dealership. Roy goes to John's office and sees a photo of him on the wall. He confronts John in the lobby of Auggie's apartment, and says he began spying on him when he didn't eagerly accept the transit heist, and that he had asked around and learned Auggie was dead. He accuses John of killing him to take his identity, which John denies, and Roy says he thinks John must be working some kind of life insurance scam. Roy threatens to tell Lucy and John punches him. Roy says he even knows about Carol before he leaves. John later gives Roy a forged insurance policy in Auggie's name worth $100,000 with a blank beneficiary, and tells him to take it and go away.  John continues to have dreams and flashbacks to the shooting, including dreams in which he is in Auggie's place and gets shot after coming out with the bottle of wine. Lucy confesses to John that she got married to someone she didn't love after she started writing Auggie, but that the marriage had been annulled after four months after her husband found all of the letters to Auggie. She says she felt she had to tell him because he was so much more than she thought he would be. John decides to tell Lucy the truth. Devastated, she leaves.   John decides to officially end his life as John Nolan, selling his half of the business to his partner, Carl ([[Casey Biggs]]). As he leaves the office, he runs into his partner with a couple, whom he recognizes from the market. They ask his advice about the plan Carl recommended, and John tells the husband, "I think you should go home and make love to your wife and pray that nothing bad happens, and ask yourself each day, 'if it were to end right here right now, would it be enough?'" John even has a headstone put up for himself with the inscription "Free at last." He informs Decker about Roy's plan to rob the Transit Authority, and Roy is arrested for violating his parole while trying to cash the life insurance policy.   John goes back to work at the market. He is sent to the back to retrieve a bottle of wine and pauses, coming out cautiously. Instead of a gunman, he sees Lucy, who greets him with, "Hi, Auggie."

The two criminals then decide to pull off one last job.  The story is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], framed by the story of the pair's last robbery of the Alamo Bank, as told by ''Criminals at Large'', a fictional [[reality television]] show, with which they taped an interview stating that Kate was only a hostage, not a participant.  The show tells the story of their last job, which is known to be a failure when Kate tips off the police and the two are caught in the act. The two then begin to argue when Joe tells the police "You won't take us alive!" and the argument gets to the point where the two of them shoot each other dead.  At the end of the film the real story behind the last job is revealed: Harvey used some of his special effects to make it seem as though Terry and Joe were shooting each other. Harvey and his girlfriend then ran in dressed as paramedics and placed the stolen money, Terry, and Joe in body bags while Kate (who was in on the plan) distracts the police by pretending to pass out in shock upon seeing the "bodies."  In the ambulance, Harvey used electronics to blow out his tires which sent the ambulance into a junkyard. Under his jumpsuit, Harvey was wearing a fire suit. He lit himself on fire and rigged a bomb to go off. Harvey, Harvey's girlfriend, Terry, and Joe fled the scene, leading officials to believe the bodies were burned beyond recovery.  Kate received the $1 million reward for having turned them in.  Reunited, Joe, Terry, Harvey and Kate make it to Mexico to live out their dream. The last scene shows Harvey getting married in Mexico and Kate kissing Joe and Terry passionately.

Bagong Buwan
 Ahmad (Cesar Montano) belongs to the [[Moro people]] . While many of his kind are bent on fighting, thinking that Mindanao is only for the Muslims, Ahmad prefers to live a simple and peaceful life. He works as a doctor in Manila while his wife, Fatima (Amy Austria), and his only son, Ibrahim, stay in Mindanao with his mother, Farida (Caridad Sanchez). Ahmad is shocked and devastated when Fatima breaks the confounding news. Ibrahim was killed by a stray bullet when vigilantes indiscriminately fire at their village. Ahmad goes back to where he came from --- Mindanao.  Ibrahim’s death did not cause Ahmad to stop striving to live a peaceful life, much to the consternation of his brother, Musa (Noni Buencamino). His brother takes an exactly opposite stand. Musa believes in waging a war against all the ''Kaafir'' (unbelievers) who may impede the Moro’s goal of independence. He even trains his young son, Rashid (Carlo Aquino) to a [[Mujahideen|Muslim warrior’s]] life.  Ahmad wishes to bring his family to Manila in order to escape the conflict in Mindanao but convinces no one, even his mother. Farida is apparently used to a life of constantly running away from crossfire. His wife, Fatima, wishes to stay where the memory of his son remains. Ahmad is now challenged to continue his life’s vocation as a healer in his war-torn homeland.  One day, the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|MILF]] headed by Musa, together with Rashid, bombed a police station near a public marketplace. Francis (Jiro Manio), a young [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] boy, is separated from his parents during the confusion and follows Rashid. Rashid grudgingly takes Francis with him and introduces him to his co-villagers. Francis goes wherever Ahmad and his people go. Francis and Rashid, at their very young age, find themselves prejudiced against each other. The tribe leader was later slain in a crossfire between MILF and a battalion of soldiers sent to search the missing boy.  Ahmad’s group flees the war by evacuating their village and looking from one place or another for a safe haven in the hope of avoiding crossfire and finding a safe place to live in. Ahmad, in his new role as the leader, discovers the pain and suffering that innocent people have gone, and still, go through just because they find themselves in the middle of a war they never instigated.  Ahmad learns more about his own people. He learns about how the government takes them for granted. He learns about how the Moro, as a people, strive to fight for their rights and liberty. Ahmad also learns that in his veins still runs the blood of a Muslim and offers the ultimate sacrifice. He died in battle when Lt. Ricarte's men fired at Ahmad, killing him and crippling Ricarte.  Near the end, Musa and Rashid joins the rebels, Francis returned to his parents, and Fatima and Farida descended from the mountains to teach the kids what they learned. The two met in Ahmad's grave for a last time before departing, for good.  In the end, one realizes that "nobody really wins in a war. A just peace is better than a just war."

Shaan is of the best Gujjar kind, his name Shareef means, he is a God-fearing, peace-loving, humble sort of person even at things that may annoy people.  This ('Shareef Gujjar')'s best friend Bhola (pronounced Pohla) played by [[Moammar Rana]] is a loud, thoughtless buffoon who just about manages a ''[[paan]]'' stall. His greatest problem is his infatuation with the local prostitute Nirma. She does recognize true love in Bhola even if he isn't quite what she was hoping for. One day some villainous goons led by Saud and Cheema swagger into town and make their way to Nirma's ''[[Brothel|kotha]]'' (brothel) where she is booked to entertain. When Pohla hears of this indignity, he arrives at the Kotha where a terrible shoot-out follows. To cut a long story short, Nirma is saved from a life as a ''[[tawaif]]'' by Rana, who is then framed by the police and imprisoned.  Meanwhile, Cheema and Saud hunt for Nirma so that they can force her to return to the Kotha. Eventually their search for Nirma leads them to Rana's best buddy Shareef who is having a celebration for his brother who has just memorized every single word of the Holy scriptures, no less than a Herculean task. The goons gatecrash the celebrations and demand Nirma but when they are met with resistance, they gun down the celebrating lad mercilessly with no regard for his recent memorizing of the holy book. Finally 'Shareef Gujjar' realizes that in order to survive and compete in this horrid world, one has to have a change of name as well as a change of heart. So he announces very loudly no less than five times that he is now to be known as 'Badmash Gujjar' rather than 'Shareef Gujjar', and as if to prove his point he guns down about 60 policemen in the next 30 seconds.

The Nutcracker explains that he needs to find the Sugarplum Princess who is the only person who can stop the Mouse King from taking over his world.

Bartleby (2001 film)
 The film opens with a brief summary of Herman Melville's life; his popularity waning after he wrote [[Moby-Dick|"Moby Dick"]] and "Bartleby, the Scrivener", Melville was unable to support himself by writing and took a job as a clerk at the [[U.S. Custom House (New York City)|New York Custom House]]. By the time Melville died at the age of 72, hardly anyone had heard of him.  While on his way to work one day, the film's narrator, the unnamed head of a public records office (hereafter referred to as the Boss), sees a forlorn-looking man standing on an overpass. The Boss's office is in a building on top of a large hill, completely inaccessible by foot, and he employs three people: the neurotic and clumsy Ernest; Rocky, who looks and acts like a stereotypical gangster; and Vivian, an eccentric, flirtatious receptionist with a large vocabulary. The Boss decides to advertise for a fourth employee, but the only person who applies for the job is the man from the overpass, the titular Bartleby. Bartleby gives vague answers to the Boss's questions during the interview, but does explain that he worked at a [[dead letter office]] for eight years until the office moved. Bartleby's off-kilter attitude unsettles the Boss, but with no other options, he hires Bartleby.  Bartleby initially proves to be a model employee and a boon to the office, getting a week's worth of work done in only a few days, but when asked to help verify important documents, Bartleby refuses to do so, responding with what becomes his answer to every request and one of his only lines for the rest of the film: "I would prefer not to." To the Boss's dismay and irritation of the other employees, Bartleby refuses to do anything the Boss asks of him, performing his sole task of filing away documents and spending long periods of time staring at a vibrating vent above his desk. When the Boss brings a date to the office late one night to have sex with her, Bartleby walks in on them, leading the Boss to discover that he has started living there.  The Boss makes an attempt to reason with Bartleby and to learn something about him; he also realizes he and the other employees have started using the word "prefer" in their vocabulary. Bartleby soon refuses to do any more filing, now doing nothing at all and claiming that he's "given up", so the Boss fires Bartleby and gives him until Friday night to leave the office. When the Boss returns on Monday morning, he finds that Bartleby hasn't left, and indeed hasn't even touched the paycheck the Boss has given him. Tensions start to rise as the others wonder why Bartleby is still at the office. Realizing the threat to his reputation but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the Boss moves the office to another building. Before he leaves, he gives Bartleby a letter of recommendation, while a repairman removes a dead bird from the vent above Bartleby's desk, fixing the vibration.  However, the new tenants soon come to ask the Boss for help getting rid of Bartleby, who still has not left and now sits on the stairs all day and sleeps in the lobby at night. The Boss insists that Bartleby is no longer his problem, but relents under the pressure. Speaking to Bartleby again, the Boss offers to help him find a job he would like, but Bartleby refuses to budge. After the Boss leaves, Bartleby is arrested by the police and released onto the streets after a night in jail.   When the Boss learns of this, he goes searching for Bartleby and finds him at a homeless camp; to his own surprise, the Boss invites Bartleby to come live with him, but Bartleby declines the offer. The Boss rushes to a nearby soup kitchen and tries to convince a cook to make sure Bartleby gets fed, but the cook, unsympathetic to Bartleby's plight, refuses to help and forces the Boss to wait in a long line. By the time he returns with food, Bartleby has died from starvation, having preferred not to eat apparently since the Boss moved the office. Finding his letter of recommendation in Bartleby's coat, the Boss realizes it's a dead letter now, and gives the resigned and painful sigh, "Ah, Bartleby. Ah, humanity.", sinking into a depression and finding his way to the overpass from the beginning of the film.  A small subplot deals with Vivian becoming close to the Boss's benefactor, City Manager Frank Waxman. Before anything can come of their relationship, however, he catches her, Rocky, and Ernest making fun of Bartleby. Believing Bartleby to have some sort of mental disorder, Waxman takes the matter to the Mayor, and the Boss apparently becomes involved in a scandal.  Deeply affected by Bartleby's death, the Boss resigns from his job and writes a memoir about his time with Bartleby, but the publishing agent he shows it to refuses to publish it, finding the subject matter too dreary for her tastes. The Boss flies into a rage, demanding that Bartleby's story be told, and when the agent tells him to leave, the Boss responds "I would prefer not to!" Rattled by this, the agent leaves. Finally realizing the impact Bartleby has had on his own life, the Boss repeats the phrase again and again as the film closes with a shot of several office buildings, all isolated on top of large hills like the Boss's old office.

Their family includes a girl, boy, artist father, and campaigning mother, and a dog named [[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]], who they are keeping for a relative family. The children love Beethoven, but their parents do not, and want to get rid of him. So the children begin taking the dog to Obedience Training led by a former army sergeant. Brennan falls in love with a girl (Hayley), while Beethoven literally destroys the [[obstacle course]] in one day. To top it all off Beethoven hits the army sergeant in the groin with a leash causing him to kneel over in pain.  Meanwhile, the rich Sedgewick family owns a pampered pup that looks exactly like Beethoven, named Michelangelo. Michelangelo and young Madison Sedgewick are friends, but busy Mr. and Mrs. Sedgewick are always neglecting her. In fact, Mr. Sedgewick is the only one who seems to try to play with her. Beethoven, meanwhile, runs after a loose [[hot dog cart]], and ends up on a merry-go-round. Michelangelo has gotten loose and is now on the same [[merry-go-round]]. He is mistaken for Beethoven and taken home by Brennan and Sara. The real Beethoven is mistaken for Michelangelo, and grabbed by Simmons, the Sedgewick family [[butler]] and taken to their mansion.  Meanwhile, Sara is surprised when Michelangelo wipes his feet on the welcome mat and folds the napkins with his teeth at dinner. The Sedgewicks notice the change in "their dog" too, when he bolts Simmons to the ground to get a piece of [[turkey meat|turkey]]. Then, at night, Beethoven hears Madison whimpering because of a bad dream, and comforts her. At the next obedience class, Michelangelo leaves everyone in astonishment, by finishing the entire new obstacle course, while the sergeant is announcing about the course.  Meanwhile, Beethoven ruins a dinner party, when Nigel tries to kidnap him. A [[therapist]] points out to Mrs. Sedgewick that the reason "Michelangelo" is acting this way is because he is the first one exhibiting "symptoms". The therapist suggests that it may be because Mrs. Sedgewick doesn't care about anyone but herself. Meanwhile, Mr. Newton is concerned about "Beethoven", and starts acting out to get "Beethoven" to act out again too. He drinks toilet water, chases the mailman, etc. Michelangelo ends up catching on, and turns into a perfect clone of Beethoven.  Meanwhile, the Sedgewick family start playing fetch and swimming with Beethoven. But as the Sedgewicks and Beethoven are [[hiking]], Nigel (who turns out to be Simmons' sidekick) kidnaps Beethoven and locks him in a [[warehouse]], for a ransom of $250,000. But Beethoven breaks out and secretly switches places with Michelangelo at the obedience graduation. The real Michelangelo is found by the Sedgewicks, and Simmons and Nigel are put in jail. The real Beethoven is found by the Newtons, and he graduates. The Sedgewicks and Newtons then meet up at a fork on the road, though, they never find out about the switching of Beethoven and Michelangelo.  
Behind Enemy Lines (2001 film)
 During the [[Bosnian War]], United States Navy flight officer Lieutenant Chris Burnett and pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse, who are stationed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70)|USS ''Carl Vinson'']] in the [[Adriatic Sea]], are assigned an [[aerial reconnaissance]] mission by their commanding officer, Admiral Reigart. The mission goes smoothly until they spot suspicious activity in the [[demilitarized zone]] where NATO aircraft and the warring factions are prohibited from engaging in military activity. Burnett persuades Stackhouse to fly their [[Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornet]] off-course to get a close look and photograph the target. They are unaware that they photographed mass graves, and Serb soldiers see the jet. The local [[Republika Srpska (1992–95)|Bosnian Serb]] paramilitary commander, General Miroslav Lokar, is conducting a secret genocidal campaign against the local [[Bosniak]] population. Not wanting the mass graves to be discovered, Lokar orders the jet be shot down.  Despite trying to outmaneuver the missiles fired at them, their jet is hit and both men are forced to eject. Shortly after touching ground, a Serb patrol finds an injured Stackhouse and interrogate him. Stackhouse is then executed by Sasha, one of Lokar's right-hand men. Burnett, who was observing the Serbs' interrogation of Stackhouse from a hill, flees the area, but exposes his location. Wanting Burnett dead as well, Lokar orders both his deputy, Colonel Bazda, and Sasha to find him. After Burnett contacts Reigart for help, he orders Burnett to move to a certain location in order to be extracted. However, Reigart is forced to stand down after Admiral Piquet, the commander of NATO naval forces in the region, warns him that rescuing Burnett in the demilitarized zone risks derailing the peace process. When Burnett reaches the extraction point, Reigart informs him that he must move to another location miles outside of the demilitarized zone in order to be rescued.  Immediately after being informed, Burnett sees a Serb patrol, led by Bazda, looking for him. Running from them, he falls into the mass grave that he and Stackhouse had photographed and hides under a dead body. When the patrol is out of sight, he continues to run. On his way to the new extraction point, Burnett encounters a group of Bosniak guerrillas in a pickup truck who offer him a ride. The guerrillas inform Burnett that they are heading to Hač, which is supposedly a safe haven but turns out to be a war zone. During the battle, Serb troops believe that they have found Burnett's body, but Sasha realizes that Burnett had switched uniforms with a dead Serb soldier and escaped Hač.  The Serbs turn the situation to their advantage, presenting the corpse wearing Burnett's uniform to the media, and saying he was killed by guerrillas. The ruse works and a mission to rescue Burnett is aborted. However, Burnett notices an angel statue near where his ejection seat landed. He returns to his seat and activates the rescue beacon. Though the carrier group notices his signal and positively identifies him, Burnett has also alerted the Serbs to his location.  Knowing he risks being relieved of command, Reigart prepares a task force to rescue Burnett in open defiance of Piquet's orders. Meanwhile, Bazda and Sasha are ordered by Lokar to find Burnett and kill him, but on their way, Bazda steps on a landmine and Sasha abandons him to his fate. The mine eventually explodes, alerting Burnett that someone is following him. After Sasha finds the ejection seat, Burnett ambushes him and the two men engage in hand-to-hand combat until Burnett stabs Sasha. Immediately after Sasha is killed, Lokar arrives with armored vehicles and infantry who open fire on Burnett. After retrieving the hard drive containing the photos of the mass graves, Burnett escapes with the task force.  The footage Burnett retrieved leads to the arrest and conviction of Lokar for war crimes including genocide, while Reigart's actions result in him being relieved of command and his eventual retirement. Burnett continues his career in the Navy.  
Behind the Sun (film)
 The year is 1910; the place, the badlands of [[Northeast Region, Brazil]]. Twenty-year-old Tonho is the middle son of an impoverished farm [[family]], the Breves. He is next in line to kill and then die in an ongoing blood feud with a neighboring clan, the Ferreiras. For generations, the two families have quarreled over land. Now they are locked into a series of tit-for-tat assassinations of their sons; an eye-for-an-eye, a tooth-for-a-tooth. Embedded in this choreography of death is a particular code of ethics: "Blood has the same volume for everyone. You have no right to take more blood than was taken from you." Life is suffused with a sense of futility and stoic despair.  Under pressure from his father, Tonho kills one of the Ferreira sons to avenge the murder of his older [[brother]]. This act marks him as the next victim. Tonho's younger brother is addressed only as "the Kid" by the family. Anticipating future loss, his parents don't give him a name.

The Kid's love encourages Tonho to question his fate. When Tonho meets Clara, a charming itinerant circus girl, all of life's possibilities open up for him.  The film is narrated by "The Kid" who is later given a name by Clara and her stepfather, the traveling circus performers.  They call him "Pacu" and he spends the whole film narrating which ultimately drives the viewers to identify and allows the film to humanize the characters.  Later, Pacu and Tonho visit the circus in town, with Tonho forming a relationship with Clara. Clara later leaves her stepfather to be with Tonho, arriving at the farm to be with him. The two sleep together before she departs, telling Tonho to meet her in the east by the ocean. One of the Ferreira men come to the farm in order to exact revenge on the Breves, initially appearing to kill Tonho. However, it is revealed that they actually shot and killed Pacu, devastating the Breves.  The father tells Tonho to get the gun in order to kill all of the remaining Ferreiras in retaliation. Tonho, realizing that his life with his family is destroyed, walks off without a word. His father attempts to shoot him for disregarding the honor of their family, but he is stopped by the mother who insists that the feud no longer matters and that it's over. Tonho arrives on a beach, staring at the sea with an expression of melancholic wonder on his face.

He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by his mysterious supervisor, William Parcher (Harris) of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. He is to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns and believes he is followed when he delivers his results to a secret mailbox.  Meanwhile, a student, [[Alicia Nash|Alicia Larde]] (Connelly), asks him to dinner, and the two fall in love. On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into Charles and his niece, Marcee (Cardone). With Charles' encouragement, he proposes to Alicia and they marry.  Nash begins to fear for his life after witnessing a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, but Parcher blackmails him into staying on his assignment. While delivering a guest lecture at [[Harvard University]], Nash tries to flee from people he thinks are foreign Russian agents, led by Dr. Rosen (Plummer). After punching Rosen in an attempt to flee, Nash is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility he believes is run by the Soviets.  Dr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and finally confronts Nash with the unopened documents he had delivered to the secret mailbox. Nash is given a course of [[insulin shock therapy]] and eventually released. Frustrated with the [[Adverse drug reaction|side-effects]] of the [[antipsychotic]] medication he is taking, which make him lethargic and unresponsive, he secretly stops taking it. This causes a relapse and he meets Parcher again.  Shortly afterward, Alicia discovers Nash is once again working on his "assignment." Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes into the house to find Nash left their baby unsupervised and nearly submerged in the tub, which had been filling with water. Nash claims that Charles was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash believes Parcher is trying to kill her. He rushes in to push Parcher away, and accidentally knocks Alicia and the baby to the ground. As Alicia flees the house with their baby, Nash jumps in front of Alicia's car and begs her to stay. Nash tells her that he realizes that he has never seen Marcee age, even though he's known her for three years. He finally accepts that Parcher and other figures are hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen's advice, Nash decides not to restart his medication, believing that he can deal with his symptoms himself. Alicia decides to stay and support him in this.  Nash returns to Princeton and approaches his old rival, Hansen, now head of the mathematics department. He grants Nash permission to work out of the library and to [[Academic audit|audit classes]]. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations. By the late 1970s, he is allowed to teach again.  In 1994, Nash wins the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] for his revolutionary work on [[game theory]], and is honored by his fellow professors. The movie ends as Nash, Alicia, and their son leave the auditorium in Stockholm; Nash sees Charles, Marcee, and Parcher standing to one side and watching him.  
Beijing Bicycle
 Guei (played by [[Cui Lin (actor)|Cui Lin]]) is a seventeen-year-old country boy who came to [[Beijing]] to make a living.<ref>Full name is '''Guo Liangui''', if written in [[hanyu pinyin]] without tone marks. In the English subtitles "Guei" is used instead.</ref> Along with a number of other boys from the country, Guei finds employment with a courier company, which assigns them brand-new bicycles for use in their deliveries. The company manager ([[Xie Jian]]) announces to them that since the bicycles do not yet belong to them, they will only earn twenty percent of the commission. But once they have made enough deliveries to earn the bicycles, their share will be raised to fifty percent. Within two months Guei has made enough to earn his bicycle. However, on the day that Guei is due to take over the ownership, the bicycle is stolen while he is picking up a document. The manager fires Guei for neglecting to deliver the package, but, upon the latter's pleas, agrees to take him back if he succeeds in recovering his bicycle.  At the other end of the city, Jian ([[Li Bin (actor)|Li Bin]]) is a seventeen-year-old schoolboy who longs for a bicycle of his own so he can ride with Xiao ([[Gao Yuanyuan]]), the girl he fancies.<ref>Name given in dialogue is '''Xiaoxiao'''.</ref> His hopes are dashed when his father ([[Zhao Yiwei]]) delays buying a bicycle for him yet again so that his younger stepsister Rong Rong ([[Zhou Fanfei]]) can go to a prestigious school. This frustrates Jian, who steals some money from his family and pays 500 [[Renminbi|yuan]] to a second-hand dealer for a bicycle—the one that used to belong to Guei.  Meanwhile, the stubborn Guei embarks on a search for his bicycle. By chance, his friend Mantis ([[Liu Lei]]) spots Jian with the bicycle. Guei tries to make off with the bicycle but is stopped by Jian and his gang of schoolboys. The determined Guei follows Jian home and steals back the bicycle from where Jian hides it. The manager keeps his promise and takes Guei back. However, when Guei shows up at the courier company on another day, he finds Jian and his gang waiting for him. He tries to escape but the gang chases him down and, after giving him a beating, forcibly re-takes the bicycle.  When Jian returns home, he finds his father waiting for him at the door, along with Guei. Thinking that his son was the bicycle thief, the enraged father gives Jian a rapping and lets Guei take his bicycle. However, Jian and his gang track down Guei again the next day and after long hours of negotiation, the two sides reach a pact: Guei and Jian are to share the bicycle, each entitled to the use of it on alternate days. This arrangement persists for some days until Jian finds out that Xiao has fallen for Da Huan (Li Shuang), a bicycle freestylist. Jian hits his rival with a brick and rides off.  At their usual meeting place, Jian hands the bicycle to Guei and tells the latter that he does not need it any more. Meanwhile, Da Huan, along with his gang, comes after Jian on their bikes. Jian and Guei make off together but are cornered by Da Huan and his gang, who give both of them a serious beating. As the gang leaves, one member stays behind to wreck Guei's bicycle. In a rare burst of rage, Guei picks up a brick and smashes the head of his attacker, who collapses. Carrying his battered bicycle on his shoulder, Guei walks back alone.

The Believer (film)
 Daniel Balint is a former [[Jewish]] [[yeshiva]] student, brilliant but troubled, who is now a fanatically violent [[neo-Nazi]] in [[New York City|New York]] in his early twenties. As a child, he often challenged his teachers with unorthodox interpretations of scripture. He once argued that the [[Binding of Isaac]] was not about [[Abraham]]'s faith but God's power: that God did not want Abraham to accomplish a particular task but instead asks unquestioning obedience, which Abraham refuses to give. He concluded that God is a [[Bullying|bully]].  Daniel finds a meeting of [[Fascism|fascists]] run by Curtis Zampf and Lina Moebius, where he also makes a connection with Lina's daughter Carla. Daniel advocates killing Jews, and a banker named Manzetti in particular, but Curtis and Lina oppose harming Jews on practical if not moral grounds. Impressed with Daniel's intelligence, Lina invites him to their camp retreat in the country. Afterward, Daniel and his fellow neo-Nazi friends pick a fight with two [[African-American]] men, get arrested, and are bailed out of jail by Carla. He spends the night with her but returns to the home of his ailing father. Daniel searches his Hebrew school notebooks and finds a semiautomatic pistol. He is harangued by his sister Linda for his Nazi beliefs, but she also urges him to stay and have ''[[Shabbat]]'' dinner with their father. The men watch television, which is forbidden, leading them to commiserate on the incomprehensibility of Jewish law.  Guy Danielsen, a journalist writing an article on hate groups in the wake of the [[Oklahoma City Bombing]], meets Daniel for an interview. He listens to Daniel's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rant, then reveals that he had been in contact with Daniel's old rabbi Stanley Nadelman and knows that Daniel is Jewish. Daniel pulls out his pistol and threatens to commit [[suicide]] if Guy publishes the truth.  Daniel goes to Lina's fascist camp retreat, where he meets Drake, a skilled marksman, along with an explosives expert. Six of the retreat participants, including Daniel, go to a Jewish deli, where they mock the other patrons and torment the owner about Jewish dietary laws until a fight breaks out. After this fight, Daniel and his friends are required by a court to take sensitivity training, where they listen to the experiences of [[Holocaust]] survivors. One talks about how his infant son was murdered by a Nazi. Daniel is enraged that the man did nothing to save his son, but all the survivors assert that Daniel would also have done nothing to avoid being killed, and he walks out in anger.  The story will haunt him, and he imagines himself as both the Nazi and the Jew. Later that night, Daniel and the other neo-Nazis break into a [[synagogue]], vandalize it, and plant a bomb under the pulpit. They also tear, trample, and spit on a [[Torah]] scroll, though Daniel protests. After they leave, Daniel takes the scroll and a [[tallit]] with him. The next morning, the neo-Nazis hear on the news that the bomb failed to go off because the timer froze at thirteen minutes, which the rabbi explains is [[Significance of numbers in Judaism#13|a mystical number]] in Judaism. He says that he believes this means that God protected the synagogue. Back in his cabin, Daniel cleans and repairs the scroll, envisioning himself as the Nazi soldier in the Holocaust survivor's story. He puts on the tallit under his shirt and performs a combination of the [[Nazi salute]] and a [[Torah reading#Hagbaha|gesture used in Jewish prayers]].  Drake soon approaches him with a plan to kill Manzetti, so the two ambush him outside a temple, where Daniel fires but misses. Drake sees the tallit under Daniel's shirt and realizes that he is a Jew, so Daniel shoots him and escapes. He continues to meet with Lina and Curtis, who want to start an above-ground movement to bring fascism into the political mainstream, inviting Jews, blacks, and liberals. Daniel reluctantly agrees to help them raise funds. At the meetings that follow Daniel first charms, then enrages, their potential donors with his intellectual games, leading to his eventual expulsion. When the group hears that Manzetti was killed, Lina suspects Daniel, since he proposed the assassination, but Drake is the real killer.  In the meantime, Carla comforts Daniel and the two sleep together at his home. When she sees the stolen Torah, she asks Daniel to teach her [[Hebrew]], ostensibly for intellectual reasons. They also begin to practice Jewish rituals. He soon runs into an old friend and his fiancée, Stuart and Miriam, who invite him to a [[Rosh Hashanah]] service, assuming that he is an [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice|anti-racist skinhead]]. When Daniel arrives, another old friend calls him out as a racist skinhead. As he is leaving, Miriam, who works for the [[District Attorney]], tells him that half of the people in Lina Moebius' meetings are informants for the D.A. Later she asks Daniel to record conversations at a meeting so she can help him with possible charges stemming from the Manzetti killing. He refuses because as Miriam confesses she doesn't care about the truth, she only cares about Daniel.  As [[Yom Kippur]] approaches, Daniel calls Miriam and insists on taking Stuart's place [[Torah reading|reading the Torah]] at the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] on Yom Kippur. He and his friends plant a new bomb under the temple's pulpit even though they find it reinforced, limiting the explosion. When Daniel takes the pulpit the next day, he is shocked to see Carla in the congregation. He again imagines himself in the story the Holocaust survivor told him, this time as both the Nazi and the Jew. With five minutes to go, Daniel stops and tells to everyone to get out because there is a bomb, but refuses to leave himself.  Daniel is shown in a mystical vision, ascending the stairs in the Jewish school he left as a child. His old teacher approaches, hoping to talk about the Binding of Isaac, and suggests that Isaac died on the mountain and was reborn in the next world. But Daniel ignores him and keeps going, up, and up, infinitely, as his teacher urges him to stop, calling out, "There's nothing up there."

In response, the U.S. Army deploys three of its [[Special forces|special operations forces]] &ndash; [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Rangers]], [[Delta Force]] counter-terrorist operators, and [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th SOAR - Night Stalkers]] aviators &ndash; to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president of the country.  To consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments, while the UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture [[Osman Atto|Osman Ali Atto]], a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. A mission is planned to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers.

Black Knight (film)
 Jamal Walker ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is an everyday slacker with a job at a crummy [[theme park]] called Medieval World, which is about to receive big competition from another theme park, Castle World. While cleaning a [[moat]] surrounding the park, he finds a [[medallion]] in the moat and when he tries to retrieve it he gets sucked into the past. He awakes in 14th century [[England]], 1328, where he is first met by a drunkard named Knolte ([[Tom Wilkinson]]). He then searches for Medieval World, but he finds a castle that he thinks is Castle World, so he decides to check it out. The tenants of the castle believe him to be a [[France|French]] [[Moors|Moor]], from [[Normandy]], because he tells them he is from [[Florence Avenue|Florence]] and [[Normandie Avenue|Normandie]], a famous intersection in [[South Central Los Angeles]].  Jamal is soon taken in by the reigning king, King Leo ([[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]). He is assumed to be a messenger from Normandy who the king believes to be bringing news of an alliance between England and Normandy. Although at first Jamal thinks that all the people around him are just actors in a theme park he changes his mind when he witnesses a [[beheading]]. He gives his name as Jamal [[Skywalker|"Sky" Walker]] after his high school basketball nickname, and, after gaining trust from the king by accidentally preventing his [[assassination]], Jamal is made a lord and head of security. While all of this is going on, Jamal finds out about the ruthless way the king came to power by overthrowing the former queen. He learns from Victoria ([[Marsha Thomason]]), a [[maid|chambermaid]], and Sir Knolte, who was a former knight of the queen. Through their help and his own realization of the situation, Jamal soon understands he must help overthrow King Leo and help restore the queen to her throne.  With some effort, Jamal manages to convince the decimated rebels and townsfolk to band together to overthrow the king. Using modern-day tactics used in [[American football]] and [[pro wrestling]], he gives the peasants the means to fight the armed and armored king's guards. Out of gratitude for helping him find his honor again, Knolte teaches some basic sword-fighting maneuvers to Jamal, and also tells him that he has an idea that may give them an advantage in the upcoming battle.  The next day, Knolte and the rebels storm the castle, only to find themselves quickly surrounded by guards and Leo's bodyguard, Percival ([[Vincent Regan]]). The tide turns briefly when the legendary [[Black knight|Black Knight]] charges in, breathing fire and scattering the guards, but the plan goes awry when he falls from his horse and is revealed to be Jamal in disguise. Using their newfound skills, the peasants succeed in overpowering the guards, but Knolte is severely wounded by a [[longbow]] shot from Percival, who takes Victoria hostage. King Leo is scared since his troops are being defeated, and asks Percival for safety. Percival, who already sees Leo as pathetic and weak as a leader, kills him and throws him in the moat. Charging to the rescue, Jamal surprises Percival with his fighting skills, rescuing Victoria. Percival is then shot dead by Knolte before he could administer a killing blow to Jamal.

Blackwoods (film)
 Matt Sullivan ([[Patrick Muldoon]])  travels with his girlfriend, Dawn ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]) from their urban residence in Denver on a [[Tourism|vacation]] to the Blackwoods of Colorado, only to discover a motel run by a motel clerk, Greg ([[Clint Howard]]), a deranged [[family]], and a horrific secret.  Matt is haunted by the death of a girl from a car accident he caused years ago. Matt was drunk and as he reached for the car radio, he struck the girl as she crossed the road. The guilt that he feels has altered his sense of reality, making Matt's life a mystery full of shadows and phantoms. Now, years later Matt goes away for weekend with his new girlfriend Dawn.  During a stopover in a small town, Matt and Dawn have lunch at a local diner where he notices several of the locals staring oddly at him. On the road, Matt is pulled over by the local sheriff, Harding ([[Michael Paré]]) who asks Matt who he is and what he is doing passing through the town. After Matt explains about his private getaway Sheriff Harding lets him go.  Matt checks into a local motel where he interacts with the debauched motel clerk and owner Greg who tries to overcharge him for his room for the night. A little later, after a wild session of lovemaking, Dawn goes for a walk. While she is away, a strange man with an ax comes into the motel room and attacks Matt who escapes. Matt calls the police where Sheriff Harding shows up and after finding no one around, openly suspects Matt of having an agenda to the suspicions of his story. After the sheriff lets Matt go, again without arresting him, Matt phones his friend Jim ([[Will Sanderson]]) where he tells him about Dawn's disappearance and asks Jim to come to his aid.  After that incident Matt goes into the woods, looking for Dawn. There he encounters Dawn's family who tie him down and put him on trial for the murder of the girl years before. It turns out that Dawn is the twin sister of Molly, the young girl that Matt ran over with his car years earlier after he was driving drunk following an argument with his former girlfriend. The backwoods Franklin family find Matt guilty and he is sent back into the forest to be hunted down by the family. The deeper Matt runs into the forest the farther his mind is lost to the Blackwoods.<ref>[http://www.toastedpixel.com/archives/9-21-05.html Uwe Boll's Blackwoods Film Review - Toasted Pixel]</ref>  Matt manages to ambush and kill two of the family members, Jack and John, pursuing him through the woods. But the film's climatic twist comes when Jim appears after having tracked Matt down and Matt suddenly kills Jim, after thinking that he too is in league with the Franklin family. It turns out that Matt's girlfriend 'Dawn' is only a figment of his imagination. All of the interactions with Dawn and the rest of the family were fabrications that stemmed from Matt's guilt of running over the young woman years earlier and Matt at this point as become totally deranged and paranoid.  Sheriff Harding follows some leads that Matt told him earlier into the woods and to the old Franklin house which is unoccupied and in disrepair (confirming that Matt's "trial" was indeed fabricated in his head). Harding finds Jim's dead body and then chases Matt through the woods to arrest him, only for Matt to run onto a main road where he is run over by a speeding truck and killed. The final scene shows Sheriff Harding telling his story to Beth, the waitress at the local diner, and how Matt's mental instability led to him dreaming up this waking nightmare about Dawn, her family, and of the other encounters in the Blackwoods.

Later Jeremiah, who is Patrick and Bill's father as well as Tia's stepfather, finds out about Patrick and the gang's plan to open the club at Bones' old building. He freaks out and demands that Patrick and the others leave the building. Patrick, Bill and Tia refuse his request and open the nightclub, in spite of their father's objections.

Patrick, Cynthia, Bill, and Pearl go underground to find that Jimmy Bones' body has disappeared. Pearl tells them that in order to put Jimmy to rest, they have to destroy the dress she wore the night Jimmy was murdered which was buried alongside him as his blood which splattered onto it still contains his spirit and is the only thing keeping him anchored to the world of the living. As they look for Jimmy, Pearl steps in the elevator which closes and goes up. Meanwhile, Jeremiah asks Jimmy what he wants. He asks Jeremiah if he could give him his life back.

As Cynthia is lured to Pearl and Jimmy, Patrick hears his father's voice in a mirror begging for help. When Patrick hesitates, Jeremiah chokes him. Patrick uses his knife to chop Jeremiah's arm off and he disappears into hell. Patrick goes after Jimmy, who disappears and reappears behind Patrick's back much more demonic-looking. He grabs Patrick by his throat, as Cynthia begs him to let go. Pearl, realizing what is happening, tells Jimmy she loves him before grabbing a candle and setting fire to the dress while still wearing it.  As Jimmy and Pearl both die together, Patrick and Cynthia make their escape, barely making it out before the entire building collapses. Before jumping to safety, Cynthia is breifly pulled back into the building by an unseen force. Outside, Patrick finds an old picture of Jimmy and Pearl as Jimmy's face turns to him and says "Dog eat dog, boy."

The Body (2001 film)
  Dr. Sharon Golban (Williams) finds an ancient skeleton in Jerusalem in a rich man's tomb. Coloration of the wrist and ankle bones indicates the cause of death was [[crucifixion]]. Several artifacts, including a gold coin bearing the marks of [[Pontius Pilate]] and a jar dating to 32 AD, date the tomb to the year [[Jesus|Christ]] died. Faint markings on the skull consistent with thorns, the absence of broken leg bones, occupational markers suggesting the deceased was a carpenter, and a nick on the ribs from a pointed object lead authorities to suspect that these could be the bones of Christ. The different reactions of politicians, clerics, religious extremists—some prepared to use terror to gain their ends—to the religious, cultural and political implications of the find, make life difficult and dangerous for the investigators as they seek to unearth the truth.  Father Matt Gutierrez is assigned by the Vatican to investigate the case and to protect the [[Christian faith]]. He sets out to prove that the bones are not those of Jesus, but as there is more and more evidence to support the claim, his faith begins to waver. Troubled by the case, he turns to Father Lavelle (Derek Jacobi) who commits suicide because he cannot reconcile the scientific evidence with his faith. This event causes Father Gutierrez to turn from his faith, but he comes back to it in the end. He also comes to understand that it is the [[Catholic Church]] that he is protecting and not the faith, and decides to resign from his priesthood.

Bolivia (film)

La Brassiere
 The film's underlying plot is to create the "ultimate [[brassiere]]" for a [[Japan]]ese company specialising in this undergarment, hence the fanciful title. Samantha ([[Carina Lau]]), who is managing the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of the company, is the project leader of this assignment and she appoints two zany but highly creative designers to aid her in that project, Wayne ([[Louis Koo]]) and Johnny ([[Sean Lau|Lau Ching-wan]]). Johnny flirts with Samantha soon enough, being engaged in such a work, which he claims would assist in his creative powers although the story was more engaged in the humorous efforts in creating the bra. However, Samantha snubbed his overtures and their love affair remained in balance.  Meanwhile, during the project various prototypes were tried and tested, but with appalling results. Apparently, Wayne and Johnny being both male were unable to realise the finer points of creating the undergarment. Lena ([[Gigi Leung]]), a lover of Wayne and also working on the project then got the inspiration that the "ultimate bra" is the one which incorporates the feeling a woman has when her male lover lovingly supports her [[breast]]s. Accordingly, the two designers created just such an undergarment and was approved by their Japanese employers.  
Bridget Jones's Diary (film)
 Bridget Jones (Renée Zellweger) is 32 years old, single, very accident-prone, and worried about her weight.

At a New Year party hosted by her parents, she re-encounters Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), the [[barrister]] son of her parents' friends. They had known each other as children. After their initial encounter, Mark thinks that Bridget is a fool and vulgar and Bridget thinks that he is arrogant and rude, and is disgusted by his novelty [[Christmas]] [[Sweater|jumper]]. After overhearing Mark grumble to his mother about her attempts to set him up with "a verbally incontinent spinster who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother", she decides to turn her life around. She starts her own diary, which covers all her attempts to stop smoking, lose weight and find her Mr. Right.  Bridget and Daniel begin to flirt heavily at work, first over email, ahead of an important book launch, at which Bridget bumps into Mark and his glamorous but haughty colleague Natasha ([[Embeth Davidtz]]). Bridget leaves with Daniel and they have dinner, despite the fact that he is a notorious womaniser with a questionable personality, of which Bridget is aware. Bridget learns from Daniel that he and Mark have a history and, as a result, hate each other. Daniel informs Bridget of their falling-out, telling her that Mark broke their friendship by sleeping with Daniel's fiancée.  Bridget is invited to a family party, and she takes Daniel along as her "plus one". They spend the day before the party at a country house hotel, where Mark and Natasha are also staying. Daniel, having to spend the day working, is not able to attend and sends Bridget to the party alone. However, his dubious character becomes clearer to Bridget when she returns home from the party to find Daniel with another woman, a colleague of his, Lara ([[Lisa Barbuscia]]), and Bridget cuts ties with him soon after. Bridget begins to search for a new job and after landing a job in television, quits her role at the publishing house without giving notice. Daniel makes a desperate attempt to convince Bridget to stay, only for her to retort that she would "rather have a job wiping [[Saddam Hussein]]'s arse."  Bridget has a long-standing invitation to a friend's dinner party, where she is the only single person and distraught to see Mark and Natasha seated at the table. During the party, Mark privately confesses to Bridget that, despite her faults, he likes her "just as you are." He later helps Bridget to achieve an exclusive TV interview in a landmark legal case.  Bridget begins to develop feelings for Mark, and he comes to her rescue at her birthday dinner party at her flat in [[Borough Market|Borough]], which she is disastrously attempting to cater for herself. Daniel drunkenly visits, temporarily claiming Bridget's attention. Mark leaves the party, but returns to face Daniel. Mark punches Daniel and the two fight. They end up in a nearby restaurant and finally smash through the window, landing on the street. Mark wins the battle and knocks Daniel out. Bridget chides Mark for being mean and he leaves, but after an insensitive appeal by Daniel, she also rejects him emphatically.  In the meantime, Bridget's mother, Pamela ([[Gemma Jones]]) temporarily leaves Bridget's father, Colin ([[Jim Broadbent]]) and begins an affair with a perma-tanned shopping channel presenter named Julian. After the affair is over and she has reconciled with Colin, she returns to the Jones family home and unintentionally reveals a truth: that Mark and Daniel's falling-out resulted from Daniel (who was Mark's best friend at [[Cambridge University]]) seducing Mark's wife, not the other way around, as Daniel had led Bridget to believe.  At the Darcys' ruby wedding anniversary party the same day, Bridget confesses her feelings for Mark, only to find out that he and Natasha are both leaving to accept jobs in New York. Bridget interrupts the toast to their pending engagement with a stuttering but moving speech about England losing one of its finest men. Her words clearly have an effect on Mark, but he still flies to New York, though with obvious misgivings. Bridget's friends rally to repair her broken heart with a surprise trip to Paris, and just as they are about to leave, Mark appears at Bridget's flat.  When they are about to kiss for the first time, Bridget goes to her bedroom to change into sexier underwear. While Bridget is changing, Mark peeks at her diary, in which she has written many insults about him. Bridget returns to find that he has left. Realising that he had read her diary and that she might lose him again, Bridget runs outside after him in the snow with a thin sweater and tiger skin-print underwear. Unable to find him, she is disheartened and is about to return home when Mark appears having bought a new diary for Bridget in order "to make a fresh start." They kiss in the snow-covered streets. Bridget then notes that "nice boys don't kiss like that," to which Mark, contrary to his uptight nature, retorts "Oh yes they fucking do."  
The Breed (2001 film)
 In an unidentified, vaguely totalitarian future, Detective Stephen Grant ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]) investigates a series of strange murders; his partner is killed by a pale man in black who can survive bullet wounds, tosses Grant through a window, and climb up walls like a reptile.  After Grant reports the incident, his superiors introduce him to another officer, Aaron Gray ([[Adrian Paul]]).  Grant learns that vampires exist—Gray is one of them—and plan to gradually integrate themselves with the rest of humanity.  One of these vampires is responsible for the murders and the other vampires want to help catch the perpetrator.  Aiding the officers is a female vampire named [[Lucy Westenra]] (played by [[Bai Ling]]).   Lucy Westenra and Detective Grant eventually become lovers and this complicates the lives of the police officer and the beautiful female vampire as later circumstances seem to implicate everyone's hidden agenda, betrayal, and deception. All the various human and vampire characters seem to be up to something sneaky and questionable as the movie progresses.  In absolute secrecy, humans have created a virus that is capable of killing only vampires while leaving humanity unharmed. The virus is made as a failsafe device, in case the plan to coexist between vampires and humans fails. Hidden in a veil of deceit, the elder vampire makes a cynical plan to eradicate humanity if they won't take the cure made from vampire blood and become vampire themselves. The vampire leader believed that as long as humans and vampires remain separate races, there will always be conflict and warfare. He forces the creator of the vampire virus to alter the nature of the virus, making it deadly to humans and not to vampires. The virus creator, Dr. Fleming, doesn't seem to need all that much coercion to make a human biological weapon, as he wanted immortality and the Elder vampire was all too happy to manipulate him. Dr. Fleming pulls a gun and tries to eliminate the police officers when they discover his collaboration with the vampire leader. The vampire leader kills Fleming to silence him when the plot starts to unravel.   A renegade vampire resistance leader mistrusts human-vampire cooperation and would use any excuse to start his human-vampire war to determine who would control the world. On the government side, Seward also mistrusts coexistence and would later order government troops to set up an ambush to attack the vampire migrants, and the vampire police force escorting them.   Only due to the trust between the human police officers and their vampire allies is the deadly virus plot brought to an end. The subplot of the vampire renegade leader and the overly zealous government agent Seward were also resolved without a bloody war. The high-ranking government director ordered Seward to stand down his troops. It's also implied that the surviving vampire leadership reined in the wild vampire renegades with vampire police forces. Human Detective Grant and Vampire Officer Grey become permanent police partners at the end of the movie. Grant and Lucy Westenra seem to have become a romantic couple, and he even moves into her luxurious mansion.  
Brian's Song (2001 film)
 Brian and Gale aren't friends in the beginning; in fact they are rivals. Brian, during their first season together with pro football's [[Chicago Bears]], is always one-upped by Gale, never being in the spotlight. After the season, Brian pledges to outplay Gale and take his position on the team.  During their second season, Gale is still the Bears' starting running back. After he is injured during a game and loses hope of ever playing again, Brian personally takes charge of his [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], on the basis that if Gale gives up, and Brian rises to the top, he would have made it only on a chance and not by his own prowess. The two bond during this time, soon becoming good friends and roommates.  Brian is diagnosed with [[cancer]]. The treatments and [[radiation therapy]] only do so much, and every time it seems as if everything is getting better, the cancer shows up again, someplace else. Brian dies from the disease at age 26. During this time, Gale stays by his side.  
Bubble Boy (film)
 Born without an immune system, Jimmy Livingston is forced to live in a sterilized dome in his bedroom, earning him the title "Bubble Boy" by his neighbors. Jimmy's overbearing and devout [[Christian]] mother only exposes him to ''[[Highlights for Children|Highlights]]'' magazine and the ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'' for entertainment. When he is a teenager, a girl named Chloe moves in next door. Jimmy is immediately taken with her, and eventually befriends her despite his mother's discouragement.  Chloe visits Jimmy and tells him that she is leaving for [[Niagara Falls]] to marry her  boyfriend, Mark, in three days. Jimmy  realizes that Chloe cares for him. Realizing how much he cares for her, Jimmy builds a mobile bubble suit and runs away from home, determined to stop the wedding.  On the first day of his journey, he's unable to afford a bus ride to Niagara Falls, but is picked up by an overly enthusiastic cult on a pilgrimage towards enlightenment. By this time, Jimmy's mother has discovered her son missing, so she and her husband set off to find Jimmy.  While traveling through the desert, Jimmy meets Slim, a  biker with a flat tire. Jimmy offers to fix the flat with some patches and the two become friends. Elsewhere, Gil, the leader of the cult Jimmy met, has revealed that their messiah is "the round one," and that whoever rejects him will suffer. The group who abandoned Jimmy set off to find him. Jimmy and Slim have traveled to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for traveling money. However, Slim gets caught up in the Vegas life so Jimmy goes on without him. The cult runs into Slim in Vegas while asking for directions. Slim recognizes them from Jimmy's story and threatens them, only to have his bike destroyed by the cult bus.  Soon Jimmy accidentally boards a train belonging to Dr. Phreak, a small man who collects freaks and shows them off to the public for money. When Dr. Phreak tried to require Jimmy to his show, Jimmy knocks him unconscious; allowing for Jimmy and the freaks to go their own way.        Jimmy then wanders into a restaurant where an Indian man name Pushpop is being antagonized by the ignorant townspeople. When Jimmy tries to defend him, the townspeople begin to probe him about his suit, but panic and evacuate the restaurant when they misunderstand his illness. Pushpop thanks Jimmy for his earlier kindness and agrees to take him to Niagara Falls. Meanwhile, Jimmy's parents have met up with Dr. Phreak, whom Jimmy's mother mistakes for a child and brings along with them. Elsewhere in Niagara Falls, Chloe is apprehensive about marrying Mark and can't stop thinking of Jimmy.  To earn money for a taxi driver name Pappy to take him to New York, Jimmy goes into a Chinese casino nearby and enters a mud wrestling competition for a prize of $500. Having won the prize, Jimmy is spotted and picked up by the cult bus as he heads back to the taxi. Luckily, the freaks have followed Jimmy and realizing he's in danger, disguise themselves as members of the cult and trick them into believing they're mutating for their earlier crimes against Jimmy. As Jimmy and the freaks try to escape, Slim and his gang arrive in Pushpop's ice cream truck (which they took after the cult's bus destroy all their bikes) and take Jimmy from the freaks thinking they belonged to the cult. A fight breaks out between the cult, Slim's gang and the freaks that Jimmy uses the distraction to escapes with Pappy.      On the last day of his journey, Pappy and Jimmy have now arrived in [[New York State|New York]], but Pappy is unresponsive, having apparently died behind the wheel overnight, forcing Jimmy to abandon the moving taxi before it crashes.  Jimmy tries to call Chloe to tell her of his success, only to reach her fiance Mark, who rudely convinces him that Chloe doesn't really love him.  Jimmy becomes depressed at this assumed rejection and calls Dr. Phreak, ready to assume his role as a freak like the others. Learning Jimmy contacted Dr. Phreak about his location, Jimmy's parents throw Dr. Phreak out of their car realizing he was a rude man.   When his parents pick him up, Jimmy and his father are sitting alone in the car.  His father regrets that Jimmy is giving up when he is so close.  Jimmy's father then looks the other way while Jimmy escapes to finish his mission. With the help of Pappy's twin brother Pippy, Jimmy flies to the wedding. His mother tries to stop him from taking off, but the cult, the freaks and Slim's gang collide in helping Jimmy and stop her. Its revealed that Slim and Jimmy's mother knew each other in the past as she's the "Wildfire" he kept mentioning. Like Pappy, Pippy apparently dies at the wheel and Jimmy ends up falling out of the plane and over Niagara Falls, but he survives.  Jimmy manages to escape the water and arrives just in time to stop the wedding.  He then removes his bubble suit, allowing him to touch the girl he loves for the first time.  Jimmy's mother then confesses that Jimmy had developed an immune system when he was four, revealing that he is not actually dead at all and Jimmy's perfectly fine.  Finally, Jimmy and Chloe are married with all of Jimmy's new friends in attendance.  Pushpop has become the new leader of the former cult who are apparently now followers of Hinduism.  Dr. Phreak has befriended his band of freaks and Jimmy's mother has reunited with Slim and embraced a more rebellious lifestyle with Slim and Mr. Livingston.  Pippy and Pappy drive off with Jimmy and Chloe to their [[honeymoon]].  
Brotherhood of the Wolf
 The film begins during the [[French Revolution]], with the aged Marquis d'Apcher as the [[narrator]], writing his memoirs in a castle, while the voices of a mob can be heard from outside.  The film [[Flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to 1764, when a [[Beast of Gévaudan|mysterious beast]] terrorized the province of [[Gévaudan]] and nearby lands.  Grégoire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King [[Louis XV of France]], and his [[Iroquois]] companion Mani, arrive in Gévaudan to capture the beast.  Upon arrival, they rescue [[Jean Chastel]], an aged healer, and his daughter La Bavarde from an attack by soldiers.  The young and enlightened Thomas—Marquis d'Apcher—later befriends the two outsiders.  Fronsac is initially skeptical about the beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any [[wolf]] he has ever seen.  However, by studying the bite size on a victim of the beast, he deduces that it must weigh more than 500&nbsp;lb (227&nbsp;kg).  Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer.  While staying in Gévaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in [[Africa]].  Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an [[Italians|Italian]] courtesan at the local [[brothel]].  While investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, which increases his doubts of the beast's existence.  A traumatized child witness swears that the beast is controlled by what seems to be a human master.  Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, trying to find a common thread and reveal the murderer.  As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, [[Antoine de Beauterne|Lord de Beauterne]], arrives to put an end to the beast.  However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster.   Fronsac hesitantly does so, and the bogus wolf is sent back to [[Paris]], where it is put on display, much to the pleasure of the king and the French aristocracy.  In Paris, the king's advisor shows Fronsac a copy of a book titled ''L'Édifiante'' (French for "''The Edifying''").  Within the book are treasonous theories, such as that the beast has come to punish the King of France for his indulgence of the philosophers, and that [[The Enlightenment|the modern embrace of science over religion]] is [[heresy]].  Fronsac realizes that the beast is actually an instrument of a secret society: The Brotherhood of the Wolf, which is working to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country.  Fronsac is told that "officially" the beast is dead, warned to stay silent, and bribed with an appointment to travel to [[Senegal]].  Back in Gévaudan, the attacks by the real beast continue. Ignoring his orders, Fronsac returns to Gévaudan at the request of the Marquis and Marianne, determined to put an end to the beast's killings, and also to take Marianne away.  At a secret rendezvous with Marianne, they are attacked, and he finally sees the beast with his own eyes.  It kills a man, but mysteriously refrains from attacking Marianne.  Fronsac, Mani, and the Marquis set out into the forest and set up an array of traps to capture the beast.  Although badly injured during the encounter, it proves to be too powerful and intelligent to be captured by their plan.  After the battle, Mani sets off alone, in pursuit, where he finds a [[catacomb]] used as the beast's holding pen, inhabited by the Brotherhood and a band of [[Romani people|Gypsies]] working with them.  These include Chastel, the beast's tender, and his daughter, whom Mani saved.  Outnumbered and distracted by Chastel's daughter, Mani is shot in the back, overwhelmed and captured, but not before slaughtering a number of his attackers.  Fronsac is devastated when he discovers the body of his best friend, who has been tortured to death. Performing an [[autopsy]] on Mani's body, he finds a [[silver bullet]]—Jean-François' signature choice of ammunition.  In a fit of rage, a vengeful Fronsac goes to the catacombs, finding a pile of copies of ''L'Édifiante''.  He kills many of the Gypsies and discovers the beast's lair, before leaving so that he can burn Mani's body at dawn, as required by the customs of Mani's tribe.  After collecting Mani's ashes, he is overpowered by the local authorities and imprisoned.   Sylvia visits him in jail and reveals to him that she is a spy for the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. She explains that Henri Sardis, the local priest and leader of the Brotherhood, believes that he is restoring worship of God to France.  [[Pope Clement XIII]] has decided that Sardis is insane, and sent her to eliminate him. She then poisons Fronsac, telling him he knows too much.  Henri Sardis decides to kill Marianne, and he persuades Jean-François to do so as a way to combat his [[incest]]uous lust for his sister.  Jean-François comes to Marianne's room and reveals to her that he is the beast's master; it recognized his scent on her when it came near her, which is why it did not attack.  He also reveals that his right arm is in fact intact, albeit badly scarred, and he has kept it hidden (his arm is seen stroking the beast earlier in the film).  Enraged by her rejection of his love, Jean-François then [[rapes]] Marianne and leaves her for dead.  Sylvia's agents [[Exhumation|exhume]] Fronsac, who had not been killed but merely put into a temporary [[coma]], and he appears at one of the Brotherhood's secret [[sermon]]s.  In the resulting climactic battle, he kills several Gypsies and duels Jean-François to the death.  The other members of the Brotherhood attempt to flee, but they are corralled and arrested by Captain Duhamel and his men.  Sylvia, meanwhile, personally kills Chastel's daughter.  Sardis escapes into the mountains, but is mauled to death by a pack of wolves (their leader being the same white wolf that survived the previous slaughter, and was seen chasing the beast with its pack and seemingly bonded at a spiritual level with Mani).  Fronsac attempts to heal Marianne with a potion previously carried by Mani.  He and the Marquis then go to the beast's lair, where Chastel is tending to it as it lies grievously wounded after the fight in the forest.  It turns out the beast was the last surviving offspring of a "strange beast" that Jean-François brought back from Africa (which director [[Christophe Gans]] verifies is a lion<ref>Ain't It Cool News ''[http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=10793  Euro-AICN Special: An Interview with ''BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLVES'' director Christophe Gans from the Paris Underground]''</ref>).  It was tortured into becoming vicious, trained to attack humans, and dressed in metal armor plating and spikes along with a large mask and metal implants in its jaw to make it more formidable and frightening.   Fronsac takes pity on the dying creature and kills the beast in an act of mercy.  The film then returns to the opening time period of the French Revolution.  The now-elderly Marquis d'Apcher finishes writing his account of the killings, just before he is led to his execution by a revolutionary [[Angry mob|mob]].  In the final scene, the Marquis has a flashback, in which he narrates that he does not know what happened to Fronsac and Marianne after the death of the beast; but he hopes that somewhere, they are happy together.  Fronsac is shown traveling to Senegal with Marianne to start a new life together, scattering Mani's ashes at sea.  It is left unstated whether the two are alive and happy, or whether this is indeed the Marquis' dream.

While in a parked car, Ali performs [[oral sex]] on Bobby, while Lisa and Marty have sex in the back seat. Lisa later learns she is pregnant, but is afraid that the child is Bobby's instead of Marty's, since Bobby [[rape]]d her after beating Marty unconscious.  Bobby emotionally and physically abuses Marty, and also rapes Ali. Marty reveals to Lisa that the abuse has been going on since they were boys, starting with Marty taking drugs at an early age, which Marty thinks that Bobby has been using to take advantage of him. Marty and Bobby then go to a gay bar, where Marty is told to strip down to his underwear and dance. Lisa eventually proposes that they murder Bobby.  Ali recruits her new boyfriend, Donny, and her friend, Heather Swallers, while Lisa recruits her cousin, Derek Dzvirko. After doing drugs and having sex, the teens make their first attempt, but back out. Realizing they need help, they hire a supposed "hitman", Derek Kaufman, who is just a tough-talking adolescent.  The teens come up with a new plan. They arrive at a swamp, where Donny stabs Bobby in the back of the neck. Shocked by the violence, Ali, Heather, and Derek Dzvirko run back to Ali's car. Bobby begs for mercy, but Marty slits his throat, and Derek Kaufman bludgeons him with a baseball bat. Lisa witnesses it all, never turning away. They dispose of Bobby's body in the swamp and flee. Marty later realizes that he left the sheath to his diving knife at the canal. They go to retrieve the sheath, and check on the corpse, which is now being eaten by crabs. Lisa, Derek Dzvirko, Ali, and Heather do not believe they did anything wrong, since they did not directly participate in Bobby's actual death. Lisa decides to dispose of the knife, which is the only evidence linking them to the crime.  Unable to maintain the secret, Derek Dzvirko and Lisa reveal to their other friends what they've done, while Ali phones in an anonymous tip to the media, alerting them to Bobby's death. Lisa calls Derek Kaufman and speaks to his younger brother, who says that Derek has already been arrested for the murder. Eventually, all the teenagers turn themselves in, with the exception of Marty, who is arrested a few days later. The group is later seen in court wearing prison jumpsuits, and Lisa visibly pregnant by this time. Marty and Donny argue, inadvertently admitting to Bobby's murder in front of the entire court.

Buffalo Soldiers (2001 film)
 It is almost the end of the [[Cold War]] in Europe. [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) is a [[U.S. Army]] soldier stationed in [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]], in 1989. He devotes much of his time to dealing on the [[black market]] and cooking [[heroin]] for a group of drug-dealing [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] led by the sadistic Sergeant Saad. As a supply specialist, Elwood poses as a model soldier and friendly confidant to his amiable commanding officer, Colonel Berman (Ed Harris). Berman has no idea what supplies his subordinate is requisitioning or that Elwood is sleeping with his wife (Elizabeth McGovern). But things change when a new [[First Sergeant]], Robert E. Lee (Scott Glenn) joins Elwood's supply company. The new Top is both menacing and savvy, quickly assessing that Elwood and his squad are engaged in graft.   A tank crew, under the influence of Elwood's heroin, unintentionally kill two soldiers in charge of a weapons convoy by crashing through a gas station. Elwood happens upon the cache and steals it, hiding the weapons in a missile base.   When confronted by Lee, Elwood's attempt at bribery backfires badly. The Top revokes Elwood's privileges, destroys his property, and orders a new, naive and honest soldier, Pfc. Knoll (Gabriel Mann) to bunk in his room. To get back at Lee, Elwood begins a sexual relationship with his daughter, Robyn (Anna Paquin). However, in retaliation the Top makes Elwood destroy his expensive car during a weapons exercise. Lee booby traps a locker some soldiers are using to hide heroin. The grenade kills Stoney, one of Elwood's friends.  Elwood sells the stolen weapons to a Turkish gangster (Haluk Bilginer), reluctantly accepting payment in raw [[opium]]. He plans to cook the large amount into heroin. However, after Elwood is forced to save Knoll from being killed by Saad in a fight, he agrees to let the MP Sgt. become a business partner. In order to have time to trade the weapons from the missile base and collect the drugs, Elwood sells out Col. Berman so another regiment can easily capture their positions during a mobilization exercise. Afterwards the colonel wistfully tells Elwood he has been dismissed from command but this has given time to reflect on his future.  On 9 November 1989, the night the [[Berlin Wall]] came down, Elwood sneaks to the base swimming pool to meet Robyn while the opium is being cooked by his squad and Sgt. Saad and his MPs. Knoll and 1st Sgt. Lee then arrive. Elwood discovers Knoll is actually an undercover [[2nd Lieutenant#United States|2nd Lieutenant]] from the [[Inspector General#U.S. military|Inspector General's Office]]. While Knoll puts Robyn in a car, Lee beats up Elwood. However, Robyn tells Knoll her dad is going to kill Elwood, something Knoll as an honest officer  cannot allow. Meanwhile Saad, intoxicated by opium fumes, provokes a shoot out with commandos sent to arrest everyone making heroin. Upstairs just as Knoll stops Lee at gunpoint from throwing Elwood from a window, the building containing the drugs lab in the basement explodes because of a massive gas leak caused by the gunfire. Elwood falls from the window with his handcuffs around Lee's neck. He survives by landing on Lee.  The film concludes with heavy irony. The US Army decorates Elwood with medals and a transfer to [[Hawaii]] (Lee receives a posthumous [[Silver Star]]). His new CO is just as naive as Col. Berman. Elwood states that Robyn remains his sweetheart and that she will be visiting soon. The film ends with Elwood making a requisition order for more excessive supplies.

Burnt Money
 The setting is Argentina, 1965. El Nene ([[Leonardo Sbaraglia]]), a petty thief, and Angel ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]), a drifter, meet in the bathroom of a Buenos Aires subway station, and from that moment they are inseparable. They become known as "the twins", but their relationship is in fact that of lovers and, soon, as partners in crime. At a point when their relationship is already turning difficult, the plot sets in.  Their love and loyalty to each other is tested when "the twins" join a plan to hold up an armored truck together with a group of seasoned [[gangster]]s: their swaggering straight cohort Cuervo ([[Pablo Echarri]]), a sedative addict who's been carrying on an affair with the luscious Vivi ([[Dolores Fonzi]]); a 16-year-old nymphet; the trio's boss Fontana (Ricardo Bartis); and the elderly [[lawyer]] Nando ([[Carlos Roffé]]), who is past the days of any professional illusions and helps make connections to find a good team for the crime.  Angel is wounded by police gunfire during the robbery, provoking Nene to kill all of the guards and police in a fit of rage. Two [[police officer]]s are among the victims, and so the police of Buenos Aires start a major search for the culprits. They soon find a lead to Vivi's apartment, where the gang had been hiding out, but by this time, all except Vivi have escaped to neighboring [[Uruguay]]. The police force Vivi to give away their plans, and the search is broadened to Uruguay.  Meanwhile, the gang needs to wait for new [[passport]]s (to be arranged by a dubious character played by [[Héctor Alterio]]) for their escape from Uruguay.  They take refuge in an empty apartment in [[Montevideo]], but the organisation of the documents takes longer than originally planned. The waiting is especially hard on Nene: Angel—who is described as constantly "hearing voices" and seems to suffer a slight form of schizophrenia—has been rejecting intimate contact with Nene since at least the beginning of the escape, for reasons indirectly connected with his condition.  Nene eventually decides to break curfew and "get some air", and he, Angel, and Cuervo go and enjoy themselves at a fair. That evening outside of the apartment is not their last though, partly because Angel continues to reject any contact and does not even speak to Nene anymore.  On one evening, Nene ends up verbally and sexually abusing another gay person, but finally he meets the prostitute Giselle ([[Leticia Brédice]]) and starts a relationship with her, even mentioning a solo escape with her.  When Nando is caught by the police, the group is forced to abandon their refuge. Fontana goes off on his own, but Nene brings Angel and Cuervo to hide out in Giselle's apartment before they leave the city at night.  Angel had sensed that Nene had been cheating on him, and he soon understands where Giselle fits in. Before it can come to a fight, however, he also hears from Giselle that Nene still cares for him and suffered from his rejection. Giselle tells Nene that she has a cousin who lives near the border and she can arrange passage, but not for three men the police are after. She says that a couple, a man and a woman, will be able to get across easily. When she forces him to choose between her and Angel, he chooses Angel.  Nene tells Giselle that he will find her and kill her if she turns them in. Despite his threats, Giselle goes straight to the police to turn in the gang. Before the group takes to their heels, police have already surrounded the building. At first, the trio believes they will be able to escape, thinking that the police will not endanger the haul (several million dollars) or the lives of a large number of policemen. In high spirits, the three of them set to defend the apartment and their freedom, while Nene and Angel rekindle their relationship and spend some short and erotic moments of mutual happiness. After the first wave of attacks, a contented Angel even says the "voices" he always heard have fallen silent.  The group soon finds out, however, that there is no way out. Cuervo dies in an attempt to sally, and Nene and Angel remain waiting for the next wave of police attacks on the apartment. Seeing that they can save neither their own lives nor the money, they burn the entire haul in a final outburst of ''[[joie de vivre]].''  Finally, Nene catches a bullet and dies in Angel's arms. Angel still holds Nene and sends intermittent volleys of bullets in the direction of the approaching police. When the screen fades to black, the audience is left with the sound of the final fusillade of police machine gunfire, implying that Angel has committed [[suicide by cop]].  
The Bunker (2001 film)
  In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German [[Panzergrenadier]]s from the [[Großdeutschland Division]] are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, during which Pvt. Hugo Engels is killed in action, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus ([[John Carlisle (actor)|John Carlisle]]) and young Pvt. Neumann ([[Andrew-Lee Potts]]) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Cpl. Schenke confronts Sgt. Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Pvt. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right.  As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Cpl. Schenke ([[Andrew Tiernan]]) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt.  Krupp ([[Simon Kunz]]) orders against it. Later, Pvt. Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kreuzmann ([[Eddie Marsan]]) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Pvt. Neumann reveals that Pvt. Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann ([[Jason Flemyng]]) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert ([[Jack Davenport]]) finds a danger sign. Exploring further, Cpl. Ebert comes to a mine shaft where he hears movement and a pile of sand nearly falls on top of him. Terrified, he is suddenly stabbed from behind. As he lays dying, a silhouetted figure resembling Pfc. Kreuzmann walks up. Cpl. Baumann hears his scream and packs up the papers to investigate when his torch dies. He lights a match and, seeing figures walking towards him, aims his weapon, but they turn out to be his comrades. When Lt. Krupp tries the torch, it turns on easily.  Cpl. Baumann thinks that the Americans are in the tunnels. The group then hears movement, which turns out to be Pvt. Mirus. The soldiers turn on a rusty old generator, causing lights to turn on down in the tunnels. Lt. Krupp asks Pvt. Mirus what's going on but Pvt. Mirus is evasive. Before the questioning can go any further, the men hear machine gun fire coming from the bunker. When the men arrive, it appears that Pvt. Neumann, Pfc. Franke and Cpl Schenke had been firing at nothing. Lt. Krupp attempts to call headquarters, but the phone lines are dead. Convinced that the Americans have entered the tunnels, a game of cat and mouse develops. Stalked by shadowy figures, it becomes increasingly unclear where the men's fantasies end and the danger begins. Lt. Krupp agrees to send an expedition to secure the back entrance to the tunnels but on condition that if too much resistance is encountered they return. Pvt. Mirus and Pvt. Neumann are left behind in the bunker, while the remaining men split up: Lt. Krupp and Cpl. Schenke in one group and Cpl. Baumann, Pfc. Franke and Pfc. Neumann in the other. Before leaving, Cpl. Schenke gives a Nazi salute, which none of the men in the other group return. Pvt. Neumann stands guard while Pvt. Mirus scorns the whole idea of trying to fight anymore. Pvt. Mirus then claims that his son Werner, who died in Normandy, still talks to him and told him something about the tunnels.  Down in the tunnels, Cpl. Schenke and Lt. Krupp force their way into an ammunition storage room only to find nothing but shells. Arriving at the rear entrance, they find it is sealed but Cpl. Schenke hypothesises that there's another way in. They continue searching and discover Cpl. Ebert's body. The other group comes across the mine shaft and discover a mass grave. Following a voice, they find Pfc. Kreuzmann, catatonic and repeatedly screaming "no". Pfc. Kreuzmann begins babbling about someone being back. They hear a women's voice and try to get Pfc. Kreuzmann out but Pfc Kreuzmann resists them. He breaks away, knocking Cpl. Baumann out cold. He then hallucinates a soldier with his throat ripped out while two others take pictures and runs off.  Lt. Krupp and Cpl. Schenke explore a corridor when the lights begin to flicker. They hear movement and look, only to spin around a second later when they hear movement behind them and see a lamp swinging from side to side. They slowly back down the corridor to the back door of the tunnel complex. They hear loud banging as something tries to break into the tunnels. Pfc. Kreutzmann comes rushing up the tunnel, screaming. Startled, Cpl. Schenke and Lt. Krupp open fire, killing him. The gunfire causes a collapse, burying Lt. Krupp under a pile of wooden beams and killing him. When Schenke realises it was Pfc. Kreutzmann that they killed, he begins laughing hysterically.  Back in the bunker, Pvt. Neumann hears the gunfire and ventures down into the tunnels despite Mirus' protests. Alone, Pvt. Mirus sees a shadowy figure and takes off in panic. As he flees, he hears pounding on each consecutive door he closes behind him, as if he is being pursued. Pvt. Mirus leaves the bunker and falls outside into the barbed wire. He sees another dark figure approaching and in his panic to escape becomes more and more tangled in the barbed wire. Meanwhile, Pvt. Neumann, who is searching through the tunnels, is caught by an increasingly paranoid Cpl. Schenke, who puts a knife to his neck. Pvt. Neumann regains his trust and the two return to the artillery ammunition room and booby trap the room to prevent the shells from falling into the hands of the Americans, whom Cpl. Schenke is sure are stalking them through the tunnels. Sgt. Heydrich, Cpl. Baumann and Pfc. Franke decide to blow the bunker door with a stick grenade and fight their way out. Cpl. Schenke and Pvt. Neumann hear the explosion and think that the Americans have set off a booby trap.  Cpl. Schenke lights a fuse to destroy the artillery ammo and the two of them move out. Sgt. Heydrich, Cpl. Baumann and Pfc. Franke's plan to blast the door open fails so they go looking for another entrance. They run into Cpl. Schenke and Pvt. Neumann, who thinking that the three of them are Americans, open fire. A short firefight ensues in which Sgt. Heydrich, Pfc. Franke and Cpl. Baumann use up their remaining STG-44 ammo they withdraw. Pfc. Franke finally cracks and offers to surrender but it turns out that instead of Americans, Schenke is the one in the corridor. He looks rather deranged at this point. Pvt. Neumann comes up and aims his Kar98K rifle at Sgt Heydrich, Cpl. Baumann and Pfc. Franke as Cpl. Schenke  announces his plan to execute the three of them. When Pvt. Neumann refuses to execute the three of them Cpl. Schenke pulls out his Luger and executes Pfc. Franke. He then puts the gun to Pvt. Neumann's head and threatens to kill him. Pvt. Neumann is about to pull the trigger when the explosives planted in the ammunition room detonate, knocking everybody down. Sgt. Heydrich, Cpl. Baumann and Pvt. Neumann make a run for it while Cpl. Schenke wildly fires his pistol after them. The three men race through the tunnels but the main exit is blocked by wreckage. Sgt. Heydrich pulls Pvt. Neumann into the mine shaft to get away, but Cpl. Baumann who is holding the rifle, stays behind and shoots at the helmeted figure approaching. To his amazement and terror the bullets seem to do nothing. He then begins hallucinating and fires a third shot before Sgt. Heydrich pulls him away. Soon Cpl. Schenke arrives, but the others have already erected a barricade over the mine shaft entrance.  The men stumble across the mass grave again and then Cpl. Schenke appears, destroying the barricade. Sgt. Heydrich shoots Cpl. Schenke in the chest with a flare gun and Cpl. Schenke suddenly bursts into flames, screaming and reeling away. The three men begin whacking at the mass grave wall with entrenching tools, which break ground. Pvt. Neumann breaks out and Sgt. Heydrich is about to follow him when he's stabbed in the back by Cpl. Schenke, who seems to have put his flames out, despite being badly burned. Cpl. Baumann launches himself at Cpl. Schenke and the two begin a fight, which seems even for a while, until Cpl. Schenke throws Cpl. Baumann back. Sgt. Heydrich intervenes, only to get stabbed to death by Cpl. Schenke. The distraction gives Cpl. Baumann time to get away. Cpl. Baumann breaks through a layer of soil made up of bones, which seems to try and suck him back into the earth, but is pulled out by Pvt. Neumann. Cpl. Baumann then rolls over and hurls a grenade down into the hole, which lands next to the gravely injured Cpl. Schenke. Several seconds before it explodes, Cpl. Schenke sees several silhouetted figures standing nearby.  The movie then cuts to Pvt. Neumann and Cpl. Baumann running away as the grenade explodes behind them, presumably killing Cpl. Schenke. Pvt. Neumann then checks out the bunker from the rear, and comes back to tell the wounded Cpl. Baumann that it's safe. Cpl. Baumann gives Pvt. Neumann a handkerchief and tells him to go surrender. Pvt. Neumann wants to stay but Baumann refuses, telling Neumann to leave. Neumann agrees to leave and on his way down the road finds Pvt. Mirus' body tangled up in the barbed wire. He then sees American soldiers emerging from the woods and waves his handkerchief to get their attention. The film then cuts back to Cpl. Baumann's memories which show the squad advancing across a sunny field only to find a bunch of deserters about to be executed. An officer hustles over Cpl. Baumann to participate in the execution. One of the deserters is seen praying and Cpl. Baumann misses his first shot before shooting the man twice. Quickly the firing squad moves in, with one soldier taking pictures with his camera and an officer finishing off the wounded with a pistol. A member of the firing squad is seen striking a pose while the picture-taking soldier snaps another shot. Cpl. Baumann snaps out of remembering and staggers off towards the Americans.

Derek Hill ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), who is engaged to the cocktail waitress, Caela ([[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]). At Lou's Bar, Carmen gets into a fight with a jealous woman. Hill's superior, Lieutenant Miller ([[Mos Def]]) orders Hill to bring Carmen to jail. Carmen tries unsuccessfully to seduce Hill, but she convinces him to let her stop at her apartment to put her mother's ring in a safe place so it does not get stolen in jail. There, she puts on lingerie and wins him over. He is caught in the morning (with Carmen nowhere to be found) by Lieutenant Miller (who is now revealed to be a crooked cop), who brings Caela with him as he arrests Hill. Caela slaps Hill and tells him she hates him.  While in jail, Hill cannot stop thinking about Carmen. She writes him a letter, and he shares his obsession with cellmates Jalil ([[Bow Wow (rapper)|Lil Bow Wow]]) and Pockets ([[Jermaine Dupri]]). While Hill is in jail, Carmen meets the famous rapper Blaze (Casey Lee) at a nightclub, The Spot. He wants to bring her to Los Angeles, but succeeds only in bringing her best friends. Carmen promises to meet them in LA once Hill is out of jail. Unfortunately, Hill is facing a year of probation once he gets out. However, after he gets into an argument with Miller, he punches him in the face (after calling Carmen a "silly [[Wikt:hoe#Etymology 2|hoe]]"), he and Carmen flee to Los Angeles. However, Carmen is unaware of the incident.  Things in Los Angeles do not go well. Carmen cannot find an acting job, and Hill's fugitive status prevents him from obtaining employment. She runs into her best friends, Rasheeda ([[Rah Digga]]) and Nikki ([[Joy Bryant]]), who are being treated like royalty by Blaze. The three of them have their [[tarot]] cards read by a psychic ([[Wyclef Jean]]). Rasheeda and Nikki receive favorable fortunes, but Carmen's cards read "ruin," "sorrow" and "death." She decides that it is time for a change. She goes to Blaze's rehearsal and wins an invitation to be his date to his next concert. Meanwhile, Miller is looking for Hill, and Porter (his ex-partner) gives him Hill and Carmen's address for a large amount of cash. At the same time, a radio, connected to a power point, falls into the bathtub which Carmen had just left. Carmen wonders if that was meant to be her death.  Shortly afterwards, Carmen breaks up with Hill and moves in with her friends in a house apparently owned by Blaze. She feels that she should not give up her life for him, even though he did for her. Much like his counterpart in the original opera, Hill is devastated. He also learns from Caela that he is in danger. Since Hill knows how crooked he is, Miller wants to get rid of him. But Hill goes to Carmen to try to win her over again and make her leave with him. Carmen does not want to leave and tells Hill that she is staying. While they are arguing, Miller is watching them and accidentally shoots Carmen in the back twice with a silenced gun while aiming for Hill. Carmen is dying in Hill's arms and she can't talk when Hill keeps asking what was wrong. He touches her back and sees blood running down his hand. Sadly, Carmen dies in his arms. He lays the dead body down on the floor and goes to fight Miller. Hill and Miller have their last fight which ends with Miller falling to his death. Rasheeda and Nikki find Carmen's dead body and are both shocked and devastated. The story ends with Hill's wrongful arrest. The film officially ends with the rapping narrator ([[Da Brat]]) laying a rose down for Carmen stating "Immortal Beloved ... Carmen Brown, There'll never be another".  
Cats & Dogs
   Mrs. Carolyn Brody ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]) and her son Scotty ([[Alexander Pollock]]) return home, and the family's [[Bloodhound]] Buddy starts chasing a cat, a chase which ends with Buddy's capture by other cats in an ambush.  This is witnessed by an [[Anatolian Shepherd]] dog named Butch (voiced by [[Alec Baldwin]]) who reports Buddy's capture to his superiors. The head dog then orders the best canine agents to complete the mission by preventing all ([[cat]]s) from achieving their favorite goal: to make all humans allergic to [[canidae|dogs]].  Meanwhile, at a farm, a handful of [[Beagle]] puppies make fun of a younger puppy (voiced by [[Tobey Maguire]]), who wants to be free. The younger puppy tries an escape, but he fails. A group of young black Doberman puppies, all of them trained dog agents, led by a large [[Doberman Pinscher]] appear, round up the Beagle puppies and force them into hiding underground. Mrs. Brody comes into the puppy pen and she selects the younger puppy who was forgotten by the Dobermans. She decides to adopt him and takes him home, naming him Lou after Scotty sarcastically suggests the name "Loser".  Lou goes near an explosive trap set by the cats but Butch comes out and detonates it harmlessly. Butch then shows Lou the network that dog agents use, then takes him to meet some more agents: Peek (voiced by [[Joe Pantoliano]]) is a [[Chinese Crested Dog]] who works in an underground tube and has surveillance and communications equipment and Sam (voiced by [[Michael Clarke Duncan]]) who is an [[Old English Sheepdog]]. Having mistaken Lou for a trained dog agent, Butch raises his concerns to his superiors, but is told that there is no time to send a replacement. Lou is then briefed on the origins of the war between cats and dogs, which apparently dates all the way back to [[Ancient Egypt]]. Butch also mentions that Buddy managed to escape from the cats and retired from the spy business, living life in a [[condominium]].  Meanwhile, Mr. Tinkles (voiced by [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]), a white [[Persian cat]], plans to conquer the world by making all humans allergic to dogs with Professor Charles Brody's ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) research on a cure for dog allergies. He is briefly interrupted by Sophie the Maid ([[Miriam Margolyes]]) who needs to dress him upon seeing the comatose Mr. Mason (Myron Natwick). Tinkles then tells his sidekick Calico (voiced by [[Jon Lovitz]]), an [[Exotic Shorthair]], to send in the ninja cats (voiced by [[Danny Mann]] and [[Billy West]]) he hired to steal the research. He sends in the [[Devon Rex]] ninjas but Lou manages to prevent the theft. Lou then meets a former agent and Butch's ex-sweetheart and girlfriend named Ivy (voiced by [[Susan Sarandon]]), a [[Saluki]] who belly scratches him. Disappointed that the ninja cats failed him, Mr. Tinkles then orders Calico to send a [[Russian Blue]] mercenary, whose name is Diemitir Kennelkoff, (voiced by [[Glenn Ficarra]]) to steal the research. Kennelkoff frames Lou for defecating in the house with a ball containing fake dog [[feces]], causing Lou to be confined outside, then places a bomb on the lab door. Butch and Lou manage to get into the house through the window, but Peek and Sam are trapped outside after Lou knocks the window prop away. Kennelkoff fires a series of boomerangs around the Brodys' house causing serious damage and which break several vases and knock a lamp over; the boomerangs also cause the curtain pole to break. Lou then distracts the Russian while Butch tries to disable the bomb, but Kennelkoff turns his attention on Butch and tries to kill him. Butch gets caught in a telephone wire, then Mrs Brody comes home looking for her cell phone and surprisingly does not notice her wrecked living room. Although he suspects that dogs can see in black and white, Butch manages to escape and disables the bomb, but Kennelkoff holds out a remote that will detonate the bomb and laughs until the lab door opens and hits him. Kennelkoff is then captured and interrogated. The agent tells the gang that they pumped a few things out of Kennelkoff's stomach, including a note written by Mr. Tinkles.  After an incident involving Lou playing with Scotty, Professor Brody's machine finally gets the positive combinations for the formula. As Mr. Tinkles and Calico overhear the call between Professor Brody and a doctor, they decide to spring a trap for Dr. Brody and his family. First, Mr. Tinkles makes his sinister and talking side known to Sophie, causing her to faint, then he and his cats take Mr Mason's comatose body to Mason's [[Christmas tree]] flocking plant, where Tinkles passes his voice off as Mr Mason to send the employees home and commandeer the factory for the next plot. The cats send soccer tickets to an exhibition game between [[Uruguay]] and [[Chad]] to the Brody family, obviously a ruse. The cats make a fake entry and when the Brody family pulls up, the cats throw a gas bomb into their car, which goes off in a tremendous explosion and leaves the family unconscious.  While trying to decipher Mr. Tinkles's location, the dogs are obviously unaware that the Brodys have been led into a trap and are kidnapped by the said cat. After receiving a video from the cat demanding Mr. Brody's research as a ransom, the dogs from around the world assemble at a meeting (like the [[United Nations General Assembly]]) run by the Mastiff (voiced by [[Charlton Heston]]). When the dogs are unable to give up the formula after the meeting of the world's dogs, Lou angrily confronts Butch for not helping him. Butch then explains that when his owner went to college, he left him with his grandmother and storms off, cutting off all of Lou's communications with Peek and the others, so Lou would not seek help to save his family. Lou gives in and brings Mr. Tinkles the research, and is betrayed. Butch manages to find the depressed Lou and, along with Ivy, the two stage an ambush of Mr. Tinkles's factory where the latter plans to use [[Mouse|mice]] to spread the now mass-produced allergy to dogs. While Butch, Ivy, Peek and Sam fight Tinkles's cat forces, Lou frees the Brodys and Calico (who was betrayed by Tinkles), revealing he can speak in the process. Lou defeats Tinkles and rescues Butch, but the claw of the excavator hits his head and a flocking tank, causing an explosion that destroys the factory. Butch manages to save Lou and he tells him he was right about everything, but the puppy is unresponsive and seems to be dead. After a few hurtful moments of sadness and sorrow, Lou suddenly awakens, and all rejoice. Lou decides to be a normal canine and not a secret agent yet, but one day he will be when he is a full-grown beagle.  Meanwhile, Mr. Tinkles is sent to live with Sophie and her three sisters, who dress him in hilariously ridiculous girly outfits as punishment.  
The Cat's Meow
 November 15, 1924: Among those boarding the luxury yacht ''[[USS Oneida (SP-432)|Oneida]]'' in [[San Pedro, California]] are its owner, publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]], and his mistress, [[silent film]] star [[Marion Davies]]; motion picture mogul [[Thomas H. Ince]], whose birthday is the reason for the weekend cruise, and his mistress, starlet [[Margaret Livingston]] (who would portray "the Woman From the City" in [[F.W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' three years later); international film star [[Charlie Chaplin]]; English writer [[Elinor Glyn]]; and [[Louella Parsons]], a film critic for Hearst's ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]''.  Several of those participating in the weekend's festivities are at a crossroads in their lives and/or careers. Chaplin, still dealing with the critical and commercial failure of ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' and rumors he has impregnated 16-year-old [[Lita Grey]] (who appeared in his film ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'') is in the midst of preparing ''[[The Gold Rush]]''. Davies longs to appear in a slapstick comedy rather than the somber costume dramas to which Hearst has kept her confined. Ince's eponymous film studio is in dire financial straits, so he hopes to convince Hearst to take him on as a partner in [[Cosmopolitan Productions|Cosmopolitan Pictures]]. Parsons would like to relocate from the East Coast to more glamorous Hollywood.  Hearst suspects Davies and Chaplin have engaged in an affair, a suspicion shared by Ince, who seeks proof he can present to Hearst in order to curry favor with him. In the wastepaper basket in Chaplin's stateroom, Ince discovers a discarded love letter to Davies and pockets it with plans to produce it at an opportune moment. When he finally does, Hearst is enraged. His anger is fueled further when he finds a brooch he had given Davies in Chaplin's cabin. Hearst concludes it was lost there during a romantic liaison, and he rifles Marion's room for further evidence.  Armed with a pistol, Hearst searches the yacht for Chaplin in the middle of the night. Ince, meanwhile, runs into Davies and the two sit and talk with Ince donning a hat Chaplin had worn.  Davies explains to Ince her love for Hearst and her regret at an earlier affair with Chaplin.  She states "I never loved him" just as Hearst arrives behind them.  Thinking Davies is referring to him, and mistaking Ince for Chaplin, a jealous Hearst shoots Ince.  The assault is witnessed by Parsons, who had heard noises and went to investigate.  Hearst arranges to dock in [[San Diego]] and have a waiting ambulance take the dying Ince home. He phones the injured man's wife and tells her Ince attempted [[suicide]] when Livingston tried to end their affair, assuring her the truth won't reach the media. To the rest of his guests he announces Ince's [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] flared up and required immediate medical attention. Davies, of course, knows the truth, and confides in Chaplin. Also armed with that knowledge is Parsons, who assures Hearst his secret will be safe in exchange for a lifetime contract with the [[Hearst Corporation]], thus laying the groundwork for her lengthy career as one of Hollywood's most powerful gossip columnists.  After seeing Ince off, Hearst confronts Davies and Chaplin. He is berated by Chaplin, who expects Davies to join him. Hearst, however, challenges Chaplin to guarantee Davies that he can promise her a happy life. When Chaplin fails to answer, Hearst informs Chaplin of the vow of silence he and the fellow guests have made to keep the weekend's activities a secret. Chaplin despairs as he realizes the murder has strengthened Davies' love for Hearst.  The film concludes with the guests leaving Ince's funeral, as Glyn relates what became of them: * Livingston went on to star in a number of successful films and her film salary "inexplicably" went from $300 to $1000 a film. * Davies starred in more of Hearst's films before finally being allowed to feature in a comedy ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' which was (as Chaplin predicted) a success. She stayed by Hearst's side until his death in 1951. * Chaplin married his teenage lover [[Lita Grey]] in [[Mexico]] and his film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' was an overwhelming success. * Parsons worked for Hearst for many years and subsequently became one of the most successful writers in the history of American journalism.  Tom Ince was largely forgotten after the events of his death. Very few newspapers reported it, no police action was taken, and of all the people on board only one was ever questioned. It is concluded that in Hollywood, "the place just off the coast of the planet Earth," no two accounts of the story are the same.  
The Center of the World
 A couple checks into a suite in Las Vegas. In flashbacks we see that he's a computer whiz on the verge of becoming a [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] millionaire ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), she's a [[lap dancer]] at a club ([[Molly Parker]]). He's depressed, withdrawing from work, missing meetings with investors. He wants a connection, so he offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in Vegas, and she accepts with conditions: four hours per night of erotic play, and no penetration.  During the days in Vegas, they get to know each other, have fun, meet a friend of hers, [[casino dealer]] Jerri ([[Carla Gugino]]); at night, at least after the first night, things seem to get complicated. When the three days are over, the stripper makes it clear that she was only there for the money and that the man she spent the time with was just a client. Upset that the feelings he had weren't mutual he then rapes her, which she makes no attempt to stop. She then masturbates for him, achieving orgasm, after saying "you want to see real? I'll show you real." The next day he returns home heartbroken.  The movie ends with his return to the strip club to see the woman he fell in love with again. She greets him fondly but interacts with him the way she did when they first met, as a stripper and a client ordering a lap dance.  Because the film is shown in a non-linear format, it is left to the viewer to interpret the ending as they choose. One could believe that the film ends with the meeting at the strip club and a chance for the two characters to have a real relationship together, or one could believe that the strip club meeting occurred earlier in time and the film ends with the characters going their separate ways in life.  
The Caveman's Valentine
 A former family man and pianist studying at [[Juilliard]] music school, Romulus Ledbetter ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), now suffers from [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and lives in a cave in [[Inwood Park]], New York. He believes that a man named Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant is controlling the world with rays from the top of the [[Chrysler Building]], and that his mind is inhabited by moth-like [[seraph]]s. On [[Valentine’s Day]], he discovers the frozen body of a young man, Scotty Gates (Sean MacMahon), left in a tree outside his cave. The police, including Romulus's daughter Lulu ([[Aunjanue Ellis]]), dismiss the man's death as an accident. However, a homeless ex-lover of Scotty tells Romulus that he was murdered by the famous [[photographer]] David Leppenraub ([[Colm Feore]]). Determined to discover the truth behind Scotty’s death and prove his worth to his daughter, Romulus manages to get an invitation through a former friend to perform one of his compositions at Leppenraub’s farm. What unfolds thereafter is a twisted tale of mystery, deception, and a man's struggle against his own mind.  
Captain Corelli's Mandolin (film)
 Greece's [[Ionian Islands]] are [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied]] by the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] when it brings a large [[garrison]] along with a few Germans to the tranquil island of [[Cephalonia]], whose inhabitants surrender immediately. Captain Antonio Corelli, an officer of the Italian [[33rd Mountain Infantry Division Acqui|33rd Acqui Infantry Division]], has a jovial personality and a passion for the [[mandolin]], and trains his battery of men, (who have never fired a shot), to [[choir|choral sing]]. Initially he alienates a number of villagers, including Pelagia, the daughter of the village doctor. She is an educated and strong-willed woman. At first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to Corelli's charm, and mandolin playing, as they are forced to share her father's home after the doctor agrees to put him up in exchange for medical supplies.  When Pelagia's fiancé, Mandras, a local fisherman, heads off to war on the mainland, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows. Her beauty and intelligence have captured Corelli's heart, and his fondness for the village's vibrant community has caused him to question his reasons for fighting. Corelli, and his battery of musical troops, becomes a part of the villagers' lives; but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiances and the love they feel for one another.  [[Armistice of Cassibile|The Italian government surrenders to the Allies]], and the Italian troops happily prepare to return home. However, their erstwhile allies, the Germans, insist on disarming them, intemperately and violently. The Greeks are also exposed to the brutality of the incoming Germans, and arrange with the Italians to use their arms in a brief but futile resistance. For this, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] has thousands of the Italian troops [[Massacre of the Acqui Division|shot as traitors]]. Corelli survives when one of his soldiers shields him from the fusillade of the German executioners' bullets with his body, and falls dead on top of him.  Mandras finds Corelli, still alive among the pile of massacred soldiers, and takes him to Pelagia and the doctor for treatment and recovery, and then to a boat to escape the island. As a result of Pelagia's questioning, Mandras admits that he rescued Corelli from the heap of dead soldiers because he wanted to re-kindle their love. But it does no good and the couple part. Earlier, on one of Mandras's return visits to Cephallonia, he admits to Pelagia that the reason he never replied to her many love letters is because he is illiterate.  In 1947, Pelagia receives a parcel from Italy containing a record of the tune Corelli wrote for her, but no note. An [[1953 Ionian earthquake|earthquake]] destroys much of the village including the doctor's house; but island life continues, and, soon after, Corelli returns to Pelagia.

Chicken (film)
 Mick (Darren Healy) and Kev (Niall O'Shea) spend a late afternoon near railroad tracks by the seaside where Mick teaches Kev how to "[[Shotgunning|shotgun]]" beer for reasons then unknown to the viewer. He observes that Kev is "a bit of a wuss" after he fails to replicate the proper shotgunning technique and calls for Kev to come sit close to him for a test of courage, the [[knife game]], which involves stabbing a knife between outstretched fingers at an ever-faster rate. The game is usually played with one person's hand at a time and as a gesture of what may be seen as self-sacrifice, Mick puts his hand over Kev's in order to shield Kev's hand from the brunt of an injury should it occur.  When a train speeds by them, Mick accidentally cuts Kev and himself very slightly with the knife. They clasp each other's hands tightly and Mick, who suddenly seems very insecure and in need of affection is lovingly embraced by Kev, who perhaps has known all along why Mick brought him here.  A single screen of credits appears, then the film ends with a brief shot of the two in silhouette, standing apart, watching the sun set over the ocean.  
Charlotte Gray (film)
  In 1942, a young [[Scottish people|Scot]], Charlotte Gray, travels by train to [[London]] to take a job in a surgery. On the train, Richard Cannerley enters the compartment where Charlotte is seated. Cannerley chats with Charlotte, asking questions about her life and expressing interest that she is fluent in French. He gives Charlotte his card with the date, time and address of a book launch party. Social life in London is in full swing, and Charlotte's friends convince her to attend the party. There Charlotte meets handsome [[Royal Air Force]] [[Flight Lieutenant]] Peter Gregory. Cannerley interrupts Charlotte and Gregory by urging Charlotte to meet some of his acquaintances at the party. Cannerley asks Charlotte to contact him when she leaves the party.  Charlotte and Gregory enjoy a quick wartime romance. As they talk about the war and bravery, Charlotte confides that she thinks Cannerley wants her to try out for some secret organisation in connection with the war. Peter tells her not to get involved because it is too dangerous. Charlotte points out that nothing could be more dangerous than flying air force combat missions. Gregory tells Charlotte that he will be away for the next few weeks flying missions over [[German occupation of France|occupied France]].  Charlotte joins the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] and is seconded to [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] with the rank of Driver. She completes rigorous SOE training. Charlotte learns that Gregory's plane has gone down in France and that he is [[missing in action]]. Charlotte signs up for SOE operations in France, motivated in part by her desire to find Gregory.   Charlotte enters France by parachute with two men. She lands out of the [[drop zone]] because two young boys on the ground are playing with flashlights, which appear to signal the drop zone. The boys run away, half-thinking Charlotte is an [[angel]].   Charlotte's first mission in France is a test run, to deliver radio [[vacuum tube]]s to a contact in occupied France. The meeting place is a café. Charlotte's contact hurriedly enters the café, and they exchange the coded greeting to identify one another. The contact explains that she believes that local police are following her. Police enter the café, question the contact, examine her papers and other belongings (including the vacuum tubes), and finally "ask" the contact to follow them out. Charlotte realizes that this encounter compromised her cover.  Charlotte explains this incident to Julien, her main contact in the [[French Resistance]]. Julien reassigns her to act as friend and housekeeper to his father, Levade, who lives in a large house in the country. Levade has taken two [[French Jews|French Jewish]] children, André and Jacob, into his home to hide them after their parents were arrested. It is not clear whether Charlotte recognizes the boys, but the boys recognize her—they were the boys who were playing with flashlights when Charlotte landed by parachute. As time progresses, the film reveals that the parents were deported to a [[The Holocaust in Poland|German concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland]], and the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] is cooperating with the Nazis in the steadily growing oppression of Jews in France.  Charlotte participates in a Resistance mission: blowing up a train carrying Nazi tanks and armaments. The Nazis bring their own forces and tanks to the village to crush the Resistance in the area. Charlotte's SOE contact tells her that Gregory died after his airplane was shot down. Charlotte grieves for Gregory.   A Vichy official arrives from Paris to work with the Germans and local villagers to ensure that their quota for deporting Jews is met. Renech, the village schoolmaster, follows Charlotte. Renech learns that Levade is hiding Jewish children. He threatens Charlotte with reporting the boys to the Nazis unless she agrees to become his "friend". She agrees and promises to meet Renech the following night.  That night, Julien's Resistance group conducts a mission to guide [[paratrooper]]s to a safe landing zone. Someone has informed German forces of the mission. German soldiers, armed with [[MG 34|machine guns]], surprise Julien's Resistance group and kill all of them except Julien.  Believing Charlotte betrayed them, Julien confronts her the next day at his father's house. Soon afterward, German soldiers, with Renech and the Vichy official from Paris, arrive at Levade's house. They meet in Levade's dining room. The Vichy official asks Levade for his papers, especially for documentation that he is not a Jew, and question him about his Jewish ancestry, about which Renech apparently informed him.   Renech takes Julien aside, away from the dining room. Renech tells Julien that he must betray either his father or the boys to satisfy the Nazis' quota of Jews to deport; Renech says he does not care whom Julien chooses to betray. Julien returns to the dining room. Julien announces that his father has Jewish grandparents and acknowledges that this means Julien himself is also of Jewish ancestry. Levade understands Julien made this disclosure to protect the boys. The Vichy official explains that Julien does not qualify for deportation as a Jew because he is only  Jewish. The German soldiers seize Levade.  Renech betrays the boys anyway. Charlotte rushes to the boys' hiding place to move them, but the Nazis arrive first and capture the boys.  Julien enters Renech's apartment while Renech is away. When Renech returns to his apartment, Julien shoots and kills him.  With his Resistance group destroyed and his father deported, Julien decides to go to southern France, perhaps to escape to fight elsewhere. He begs Charlotte to go with him. Charlotte refuses, saying that she still has duties to fulfill in France. Julien says that he does not even know Charlotte's real name. Charlotte simply smiles.  Evading French police, Charlotte rushed to Levade's house where she hurriedly types something and takes it to the railroad station where Jews are being loaded into cattle cars. People from the village run alongside the cars, searching for their loved ones. Hearing the boys and Levade in one of the cattle cars, Charlotte pushes the paper she typed between the boards of the car. Inside the car, Levade takes the document and reads it aloud to the boys. It purports to be a letter from the boys' parents, encouraging them to care for one another, to be careful, to survive, and reminding them of their parents' love. (Much earlier in the film, when Charlotte is interviewed for a position in the SOE, she is asked, "Which is more important: love, hope, or duty?" Charlotte answers, "Hope." Charlotte's fake letter gave the boys the gift of hope.)  Although the screenplay suggests that Julien's father and the Jewish boys are doomed, Faulks's novel states explicitly that they die in a concentration camp.  Some time later, Charlotte leaves France and returns to London.  After the end of the war, Peter Gregory, who in fact survived his airplane crash and has been in hiding, approaches Charlotte. He wants to resume their romance. Charlotte explains that things have changed. She says she grieved for Gregory, but she cannot go back to their romantic relationship.  At the end of the film, Charlotte returns to France and to Julien at his country home (formerly his father's home). When they reunite, Charlotte reminds Julien that he still does not know her real name. "My name is Charlotte Gray," she announces.  
Chaos (2001 film)
  Paul and Hélène, a wealthy Parisian couple, are preparing to go out for the evening. While driving, they see three men chasing a prostitute down the street. She begs them to save her by letting her into the car, but Paul locks the doors and drives away as the three men savagely beat her, leaving her unconscious in the street. He refuses to let Hélène phone an ambulance, afraid of being charged with not helping a person in danger (which is a crime in France).  Hélène cannot forget the incident, and the next day she goes to the hospital, where she finds the prostitute, Noémie, in a coma. Moved, Hélène stops work and leaves her family responsibilities to stay with Noémie throughout her recovery, aiding her as she regains mobility and helping her to communicate since she can't yet speak. When one of the pimps returns to threaten and beat Noémie again into submission, Hélène follows him out of the hospital, knocks him unconscious with a wooden plank, and leaves him for the police to find.  Meanwhile, Paul and Hélène's son Fabrice, a university student, is cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, who is pregnant. When his girlfriend discovers the truth, she destroys his apartment. He moves into Paul's apartment just as Hélène moves out, and the two girls follow him, much to Paul's chagrin.  When Hélène returns home for a day, one of Noémie's pimps goes to the hospital with a friend and removes Noémie under the pretense that they are relatives taking her for a walk.  Noémie, who still cannot speak, is unable to protest.  Realising what has happened, she accosts the pimps on the street and takes Noémie to Paul's mother's house.  There, Noémie recovers her ability to talk, and explains her life story:  Her name is actually Malika, and she is a child of poor French-Algerian immigrants. At 17, her father attempted to sell her into an arrange marriage and she fled. She was picked up by a pimp, named Touki, on the street and he subsequently sold her into sexual slavery and had her hooked on heroin. She convinced Touki to move to Paris to speak to her step-mother and retrieve her passport. Her family kicked her out, and she formed plans to leave her life of forced prostitution behind. She sobered up and opened up an account with her sister, Zora's passport to put some money behind. She tried going to [[SOS Racism]] for help, but she was dismissed. She moved to [[Geneva]] and seduced a rich man and conned him into giving her all of his money and jewelry, just before he died. She and Touki returned to Paris with the money. However, the rich man's family went to the press with claims that their money was stolen from the bank. Her pimps found out that she laundered the money for herself and beat her into signing a proxy. She escaped, with Touki and the other two pimps chasing after her, which was when Hélène and her husband came across her in their car at the beginning.  The two women plan Malika's freedom and revenge on her abusers. Hélène tells Malika that her husband was the one who locked the doors of their car during her attack, but Malika doesn't care. Later, she manages to distract Paul at the Basel airport, who looking for his Hélène, and has sex with him. All three manage to get on the same flight back to Paris, with Malika keeping her distance, in order to avoid the police.  Hélène finally stands up to the selfishness of her husband and son. Paul falls madly in love with Malika, going insane when she doesn't call. Fabrice also meets and falls in love with her.  Hélène and Malika set up the pimps and their gang to be arrested by the police. Touki is shot after trying to escape. Malika returns to her estranged family and tells her sister, Zora, that she will be forced into marriage as soon as she's old enough, just as Malika was at her age. To save her from a life of patriarchal misery, she begs her sister to come with her to live in freedom, but she refuses, saying she loves them.  Malika meets up with Paul again and she takes him to his mother's house. When Zora is beaten by her sexist brothers, her father reveals that she will indeed be married to an older man soon. Malika and Hélène rush to Marseilles and stop Malika's father from sending Zora off to a forced marriage. Her father curses her and she replies that it is the first time he has ever given her anything. The film ends with Malika, Hélène, Zora and Paul's mother sitting on a bench gazing at the sun.

Children of the Corn: Revelation
 Jamie ([[Claudette Mink]]) comes to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] after numerous phone calls to her grandmother have gone unanswered. Her grandmother's apartment building, which is built next to a cornfield, appears to be empty, except for two young, mysterious children who roam about. Jamie discovers that her grandmother has received a notice of eviction. She goes to see Det. Armbrister, who is not much help. While at the local grocery store, Jamie has an encounter with the children from the building, but they do not speak to her. Outside, she sees a priest standing in the street, staring at her. She returns to her grandmother's apartment to discover a message: "Jamie go home."  Jamie questions the building manager, Jerry, who is of no help. Jamie investigates in the basement and finds a crop of carrots and tomatoes. She flees when she hears a group of children laughing.  She runs into a man with a gun, who tells her to keep out of the basement. She later meets two more tenants, an old man in a wheelchair who swears at everyone and a young woman named Tiffany ([[Crystal Lowe]]), a stripper. Jerry invites Jamie to a BBQ on the roof, she agrees. On the roof, Jerry takes a bite of corn and discovers there is blood inside. He is then shoved off the roof by the two children. When Jamie arrives, he is nowhere to be found, and she sees the priest watching her from the ground.  Jamie has a nightmare in which her grandmother was lured from her house by a strange voice to railroad tracks. The next day, Jamie goes to see Det. Armbrister who reveals Jamie's grandmother was part of a religious cult when she was a child. The kids, who were led by a boy-preacher named Abel, committed suicide by entering a tent and setting it ablaze. Only Jamie's grandmother survived. Jamie's grandmother's apartment is built upon the site of the fire. This is ironic, because Jamie's parents were killed in a house fire.  Tiffany returns home and, while taking a bath, she is attacked by one of the children who uses corn to strangle her, before taking her body. Det. Armbrister and Jamie arrive at the apartment, but don't notice Tiffany's body lying nearby in the cornfield.  Later, after Det. Armbrister leaves, the old man in the wheelchair is attacked by the kids and is pushed through a stair balcony and falls to his death.  Jamie returns to the grocery store, which is ransacked.  She spots a girl wearing her grandmother's hat and chases after her, failing to notice the storeowner's severed head inside a drink cooler. Jamie returns to the apartment, where she runs into the man with the gun.  He reveals that everyone else has disappeared and that he is leaving. As he makes his escape, the kids trap him in an elevator and scare him so much, that he has a heart attack and dies. The kids then drag off his body.  The priest arrives and explains about Gatlin, and He Who Walks Behind the Rows, who is apparently the devil. The priest tells Jamie that her grandmother is dead and that if she does not leave, she too will be killed. The priest then leaves. Some of the children arrive and take Jamie down to the basement, where there are now rows of corn growing.  Abel appears and the children close in on her.  One of the children reveals herself to be Jamie's grandmother and though she is a child, speaks in the voice of an old woman. Jamie flees, but Abel uses his power to prevent her from leaving.  Cornered, Jamie faces Abel and the children, who ask her to join them. Jamie agrees, but it is only a distraction and she causes a gas explosion, but Abel is unscathed.  Abel uses corn stalks to tie down Jamie, but she is rescued by Det. Armbrister. They both manage to escape before the apartment explodes and destroys the corn as well. It is implied that the souls of the children were freed and Abel was killed.  
Les Chiefs
 The film opens with "The Super Fan", an avid Chiefs fan, making his 3rd belt. The film depicts the lives of 5 Chiefs players: Mike Bajurny (brother of producer David Bajurny), Brady Austin, Mike Henderson and Cory Holland.  With the exception of Henderson, all of these players live in an abandoned storage area on the second story of [[Colisée de Laval]], affectionately known as "The Rat's Nest".<ref>[http://www.ehproductions.com/leschiefsflash/synopsis.swf East Hill Productions - Les Chiefs Synopsis Page]</ref> Several players discuss the living conditions. Some don't mind it, while other say that since the room is near an exit, the apartments will not be used for a fire exit. Henderson mentions that the living situation isn't bad for a young single guy.  Henderson discusses his role with the team. He doesn't think he is limited to being a fighter, but considers himself to have an Owen Nolan-type of role with the team, where he could be tough as needed.  The Super Fan shows how he prepares for a big game: which involves the shining of one of his championship belts.  A shot of the arena is shown with fans mock-fighting each other with security surrounding the ice. Craig Martin discusses a line brawl and how it originated. At the end of the second, the team was trailing 3-0, but the Chiefs would score 7 goals to come back and win.  Families of the players discuss their son's and boyfriend's role with the team. Bajurny's mother does not approve of her son's role as a fighter. Henderson's fiance discusses how they met and how she feels about him playing professional hockey.  A 6'5", 265&nbsp;lbs ex-military strong man by the name of [[Tim Leveque]] comes to play for the Chiefs. The players discuss Tim coming to the team, and some players are concerned about not knowing his background. He immediately establishes himself as an enforcer. He is shown fighting 6'7", 320&nbsp;lb Dominic "The Giant" Forcier and beats him.  Near the end of the film a boxing promoter comes to town and tries to get Bajurny and Holland to fight. Bajurny and Holland at first accept it. But after an inspiring talk from his grandfather, Bajurny says no, but Holland still goes through with it. Holland loses his fight.  In the playoffs Bajurny is benched for fighting and Austin and Holland aren't even dressing for games anymore. Everyone looks depressed and they want to go home.

Boom Boom tells his girlfriend, Kitty, that Tommy acquired his nickname when one of his shoes was stolen, and he could not afford another due to his family's poverty.

The Claim
 Daniel Dillon is an [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant who settles in the high mountains of [[California]] during the Gold Rush of 1849. It is now 1867, and Dillon has a vault filled with gold and a town of his own, named Kingdom Come. Dillon owns nearly every business of consequence in the town; if someone digs for gold, rents a hotel room, opens a bank account, or commits a crime, they will have to deal with Dillon.  One of the few profitable enterprises in town that Dillon does not own is the saloon/brothel, which is operated by Lucia, his [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] lover.  Donald Dalglish is a [[surveying|surveyor]] with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], which wants to put a train either through Kingdom Come, or somewhere in the vicinity. He is here to decide the route. Dillon is anxious to ensure that the railway line is routed through "his" town, as this will bring more business.  Among the travelers who arrive in town with Dalglish are two women, the beautiful but ailing Elena Burn and her lovely teenage daughter Hope. The presence of these women is deeply troubling for Dillon, for they are the keys to a dark secret Dillon has kept from the people of Kingdom Come for nearly twenty years. Dillon had come to these mountains with his [[Poles|Polish]] wife Elena and their months-old baby, Hope. On a cold and snowy night they happen upon a shack named Kingdom Come, owned by a disillusioned [[Californian Gold Rush#Forty-niners|'49er]] named Burn. Like Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, Dillon sells Elena and Hope to the prospector in exchange for the small gold claim that would later flourish and make Dillon so wealthy. Burn has died, and Elena has come to find Dillon because Burn left her with nothing, she is dying, and she wants Dillon to give her $200 per year so that she can "do right by Hope".  Dillon tells Lucia that they have to end their relationship and gives her some gold bricks and the deeds to her home, the saloon/brothel, and the tobacco house. Lucia is heartbroken, wanting Dillon and not his money. Dillon tells Elena that he never married anyone else because he was always married to her. The two renew their marriage but their time together is short, filled with Dillon's efforts to find a cure for her illness and ending with her death.  Elena's death coincides with the decision to route the railway some distance from the town for easier passage and construction. Lucia moves the girls, the booze and the tobacco house to the valley, effectively moving the entire population of Kingdom Come to her new town of [[Lisbon|Lisboa]], named for her father's home in Portugal, to be near the railroad. Following Elena's funeral, Hope tells Dillon that she is leaving to find Dalglish and start a life with him. Dillon takes her up to the original shack Kingdom Come, showing her a picture of their family when she was a baby, and revealing the deal made right on that spot between him and Burn. Hope leaves him and goes to the new Lisboa.  Dillon is thus faced with the loss of both Elena and Hope, and his town. He sets fire to all the buildings in Kingdom Come. The smoke attracts the people of Lisboa, who find Dillon's frozen body in the snow near his original shack. Lucia is devastated, crying over the frozen body as it is brought back to the ruins of Kingdom Come. While many of the 'former' townspeople rush to find Dillon's stockpile of gold in the burned out vault, Hope and Dalglish choose instead to follow Dillon's body as Lucia and others continue with it down the mountain.  
Citizen (film)
 A district collector, judge, and police official are all kidnapped in broad daylight. The kidnapper calls himself 'Citizen' and appears in various disguises to get at his targets. [[Central Bureau of Investigation|C.B.I.]] officer Sarojini ([[Nagma]]) finally traces the common factor among the kidnapped trio to the fictional hamlet of Athippatti, inhabited by fishermen, but to her surprise, the village does not appear on the official gazette maps. Excavations reveal evidence of a massacre that must have taken place a couple of decades previously. 'Citizen' is finally apprehended. He explains that as a child he was the sole survivor of the massacre twenty years previously, and reveals that the three kidnapped officials perpetrated the massacre to gain power and money, and he wants the citizenship of the three government officials and their families to be revoked as a punishment for their atrocities.  
Claire (film)
 When the curtains open, viewers find themselves caught within a nightmare that strongly contrasts the dreaminess of sequences to come: a young girl's birthday party is cruelly interrupted by Josh's (Mish P. DeLight) loss of custody over her.  He wakes in a fright and squeezes the hand of his husband (James Ferguson) for comfort. Early on, a theme in ''Claire'' is identified here: the transcendence of love beyond social norms.  The audience is briefly walked through the pair's daily routine.  One exception emerges after the couple has lain down the following night: the appearance of Claire; their unexpected miracles, just a tiny thing inside an iridescent ear of corn.  As the story progresses and Claire grows into the shape of a young woman, she enchants onlookers with her beauty and readings of fantastic poetry in various languages.  Richard (Allen Jeffrey Rein) is particularly entranced; and gives her his copy of Shelley's work as a token.  It is in him that Claire discovers her miraculous healing powers proceeding his dive from a cliff in an attempt to win her affection.  While exemplifying the nontraditional family---two men lovingly raising a child of the moon---the film celebrates the diversity of family and also addresses the grief of losing a loved one.  
Circuit (film)
 The film opens with John ([[Jonathan Wade Drahos]]) regaining consciousness in a restroom stall at "The Red Party." He stares at himself in the mirror and flashes back to when he was a small-town cop from [[Illinois]] who moved to [[Los Angeles]], hoping to find a more welcoming environment. He temporarily moves in with his cousin Tad ([[Daniel Kucan]]), who is living with his suddenly ex-boyfriend Gill ([[Brian Lane Green]]) and Tad's new boyfriend Julian ([[Darryl Stephens]]). Tad is a filmmaker, shooting a [[documentary film|documentary]] on [[circuit party|circuit parties]] and Julian [[DJ]]s at the parties. Gill takes John to a party in the Hollywood hills, where he meets Hector ([[Andre Khabbazi]]), a [[male prostitute|hustler]] who is battling mounting insecurities over his looks and age as he is about to turn 30. John and Hector forge a friendship and Hector introduces John to the world of circuit parties and illicit drugs.  One of Tad's subjects is Bobby ([[Paul Lekakis]]), an [[stripper|exotic dancer]] and model who performs at circuit parties (and with whom coincidentally John tricked at a party). Bobby is [[HIV]]-positive but asymptomatic. Tad records Bobby's performance at a club. Also performing at the club, as a [[stand-up comedy|comedian]], is Nina ([[Kiersten Warren]]), who coincidentally is a friend of John's. She is living out of her car so John invites her and her cat to stay with him in his new trailer.  Tad shows his footage of Bobby to Gino ([[William Katt]]), who is an investor, to secure the funding to finish the film. Gino is involved in a number of business ventures, including running circuit parties with his wife Louise ([[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]]), distributing drugs and buying [[viatical settlement]]s, including Bobby's. Gino offers Tad half the money he needs. After viewing the footage Gino angrily confronts Bobby, who remarks that Gino gambled by buying his insurance policy and lost.  John follows Hector deeper into circuit scene, using a variety of drugs including [[ketamine|Special K]], [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], [[cocaine]], [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] and, suffering from [[body dysmorphic disorder|body dysmorphia]] despite being in terrific physical shape, [[anabolic steroids]].   Gill has grown tired of Tad and Julian living with him and gives them a deadline for moving out. Initially he agrees to let them stay until after the [[White Party]] so Julian can earn rent money and Tad can finish his film but then decides he wants them out sooner. Desperate, Tad returns to Gino for more financing. Gino refuses. Louise, growing more disgusted with Gino, later secretly gives Tad the money.  Gino becomes obsessed with Bobby and plans to kill him. He offers to pay Hector to sleep with Bobby and slip Bobby poisoned drugs.  John begins working security for Gino's parties (which is largely an excuse for his own partying). One such party is The Red Party, where John runs into a [[drag queen]] who remembers him from his small town days. This reminder of his past nearly sends John over the edge, leading to the drug binge which lands him on the stall floor.  Gill and Nina realize John is in trouble but are not able to help him. John goes so far as to prostitute himself, joining Hector for a scene in which they have sex while a client [[voyeurism|watches]]. John, disgusted with himself, argues with Hector and refuses to take his cut of the fee. Eventually Nina moves out after John, in a drug-induced rage, attacks her cat. John tries to seduce Gill, who refuses him because of his heavy partying and drug abuse.  John reduces his partying and drug use and goes to Gill for a job with his [[landscaping]] business. He and Gill also pursue a romantic relationship, but John, having stopped his steroid use, can't perform sexually because his body feels "soft." He returns to Hector for more "juice."  It is the weekend of the annual [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] White Party. Gino has provided Hector, who has become more terrified about losing his youth and looks, with the poisoned drugs. Tad is going to the party to record the last footage he needs to complete his documentary, including Bobby's farewell performance. Julian is DJing. John is going to supervise security. He and Hector travel by limousine and they reconcile. After giving John his headphones to listen to a song, Hector confesses that he loves him. Gino and Louise are also at the party and amidst the chaos Louise leaves him.  After Bobby's farewell performance, Hector goes to his room and they have sex for most of the night. When they're spent, Bobby says to Hector, "you saved my life tonight." Hector replies, "More than you'll ever know" and ingests the poisoned drugs. He dies, on his 30th birthday.  The next morning, Bobby discovers that Hector is dead. John, on his way to find Hector, runs into Gino outside the room, who says how sorry he is about Bobby's death, but trails off when Bobby walks out of the room. John looks in and sees Hector's body. He realizes Gino is involved and starts to attacks him, then, shattered by grief, runs off weeping.  Six months later, John and Gill (still dating), Nina, Tad, Bobby, Louise, and others gather for the premiere of Tad's documentary.

The Comeback (2001 film)
    
Cowboy Bebop: The Movie
  ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'' is set on [[Mars]] in 2071, 49 years after Earth was mostly abandoned after a catastrophe. Humanity has settled on other planets and moons in the solar system. The film's protagonists are legalized bounty hunters who travel together on the spaceship ''Bebop''. They are [[Spike Spiegel]], a former associate of the Red Dragon crime syndicate; [[Jet Black (Cowboy Bebop)|Jet Black]], a former police officer and owner of the ''Bebop''; [[Faye Valentine]], a woman who was once a fugitive from bounty hunters; [[Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV]] (Ed for short), a girl with genius computer skills; and [[Ein (Cowboy Bebop)|Ein]], an artificially enhanced "data dog" with human-level intelligence.  Days before Halloween, a man explodes a truck in Mars' capital city, spreading what is assumed to be a new pathogen that kills or sickens over three hundred people. In response, the Mars government issues a record bounty of 300 million woolong for the culprit's capture. Faye, who was pursuing [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Lee Sampson|Lee Sampson]], a hacker that was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the ''Bebop'' crew decide to take on the bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using a tattoo on the attacker's wrist, manages to identify him as [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vincent Volaju|Vincent Volaju]], a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: made an amnesiac, he suffers from hallucinations, and his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.  Jet learns that the truck was the property of Cherious Medical Pharmaceutical Company, who illegally manufactured the pathogen as a biological weapon. Looking for information on the pathogen, Spike is given a sample by a man named [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Rashid|Rashid]], who was the former lead on its development. Spike also encounters [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Elektra Ovilo|Elektra Ovilo]], an agent of Cherious Medical. Upon examination, the "pathogen" proves to be a type of protein-based nanomachine that mimics human lymphocytes then breaks down into protein after death, making it undetectable. Attempting to infiltrate Cherious Medical, Spike fights with Elektra, planting a listening device on her. Elektra, who is sent by Cherious Medical to kill Vincent, is tailed by Spike, who attempts to take down Vincent on a train. Vincent easily defeats Spike, severely wounding him and throwing him from the train before releasing another cloud of the nanomachines: everyone in the train dies except Elektra, who was unknowingly immunized when she had been in a relationship with Vincent prior to the test on Titan. She secretly gives a friend in the company a sample of her blood to prepare a stock of vaccine.  During this time, Faye relocates Sampson, who has been working with Vincent, but fails to catch him. Ein and Ed manage to find him again, but the two run off before Faye can get there. She arrives just as Vincent breaks one of the nanomachine containers with him, killing Sampson. Although Faye is also infected, Vincent gives her some of his blood through a kiss, immunizing her.  After Spike recovers and has a final talk with Rashid, he and Elektra are captured by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger an attack on the city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant [[jack-o'-lantern]] balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. Spike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.  
Conspiracy (2001 film)
 In 1942, a [[Wannsee Conference|meeting]] is arranged by [[Reinhard Heydrich]] in order to determine the method by which the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] is to implement [[Adolf Hitler]]'s policy, that the [[German-occupied Europe|German sphere of influence]] should be [[Judenfrei|free of Jews]], including those in the occupied territories of [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Poland]], [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Latvia, Estonia,]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|France]]. As the film opens, officials from several different agencies arrive and mingle at a lakeside [[villa]] in the [[Berlin]] [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|borough]] of [[Wannsee]].  It is quickly established by those present that there is a significant "[[Jewish question|Jewish problem]]", in that the Jews of Europe cannot be efficiently contained, nor can they be forced onto other countries. Kritzinger interrupts at several points to opine that the meeting is pointless, given that the [[Jewish Question]] had previously been settled, but Heydrich promises to revisit his concerns.   A discussion follows of the possibilities of [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]], and of the exemptions for [[Mischling|mixed race Jews]] who have one or more non-Jewish grandparents. At this point, Stuckart loses his temper and insists that a sturdy legal framework is paramount, and that ''[[ad hoc]]'' application of standards will lead to administrative chaos. He also chides Klopfer for his simplistic portrayal of Jews as subhuman beasts, simultaneously painting his own picture of Jews as clever, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and untrustworthy.   Heydrich calls a break in the proceedings, and after praising Stuckart aloud takes him aside to warn him about the consequences of his stubbornness, implying that others in the SS will take an unwanted interest in his actions. When the meeting reconvenes, Heydrich steers the discussion in the direction of [[Genocide|wholesale extermination]] using [[gas chamber]]s. This causes consternation among some attendees, notably Kritzinger, who objects on the grounds that Hitler had given him personal guarantees that extermination of the Jews was not being considered, and Bühler who is shocked to discover that the SS have been building [[extermination camps]] and making preparations for the "[[The Holocaust|Final Solution]]" under his nose.    It eventually become clear to everyone at the meeting that they have been called together not to discuss the problem but to be given orders by the SS, who are intent on wresting control of the operation from other agencies such as the Interior Ministry and the Reich Chancellery. Eichmann now describes the method that will be used, i.e. the gassing of Jews. Many have already been killed in [[Gas van|specially-designed trucks]] and his figures include tens of thousands of victims. He even describes their bodies as coming out "pink" (a symptom of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]), at which point Hofmann is suddenly taken ill. He later puts it down to a bad cigar.  Throughout the meeting and over refreshments attendees raise other side issues, reflecting the interests of their respective work areas.  Lange warns executing Jews by shooting has a deleterious effect on the morale of his troops, and he clashes with Luther's indifference. Klopfer requests that the Party retains some discretionary power over the process. Bühler presses for urgency, concerned that [[typhus]] could break out from the over-populated ghettos in Poland.  Meyer and Neumann do not want production stymied due to disruption or the loss of skilled workers.  Heydrich admonishes Hofmann over his insistence that his office takes the lead in managing resettlement in Hungary.  A break is called and this time it is Kritzinger's turn to be taken aside and intimidated by Heydrich, who warns that Kritzinger is influential but not invulnerable. Heydrich tells Kritzinger that he wants not only consent but active support, and Kritzinger realizes that any hopes he had of assuring livable conditions for the Jewish population are unrealistic. In return, he tells Heydrich a cautionary tale about a man consumed by hatred of his father, so much so that his life loses its meaning once his father dies; Heydrich later interprets this as a warning that a similar fate awaits them if they allow their lives to revolve around antisemitism, but rejects the possibility.  Heydrich then recalls and concludes the meeting, giving clear directives that the SS are to be obeyed in all matters relating to the elimination of the Jews. He also asks for explicit assent and support from each official, one by one. After giving careful instructions on the secrecy of the minutes and notes of the meeting, they are adjourned and begin to depart.  In the evening twilight, a stunned Kritzinger remarks to Hofmann, "It is night in [[Moscow]] already. Soon it will be dark here. Do you think we will ever see the dawn in our lifetime?"  As the servants at the [[villa]] tidy away the remains of the meeting, and the officials depart, a brief account of the fate of each one is given. The movie ends with the house tidied up and all records of the meeting destroyed as if it had never happened. The final card before the credits reveals that Luther's copy of the Wannsee minutes, found by the [[United States Army]] in the archives of the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign Office]] in 1947, was the only record of the conference to survive.  
Cradle of Fear
 The opening scene sees "The Man" being approached and attacked by two muggers in a dark alley of [[London]]. As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both.  Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finally finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. All three bodies are found by the police at Sophie's house.  As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former [[hypnotist]] and son of infamous [[Satanism|Satanist]] Anthony Crawley. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[lunatic asylum]]. Neilson's boss has Kemper transferred to another facility so that his cell can be investigated.  Nick Holland is an amputee who is unable to engage in sexual activity with his girlfriend Natalie due to his frustration with the loss of his left leg in a prior accident. Nick visits his old friend Thomas and shoots him in the head. He then removes Thomas' left leg, puts it on ice and has it [[organ transplantation|transplanted]] to himself by his doctor overnight. Nick goes through rehabilitation and eventually becomes able to move his transplanted leg. One night, while driving with Natalie, Nick loses control of his leg which steps on the accelerator, resulting in a crash that instantly kills Natalie. As two policemen arrive on the scene, they witness Nick stab himself to death, then The Man appears and kills them both. Meanwhile, a [[contract killing|hit list]] is found in Kemper's old cell, containing the names and addresses of those responsible for his capture and their relatives, including the recent victims and Neilson himself. During his confinement, Kemper had also managed to give a copy of the list to The Man.  Richard is a reporter with a morbid obsession for [[extreme pornography]] and [[snuff films]]. One day he finds a website offering real-time footage of people being attacked and tortured on commands issued by the user. Richard's escalating obsession with the website causes him to lose his job and, eventually, his house. While attempting to log into the site from an [[internet cafe]], he receives an [[email]] from an anomymous sender who reveals the location of the house where the live footage is filmed. Upon reaching the house, Richard is taken by the homeowner to the supposed location of the filming equipment, but instead he finds himself on the set of the snuff filming, where he is murdered by two masked men upon orders issued remotely by The Man. As his body is found and identified, Richard is revealed to be Neilson's son.  Determined to avenge his son and end the streak of killings, Neilson goes to the facility where Kemper is held and forces the staff to take him to Kemper's cell at gunpoint. He shoots Kemper in a leg and arm, but is immobilised by reinforcement guards before he can kill him. The Man, disguised as one of the guards, uses a [[machete]] to kill the director of the facility and the remaining guards, and is now revealed to be Kemper's son. Neilson shoots The Man, blowing half his head off, then delivers the fatal gunshot to Kemper. The Man however gets back on his feet and, with claws and tentacles emerging from the remaining half of his head, supposedly kills Neilson off-camera.  
CQ (film)
 In Paris in 1969, young [[film editor]] Paul Ballard ([[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]]) is currently working on a [[science-fiction]] [[adventure film]] called ''Codename: Dragonfly'', written and directed by renowned director Andrezej ([[Gérard Depardieu]]).   In ''Codename: Dragonfly'', Valentine plays "Dragonfly," a sexy freelance super-agent - in the futuristic year of 2001 - who lives in a spaceship perched on top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] and undertakes assignments for the "World Council".  Dragonfly's latest mission is to stop a revolutionary leader known as "Mr. E" ([[Billy Zane]]) who is based on the "far-out" side of [[the Moon]].  The World Council turns for help to Dragonfly, reluctantly because she charges huge sums of money -  with which the council literally showers her.  Andrezej is utterly infatuated with his film's star, Valentine ([[Angela Lindvall]]), a young American whom he discovered at a [[political rally]] some time ago. Paul, an aspiring [[filmmaker]] working on ''Codename: Dragonfly'', regularly borrows cameras and other equipment from work in order to film his own project: a [[Documentary film|documentary]] of his own [[self-reflection]]s.  When the producers prove unhappy with Andrezej's ideas for the movie's ending, they fire him.  They are particularly upset with Andrezej's ideas for what they had expected would be an action movie: Andrezej believes it should end with a whimper instead of a bang, in order to subvert the audience's expectations.    Andrezej is first replaced with the flashy Felix DeMarco ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) - but ultimately producers settle on Paul.  Much as Andrezej before him, Paul finds his efforts to complete ''Codename: Dragonfly'' stymied by his infatuation with Valentine.  Paul has a girlfriend, Marlene ([[Elodie Bouchez]]), an [[Air France]] flight attendant who makes time for Paul despite her schedule, his obvious growing infatuation with Valentine, his obsession with film making and his self-absorption.  Ultimately, Marlene leaves Paul, realizing that his obsessions will never include her.  Paul is also challenged by the apparent work of a saboteur, who cuts up footage before it can be edited, and who sends cryptic messages to the remaining crew.  Others suspect Andrezej - who resents being fired and losing control of what he considers to be his film.  As the crew prepares to shoot a climactic chase scene in ''Codename: Dragonfly'', Andrezej sneaks onto the set and steals their film.  Valentine and Paul jump into Dragonfly's car and chase Andrezej through Paris, ultimately confronting him on the banks of the [[Seine]].  Paul convinces Andrezej to return the film, and ultimately it is completed, apparently keeping Andrezej's original idea for the ending.    Finally, Paul is a guest speaker at a French film festival in early 1970. Despite signs of stature, he is asked to pass along a script to Felix DeMarco, as though he is still in the other man's shadow. The festival also presents Paul's own film - the collection of self-reflections he'd been shooting over the course of ''Codename: Dragonfly.''  In voice overs accompanying Paul's film, it is learned that Marlene and Paul never got back together.

Corky Romano
  [[Veterinary technician]] Corky Romano ([[Chris Kattan]]) having been banished from his family after the death of his mother, is unaware of their underworld connections until he receives a call from his father, "Pops" ([[Peter Falk]]), a Mafia crime lord. Pops has been [[indicted]] on [[racketeering]] charges, and, knowing that the prosecutors have a strong case against him, has concluded that the only solution is to somehow destroy the evidence held by the FBI.  At the family mansion, an ailing and bedridden Pops convinces Corky to infiltrate the local FBI office, since the Romano family cannot send anyone with known underworld connections, such as Corky's brothers Paulie ([[Peter Berg]]) and Peter ([[Chris Penn]]).  With the aid of a computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], Corky is able to obtain a false name ("Agent Corky [[Pissant]] pronounced 'peesohn'...It's, you know, French!"), background, and résumé. He gains access to the local FBI office, where he discovers from office chief Howard Schuster that, according to his résumé, "Pissant" graduated from [[Harvard]], can speak five different languages, is an expert [[sharpshooter]] and has a black belt in the [[martial art]] "yan mu kwan."  Corky makes several trips to the FBI office's evidence room, only to be sidetracked each time. He is sent on investigations and raids, most of which have nothing to do with his father's case. Corky finds himself on a mission to infiltrate a [[Nazi-Skinheads|neo-Nazi skinhead]] group related to the Night Vulture, a [[heroin]] trafficker who is number six on the FBI's Most Wanted List. Corky approaches the gang members, who promptly rip off the [[Britney Spears]] tank top he is wearing as a disguise, and take him to a warehouse. Every Mafia member, including Paulie and Peter, are listening in through a microphone that was earlier taped to Corky's crotch. They go to the warehouse, beat up all the gang members, and leave. When the FBI arrives, they assume that Corky has handled the skinheads singlehandedly. He receives praise at the office and in the local media, though one agent, Agent Brick Davis ([[Matthew Glave]]) appears both jealous and suspicious of him.  Corky attends a hostage situation involving a Night Vulture suspect. FBI director Howard Schuster ([[Richard Roundtree]]) hands Corky a machine gun and orders him to kill the suspect. When Corky fires, the trigger gets stuck, spraying bullets everywhere. One of them hits a propane tank, causing it to explode, which knocks the suspect off his feet. Agents rush in and arrest the suspect, and it transpires that his gun was a fake. Schuster sends Corky to put the suspect in jail.  On the trip back to the FBI office, Corky locks himself out of the car and the suspect kicks out the metal divider between the front and back seats. The divider jams the gas pedal to the floor, sending the car weaving wildly through city streets. Corky's arm is stuck in the window the whole time.  Later, the car crashes into Paulie and Peter. Davis and other agents arrive and proceed to arrest Paulie and Peter, citing photographic equipment in the backseat of their car (the family mansion was already under watch by the FBI). However, Corky steps in to handle the situation. He [[farts]] in the faces of his brothers, and tells them to leave.  Corky grows to like FBI agent Kate Russo ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), but she seems uninterested until they bump into each other at the Romano mansion where Russo has been sent undercover to collect more evidence against the Romanos. Corky is able to convince Russo that he, too, is working undercover.  Corky is sent to infiltrate a drug deal in Chinatown posing as a translator (the agency believes that he can speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]]). Corky attempts to translate, but ends up saying nonsense phrases such as "fool" and "hairy pencil".  The participating drug lords draw their guns and begin shooting in frustration. Corky's new FBI partners, agents Bob Cox ([[Roger Fan]]) and Terrence Darnell ([[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]), engage in a shootout with one of them while the other escapes.  Cox and Darnell are captured while trying to infiltrate one of Pops' underground [[casino]]s. Corky comes to the rescue, but is caught by the bouncers and has his head placed in a paint shaker. When it is discovered that he is a member of the Romano family, and the bouncers ask how they can make it up to Corky, he says, "Maybe I can take some of my friends with me?".  Corky eventually gets the evidence, and discovers that his father will be facing [[murder]] charges.  Shocked, he tells Pops, who vehemently denies killing anyone. Meanwhile, Russo discovers that Corky is a member of the Romano family and not an FBI agent. The entire FBI office conducts a raid on the Romano mansion, where it is discovered that family friend Leo Corrigan ([[Fred Ward]]) is an FBI informant and has been lying about the family's activities, including the alleged murder. It is also discovered that Brick Davis is in fact the Night Vulture. Leo is knocked out by Corky with a light fixture, and Davis is arrested by his fellow FBI agents. In the end, Corky and Agent Russo get married and drive off in Corky's car, a bright yellow [[Mazda Miata]]. Corky also gains the respect and love of his entire family.  The peculiar nickname "Corky" is alleged to be taken from real life [[New Jersey]] mobster [[Gaetano Vastola (gangster)|Gaetano Vastola]] whose nickname among the mafia ranks as a street soldier was "Corky". Gaetano is also believed to have been the model for the fictional character in [[The Sopranos]], [[Hesh Rabkin]] (played by [[Jerry Adler]]).  
Costa!
 Janet is a lonely girl who is forced to go on holidays with her sister Angela and her arrogant friends, Maureen and Joyce. When they arrive in [[Spain]], Angela and her friends take off to the beach while Janet has to carry all the luggage to their apartment.  That night, Angela, Joyce and Maureen decide to go out and end up in the popular [[nightclub]] ''Costa''. Janet is left home alone, but doesn't agree and goes to Costa as well.  Afterwards, Rens walks Janet home, while singing some songs and doing some new dances. Rens soon finds out that Frida is unable to dance for a couple more weeks and she cannot join them during the MTV Dancing Awards. Rens takes a risk by asking Janet to dance with the group, despite the protest of the other dancers, Tommy and Björn. Janet agrees and she and Rens are practicing a lot in the following days.   That night, a parade is all over the streets of [[Salou]]. While watching the parade, Janet spots the car of Costa's rival nightclub, ''The Empire'' where Rens now works. She, Angela, Joyce and Maureen visit The Empire, and realize the club is different from Costa—the dancers  work with snakes and the women wear [[dominatrix]]-style outfits. Maureen eventually gets drunk by the end of the night.  The girls lose sight of her and don't see her going to the back with one of the dancers.  When Rens arrives, he sees Maureen lying on a table about to be raped by the dancer.  Rens punches him. Maureen gets away safely while Rens is beaten up by the rest of the Empire dancers.  Meanwhile, Rens heads back to the streets of Salou, where he finds Tommy, Björn and Bart, Frida's younger brother. The four reunite and steal a car from The Empire dancers. The four head to the Empire building. When they arrive there, they get into a fight with the dancers of the Empire. The Costa's win eventually, leaving the Empires knocked out behind. Tommy, Björn and Bart go back to Costa, leaving Rens behind, who doesn't know what he has to do now.  The dancers of Costa still have to perform for the MTV Dancing Award, but they don't have a convincing dance, causing the audience to yell at them.  Janet arrives at the club, asking if she can join them.  Rens arrives as well and the two meet at the back, where they are happy to see each other.

Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles
 At the beginning of the film, protagonist [[Michael "Crocodile" Dundee]] ([[Paul Hogan]]) is living in the Australian outback with Sue Charlton ([[Linda Kozlowski]]) and their young son Mikey (Serge Cockburn).  Because [[crocodile]] hunting has been made illegal, Mick is reduced to wrestling crocodiles for the entertainment of tourists, having as his rival in the business another outback survivalist named Jacko (Alec Wilson).  When an opportunity arises for Sue to become the Los Angeles bureau chief of a newspaper owned by her father, Mick and his family cross the Pacific to California.  In the United States, Mick and his son's encounters with the locals cause cross-cultural mishaps.  Mick becomes an undercover amateur sleuth helping to probe the mysterious death of his wife's predecessor at the newspaper, while Mikey attends a local school, where he quickly impresses his classmates and teacher with his outback survival skills.  Because the case takes up so much of their time, Mick and Sue eventually call in Jacko to babysit their son; Immediately, Jacko and Mikey's teacher become interested in each other.  It is revealed that the dead reporter had been investigating a film studio, which is about to make a sequel to the [[action film]] ''Lethal Agent'', despite the title's [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]].  Mick becomes suspicious when several paintings from Southern Europe are brought onto the set; although at first he suspects drug smuggling, the pictures themselves are revealed to be missing art from a museum in former [[Yugoslavia]] thought lost in the [[Yugoslav Wars|recent civil wars]].

Cruel Intentions 2
 Troublemaker student Sebastian Valmont ([[Robin Dunne]]) is transferring to Manchester Prep following his father's new marriage to a wealthy divorcee. His current [[Principal (education)|principal]] is insistent on having Sebastian's permanent record relayed to his new school, thereby hampering his chance for a fresh start, but Sebastian already retaliated by pulling a cruel stunt on his wife.  Following his arrival in [[New York, New York|New York]], Sebastian discovers the wealth of his new family and first meets his deceitful and determined step-sister [[Kathryn Merteuil]] ([[Amy Adams]]). Sebastian quickly proves to be able to better her both at piano and vocabulary. This leads to a confrontation between Kathryn and Sebastian whereby she states that she has a comfortable lifestyle and that he "better not interfere".  Sebastian begins school. While waiting to see his new headmaster, he encounters Danielle Sherman ([[Sarah Thompson (actress)|Sarah Thompson]]), who is, unbeknownst to him, Headmaster Sherman's daughter. Luckily, Sebastian swapped his permanent record for an excelling one before it was sent to the headmaster's office, and he can now start over with a clean slate. A school assembly follows, showing Kathryn delivering a speech to her classmates, but being persistently interrupted by uncontrollable hiccups coming from a student, who then begins to choke on the gum that she was chewing in a bid to stop her hiccups. She is saved by the quick action of Danielle who performs the [[Heimlich maneuver]], allowing the student to expel the gum, which ends up flying into Kathryn's hair. A meeting of a [[secret society]] of student elites presided by Kathryn takes place, deciding upon the fate of the new students. This leads them to Cherie, the student with the hiccups, as well as the discovery that Cherie's family is wealthier than that of Kathryn; this, along with the events of the assembly, causes Kathryn to seek a vendetta against Cherie.  Sebastian, coming from a more humble upbringing, wishes to befriend his house staff. Doing so angers Kathryn, whose day is interrupted by not being able to contact her driver. This, combined with Kathryn's jealousy of Sebastian, causes her to admit that she is unhappy with her life. Sebastian attempts to woo Danielle: first, asking her for coffee at her work; then later, conversing with her over the telephone. Eventually, this evolves into a relationship, but Kathryn, seeing this, uses it as a way to get back at Sebastian. She tries to lure him away from Danielle by tempting him with identical twins, who confide to Sebastian that Danielle is the only virgin at Manchester.  Kathryn's attempt to sabotage Cherie backfires, as Kathryn's mother tells her to become best friends with Cherie, in an attempt to encourage Cherie's mother to donate a large amount of money to the school. In the end, Sebastian stays with Danielle; he professes his love for her, only to find that she does not reciprocate. It turns that Danielle is actually working alongside Kathryn in a secret plan to dupe Sebastian. Defeated by Kathryn's manipulation, Sebastian states "if you can't beat them, join them", thus leading to a threesome with Danielle and Kathryn, followed by an alliance of the three to dominate and manipulate others. In the last scene, Cherie is seen riding her bike, which is run over by Sebastian's car. Sebastian offers to give her a ride, and has sex with her. Kathryn and Danielle are seen, in the front of the car, pleased with the results.

Upon returning home, tradition dictates that Will must take the tribal chief position.

Crying... Silicon Tears
 The movie is divided into three clear timelines, the 1960s, the World War II period and the bucolic period (in order from newest to oldest). In the 1960s, the rich Della Franca family start a fight with the poor Bisbikis family over a man that romances with women from both families. The Della Franca's manage to put the mother of the Bisbikis', Lavrentia, out of business, which triggers the [[World War II]] flashback, where Lavrentia worked with the [[Greek Resistance]]. In that period, another event triggers the bucolic period in the form of Lavrentia talking about her ancestors, a man and a woman that lived in a small village in the countryside. No clear main plot existent in any period, the film mainly revolves around Lavrentia's history and the tragic events that stained her life. In the end of the film, it is revealed that the Bisbikis' are actually blood-related to the Della Franca's and they all live happily ever after.  Although the film features mostly tragic events, they are presented in a way that parodies older movies of the Greek cinema, rendering them hilarious. It is both a tribute and a satire of old Greek dramas, war movies and bucolic-style films.  
Crayon Shin-chan: Fierceness That Invites Storm! The Adult Empire Strikes Back
 Shinnosuke and his family attend a convention that dates back to the 20th century. Even though adults like Hiroshi and Misae are filled with fascination and excitement, children like Shin and Himawari are disinterested and concerned for their parent's nostalgia. As this goes on, Ken and Chaco (the owners of the convention) discuss plans to "rid of the smell of the 21st century." This takes into effect during the night as Hiroshi and Misae suddenly sleeps for the night.  The next morning, Shin finds that Hiroshi and Misae have become very crude and irresponsible. After angrily leaving the house for kindergarten, Shin (taking Himawari along with him) finds that every adult is acting childlike; this even extends to the kindergarten he goes to. Suddenly, trucks appear and take every adult to a place where only the 20th century exists. Shin and his friends meet at his house to discuss the events that occurred in their hometown. Not only they found out that children are trying to survive without their parents, the media they are watching and listening to is reverting to the 20th century; this is only made worse when the electricity shuts down. Later, trucks appear and several workers claim that they arrive to pick up the children and reunite them with their parents; however, Shin and his friends realize this is nothing more than a trap, and that they heard they will come back to capture other stray children.

After finding Misae, Ken decides to take Shin and his reunited family to the source of the 20th century.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
 In 1940, C.W. Briggs ([[Woody Allen]]) is an insurance investigator in New York City who is highly successful, owing to his many connections and ability to think like a criminal.  His work does not impress Betty Ann Fitzgerald ([[Helen Hunt]]), an efficiency expert who butts heads with C.W. over his old-fashioned views. Her advice is usually followed, however, because she secretly is in a relationship with her boss, Chris Magruder ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), who constantly reassures her that they will be free to pursue their relationship in public once he finalizes his divorce with his wife.  While attending a dinner with some employees, Voltan ([[David Ogden Stiers]]), a stage magician calls on Betty Ann and C.W. to be in his hypnotism act.  Using the words "Madagascar" and "Constantinople" on them respectively as trigger words to put them in a trance, the two are given the suggestion that they are newlyweds who are madly in love before being reawakened.  When C.W. returns home for the evening, he receives a call from Voltan, who uses C.W.'s trigger word to put him back in a trance and orders him to steal jewels for him.  C.W. has no recollections of these crimes after he is woken up and is determined to prove himself by solving the crimes.  He starts investigating Betty Ann on the grounds of her suspicious behavior (actually related to her affair with Chris) and sneaks into her house one evening. There, he witnesses Chris telling her that he has reconciled with his wife and will not have a divorce.  When he leaves, Betty Ann becomes drunk in a fit of depression and tries to jump out of a window.  C.W. stops her and spends the night keeping her from other self-destructive activities.  Eventually, investigations start picking up evidence pointing to C.W., leading to his arrest.  He manages to escape to Betty Ann's place, where she grudgingly hides him. Thinking that C.W. is no longer available, Voltan calls Betty Ann, using her trigger word of "Madagascar" to put her in a hypnotic state and steal for him. On her return, still in a trance, the subliminal suggestion of being in love leads her to seduce C.W.  Eventually C.W.'s co-workers and friends George Bond ([[Wallace Shawn]]) and Alvin "Al" ([[Brian Markinson]]) recall the initial hypnotism and realize that it is the cause of the robberies.  George, an amateur magician, frees C.W. of the trigger word and restores his memories.  C.W. realizes what has happened and goes back to Betty Ann's apartment to find her missing.  He then realizes that Betty Ann must have been hypnotized again and manages to locate the site where the still hypnotized Betty Ann is delivering the jewels to Voltan.  Voltan discovers C.W. and holds him at gunpoint.  However, C.W. deduces that a small-time criminal like Voltan would not have the nerve to do something as drastic as murder.  Voltan tries escaping, but the police catch him shortly after.  The still-hypnotized Betty Ann expresses her love for C.W. who takes advantage of her state to passionately kiss her before erasing her memories of the event.  Back at work, the employees talk about Betty Ann and Chris going on a romantic getaway.  C.W. goes to Chris to inform him of his resignation.  An apologetic Chris understands and lets him know that if C.W. leaves, the company will give him his blessing and if he stays, Chris will give him a raise.  He also promises C.W. that if he stays, he will make sure that Betty Ann will no longer interfere with his work, letting him know that he intends on forcing her to retire after they get married, as he does not want his wife to be working with him.  This visibly disturbs C.W.  C.W. then heads to Betty Ann's office to let her know of his resignation and say goodbye.  The two have a parting drink during which Betty Ann playfully insults C.W. a few more times and C.W. expresses his amazement that an intelligent woman like Betty Ann would be with Chris, stating that she refuses to be vulnerable even at the price of finding true love and happiness.  Outside, Al says that he will quit if C.W. does, and the rest of the staff hail him as a hero.  C.W. dismisses his success as luck.  When Al notes that hypnotism can make people do things that they do not want to do, George reveals that a hypnotized would not do anything that they would not when in a normal state, leading everyone to realize that both C.W. and Betty Ann have secret criminal instincts.  Al then privately gets C.W. to admit that he loves Betty Ann.  At Al's urging, C.W. decides to go after Betty Ann, who is about to leave for Paris with Chris.  C.W. proceeds to propose to Betty Ann, confess his love for her, and convince her that she loves him, too.  Betty Ann repeatedly rejects and insults C.W. while Chris tries to get C.W. to leave.  As Betty Ann and Chris are about to leave, a desperate C.W. uses her trigger word to hypnotize Betty Ann.  Betty Ann, who is now in an amorous state, dreamily tells Chris that she is staying with C.W. and announces that the two are getting married, confessing to C.W. that she fell in love with him the moment that they met.  A frantic Chris runs to stop his divorce while Al presents C.W. with the jade scorpion as a gift.  C.W. and Betty Ann decide to go to her apartment to have sex.  As they are leaving, Al notes that it was lucky that George forgot to deprogram Betty Ann, but George reveals that he had done that the night before.  Meanwhile, Betty Ann continues to gush out her love for C.W., and C.W. promises her that he will be able to make her love him for real.  Betty Ann notes that anything is possible, pointing out that she was able to make C.W. fall in love with her without using his trigger word.  At that moment, C.W. realizes that Betty Ann is no longer hypnotized and finds her grinning knowingly.  Understanding that she is going with him willingly, the two head off with Betty Ann putting her arm around C.W.  
Dagon (film)
 Stock market tycoon Paul Marsh has a dream that he discovers a [[mermaid]] with razor sharp teeth while scuba diving into a carven pit. Paul awakes on a boat off the shores of Spain, where he is vacationing with his girlfriend, Barbara, and their friends Vicki and Howard. A sudden storm blows their boat against some hidden rocks. Vicki is trapped below deck and Howard stays with her while Paul and Barbara take a lifeboat to the nearby fishing village of Imboca. During their absence, an unseen creature from the deep attacks the two in the boat.  At shore, Barbara and Paul find no one about and venture into town until they eventually reach the church, where they find a priest. Barbara convinces him to help them, and the priest speaks with two fishermen at the docks, who volunteer to take either Paul or Barbara to the wreck. Despite Paul's misgivings, Barbara stays to try to find a phone in order to call the police and a doctor while Paul goes to help their friends.  Vicki and Howard are mysteriously missing, however, and Paul is taken back to Imboca, where he is sent to the hotel that Barbara was supposed to have gone to. But she is missing as well and Paul is left to wait for her in an old, filthy hotel room, where he dreams of the mermaid again. His fitful rest is disturbed by a large gathering of [[Deep One|strange, fish-like people]] approaching the hotel and is forced to flee. He ends up in a macabre tannery full of human skins, where he discovers Howard's remains. He escapes the tannery by starting a fire and finds momentary safety with an old drunkard named Ezequiel, the last full-blooded human in Imboca.  Ezequiel explains to Paul that, many years ago, the village fell on lean times and turned from Catholicism to the worship of [[Dagon]], converting the church into his temple. This brought marvelous wealth to Imboca in the form of fish and gold, but also horror when Dagon demanded [[Human sacrifice|blood sacrifices]] and human women to breed with. These were, respectively, the fates of Ezequiel's father and mother. Paul begs Ezequiel to help him escape. Ezequiel relents and takes Paul to the Mayor's manor, so he can steal the town's only car. Ezequiel distracts some Imbocans long enough for Paul to slip inside, but he accidentally honks the horn while trying to hot-wire the engine. Forced to flee into the manor, Paul finds a beautiful woman named Uxia, the mermaid from his dreams. She saves him from discovery, but when he finds that she really is half-fish, he flees in horror, despite her pleas for him to stay.  Paul narrowly escapes a horde of villagers in the car, but ends up crashing. He is caught and thrown into a barn, where he is reunited with Vicki, Ezequiel, and Barbara. The three plan to escape, but the attempt is foiled. Having been raped and impregnated by Dagon, the traumatized Vicki kills herself. Paul and Ezequiel are separated from Barbara and end up in a butchery, where they are chained and given a chance to join the worship of Dagon. When they both refuse, Ezequiel is flayed alive before Paul's eyes as they recite the [[23rd Psalm]] together.  Paul is saved by the appearance of Uxia, who informs him that he has no choice but to join them. He offers to stay with her in return for Barbara's release, but she insists that Barbara must stay and bear Dagon's child. When Paul seems to concede, Uxia tells the priest of Dagon to make arrangements for their marriage. After Uxia leaves, Paul escapes, killing the guards and the priest. He starts looking for Barbara, collecting a can of kerosene on the way. When he reaches the church, apparently intending to burn it down, he instead discovers a hidden passage that leads below ground to a ritual chamber. There a congregation of Imbocans watch Uxia prepare Barbara to be offered to Dagon; she is chained by her wrists and lowered nude into a deep pit leading to the sea. While the Imbocan congregation and Uxia call to Dagon, Paul attacks, dousing several villagers in kerosene and setting them on fire. He winches Barbara back out of the pit, but Dagon has already raped her and she pleads with him to kill her. Paul refuses and the monstrous Dagon himself grabs Barbara and tears her bodily from the winch, claiming her as his new consort and leaving her severed hands still in their chains.  The uninjured Imbocans assault Paul, but are halted by Uxia and a monstrously deformed Imbocan who is revealed to be Uxia's father—and Paul's. Uxia explains that Paul's human mother escaped from Imboca years ago, but now that Paul has returned, he will be her lover and they will dwell with Dagon forever. Trapped, Paul pours the last of the kerosene over his own body and sets himself on fire. Uxia grabs him and dives into the water, where Paul sprouts gills. With no choice left, he follows Uxia down into Dagon's undersea lair.

After the invasion, the Czechoslovakian military is disbanded and has to give up its aircraft. However, young pilots Franta and his friend Karel Vojtíšek (Kryštof Hádek), among others, refuse to submit to their occupiers and flee to the United Kingdom to join the RAF.  The British make the Czechoslovaks retrain from the basics, which infuriates them, especially Karel, who is both impatient to fight the Germans and humiliated at being retaught what he already knows. Karel also sees the compulsory English language lessons as a pointless waste of his time.  The RAF is in such a dire need of pilots during the [[Battle of Britain]] that eventually the Czech and Slovak airmen are allowed to fly, and after their first [[sortie]], they realise why the British have trained them so intensely: a young Czechoslovak nicknamed "Tom Tom" is shot down by a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]].

As the film opens, she is arrested on suspicion of [[child abuse]], and during questioning, she reveals the story of what actually happened, told via [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].  One evening, a call to Jack's basketball coach reveals that he has been given a two-week suspension from the team due to poor grades, which Jack did not tell her. Compounded with the fact that he stayed out past curfew that night, Sally attempts to talk to Jack about his problems, but he angrily orders her out of his bedroom, slightly shoving her in the process. A short time later, while hanging out with his friend Luke, Jack is arrested for [[shoplifting]] at the local mall, and when Sally attempts to question him afterwards, he again becomes furious and smashes a glass. She later tries to ask Jack what caused this outburst, but he tells her he doesn't know and tearfully apologizes.  Not long afterwards, Sally goes on a date with a colleague named Frank, who is also divorced. While Leo warms up to him immediately, Jack is outright rude when Frank arrives to pick Sally up, and when she reprimands Jack for his behavior, he shouts at her and then pushes her aside. Later that night, Jack receives a phone call from Luke, and although entrusted with watching his little brother, he leaves Leo alone to go to a party. Furious, Sally grounds Jack for a month and takes the phone to call Luke's mother. A confrontation ensues, which soon turns physical, and when Sally slaps Jack in retaliation, he attempts to punch her, but she ducks and he ends up putting his hand through a window, cutting his arm in the process.  A couple of nights later, Sally has Frank over for dinner, but Jack is once again rude, and when Sally tries to talk to him afterwards, it escalates into another physical confrontation, which is cut short by a visit from the police. Both Sally and Jack claim that nothing's wrong, which satisfies them, but the next day sees Leo discovering Gus, the family cat, with a broken leg. After he and Sally return home from the vet, she finds Jack crying in his room, apologizing over and over.  Realizing her son has a problem, Sally seeks advice at a [[women's shelter]], where a counselor suggests she take out an [[order of protection]] against Jack. Though she goes to the police station, Sally changes her mind and instead goes to her ex-husband Brad's office and attempts to explain what happened the night of Jack's "accident", but Brad blames her for not having control over the situation, and takes custody of the boys. While at Brad's, an argument ensues between Leo and his stepmother  Marcia, with Leo taking an angry tone not unlike Jack's. Later that night, Jack decides to go back home and apologize to his mother, but is greeted upon his arrival by the sight of his mother in an embrace with Frank, which sets off another physical confrontation between Jack and Sally. Having followed his brother there, Leo attempts to stop Jack, but gets pushed in the struggle and inadvertently strikes his head as he falls to the floor.  After Sally's arrest, she is brought to the hospital to see Leo, where Jack and Brad are waiting; realizing the charges his mother faces, Jack finally owns up to his misdeeds, confessing to the accompanying officers and his father that he was the one responsible for everything. As a result, Sally is released and Jack gets arrested for [[assault]]. Although the prosecutor is unwilling to drop the charges against Jack, an offer is made to defer them if Sally and Brad file an at-risk youth petition, which mandates that Jack be placed in a treatment program, during which time he will also be put in temporary foster care, and that his parents undergo individual counseling. Afterwards, Brad takes responsibility for his own anger issues, which Sally points out that their sons have picked up on, and informs him they need to work together to get Jack the help he needs.   During his group counseling sessions, Jack comes to understand that his violent outbursts were learned behavior, rooted in the verbal abuse his father often dealt towards his mother, while Sally's individual sessions gives her the opportunity to acknowledge her own father's verbally abusive behavior toward her mother, as well as her own tendency to back down on enforcing discipline in an effort to avoid a verbal showdown, and what she perceives as having failed at her marriage. However, her therapist points out that Sally did not fail at her marriage; she simply couldn't tolerate the verbal abuse from Brad, and getting out of it was the best thing she could have done.  After returning home, Jack admits to his mother about having felt relief when Brad left and knowing she felt the same, while Sally acknowledges she had no idea how to make Brad stop behaving the way he did towards her, and Jack adds that he didn't either. The two then embrace, with Jack apologizing to Sally as she assures him that things are going to be OK and they're both getting the help they need.

Den places his victims in a large abandoned theater. He chains the captives to the walls and doles out meager supplies that will keep them alive. Den is truthful to the group: He admits he is a [[serial killer]] and that they are on his "list of people to do." But he wants something... conversation. Through the course of nine days, he starts daily arguments and debates with the group. As the days pass on it is revealed that the group is not only tied by chains, but by personal secrets. Milton reveals that her passion to be a nun was squelched when she realized she had [[homosexuality|sexual attractions towards women]]. She also confesses to having an affair with a married woman. Steven's darker side comes out early on when his [[racism|racial]] and [[Cultural bias|biased]] belief system is heard. He has also been a disloyal spouse by seeing hookers, which is a surprise to Lolita, but not to Cassandra. Lolita has her own skeleton she wishes to keep in the closet, but Den opens the door when it is disclosed that she has also had an affair... with Milton. And when Cassandra admits to being an atheist, this shocks Den more than her work as a prostitute.   It is revealed that Den is storing them under a church where he works as a [[priest]]. Den uses the captive's secrets to turn one against the other. But Cassandra takes all the physical and mental abuse and throws it back at Den with all the strength and stamina she can muster.

With Milton's sexual orientation and affair with Lolita exposed, Den manipulates Steven into stabbing and killing Milton with a [[crucifix]]-knife. He offers to let Steven get away with the killing, but recants, and when Steven attacks him in anger, Den beats him to death. The final scene has Cassandra verbally attacking the [[Bible]] and Den's beliefs. She calls out several mistakes that are written in this holy text and, thereby proves, if there is a God, he had no hand in the making of this religious manuscript. Den, after supposedly killing a few children, returns to kill Cassandra. He stabs her in the chest with the crucifix-knife. He taunts her about pulling the knife out so she can kill him. She doesn't and he feels that this is proof of the "no atheist in foxholes" theory. As he turns to leave, Cassandra removes the knife and tosses it at Den. The knife skewers his head. He removes the knife and rushes to kill her, but convulses and dies on her. Cassandra is unable to escape and dies. Their final death tableau forms the [[Pietà]] position.

Dil Chahta Hai
 The movie is about three childhood friends, Akash  ([[Aamir Khan]]), Sameer  ([[Saif Ali Khan]]), and Siddharth "Sid"  ([[Akshaye Khanna]]).   Akash does not believe in the concept of love and does not engage in relationships lasting more than two weeks.   Sameer is a genial, well-meaning, desperately romantic, but confused guy who is prone to romantic infatuations and believes to have found true love whenever he gets attracted to a girl.   Sid, an artist by profession and the most mature of the three, is not interested in trivial romances and is very serious, mature and dedicated to his work.  Akash, who is a cad in his personal life, proposes to a girl named Shalini ([[Preity Zinta]]) in jest, without being aware that she is engaged to someone called Rohit. He also engineers a breakup between Sameer and his then girlfriend Priya ([[Suchitra Pillai]]).  The three friends then go to Goa for a vacation. There Sameer falls in love with a foreign-looking lady and while Akash and Sid return, Sameer stays with the lady in Goa. However, she turns out to be a cheat and she, along with another man, rob Sameer of his belongings and Sameer is forced to return by lorry/truck hitch hiking. Akash and Sid have a good laugh at his plight.  Later, Sameer finds his parents have arranged a meeting with a potential marriage prospect. He resists at first as he does not want an arranged marriage, but the moment he sees the girl, Pooja ([[Sonali Kulkarni]]), he realizes that she is "the one". Unfortunately, he later discovers that she is in a relationship and Sameer has to be content with just being her friend.  Sid befriends and eventually falls in love with Tara  ([[Dimple Kapadia]]), an older divorcee and chronic alcoholic, who has moved into his neighbourhood and shares his love for art. He decides to keep it from her, suppressing all his feelings as he knows that she, like most other people in society, would consider this relationship  scandalous. When his family and friends start finding out, everything goes wrong. Sid's mother is horrified and wrongly accuses Tara of having led Sid on. Akash makes fun of Sid's true intentions and then he slaps him which creates a rift in their friendship. Tara hears that Sid has quarreled with friends and family because of her and feeling that she has ruined his life, refuses to see him.  Meanwhile, Pooja breaks up with her boyfriend and Sameer and Pooja finally start going out. Sameer eventually proposes to her.  When his parents send him to [[Sydney, Australia]] to work for the family business, Akash finds he is coincidentally seated next to Shalini. He apologises for his earlier prank and asks her to show him around the new city. Though Shalini is engaged, she agrees and soon finds herself enjoying his company. She tries to find out how he feels, but he holds back. Eventually, she then leaves for India to marry Rohit. Akash tries to let her go, but then realises that he is unable to. He returns to India and proposes to her on the eve of her wedding. She accepts with her family's blessing.  Tara has been hospitalized with [[liver cirrhosis]] and dies with Sid at her bedside. Sid and Akash finally reconcile. Six months later the three friends go to [[Goa]] to rekindle fond memories along with Shalini and Pooja.

Disco Pigs
 The film revolves around the intense relationship of the two teenage [[protagonist]]s, Darren ([[Cillian Murphy]]) and Sinéad ([[Elaine Cassidy]]), who call each other "Pig" and "Runt," respectively. Pig and Runt were born at the same hospital at nearly the same time and grow up next door to each other. This brings about an extremely close relationship between the two that borders on telepathic. They live in their own world and barely interact with the one around them; when they do, it's mostly to express their hostility toward it. Until just before their 17th birthday, their relationship, while very intense and unhealthy, remains platonic.  Around this time, Runt catches and reciprocates the attentions of another young man, Marky ([[Darren Healy]]), from their school just as Pig begins to develop romantic feelings for Runt. As their birthday draws closer, Pig becomes more volatile and violent and his new feelings become obvious to Runt when he kisses her after a rampage at a nightclub. Runt does not know how to reject him and they continue their friendship, though relations between them are markedly awkward. Their relationship finally raises concerns at their school. With the cooperation of her parents and Pig's single mother, Runt, considered the more adaptive of the two, is sent away to a boarding school. Pig is devastated by this and decides to run away and retrieve Runt.   Even though Runt is paralysed with uncertainty and fear at the boarding school, unsure of how to live her daily life without Pig, she starts to adapt, even befriending another girl. On their 17th birthday, Pig arrives at Runt's school and asks her to leave with them, which she does. Elated at their reunion, the two eventually chance upon a nightclub called The Palace. There, Runt sees Marky again and dances with him. In a fit of jealous rage, Pig beats Marky until he dies. The two flee the club and take a taxi to the beach where they often spend time and make love. In the morning, Pig wordlessly allows Runt to smother him, knowing the punishment awaiting him. Runt stares out to the ocean, wondering what the rest of her life will be like.

Beth goes outside the club for air, where she witnesses the boy who tried to drug her being murdered by someone in a mask. When the police arrive, they find "do you wanna know a secret?" is carved in the boy's back. An FBI agent ([[Jeff Conaway]]) tells the group not to leave the house, as they are all suspects for both murders.  The next day, Oz is attacked in the kitchen while Beth and Hank are showering. Outside at the pool, Nellie realizes that Tina's throat has been slit. Before she can call for help, she is attacked from behind and falls into the pool. Oz regains consciousness, and sees the same message written on the wall in blood. He runs outside to find both Nellie and Tina dead. Oz is arrested by the police for the murders.  At the precinct, the officer who arrested Oz is in the bathroom when he sees the message on the wall. He is then murdered by the masked figure. Oz is released. Beth is waiting outside the police station when she sees a truck drive by. The driver is wearing the mask she remembers from the murder at the club. Hank is nowhere to be found, so she follows the truck out to the glades and waits for Oz to meet up with her.  Oz and Beth search for the killer in the dark woods. They are separated and Oz is knocked out from behind. He wakes up in the basement of a church and hears Beth's scream. Upstairs in the church Beth is tied up in a wedding dress and blindfolded. The killer removes Beth's blindfold and his mask, revealing himself as Brad. Beth sees that the dead bodies of Tina, Nellie, and the pastor are set up in the pews, as if watching. Brad starts cutting Beth's dress open with a knife, when Oz shows up. Brad and Oz fight but Brad wins and ties Oz up again. Beth asks Brad why he murdered everyone. Brad explains that the secret is he loves Beth so much he would do anything, including staging his own death and killing all the others. He then holds up Hank's severed head.  Beth secretly unties her hands and attacks Brad. He knocks her to the ground but Oz gets untied and attacks Brad. As Brad is about to kill Oz, Beth stabs him through his entire body. As Oz and Beth exit the church, Brad jumps up again and is shot by the FBI agent. The agent reveals that the dead pastor was also Brad's father.

Don't Say a Word
 In 1991, a gang of thieves steal a rare $10-million gem, but, in the process, two of the gang double-cross their leader, Patrick Koster ([[Sean Bean]]) and take off with the precious stone.  Ten years later, on the day before [[Thanksgiving]], prominent private practice Manhattan child [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], Dr. Nathan R. Conrad ([[Michael Douglas]]), is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs ([[Oliver Platt]]), to examine a disturbed young lady named Elisabeth Burrows ([[Brittany Murphy]]) at the state [[sanatorium]].  Having been released from prison on November 4, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie ([[Famke Janssen]]) and daughter Jessie ([[Skye McCole Bartusiak]]). That evening, Patrick kidnaps Jessie as a means of forcing Nathan to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust later—especially when he reveals that Jessie has been kidnapped and will be killed if he does not get the number they want. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy ([[Jennifer Esposito]]) who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie's voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the apartment nearby. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him.  After Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth's father was a member of the gang that committed the robbery ten years prior and that he double-crossed them and took the stolen gem. However, other members of the gang later found him and ordered him to reveal where he had hidden the gem, subsequently pushing him in front of a subway train. The gang members were arrested immediately, and Elisabeth escaped with her doll in which the gem was hidden. She also remembers that the required number, 815508, is the number of her father's grave at [[Hart Island (New York)|Hart Island]] and that her doll is placed beside him in the coffin. She explains that she had stowed away on a boat that was taking her father's coffin for burial in Potter's field on Hart Island, where the gravediggers put the doll, named Mischka, inside.  Nathan and Elisabeth steal a boat to reach Hart Island. The gang members track them down and demand that Nathan give them the number they want. Elisabeth reveals the number and Patrick orders his companion to exhume her father's coffin after releasing Jessie. He finds the doll and the gem hidden inside it. He then decides to kill Nathan and Elisabeth, but Cassidy arrives before he can shoot them. Patrick's companion is shot by Cassidy, but Patrick manages to wound her. Taking advantage of the confusion, Nathan takes the gem from Patrick and throws it to a nearby excavation machine. Patrick goes to recover the gem, but Nathan triggers the mechanism which covers Patrick with earth, burying him alive. Nathan reunites with Aggie and Jessie, and invites Elisabeth to live with them.  
Domestic Disturbance
 In Southport, Maryland, Susan Morrison ([[Teri Polo]]), recently divorced from her husband Frank ([[John Travolta]]) who is a struggling ship builder, is getting married to a younger and wealthier Rick Barnes ([[Vince Vaughn]]). Danny ([[Matt O'Leary]]), Susan and Frank's twelve-year-old son, is clearly unhappy that his mother is remarrying. Susan asks Frank to allow Rick to go sailing with him and Danny, to help Danny bond with and accept Rick as a stepfather.   After the wedding and a brief improvement in Danny's and Rick's relationship, Danny dislikes Rick once again. During a game of catch between the two, Rick clearly becomes agitated with Danny's ambivalent playing style and starts criticizing him harshly. The revelation that Susan and Rick are having a baby worsens the situation. After finding out about the baby, Danny stows away in Rick's [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevy Suburban]], planning to drop off it en route and visit his father. But while Danny is inside, he sees Rick murdering mysterious stranger Ray Coleman ([[Steve Buscemi]]), who earlier attended the wedding unannounced, claiming to be an ex-business associate of Rick.   Danny reports the murder to his father and to the local police. Rick, however, has managed to dispose of most of the evidence, and is widely considered a pillar of the local community as he invested his money in the area, whereas Danny has a history of lying and misdemeanors. Frank believes his son though, stemming from Rick's notable unease around Coleman at the ceremony and the fact that Danny never lies to him.  Frank does some investigating of his own and unearths Rick's criminal past, which now stands to put his son and ex-wife in risk. Frank learns that Rick's real name is Jack Parnell and that he is a criminal who was acquitted while his partners, which included Coleman, were convicted. Jack tries to kill Frank by setting his boathouse on fire, but Frank manages to escape.   Susan realizes the truth when she sees a large burn on Jack's arm, having heard about the fire at the boathouse hours earlier. She tries to escape with Danny but Jack knocks her out and takes Danny as a hostage. Frank arrives to confront Jack, as he tries to flee. Jack and Frank fight, and Jack is killed when a tied-up Danny pushes him to a fuse box, [[electric shock|electrocuting]] him. Susan has no serious physical injury from the conflict, although we learn that she [[Miscarriage|miscarries]] her child.

Donnie Darko
   On October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald "Donnie" Darko is woken up and beckoned outside by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume who introduces himself as "Frank" and tells Donnie the precise time the world will end: in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a [[jet engine]] has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigators do not know its origin.  Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents Eddie and Rose send him to  [[psychotherapist]] Dr. Thurman. Dr. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality, and that his visions of Frank are "[[hallucination|daylight hallucinations]]," symptomatic of paranoid [[schizophrenia]]. When Frank asks Donnie if he believes in [[time travel]], Donnie asks his science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff about it. Dr. Monnitoff gives Donnie ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town. Donnie also starts seeing Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.  Frank begins to influence Donnie's actions, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer attributes the act of vandalism to the influence of the short story "[[The Destructors]]", assigned by dedicated English teacher Karen Pomeroy. Kitty begins teaching “attitude lessons” taken from local [[motivational speaker]] Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. Donnie later finds Cunningham's wallet and address, and Frank suggests setting his house on fire. Firefighters discover a hoard of child pornography there. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to chaperone their daughters’ dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.  With Rose in Los Angeles and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a [[Halloween]] costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie make love for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's [[Prophecy|prophesied]] end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who were trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky get into a fight in the road in front of her house, just as Sparrow was returning home. An oncoming car swerves to avoid Sparrow and runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye with his father's gun, and walks home carrying Gretchen’s body.  Donnie returns home as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parent’s cars, loads Gretchen’s body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex’s wake, which violently rips off one of its engines, and sends it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, crushing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the next morning, and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other, but cannot remember where.

Lola appears as his former lover, wanting to be with him again, and tries to get him to reconcile with his mother. Living with him and his mood swings is hard work however, he being a total chauvinist interested in little beyond boxing, food and sex.  Carmen, who works as a waitress in Hell, is sent by her boss Davenport to get Manny into the ring again. She appears as his cousin and takes the spare room in the flat. While Lola plays the meek housewife, Carmen is flashy and lesbian.

Manny, as well as guilt over his breach with his mother, is regularly harassed by a couple of plain-clothes heavies sent by a corrupt police chief he owes money to. While the angelic Lola tries to buy time, the diabolic Carmen tells Manny that he could win the money by fighting again.  Hell is getting very full and there are serious divisions among the management. In an effort to save his position, Davenport makes a secret deal with Marina, who he admires greatly. His argument is that without Heaven there would be no Hell, and vice versa. People on Earth, he feels, should have a free choice. So in this one case he is happy to see Manny choose Heaven, which is getting dangerously empty, and tells Carmen to work with rather than against Lola.  The two women decide to rob the hypermarket and give the proceeds to Manny, who can pay off the cops with the stolen money and need never fight again. After lifting the day's takings from the cashier's office at gunpoint, they try to walk out through the crowded store, until two of the management start shooting. The women manage in the end to escape with the money, but on getting back to Manny's flat find the crooked police there with him.

He introduces himself as Gusuke, a humanoid bird who lives in "Birdopia". Doraemon, Nobita, and Shizuka help Gusuke fix his airplane, where Nobita becomes fast friends with him. As Gusuke departs to his home, Gian and Suneo catch him and grab his plane. The other three follow them through the portal.  Arriving at Birdopia, Gian and Suneo are captured by [[crow]] soldiers and brought to the [[vulture]] Commander Seagrid, who plans execution for them. Meanwhile, Doraemon, Nobita, and Shizuka find Gusuke near the [[owl]] Professor Hou's house after fleeing from the same crow soldiers with the help of an [[ostrich]] taxi service. Hou explains that Birdopia is a world existed far away from human world and is connected only during [[bird migration]], which are guarded by Bird Migration Patrolling Troops. Seagrid was once a member of the troops, but he was shot by humans and retired shortly, seeking vengeance at them. After Hou advises them to take cover as not many liked humans in Birdopia, Doraemon brings "Bird Hats" which can sprout wings by wearing them, with him as a [[pigeon]], Nobita a [[duck]], and Shizuka a [[swan]]. The three and Gusuke manage to stage a rescue of Gian and Suneo shortly thereafter, and Doraemon gives them Bird Hats of an [[albatross]] and a [[woodpecker]] respectively. Gusuke informs Nobita and his friends that there will be an annual competition, "Rally Icarus", which is used to recruit members of the Patrolling Troops, and that they should join it. During a dinner with Gusuke's parents and his friend, Milk, Gusuke confesses that he is actually adopted and that he is unable to fly naturally due to the trauma of falling he got before being founded. Meanwhile, Hou translates an ancient Birdopia tablet which contains information about Phoenicia, an ancient [[dragon]]-like being who can bring destruction to the world. The captain of the crow soldiers reports to Seagrid after overhearing it, after which Seagrid kidnaps Hou for the location of Phoenicia so he will be able to use it to destroy humanity.  During Rally Icarus which takes place at a giant tree called the Perched Tree, Gusuke manages to win but gets disqualified when Seagrid's [[falcon]] lieutenant Babylon, by Seagrid's orders, explains that he did not fly naturally. The group later realize that Hou is missing and after Doraemon learns about Phoenicia by reading the tablet using Translator Jelly, go to search for Icarus, a legendary [[eagle]] who was imprisoned in the Birdopia prison after being falsely accused of letting Seagrid shot. They manage to convince him to stop Seagrid from awakening Phoenicia, who is buried at a mountain. Along the way, they find a projector which projects a hologram of Mamoru Torino, a 23rd-century [[Ornithologist]] who is obsessed in creating a safe haven for birds, which eventually led to the creation of Birdopia, an alternate timeline of the human world. However, the group is too late to stop Seagrid as he successfully awakens Phoenicia. Doraemon attempts to de-evolve Phoenicia into an [[amoeba]] using his Transgression Beam, but he gets into a struggle with Babylon, which causes the beam to instead evolve the creature into a bigger, stronger version. The creature does not follow Seagrid's bidding and goes on a rampage in Birdopia. During the battle, Gusuke awakes his ability to fly and manages to lure Phoenicia to the top of the Perched Tree, while Doraemon and Nobita travel to the top of the tree where Mamoru's time machine is located, intending to harm Phoenicia. While it does not work, they instead transport both the machine and Phoenicia back to billions of years in the past, before the Earth is even created ([[Hadean|Pre-Hadean Era]]).  Celebrating the victory over Phoenicia, Gusuke is revealed to be Icarus's son and he is given the position of Captain of the Bird Migration Patrolling Troops. Nobita and his friends bid farewell to Gusuke before returning to their home world.

During all this, a [[opossum|possum]] (voice of [[Isaac Hayes]]) and a [[raccoon]], Joey (voice of [[Michael Rapaport]]), approach John and tell him that their boss, the Godbeaver, wants to see him. The next day, John meets the God [[beaver]] (voice of [[Richard C. Sarafian]]), who shows him that the forest is being cut down. John plans to save the forest by getting an endangered female Pacific western bear together with a male to save their species.  At a circus, John attempts to get Archie (voice of [[Steve Zahn]]), the surviving male member in his species, to go out into the forest to teach him to become a real bear. Reluctantly, he agrees but John knows that Archie doesn't know what kind of bear he is and never acts as a real animal. Then, after taking his family on a vacation to the forest for the rest of the month, John makes a deal with a female bear named Ava (voice of [[Lisa Kudrow]]) to not make any decisions for the month and promises to turn Archie into someone she will love, despite the fact that she is involved with another male bear named Sonny (voice of [[Mike Epps]]).  While he unsuccessfully trains Archie, John hires the local forest creatures to make an attempt to stop Charisse and Eric from making out. But during the training, he ignores Lisa for the next few days. Then, John tells Archie that he will find a way to win Ava's heart. John attempts to win Lisa over by dancing in their cabin, with every animal in the forest watching as John dances with Lisa, and as the two attempt to embrace, Lucky accidentally blows it. Archie attempts to get Ava's attention by singing her a song while imitating John in a smooth voice and on a tree branch, but blows his attempt when he is too heavy for the branch to hold and he falls down.  Archie refuses to come out of his new-found cave because of humiliating himself in front of Ava. Archie proclaims that it was hard but John knows how hard it is when his wife grows mad at him. Frustrated with John's insults, Archie hits John, making him fall on a muddy hole, and he begins to listen to his "inner bear". Later on, Archie spends the rest of the day with Ava, whose relationship with Sonny isn't doing very well. Meanwhile, Lucky attempts to win the affection of an attractive female wolf (throughout the film, Lucky attempts to get her attention two times but both are unsuccessful). This attempt was successful as Lucky urinates around her territory and she is about to go out with him but one of her packmates came and finds Lucky urinating part of the pack's territory and they leave, much to Lucky's dismay. At the same time, Ava is forced to leave Archie by Sonny.  Afterwards, Mr. Potter, the owner of two logging companies, attempts to make a deal with John, and when Archie arrives, he tells John he has his "big finish", knowing that he will win Ava about John telling him to listen to his "inner bear". Back at the cabin, Charisse is beginning to hate living in the forest and is annoyed with her family talking to the animals, though John doesn't know what is bothering her. Meanwhile, Archie goes after a bee hive on a fallen tree at the edge of a tall hill, and despite commands from John and attacking bees to stop what he is doing before he falls off the hill, Archie manages to get the hive, finally winning Ava's heart and the respect of all the other forest animals.  In a game of hide and seek with Ava (who dumps Sonny), Archie is shot by a tranquilizer dart fired by Mr. Potter's apprentice. John later learns that Archie had somewhat destroyed the back of a restaurant in the woods. After getting information from a weasel (voice of [[Andy Dick]]) of what happened, John visits Archie in a jail and tells the bear that he may be too dangerous to be set free and is going to be sold to a Mexican circus, thus costing John his chances of saving the forest. Then, John realizes that Charisse has developed her father's gift of talking to animals, though it has been in her for two weeks now, which reignites John's determination to save the forest. Later, John holds a meeting for every animal in the forest to not give up without a fight, and everyone agrees to do it in order to free Archie. The animals, led by Charisse, Eric, and Maya, rebel against the loggers, and every animal around the world goes on strikes in another effort to free Archie.  Mr. Potter and his apprentice are then attacked by some of the animals at the company, such as a swarm of rats, a fleet of pigeons, a pack of wolves, and Mr. Potter's apprentice is then attacked by the swarm of bees outside the building, while Mr. Potter is cornered by Ava and Joey, thus forcing Mr. Potter to start more negotiations with John and the animals. When the animals refuse Mr. Potter's new deal to have twelve acres in their home, the strike keeps growing (even animal pros, such as racing horses and jumping whales are getting on the act). Finally, a deal is made, which the Dolittles and the animals accept, thus freeing Archie from jail and saving the entire forest outside of San Francisco.  At the end, John and Charisse become closer, both talking with and helping animals together, while Archie and Ava mate and have two cubs (a boy and a girl).  
Driven (2001 film)
 Halfway through the (fictionalized) 2001 Champ Car season, rookie driver Jimmy Bly has already won 5 races. His brother/business manager Demille seems more concerned with working out endorsement deals and press engagements than racing, putting tremendous pressure upon Jimmy. His success has also drawn the ire of the reigning champion and series points leader Beau Brandenburg, who believes he's not doing as well as he should because of his fiancée Sophia becoming "a distraction". He breaks up the engagement and he regains his winning ways.  As Brandenburg returns to form, Bly's paraplegic team owner Carl Henry is concerned that Bly is making more driving errors. He sees parallels to his former driver and Champ Car Champion, Joe Tanto, whom he convinces to come out of retirement to mentor Jimmy. Joe agrees and is brought in to replace Jimmy's teammate, Memo Moreno. To complicate matters, Joe's ex-wife Cathy Heguy is now married to Memo, the driver that Joe replaced. Despite all this, Joe and Memo are still friends.  Joe's comeback race is extremely close, with Jimmy leading and Brandenburg a close second. Jimmy can't seem to pull away from him so Carl orders Joe to pit and holds him there until the leaders are about to come by, despite Joe's protests. At the last second, Joe leaves the pit just in time to block out Brandenburg, allowing Jimmy to win the race. Jimmy's brother/manager takes a dislike to Joe's mentoring, implying that Joe should just act as a blocker. After the race, Joe urges Brandenburg to reconcile with Sophia because she has started an illegal affair with Jimmy, which is causing him to further lose his form on the track, resulting in Jimmy crashing out in Japan.  At a party in Chicago, where the prototypes of next year's cars are being introduced, Brandenburg gives Sophia her ring back, apologizes for his behavior towards her, and they reconcile, much to Jimmy's disappointment. Sophia apologizes to Jimmy, but he is so angry and upset that he takes one of the new cars and races it out of the convention center. Joe hops into another of the new cars and chases him down the streets of Chicago, eventually calming Jimmy down and bringing him back to his senses after they stop driving. In the coming race in Germany, Carl decides that bringing back Joe isn't getting the results he wants, so he reinstates Jimmy's original teammate Moreno while making Joe mentor Jimmy from the pit lane.  In the next race, it's another close one with Jimmy and Brandenburg fighting it out for first. Bly needs one more win to take the championship, and Moreno is instructed to block for Jimmy, and keep out of his way. Cathy gets on the radio and convinces Memo to go for the win, and, as a result, he collides with Bly in a horrific crash that sends him flying through the air and crashing into a lake on the far end of the course. Jimmy does a quick u-turn and drives his car to the lake and dives in after him. Brandenburg does the same and the two of them rescue Memo just as a burning tree having caught fire in the crash collapses into the burning car igniting the fuel on top of the water and it explodes. This event causes Brandenburg to warm up to Jimmy, soon telling him he's a good man and that he's sorry he didn't want to win the championship this way.  Carl, angered by Jimmy's decision to stop and rescue Moreno instead of fighting on for the championship, argues with Joe who was examining what's left of Memo's car. He decides to replace Jimmy with Brandenburg for the coming season and negotiates a deal with Jimmy's brother who will now represent Brandenburg. Demille tries to get Brandenburg to sign the new contract but he rips it up and Sophia punches Demille in the face for the way he treated her previously. With Memo now hospitalized, Joe is racing again as Jimmy's teammate. Initially, Jimmy was barred from competing due to a foot injury he sustained while rescuing Memo but Carl finally decides to clear him for the race after Jimmy passes Carl's strength test.  At the final race of the year in Detroit, Jimmy and Brandenburg are contenders for the championship. In the final laps, Joe has taken the lead but by avoiding an accident, goes flying through the air, landing safely but damaging his front suspension. He can no longer contend for the win and the two leaders pass him on the final lap. It's neck and neck coming down to the finish. Jimmy is starting to have a mental lapse, but then he hears Joe's words of wisdom and in a long slow motion sequence, we see Jimmy beating Brandenburg by just a few inches as Joe crosses in third while doing doughnuts in his now out of control car due to its damaged suspension breaking. Jimmy is the new champion and he, Tanto and Brandenburg, celebrate together on the podium drinking champagne.  
Down House (film)
 The plot is set in modern [[Moscow]], probably in the second half of the 1990s, with  ''[[New Russian]]s'', [[Hummer H1]] jeeps, bribery, violence, truckfuls of tinned stew as a dowry, and so on. The film is quite far from the novel's subject, but still keeps to the main storyline. It features [[Fyodor Bondarchuk]] as Myshkin, and a soundtrack by [[DJ Groove]], one of the most popular Russian [[DJ]]s (appeared in film as taxi driver).  In Russian,  ''Даун''  (Down) primarily refers to a person with [[Down syndrome]], or, colloquially, to anyone retarded or just stupid, so it is similar to Idiot; while  ''Хаус'' (House) refers to [[House music]], which is used extensively in the film. The name is also a reference to Russian subcultures like e.g. [[business]]men, [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]] and [[hippie]]s, heavily using words borrowed from [[English language|English]] and transliterated into [[Russian alphabet]].  Cast
Down (film)
 The film takes place at the Millennium building in [[New York City]], which has 102 floors and 73 elevators.  One evening, lightning strikes the building, which causes the three main express elevators to begin acting strangely, resulting in a guard's flashlight being crushed.  The next day, a group of pregnant women are held up between floors 20 and 21.  The elevator overheats rapidly, causing two women to give birth and hospitalizing the rest. Reporter Jennifer Evans ([[Naomi Watts]]) is called to write a report on the incident. After an investigation by METEOR elevator company technicians Jeff (Eric Thal) and Mark Newman ([[James Marshall (actor)|James Marshall]]), they determine that nothing is wrong with the elevators, a large part being Jeff's inability to actually admit there is something wrong (he states throughout his scenes that the computer controlling the elevators has absolutely no defects).  A short time later, a blind man and his guide dog disappear in the building.  The two guards from the beginning of the film discover the dog's corpse hanging from its collar on a shaft support. The discovering guard's head is caught between the elevator doors. He is decapitated a short while later, his partner too horrified to help him. Once again, the METEOR executives find nothing wrong with the elevators. Evans interviews Newman, who sarcastically states "Nine people out of ten make it out of an elevator alive." Evans places this in her report, causing a large controversy over his statement by his boss, Mitchell ([[Ron Perlman]]) and the police. During the same day, a roller skater is sucked into an elevator in the parking garage and shot from the 86th floor of the building to his death. The roller skater's death is explained to media as suicide.  Evans visits Newman and shows him a tape of the roller skater's death. She points out the time it normally takes for the elevator to go up 87 floors would take about 40 seconds to a minute. However, the elevator ascended the floors in less than two seconds, thus noting that there is definitely something wrong. When they try to show the tape to Jeff, he refuses to watch it and leaves abruptly. Instead, they go to Evans' office and look up a man named Gunther Steinberg ([[Michael Ironside]]), who had been experimenting with organic reproducing computer chips using dolphin brains. However, the project had gone disastrously wrong and Steinberg was fired. Later the next morning Milligan ([[Edward Herrmann]]), who remains suspicious of the elevators throughout the film, discovers Jeff's corpse in an elevator shaft. When Jennifer and Mark arrive, they are shocked to hear that the police have concocted a story that has Jeff being a terrorist and being behind the incidents and assure the public that the threat is over. Later during the day, an elevator cab flies to top floor at such a speed that the floor flies off and all the people in it are killed. This event reaches the President and is seen as an act of terrorism.   A terrorism unit is assembled at the building to get any further terrorists out of the building.  Meanwhile, Jennifer and Mark discover a recent suicide could be linked to the incidents, as his extremely superstitious widow believes his soul has returned to punish others. Jennifer and Mark enter the building to discover and stop the threat once and for all.  During the entry, Jennifer is taken into custody posing as a METEOR executive.  During her first attempt to prove this fraud, she receives a phone call from a friend to explains that while Steinberg's time working on the chips has been revoked, Steinberg continued to work on the project except not with dolphin brains. Eventually, Mitchell abandons Steinberg for fear of his own reputation being ruined. Mark manages to get into the Millennium Building and discovers a large bio-chip in the form of a [[brain]] in an elevator shaft. It is assumed that this brain is alive and controlling the elevators. He attempts to destroy using a screwdriver, but this attempt fails when it sends a flaming elevator down to kill him. Mark barely escapes while the elevator kills a SWAT officer who was barely out of the elevator shaft before he was sliced in half from his waist down with the upper half of his body sliding across the floor. Marshall gets a hold of a stinger missile launcher and is about to destroy the organ when Steinberg intervenes, threatening him. Jennifer appears, having escaped custody and frees Marshall. As Mark tries to destroy the organ a third time, the police enter, giving Steinberg the opportunity to hold Jennifer hostage. Jennifer manages to escape thanks to Steinberg being unable to recognize one of his superiors. Steinberg is grabbed by the elevator shaft cables and pulled in, along with Mark. At the last second, Jennifer kicks the stinger launcher to Mark, who proceeds to destroy the organ. Steinberg's mutilated corpse falls seconds later.  Some time later, Mark and Jennifer leave a hospital where they find themselves trapped in an elevator.  However, it proves to be a ruse for Mark to make a romantic overture toward Jennifer. The film then cuts out to [[Aerosmith|Aerosmith's]] song "[[Love in an Elevator]]".

The next day he is wracked with a severely high fever and spends most of the day unconscious. After he recovers he discovers that he has developed increased strength.  Later that night, Stephanie is attacked and almost raped by a [[stalker]] until Quentin intervenes and kills the man, leaving before Stephanie can see him. Quentin later returns to his apartment and finds Stephanie being interviewed by Detective Frank Grillo ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) in hopes of identifying her savior. At first Quentin is thrilled that he is finally able to live his dream of becoming a superhero.

Later, Quentin is overwhelmed with an insatiable hunger but is unable to eat solid food. Arriving at a local store in an effort to find something to satisfy his hunger, he happens upon a man attempting to rape a young woman and attacks him, severely injuring the man. Expecting the woman to be grateful, he is surprised when she yells at him in anger as the man was her boyfriend. When she attempts to call the police Quentin encases her in webbing, Police Officer Williams ([[Christopher Cousins]]) arrives on the scene and attempts to free the woman but is attacked by Quentin.  The next day the police converge on the store and find the man’s body which has been sucked dry of all fluids and the woman in a state of shock.

Meanwhile, Frank’s wife Trixie ([[Theresa Russell]]) has followed her husband who she believes is hiding Officer Williams with whom she was having an affair.

Entering the apartment Quentin kidnaps Stephanie and takes her to an abandoned building nearby. Frank arrives at the building and finds Stephanie strung up in a large spider’s web.

Ek Je Aachhe Kanya
 [[File:Ek Je Aachhe Kanya1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Screenshot of Ek Je Aachhe Kanya.]] Anjan works in advertising and has              recently rented a room in a house in the suburbs of Calcutta.              Eighteen-year-old Ria, who lives there with her grand father, falls              in love with the new tenant. But Anjan already has a long-time              girlfriend Rupa, who works with him in advertising. The rejected              girl tries in vain to win Anjan’s favour. When she sees that her              efforts are futile she starts to make trouble for the couple. At              first her mischief is only minor, but it is followed by more serious              threats to Anjan’s advertising project. And when the couple              announces their engagement the girl becomes so enraged thet she              tries to kill them. A year later Ria is released from a mental              institution because the doctors believe her to be stable. Anjan and              Rupa are married and have moved away. But a new tenant has moved              into grandfather’s house… The film candidly reflects the culture              degradation of the metropolitan environment, of traditional              interpersonal relationships and points to the raising crime rate              among young people.  There have been numerous movies made on the theme of a younger woman becoming infatuated with an older man. In that sense, 'Ek Je Aachhe Konya' isn't too different. Subrata Sen does a good job of directing and writing. He did his research well and tells his story in the modern city.Rupa, Anjan and Ria are people of modern Calcutta. They are sophisticated and smart. Anjan and Rupa work together respectively as creative head and photographer for an ad agency. While young Ria happens to be the granddaughter of new tenant Anjan's landlord. From the moment Ria sets eyes on Anjan, she develops an instant attraction and a strong liking. Though Anjan is slightly aware of this, he brushes it off as harmless. However, things start to go wrong when Rupa enters her picture.Debashree Roy does a decent job as Rupa. The actress has been working for years, hence she plays her part with ease. Sabyasachi Chakrabarty is alright. Finally Konkona Sen Sharma steals the show with her portrayal of the stubborn, obsessive and unexpectedly dangerous Ria. She is simply excellent and keeps surprising with her versatility.Thanks to Sen's writing, no time is wasted on unnecessary subplots as the focus is on the three 'protagonists'. However, 'Ek Je Aachhe Konya' bears a striking resemblance to [[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush (1993)]] that starred Alicia Silverstone. The film may not be a rip-off but some people find similarities between the two movies. The songs are beautiful. For Konkona fans, 'Ek Je Aachhe Konya' is not to be missed because you'll see her in a completely different shade.

The Emperor's New Clothes (2001 film)
 In 1821, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Holm), after six years in exile on the isle of [[St. Helena]], has a plan to escape.  Switching places with lowly French deckhand Eugene Lenormand (Holm again), Napoleon will make his way to Paris, at which time Eugene will announce the switch, allowing Napoleon to reclaim his throne.  However, the plan quickly goes awry: the ship Napoleon is serving on abruptly changes its itinerary and docks in [[Belgium]] instead of [[France]].  Having to make his way to France by land (and gaining an appalling look at the [[tourist trap]] the Battlefield of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] has become), he is finally met at the French border by a loyal agent, Sgt. Bommell ([[Clive Russell]]), formerly of the [[French Imperial Guard]].  Bommell gives him the name of another agent in Paris he can trust, Lt. Truchaut.  Arriving in Paris, Napoleon is surprised to find that Truchaut has recently died.  Passing himself off as an old comrade of the Lieutenant, Napoleon accepts the hospitality of Truchaut's widow, Nicole, whom everyone calls "Pumpkin" (Hjejle), and makes the acquaintance of her other lodger, Dr. Lambert (McInnerny) and her adopted young son, Gerard.  The crucial flaw in the plan reveals itself when, back on St. Helena, Eugene decides he likes living in the relative luxury of Napoleon's exile, and refuses to reveal the switch.  Napoleon's French entourage find themselves unexpectedly powerless, as Eugene stuffs his face with sweets, dictates his own bawdy version of Napoleon's official memoirs, and even manages to convince his British captors that he is the true Napoleon.  With no news from St. Helena, Napoleon is drawn into Pumpkin's life.  When her fruit-selling business is on the brink of failure, he applies his own talents for planning and organization, and the business becomes prosperous again.  As affection develops between Napoleon and Pumpkin, Dr. Lambert, who had designs on Pumpkin himself, jealously searches for some kind of dirt on "Eugene."  Going through his bedroom, Lambert is shocked to find a small [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] portrait of Napoleon's [[Napoleon II|young son]], and realizes who "Eugene" really is.  On St. Helena, Eugene abruptly drops dead of some kind of stomach complaint (in real-life, Napoleon reportedly died of gastric cancer).  Quickly realizing that the dead man on the island is not Napoleon, the British garrison commander lays out their options: either they announce the fraud, and commit themselves to heinous punishment, or else they maintain that "what we have here is a dead emperor" and so everything is well.  When "Napoleon's" death is announced throughout France, the real Napoleon abruptly remembers his original plan and announces to Pumpkin that it is time for him to take his rightful place on the French throne.  To his fury, Pumpkin is horrified and dismisses him as a delusional lunatic, pleading with him that she loves Eugene, and hates Napoleon.  With no loyalist agent in Paris to vouch for his identity, Napoleon finds himself an Emperor without an army, or a friend.  He is reduced to going to Dr. Lambert, who he realizes stole the portrait, and demanding it back.  When he demands to be told "who I am," Lambert retorts, "I will show you."  In revenge for being beaten to Pumpkin's affections, Lambert lures Napoleon onto the grounds of a [[sanitorium]], where it seems every patient is dressed up as Napoleon, and pretending to be him.  Lambert withdraws, expecting the real Napoleon to be rounded up by the attendants, but a shaken Napoleon escapes the grounds by climbing over the wall, suffering a nasty cut on his hand from the [[chevaux de frise]] on top.  Lambert drops the cameo down a sewer grate.  Emotionally and physically exhausted, Napoleon returns home to Pumpkin's house.  She lovingly tends his wounds, and whispers in his ear, "you are my Napoleon."  While Gerard is looking at a pictorial account of Napoleon's life on a [[magic lantern]], Napoleon tells him the story of what really happened.  It seems that Gerard, if no one else, believes Napoleon's story.  Deciding that he is happiest living a simple life with Pumpkin, Napoleon destroys all his mementos of his former life, except his old [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] uniform, which he leaves at the local military post as a gift for Sgt. Bommell, with a message that "Eugene Lenormand has moved on."  An after-note states that Napoleon Bonaparte lived out the rest of his life in Paris and was buried next to Pumpkin; while Eugene Lenormand's body was brought back to Paris and interred with high honors in [[Les Invalides]].  
Ellie Parker

Helping make sense of their surreal and humiliating Hollywood existence is her best friend Sam ([[Rebecca Rigg]]), another out-of-work actress trying her hand at design, who attends acting classes with Ellie to stay sharp. When Ellie gets into a fender bender with a guy who claims he is a cinematographer ([[Scott Coffey]]), her perspective on her work and the dating world starts to change. [[Chevy Chase]] also makes an appearance playing Ellie's agent.

Enemy at the Gates
 In 1942, following the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] the year before, [[Vasily Zaytsev]] ([[Jude Law]]), a shepherd from the [[Ural Mountains]] who is now a soldier in the [[Red Army]], finds himself on the front lines of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Forced into a suicidal charge by [[barrier troops]] against the invading Germans, he uses impressive marksmanship skills—taught to him at a young age by his grandfather—to save himself and [[political commissar|commissar]] Danilov ([[Joseph Fiennes]]).  [[Nikita Khrushchev]] ([[Bob Hoskins]]) arrives in Stalingrad to coordinate the city's defences and demands ideas to improve morale. Danilov, now a senior lieutenant, suggests that the people need figures to idolise and give them hope, and publishes tales of Vasily's exploits in the army's newspaper that paint him as a national hero and propaganda icon. Vasily is transferred to the [[sniper]] division, and he and Danilov become friends. They also both become romantically interested in [[Tania Chernova]] ([[Rachel Weisz]]), a citizen of Stalingrad who has become a private in the local militia. In fear for her safety, Danilov has her transferred to an intelligence unit away from the battlefield, ostensibly to make use of her German language skills in translating radio intercepts.  With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major [[Erwin König]] ([[Ed Harris]]) is deployed to Stalingrad to kill Vasily and thus crush Soviet morale. A renowned marksman and head of the German Army sniper school at [[Zossen]], he lures Vasily into a trap and kills two of his fellow snipers, but Vasily manages to escape. When the Red Army command learns of König's mission, they dispatch König's former student Koulikov ([[Ron Perlman]]) to help Vasily kill him. König, however, outmaneuvers Koulikov and kills him with a very skillful shot, shaking Vasily's spirits considerably. Khrushchev pressures Danilov to bring the sniper standoff to a conclusion.  Sasha, a young Soviet boy, volunteers to act as a [[double agent]] by passing König false information about Vasily's whereabouts, thus giving Vasily a chance to ambush the major. Vasily sets a trap for König and manages to wound him, but during a second attempt Vasily falls asleep after many sleepless hours and his sniper log is stolen by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vasily's death and plans to send König home, but König does not believe Vasily is dead. The commanding German general takes König's dog tags to prevent Russian propaganda from profiting if König is killed. König also gives the general a [[War Merit Cross]] that was posthumously awarded to König's son, who as a lieutenant in the 116th infantry division was killed in the early days of the Battle for Stalingrad. König tells Sasha where König will be next, suspecting that the boy will tell Vasily. Tania and Vasily have meanwhile fallen in love and have sex in the Russian barracks at night. The jealous Danilov disparages Vasily in a letter to his superiors.  König spots Tania and Vasily waiting for him at his next ambush spot, confirming his suspicions about Sasha. He then kills the boy and hangs his body off a pole to bait Vasily. Vasily vows to kill König, and sends Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sasha's mother ([[Eva Mattes]]) from the city, but Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the evacuation boats. Thinking she is dead, Danilov regrets his jealousy of Vasily and expresses disenchantment over his previous ardency for the Communist cause. Finding Vasily waiting to ambush König, Danilov intentionally exposes himself in order to provoke König into shooting him and revealing his hidden position. Thinking that he has killed Vasily, König goes to inspect the body, but realizes too late that he has fallen into a trap and is in Vasily's sights. Accepting his fate, König removes his hat and turns to face Vasily, who shoots him squarely in the forehead. Two months later, after Stalingrad has been liberated and the German forces have surrendered, Vasily finds Tania recovering in a [[field hospital]].  
Enigma (2001 film)
 The story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the [[Second World War]] was at its height. The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], have a problem: the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[U-boat]]s have changed one of their code reference books used for [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval [[signals intelligence]]. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)|"Shark" cipher]] once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.  The film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.  Mr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an [[MI5]] agent, Wigram ([[Jeremy Northam]]), who plays [[cat and mouse]] with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.  But someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts, and may be responsible for Claire's disappearance.

Epoch (film)
 Four billion years ago, before life had developed on Earth, a cosmic object fell in the seas of our planet. In modern times in the mountains of [[Bhutan]], a huge artifact makes its way to the surface, producing a powerful [[electromagnetic pulse]] causing worldwide blackouts.  Alarmed by the electromagnetic phenomenon and under request of the government of Bhutan, the American [[NSA]] launches a military and scientific reconnaissance operation on site, led by Dr. K.C. Czaban ([[Stephanie Niznik]]) with the technical assistance of terminally ill engineer Mason Rand ([[David Keith]]), picked up on the Mexican border in time for the mission. The team finds the artifact suspended in the air and object of veneration from the natives, who call it the Torus and consider it a gift from the gods with extraordinary healing properties.  The US team enters the Torus, but an air strike by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Army]] against the artifact prompts an unexpected response from the object, which destroys two Chinese military planes and kidnaps a US soldier. Unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations escalate the  tension in the area between Chinese and US armed forces, while inside the Torus the scientific team goes to the core of the huge machine. They discover how ancient the artifact is and speculate it could have been the spark of life on Earth, as well as the cause of multiple extinctions in the course of the eras. Fomented by NSA agent Allen Lysander ([[Ryan O'Neal]]), conflict explodes between the troops of the two factions and the Torus reacts, blanketing the planet with a thick cloud cover, evidently starting the process for a new mass extinction.  By Presidential order, the US soldiers plant a nuclear bomb inside the Torus to destroy it, and Czaban and Rand unsuccessfully try to deactivate the device to keep it from detonating. However, the Torus absorbs the blast and, seemingly satisfied by the extreme sacrifice attempted by the two scientists, ceases its actions, sheds its external shell and, in the form of an energy sphere, leaves Earth. Four months later, Rand, now cured after his exposure to Torus, receives from Czaban the news that she is pregnant, despite being sterile before their encounter with the alien artifact.

Exit Wounds
  [[Detroit Police Department]]'s Detective Orin Boyd ([[Steven Seagal]]) is a cop in Detroit's 21st precinct, who saves the Vice President of the United States ([[Christopher Lawford]]) from a [[right-wing]] Michigan militant group trying to kill him. As Boyd saved the Vice President's life by disobeying orders and killing all the militants, Captain Frank Daniels ([[Bruce McGill]]), who is also a long-time friend of Boyd, is forced to fire Boyd, but still tells him to talk with police chief Hinges ([[Bill Duke]]) who dislikes Boyd (because Boyd gives the police a bad name by disobeying orders) and has repeatedly tried to fire him, only for Boyd to be returned to duty by his friends in the trade union. Despite Boyd once again being returned to duty, Hinges transfers Boyd to the 15th precinct — Detroit's arguably worst police precinct.  Boyd's new captain, former [[internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] officer Annette Mulcahy ([[Jill Hennessy]]), knows of his reputation, and she tells him that she will not tolerate it. Annette sends Boyd to an anger management class, where he meets Henry Wayne ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]), the high-strung host of a local talk show called ''Detroit AM''. While driving, Boyd comes across local drug dealer Latrell Walker (Earl "[[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]" Simmons) and his fast-talking sidekick T.K. Johnson ([[Anthony Anderson]]) doing a shady deal with a man named Matt Montini ([[David Vadim]]). After a brief fight, Walker and Johnson escape, while Boyd arrests Montini and discovers to his surprise that Montini is a cop who has been working undercover trying to nail Walker and Boyd. The incident has ruined the sting, which does not sit well with Montini's musclebound partner Useldinger ([[Matthew G. Taylor]]).  Sergeant Lewis Strutt ([[Michael Jai White]]) — one of the most decent and respected cops from the precinct — steps in to cool things down when Boyd gets in a fight with Useldinger. After Boyd stumbles upon the theft of $5,000,000 worth of heroin from evidence storage, Boyd and his new partner George Clark ([[Isaiah Washington]]) begin focusing their efforts on Walker and T.K. Intrigued by what little they have on Walker, they investigate why he has been visiting Shaun Rollins (Mel Jason "[[Drag-On]]" Smalls). Henry discovers that Walker is not a drug dealer; instead he is a computer expert and billionaire whose real name is Leon Rollins — he is Shaun Rollins' brother.  While driving, Boyd is suddenly hit by a van and is captured by Montini, Useldinger and fellow cop/accomplice Fitz ([[Shane Daly]]). While they are driving, Montini takes out a syringe, filled with lethal poison and tries to kill Boyd. Boyd, however struggles with Montini and causes him to inject the poison in the van driver's neck, killing him. After Boyd beats up Montini and Useldinger, Fitz tries to shoot Boyd, however Boyd kicks Fitz to the edge of the van, causing him to get crushed by another car, killing him as well. Montini and Usedinger manage to jump out of the van and Boyd himself manages to escape as well before the van crashes.  Angered because of the attempt on his life, Boyd confronts Leon, who explains that a group of corrupt cops needed a [[fall guy]] for a deal gone bad and pinned it on Shaun. It is further revealed that Strutt himself is the leader of the group, which includes Montini, Useldinger and formerly Fitz. Leon and his friend Trish ([[Eva Mendes]]) have been videotaping the activities of Strutt's gang, hoping that it might help prove Shaun's innocence and get him out of jail.  Boyd meets Mulcahy at a parking lot to inform her what he has uncovered. However, Montini, Useldinger, and some other corrupt cops who were sent by Strutt try to kill Boyd and Annette. Mulcahy is killed in the chase and Boyd escapes. Boyd calls Frank and tells him that Strutt, Montini and Useldinger will be having a meeting at a warehouse, in about an hour, to sell the stolen heroin. Strutt plans to sell it to Leon and T. K., not knowing that Leon is working against him. Frank promises that he will be there with some backup.  Boyd and Daniels show up, however with no backup as Frank did not know who to trust. They enter the warehouse just in time as the deal goes sour because of Leon bringing only half of the money as insurance and Strutt revealing that he knows about Leon's true identity. Although Boyd and Frank confront the group, Strutt isn't moved and calmly tells Frank to keep Boyd under control and Boyd realizes that it is Frank who is behind everything. Frank reveals that the reason he became corrupt was because he felt that his annual 40,000 dollar salary wasn't enough because he risked his life everyday and he is about to shoot Boyd (to prove to a taunting Strutt that the entire operation is his) when Clark blows open the door and barges in with backup, including some non-corrupt cops and Hinges and a shootout ensues.  During the gunfight, Boyd is shot in the back (but survives due to wearing a bulletproof vest) by Useldinger, who is about to finish off Boyd, but George comes just in the nick of time and guns him down. Frank unsuccessfully tries to escape and Hinges shoots him four times with a shotgun. After taking out most of the corrupt cops, Boyd decides to go after Strutt, while Leon decides to go after Montini. However, Boyd reaches Strutt and the two fight with cloth guillotines, after which Strutt grabs Leon's case full of money and runs up to the roof, where a helicopter is waiting for him. As the helicopter is taking off with Strutt hanging on to the ladder, Boyd manages to hook the bottom of it onto a metal pipe protruding from the roof. This causes the ladder to break and Strutt to fall from the helicopter, who lands upon another metal pipe that impales Strutt and kills him. Leon finds Montini and the two start a brutal fight. Montini gets the upper hand in his fight with Leon, after he damages Leon's vision with clothing dye powder. However, Leon eventually wins the fight after he stabs Montini in the leg with a knife and kills him by stabbing him in the neck with a spike on a weight rack.  At dawn, Leon gives Hinges the videotape that proves the corruption, hoping that the tape will help prove Shaun's innocence. Hinges thinks that the courts will not care about the tape, so Hinges had Shaun released from county about an hour before. Boyd decides to stay with the 15th precinct with George as his partner, and T. K. becomes Henry's television co-host.  
Evolution (2001 film)
 Wayne Grey ([[Seann William Scott]]), a trainee firefighter practicing in a shack in the desert near [[Glen Canyon]], [[Arizona]], sees a [[meteor]] strike his car and land in an underground [[cavern]]. College professor Ira Kane ([[David Duchovny]]) and his colleague, [[geology]] Professor Harry Block ([[Orlando Jones]]), investigate, taking a sample of strange blue liquid that oozes from it. Ira discovers that it harbors [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] single-celled [[nitrogen]]-based organisms multiplying exponentially, condensing millions of years of [[evolution]] within a matter of hours. The next day, they take the science class to survey the meteor site and find it already surrounded by evolved oxygen-converting [[fungi]] and alien [[flatworms]]. Ira and Harry discover that the cells and organisms reproduce rapidly through [[mitosis]] after seeing one of the flatworms they collected in a jar split into two.  Soon, the site is sealed off by the Army, who set up a base. Ira and Harry take General Russell Woodman ([[Ted Levine]]) and the clumsy Dr. Allison Reed ([[Julianne Moore]]) to court for the right to be part of the research of their discovery, but their efforts fail when it's revealed Ira was discharged from the army after creating an [[anthrax]] vaccine that led to terribly debilitating side effects, which the soldiers dubbed "The Kane Madness". Woodman steals Ira and Harry's research, forcing them to infiltrate the base to get another sample; they find an alien rainforest teeming with life. They are caught by Allison as a mosquito-like alien gets inside Harry's body; they are forced to rectally remove the mosquito, which then dies.  Wayne arrives at the college and shows the two the dead body of an amphibian alien which killed a country club owner, much to his delight; they later investigate an animal attack, finding a dead dog-like alien in a woman's home and more dead flatworms. They find a valley behind the home filled with dead flying [[dinosaur|dinosaur-like]] aliens; Ira and Harry theorize the aliens are spreading through the caves connected to the main cavern, but can't breathe oxygen. One of the dying creatures spits out a pod containing a newborn, which then hatches into an oxygen-tolerant alien. The alien attacks a mall, where it carries off a shoplifter until Ira, Harry, and Wayne shoot it down.  [[File:Simple Periodic Table Chart-en.svg|thumb|The positions of carbon and nitrogen relative to arsenic and selenium in the [[periodic table]] is consulted in the story.]] Unfortunately, other alien encounters have made the news; this forces the [[Governor of Arizona]] ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) to demand answers. Allison explains the aliens will engulf the United States in two months. Woodman attempts to blame Ira, when he, Harry and Wayne arrive. However, the governor demands a solution; Woodman suggests evacuating the area and burn the aliens with [[napalm]]. At that moment, [[primate]]-like aliens attack them, but are fought off. The shaken governor approves Woodman's plan against protests from Ira and Allison that they don't know how the aliens will react. Allison quits the [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] and leaves the site, procuring Ira's original research and samples for him.  At the college, Harry accidentally tosses a match into a petri dish of alien liquid, causing a mass of flesh to rapidly grow from it. Ira realizes heat causes the aliens to evolve, and the meteor crashing to earth activated the alien DNA. Allison attempts to warn Woodman that napalm will only make the aliens stronger, but he ignores her call. Looking at the positions of nitrogen and carbon on the [[periodic table]], Ira theorizes [[selenium]] might be poisonous to the aliens, since they are [[nitrogen]]-based, as [[arsenic]] is poisonous to Earth's carbon life. Much to Ira's surprise, his dumbest students Deke and Danny ([[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Michael Ray Bower]]) recall [[selenium disulfide|selenium sulfide]] is the active ingredient in [[Head & Shoulders]]. This makes Ira award the Donald brothers with an A, much to their excitement. So Wayne procures a firetruck and the team fills it with the shampoo, with help from the Donald Brothers, who tag along with them.   Just as the team arrives at the cave and prepare to fire the shampoo, Woodman's napalm strike causes a similar reaction to the earlier petri dish incident, except on a much larger scale, producing an enormous [[amoeba]]-like creature that emerges to the surface. As it prepares to divide, the team drives under the organism, finds what looks like its [[rectal]] hole, and Harry (intending to settle a score for the insect incident) pumps a firehose of shampoo into the beast, causing it to explode. Governor Lewis declares Ira, Harry, Wayne and Allison heroes, making Wayne a fully credentialed [[firefighter]] while Ira and Allison skip the festivities for romance in the fire truck. Woodman is also demoted to sergeant for his blunder. Later, Harry, Ira and Wayne are shown chasing the flying alien from earlier and promoting Head & Shoulders for both hair care and fighting aliens.  
Das Experiment
 While reading a newspaper advertisement, taxi driver Tarek Fahd discovers an invitation to participate in an experiment, in which 4000 [[Deutsche Mark|German mark]]s are offered to the participants of the experiment, in which a prison situation is simulated. The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in.  Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. Tarek has a car accident shortly before the experiment, after which he meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists.  In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightsticks]], but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoner’s name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's [[lactose intolerance]], or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and Schütte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him.  The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners' side, this is Tarek, and on the guards’ side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a sadist, whose motto during the experiment is: "Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles." From that moment on, the guards start to use more and more violence against the prisoners. The scientists engage in a discussion whether or not to abort the experiment. Dr. Grimm suggests to put an end to the alarming situation, but Professor Thon refuses to stop the experiment until the violence has reached a maximum.  Dora meanwhile returns to Tarek's apartment and discovers his participation contract for the experiment. She surprises him by showing up for a visit day. Tarek, who was forced to clean the toilet with his own clothes, pleads to the friendly guard Walther Bosch to secretly bring her a message. Berus intercepts Bosch, however, and tells Dora that everything is all right and refuses to let Tarek to see Dora.  The situation becomes critical and more violence is involved. The prisoners are being abused and their self-esteem is drastically decreased by the guards' power. Most of the violence is directed against Tarek and they lock him up in solitary confinement inside a "black box" resembling a safe. Schütte, protesting this, is beaten severely, bound and gagged with duct tape and forced to sit on a chair. Later he suffocates to death due to his bloody nose drying up in addition to the duct tape on his mouth.  Bosch is beaten by the other guards for his "betrayal" and is put into confinement. Lars, a member of Thon's team, notices this and attempts to contact Professor Thon, who is attending a conference. The guards, who are aware that the professor cannot be reached by phone, are convinced by Berus that the entire situation is a test put up by Thon's team, in order to make the guards handle an exceptional situation. They take over control of the facility and capture Lars, Dr. Grimm and the other scientists, who are put into confinement as well, and gradually start their own prison in which they engage in brutally sadistic games with the total control.  Dora comes to the facility a second time to speak to Tarek and is lured into a room by Berus, where he locks her up. The guard Eckert attempts to rape Dr. Grimm. He is stopped by Tarek, who escaped from solitary confinement through the use of a screwdriver he found inside the "black box." Tarek knocks down Eckert and frees Lars, Bosch, Steinhoff, Dr. Grimm and the other prisoners. They manage to escape by removing the wall paneling of one of the cells with the screwdriver. Meanwhile, Professor Thon hears Lars' desperate message in his voicemail and leaves for the facility.  Meanwhile, Steinhoff and Tarek stay behind in order to prevent Berus from coming after them. Professor Thon reaches the facility and demands an explanation from Eckert, who accidentally injures him with a pistol. The fleeing prisoners are ambushed by the guards and trapped. Bosch, who could not keep up with the others, loses his sanity and kills Eckert with a fire extinguisher. Dora then escapes from the room she was locked up in, and steals Eckert's gun. She injures one of the guards while he is engaged in fighting Tarek and Steinhoff, leaving only Berus to fight them. Tarek incapacitates Berus, who is nearly choked to death by Steinhoff until Tarek convinces him not to kill Berus.  The film ends with a news break, confirming two deaths (Schütte and Eckert) and three severely injured (Thon, Berus, and Bosch). Both Berus and Thon will be put on trial, Berus for multiple homicides and torture with rape, and Thon for allowing an illegal and unethical experiment.  
Extreme Days
 "Road trip!"  Four childhood friends, Will, Brian, Corey, and Matt, have been saying that since they were kids their dream is to surf, skate, and snowboard across California. After graduating from junior college, it is now their time and nothing can stop them &mdash; except money &mdash; so they decide to put their education to work. Through their jobs of life-guarding kiddie pools and working at Turkish restaurants they manage to save $847.53, more than enough to cross California in their Joyota, a reconstructed jeep with a rebuilt Toyota engine. Never having so much freedom in their lives, they decide to go to Mexico where they surf the fierce and unpredictable waves of Larosarita. Unexpectedly, Corey receives a phone call and is told of the death of his grandfather, "Grandpa G."  His stepdad Frank tells him that his grandpa left him a bunch of money and his car, so Corey has to travel up to Yakima, Washington to get it. The friends, all being very close to Grandpa G., decide they will all go, counting on the fact that once they get there, they'll have more than enough money to get back.  While "taking care of some unfinished business", the group runs into Matt's beautiful cousin Jessie, who needs a ride up to Seattle because her car has broken down. Brian is immediately infatuated with her. But, not wanting to make things easy for him, Jessie avoids Brian, making him all the more determined to get to her. Corey then makes a bet with Brian that by the end of the trip, he will not be able to get Jessie to do one thing he wants her to do.  As the trip continues, through a series of paintball fights and late night phone calls, Jessie and Brian get closer and closer. Having been hurt in the past, Jessie has a hard time trusting Brian and his intentions toward her. She knew all along about the bet, but because of her convictions and some harsh words on Brian's part, she decides she has to leave, however much it would hurt.  Cold, wet, and heartbroken, the boys cross the Washington border and arrive at the home of Grandma G, only to have yet another disappointment. Corey's stepdad turns out to be a nightmare, as the only inheritance Corey was left with was a junked-out car. With no way of getting home, the only option they have is to sell the car and hope they get enough money for the trip home.  While looking through a paper and eating some of Grandpa G's snake meat, Matt comes across five tickets to Alaska for $500.  With the help of Grandma G, they sell the car left by Grandpa G online for $1,500. Only one thing can make this a good ending: having Jessie back.  Brian knows he messed up with Jessie and is truly sorry for what he's done. In a last attempt to get her back, Brian and the guys head to the [[University of Washington]] where she is giving a freshman orientation. Brian apologizes for what he did, telling Jessie that he's never known anyone like her &mdash; she woke him up. He asks her to come with them, but she tearfully says that she can't just get up and go. Matt gives her her plane ticket before the four friends leave. With hope, Brian waits at the airport for Jessie, but she does not come. As he sits in his seat, his phone starts ringing; it is Jessie, who is sitting in the back of the plane.  
Everybody Says I'm Fine!
 The film revolves around a small group of elite Mumbaikars whose lives converge at a hairdresser's salon. The protagonist Xen ([[Rehaan Engineer]]) owns the salon and has a unique gift of connecting with the minds of his clients and reading their thoughts while at work. Most of his customers maintain a facade of normality in order to gain semblance and hide their tumultuous lives to some extent.  As backdrop to Xen's ability, it is revealed that as a young boy, he witnessed the death of his parents in a freak accident at a recording studio, where nobody could hear his cries for help through the sound-proof booth as he saw the flames rising. Ever since, Xen's life  plunged into some sort of forced silence. Xen uses his gift to help most of his clients, notably Tanya ([[Pooja Bhatt]]), whose private life is being indecently probed into by another one of his customers, Misha ([[Anahita Oberoi]]). Xen manages to get the dirt on Misha, who is a secret cocaine addict, and more unsavory details surface where it comes to knowledge that Misha has even gotten some children at the orphanage she works at addicted to it. Xen slips the information to Tanya without her knowledge, who then confronts Misha with it when Misha becomes a little too inquisitive in Tanya's personal affairs.  Xen is however, clueless in his own silence, and to add to it, he is unable to probe into the mind of one of his customers, Nikki/Nikita ([[Koel Purie]]) who arrives in his saloon one day and asks him to cut off all her long hair. He begins to develop feelings for her, sensing some form of distress in her being, unable to reach her but somehow wanting to help.  Later, as Xen serves one of his regulars, a respectable businessman, Mr. Mittal ([[Boman Irani]]), it transpires that the married Mr. Mittal is busy planning a liaison with another woman. More facts slowly unfold to reveal Mr Mittal is, in fact, Nikki's father, and Nikki has been subjected to an incestuous relationship. Enraged, on gradually learning the truth straight from the thoughts of his client, Xen strikes a heavy blow to Mr. Mittal's head, killing him, and later disposing of the body.  The death of her father triggers in Nikki a sudden response, and she crumbles to the ground in Xen's arms. He is now engulfed in  her disconcerting train of thoughts, disjointed, and echoing her torment of many years. The final scene of the film shows Xen waking the next morning to find the silence in his life is now beyond him, and he can hear, as clearly and wholly as the next human being. Nikki embraces him; the mutual catharsis has made them both more wholesome beings.

The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)
  On the docks outside [[Los Angeles]], a truck is loaded with electronics and a dockside worker notifies an anonymous person about the shipment. On the road, the truck is approached by three modified [[Honda Civic]]s with green underglow. The perpetrators then proceed to harpoon & board the truck, knock out the driver, and corral the semi allowing them to heist the electronics and escape into the night.  The next day, undercover [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer [[Brian O'Conner]] is assigned to find the gang responsible for the crimes. While visiting Toretto's Market, he flirts with the shop's owner Mia Torreto, the sister of notorious street racer [[Dominic Toretto]]. Dominic's team, which consists of his friends Vince, Leon, Jesse, and his girlfriend Letty, arrive. Vince, who has a crush on Mia, starts a fight with Brian, which Dominic is forced to break up.  Later that night during a street racing gathering, Brian arrives in his modified [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], and Dominic arrives in his [[Mazda RX-7]]. Dominic organizes a drag race with himself, Brian, and two other drivers. Brian, out of cash, wagers the pink slip for his car. During the race, Brian damages the intake manifold on his engine, handing the victory to Dominic, who mocks Brian in front of the crowd. But as Brian prepares to give Dominic the keys to his car, the LAPD arrives, forcing everyone to flee. Dominic parks his car in a garage to limit suspicions by walking home, but is immediately spotted by a police cruiser. Brian arrives and saves him from the cops. The duo unknowingly venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader Johnny Tran and his cousin, Lance Nguyen. After confronting Brian and Dominic, Tran and Lance destroy Brian's car. Afterwards, Dominic reminds Brian that he owes him a car as a price for losing the race.  Brian goes to Dominic's garage, where he brings a totaled [[Toyota Supra]] as a replacement for the Eclipse. As Dominic and his crew begin the process of repairing the car, Brian begins dating Mia, much to Vince's dismay. Brian investigates Tran, convinced that Tran is responsible for the truck hijackings. One night during an investigation of a garage seemingly connected to Tran, he is cornered by Vince and Dominic, who demand an explanation. Brian lies about checking the cars of his rivals for the upcoming [[Race Wars (The Fast and the Furious)|Race Wars]], a street racing event in the desert. Brian, Vince, and Dominic then check out Tran's garage, and while there, Brian notices a large shipment of electronics in the garage.  Brian reports the batch of electronics to his superiors at the LAPD and FBI, and they arrest Tran and Lance. The raid turns out to be a bust, however, as it turns out the electronics had been bought legally, thus leading to the duo’s release. Despite his own doubts, Brian is now forced to assume that Dominic is the actual coordinator of the truck heists. Brian's superiors then give him just 36 hours to find the perpetrators, as the truckers are now arming themselves to defend against hijackings.  The next day, with the Supra restored, Dominic invites Brian to Race Wars, and he tells them that they will talk after Brian has proven himself. At the Race Wars, Jesse wagers his father's [[Volkswagen Jetta]] to Tran, but flees with the car after he loses. Tran confronts Dominic to claim the car, and then mocks him, accusing him of reporting him to the police. This leads to Dominic beating up Tran. Later that night, Brian notices the crew leaving, and realizes that Dominic is indeed the hijacker that he's been assigned to find. He then reveals his true identity to Mia, who is infuriated with him, but Brian compels her to reveal the location of the vehicles and aid him in his plans.  Meanwhile, Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon prepare to hijack a semi-trailer truck, which is also to be their last heist. However, this time, the truck driver is armed, Vince is trapped on the side of the truck and is shot by the truck driver, while Letty is run off the road by the truck driver causing her vehicle to rollover. Brian soon arrives with Mia, who commandeers the Supra while Brian rescues Vince. When Dominic arrives, Brian is forced to blow his cover and call for a [[medical evacuation]] to rescue Vince. Dominic leaves with Mia and the rest of the crew after Vince is saved.  Brian arrives at Dominic's house in L.A. just in time to see him pull his father's 1970 [[Dodge Charger R/T]] out of the garage. Brian confronts Dominic regarding Jesse's whereabouts, saying that he'll get the cops to find him before Tran does. At the same time, Jesse arrives, apologizing for his actions, and pleads for protection against Tran and Lance. He is then killed in a [[drive-by shooting]] by Tran and Lance on dirt bikes. Dominic and Brian pursue them, with Dominic ramming Lance's bike off the road before he can shoot Brian. Brian then shoots Tran, who crashes into a curb, killing him. As Brian checks on Tran, he sees Dominic, and orders passersby to call the police. Brian proceeds to follow Dominic, culminating in a quarter-mile drag race. The race ends as they barely manage to cross a railroad crossing before a train passes by, but Dominic violently crashes into a semi-truck. Instead of arresting Dominic, Brian gives him the keys to his own car, telling him he still owes him a ten-second car; Dominic is then able to escape the police. Brian then walks away from the scene, now a fugitive from the law.  In the post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving through [[Baja California]], Mexico, in a 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS.

Bored of staying in their vacation home, the two walk into town while discussing relationships and their virginity. Although the highly attractive Elena has been promiscuous, she is saving herself for someone who loves her, while heavy-set, overweight Anaïs thinks it is better to lose one's virginity to a "nobody" just to get it over with.  They meet an Italian law student, Fernando ([[Libero De Rienzo]]), at a cafe. While Elena flirts with him, Anaïs orders a [[banana split]]. Later, Fernando sneaks into the girls' bedroom for a [[affair|liaison]] with Elena. Anaïs is awake and watches their entire interaction.

In the morning, Fernando asks for [[oral sex]] from Elena before he leaves, but Anaïs has had enough and tells them to let her sleep in peace. The next day, the girls and Fernando go to the beach. Anaïs sits in the ocean in her new dress and sings to herself while Elena and Fernando go off alone together. Later, as the girls are reminiscing about their childhood together back at the house, Elena reveals that Fernando has given her a mauve opal engagement ring while at the beach. That night, Elena gives up her virginity to Fernando as Anaïs silently cries on the other side of the room.  Later, Fernando's mother arrives at the house that Anaïs and her family are renting, asking for the girl's mother to return the mauve opal ring.  Their mother discovers Elena's and Fernando's relationship, and angrily decides to drive back to Paris.  On the way back she becomes tired and decides to sleep at a rest stop, where an axe murderer arrives, killing Elena with an axe and strangling her mother.

Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
 In 2065, Earth is infested by alien life forms known as Phantoms. By physical contact Phantoms consume the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia spirit]] of living beings, killing them instantly, though a minor contact may only result in an infection. The surviving humans live in "barrier cities", areas protected by an energy shield that prevents Phantoms from entering, and are engaged in an ongoing struggle to free the planet. After being infected by a Phantom during one of her experiments, Aki Ross ([[Ming-Na]]) and her mentor, Doctor Sid ([[Donald Sutherland]]), uncover a means of defeating the Phantoms by gathering eight spirit signatures that, when joined, can negate the Phantoms. Aki is searching for the sixth spirit in the ruins of New York City when she is cornered by Phantoms but is rescued by Gray Edwards ([[Alec Baldwin]]) and his squad "Deep Eyes", consisting of Ryan Whittaker ([[Ving Rhames]]), Neil Fleming ([[Steve Buscemi]]) and Jane Proudfoot ([[Peri Gilpin]]). It is revealed that Gray was once romantically involved with Aki.  Upon returning to her barrier city, Aki joins Sid and appears before the leadership council along with General Hein ([[James Woods]]), who is determined to use the powerful Zeus space cannon to destroy the Phantoms. Aki is concerned the cannon will damage Earth's Gaia (a spirit representing its ecosystem) and delays the use of it by revealing that she has been infected and the collected spirit signatures are keeping her infection stable, convincing the council that there may be another way to defeat the Phantoms. However, this revelation leads Hein to incorrectly conclude that she is being controlled by the Phantoms. Aki and the Deep Eyes squad succeed in finding the seventh spirit as Aki's infection begins to worsen and she slips into unconsciousness. Her dream reveals to her that the Phantoms are the spirits of dead aliens brought to Earth on a fragment of their destroyed planet. Sid uses the seventh spirit to bring Aki's infection back under control, reviving her.  To scare the council into giving him clearance to fire the Zeus cannon, Hein lowers part of the barrier shield protecting the city. Though Hein intended that only a few Phantoms enter, his plan goes awry and legions of Phantoms invade the entire city. Aki, Sid and the Deep Eyes attempt to reach Aki's spaceship, their means of escape, but Ryan, Neil and Jane are killed by Phantoms. Hein escapes and boards the Zeus space-station where he finally receives authorisation to fire the cannon.  Sid finds the eighth spirit at the crater site of the alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a shielded vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of the Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.

Fly Away Home
 After her mother Aliane dies in a car accident, 13-year-old Amy Alden ([[Anna Paquin]]) is brought from [[New Zealand]] to [[Ontario]], Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden ([[Jeff Daniels]]), a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan ([[Dana Delany]]).  When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of [[Canada geese|goose]] eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David ([[Terry Kinney]]) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father’s old barn to [[Avian incubation|incubate]]. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert ([[Jeremy Ratchford]]) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all [[domesticated animals|domestic]] geese must have their wings [[pinioning|pinioned]] (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.  Thomas decides to use an [[ultralight]] aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry ([[Holter Graham]]), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a [[bird sanctuary]] in [[North Carolina]], and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.  [[File:ThomasAlden-FlyAwayHome.jpg|Thomas ([[Jeff Daniels]]) attempts to get the geese to follow him.|250px|left|thumb]]  Amy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy’s aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Glen Seifert returns to the Alden farm and confiscates the other geese. The next day, an elaborate plan is staged to free the geese and start their migration to North Carolina.  Making an emergency landing at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station]] in western  New York on the south shore of Lake Ontario, Amy and Thomas almost get arrested. They become national news, with residents cheering them on and offering the two a place to stay at night at each of their stops. Thirty miles before reaching the bird sanctuary, Thomas’s aircraft suffers a structural failure and crashes in a cornfield; he tells Amy to finish the journey by herself. After Amy takes off and begins to head toward the sanctuary, Thomas hitchhikes to the bird sanctuary. While waiting for the geese, Thomas, Susan, David, Barry and many animal enthusiasts stand up to developers who are waiting to start the excavation of the site.  Amy eventually appears with the geese, much to the joy of the townspeople and Amy’s family, but to the dismay of the developers. The townspeople and the Aldens celebrate their victory. The following spring, all 16 geese safely return to the Aldens' farm on their own.

On Fred and Wilma's anniversary, which they both forgot, the Rubbles arrange a trip to Rockapulco in an attempt to save the Flintstones' marriage.  Shortly after their arrival, a thief, Xavier, steals a diamond from a jewelry store and is chased by the guard into the same hotel the Flintstones and Rubbles are staying at. In the ensuing chaos, Xavier's bag is switched with Wilma's, and he immediately begins plotting to get the diamond back. At first, things do not improve between Fred and Wilma, to the point that Wilma lashes out at Fred and very nearly decides to divorce him, but she stumbles across the diamond in her suitcase and, assuming that Fred bought it as a surprise present, quickly makes up with him. Capitalizing on the circumstances, Fred goes along with the charade, but their newfound passion is short lived, as Fred's demeanour slowly puts Wilma off again. While spying on Wilma, Xavier notices this and masquerades as a suave Englishman in order to woo Wilma by inviting her to dinner. Wilma accepts the invitation and spends time with Xavier.  Fred, feeling guilty, decides to make it up to Wilma, but catches her from afar with Xavier and is heartbroken, and he starts to drink himself silly while speaking with another attractive woman at the bar. Wilma rebuffs Xavier's advances out of loyalty to Fred, but changes her mind when she sees him with the lady. While dancing, however, Xavier reveals his true intentions and attempts to take the diamond from Wilma, who was wearing it as a necklace. A chase ensues throughout the ballroom with Fred, Barney and Xavier each trying to get the diamond, but it eventually falls into Wilma's hands, prompting Xavier to abduct her and flee in his car. The ensuing car chase eventually leads to a bridge above a volcano, where Xavier threatens to kill Wilma if she does not hand the diamond over. Fred appears and gives a passionate speech about how he has not realized until now that even though he was not rich enough to buy the diamond, he is still the richest man in the world just by having Wilma as his wife.  Fred tries to attack him, but Xavier punches Fred unconscious. Wilma subdues Xavier and he is arrested by the same lady who Fred spoke with at the bar earlier, who is revealed to have been a policewoman on Xavier's trail. With their marriage restored, Fred and Wilma enjoy the rest of their trip, while Barney and Betty begin to bicker about their own marriage after seeing the passion Fred and Wilma ultimately displayed for each other.

Frailty (2001 film)
 Fenton Meiks ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) visits [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Wesley Doyle ([[Powers Boothe]]) claiming that his brother Adam is the culprit in the "God's Hand" [[serial killer|serial killings]]. Fenton says Adam has committed suicide, prompting Fenton to fulfill a promise to bury his brother in a public rose garden in their hometown of Thurman. He begins to tell Doyle about the boys' childhood and suggests that the bodies of the God's Hand victims are buried in the rose garden. Fenton continues telling Doyle his story as the two drive to Thurman.  In the summer of 1979, when the brothers ([[Matt O'Leary]] and [[Jeremy Sumpter]]) were children, their father ([[Bill Paxton]]) told them that he'd been visited by an angel and tasked by God with destroying demons disguised as human beings. He explained that this mission was now the responsibility of the three of them and must be kept secret from all others. The father's ''[[modus operandi]]'' is to wait for the angel to give him a list of names of those who must be destroyed. He then abducts an individual from the list, takes them to the family home and, with his sons present, touches them, which, he says, grants him a vision of the crimes the demon has committed.  He then finishes the victim with an ax and buries the body in the rose garden.  Adam believes in their father's mission and says that he sees the same visions of the demons' crimes that their father sees. Although he goes along out of fear, Fenton doesn't believe; he is convinced that their father is psychotic and has brainwashed Adam. Eventually, Fenton tries to stop the crimes by telling Sheriff Smalls ([[Luke Askew]]) what has happened. Smalls visits, and Fenton insists that he search their storm cellar. The father ambushes and kills Smalls, and is distraught at having been made to kill someone for what he believes is the first time.  The father blames Fenton for revealing their mission and thus forcing him to kill the sheriff. He further implies that the angel has told him something about Fenton he doesn't want to believe. To cure Fenton's apparent lack of faith, he locks him in the root cellar hoping Fenton will have a divine revelation. After many days of starvation, Fenton tells his father that he has indeed seen God and is ready to take his place in the mission. Upon the next abduction, Fenton is given the ax to deliver the death blow, but at the last second kills his father instead. As Fenton moves to free the hostage, Adam takes up the ax and kills him first. The two boys bury the bodies in the rose garden. Fenton asks Adam to bury him in the rose garden, too, should Adam ever "destroy" Fenton.  Doyle is puzzled by his phrasing, thinking that Fenton is taking him to bury Adam in the garden, not the other way around. "Fenton" then reveals to Doyle that he is in fact Adam and that he has destroyed the real Fenton, who grew up to become the God's Hand killer. Flashbacks reveal that Adam did in fact share his father's visions of those they abducted committing horrific crimes, just as he'd always claimed (whereas Fenton did not; as such, Adam always feared that Fenton was a demon). When Adam touches Doyle, a new vision reveals that Doyle had murdered his own mother. Doyle asks, "How did you know?" and Adam replies that Doyle's name was given to him on the list of demons to be destroyed. Doyle tries to protect himself by reminding Adam that people at the office saw him, but Adam just declares that God will protect him, then strikes down Doyle with the ax.  Those who saw Adam (posing as Fenton) at the FBI office inexplicably remember nothing about his appearance. In the surveillance tapes, his face is obscured by static. The investigation then proceeds as Adam predicted: FBI agents raid the real Fenton's home and discover evidence of his crimes, as well Doyle's badge, planted by Adam. Agent Hull ([[Derk Cheetwood]]) visits the Enid County Sheriff -- Adam Meiks -- to deliver the news about Fenton. Hull doesn't recognize Adam, even though he was one of the people who saw him at the FBI office the night before. Shaking Hull's hand before he takes his leave, Adam tells him he's "a good man," indicating he's seen that Hull has not committed any crimes. He departs, Adam telling his pregnant wife that "God's will has been served."

Franklin's Magic Christmas
 In this story, Franklin the [[Turtle]], his little [[sister]], Harriet (introduced in the previous film, ''[[Franklin and the Green Knight]]''), and their [[parents]], Jonathan and Elizabeth are paying a visit to spend [[Christmas]] with their [[maternal]] [[grandparents]] (Elizabeth's parents) at Faraway Farm, a farm far away from Woodland where Elizabeth grew up. As the family gets ready to go to the farm, they sing the first and third verses of ''[[Deck the Halls]]''. Franklin immediately becomes annoyed with Harriet when she throws a snowball, causing him to drop a large pile of presents. Faranklin's best friend, [[grizzly bear|Bear]] and his little sister, Beatrice come to collect Franklin's pet [[goldfish]], Goldie, and Franklin accidentally forgets his favorite stuffed [[toy]] dog, Sam, at home. Franklin thinks that Harriet dumped Sam in the [[snow]] on purpose, when it was really Beatrice who had Sam after they left, and Bear had failed to give it back to Franklin. Franklin is still annoyed with Harriet when they get to Faraway Farm, and he becomes even more annoyed when he learns that he and Harriet will be sleeping in the same room. Later that evening, his [[grandmother]], Jenny, tells a strange story from her childhood about a [[reindeer]]. This story involves a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] showing young Jenny and her [[father]] (Elizabeth's [[grandfather]] and Franklin and Harriet's [[great-grandfather]]). She admits that she might have imagined things just as Jonathan takes a [[family]] [[portrait]], in which Franklin gives a sad look because he still missed Sam. Jenny then shows Franklin [[Sirius]] outside and sings to him [[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]] before sending him to bed.  The next day, as Franklin feeds the [[chickens]], Jenny lets him in on a little [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] - she is fixing up an old [[sleigh]] for Grandfather Turtle. Franklin decides to help, and Jenny introduces him to her neighbors, the [[Collies]], who collect the polish for the sleigh. That night, an [[ice storm]] strikes, causing a [[Power outage|blackout]], and while Franklin is checking the attic closet for [[candles]], he comes across the [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] from Jenny's story, revealing that she was not imagining the story after all.   Franklin shows the bell to Jenny the next morning ([[Christmas Eve]]), and suggests that they use the bell for Grandfather Turtle's sleigh. Jenny has Harriet help with the sleigh, but Harriet spills the beans at [[lunch]] (fortunately, Grandfather Turtle does not overhear), to Franklin's frustration. Later, while Franklin and Harriet work on the sleigh, Harriet rings the bell, and just like in Jenny's story, a reindeer appears. Franklin runs to the house to tell Jenny. In the process, Franklin distracts Grandpa, who slips on a puddle of ice and breaks his leg. And when he is home, he then is on the sofa looking at his broken leg and is told to rest. Harriet then bursts into tears because of his leg being broken. Grandpa then comforts Harriet. Franklin feels guilty for distacting his grandfather and he and Harriet are sent to bed.  Franklin decides to use the sleigh to go back to Woodland and find Bear and Beatrice's [[mother]], Dr. Bear. He eventually discovers that Harriet has come along, hidden in the back. Rosie the [[horse]], is just as surprised as Franklin, and runs away. Franklin is furious with Harriet for scaring Rosie away, but then sees that she has brought the bell. Franklin angrily scolds her for her disobedience, which breaks Harriet down. Franklin then comforts and apologizes to her. Meanwhile back at the farm, their grandparents become worried sick about the children. Jenny finds a note that Franklin wrote saying that he is going back to Woodland to find Dr. Bear. The two young turtles are stranded and lost. So they ring the bell, and this time two reindeer come. One of them has the same exact bell as the one Franklin and Harriet have. Franklin realizes that the bell must belong to the other reindeer and that this is why he always comes whenever somebody rings it. With the bell back, the original reindeer creates a harness seemingly out of nowhere. As they soar above the clouds Franklin sees Sirius, and together he and Harriet sing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". Meanwhile, Mrs. Turtle, and Mr. Turtle. Jonathan and Elizabeth soon return home after spending the afternoon checking on the Collies. Jenny, Johnathan and Elizabeth decide to split up and try to find Franklin and Harriet. Franklin and Harriet soon arrive at the Bears' house and fetch Dr. Bear. Rosie returns to the farm and she, Jenny, Elizabeth, and Jonathan see Franklin, Harriet, and Dr. Bear arrive by sleigh. Dr. Bear gives Grandfather Turtle a cast for his leg and also gives Franklin Sam, much to Franklin's delight.  That night, Franklin and Harriet see [[Santa Claus]] and the reindeer out the window. The film ends with Franklin and Harriet wishing each other a merry Christmas.  
The Forsaken (film)
 Sean is driving cross country from [[Los Angeles]] to his sister's wedding in [[Miami]] when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a [[vampire]] hunter hunting a group of vampires led by Kit, one of the Forsaken; a group of French Knights of the [[First Crusade]] who made a pact with the fallen angel [[Abaddon]] to live forever. There were nine knights: eight were turned into vampires and became known as the Forsaken; the ninth was a sacrifice to Abaddon to seal the pact. Of the eight, four are dead, one is in Europe, one in Africa, and two in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and "infected" by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire "[[virus]]" is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism and killing the Forsaken kills the entire bloodline; killing all the vampires descended from it, and stopping anyone just bitten from turning, which is why Nick is hunting this particular Forsaken.  He believes him to be the one that his bloodline is descended from and that if he kills him, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a [[diner]], who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight.  Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean the virus from progressing. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away – chased by the vampires and their day driver Penn. After a battle on the road, Penn is killed and the car is running out of gas as its tank was shot so they are unable to reach the mission. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath (led by Kit) and after Kit bit her he left Teddy to kill her, which she did not do. Kit and Cym then catch up to them and lay siege to the gas station.  Sean discovers a graveyard outside and Ina explains that it is an old Spanish graveyard that was never dug up, making the house hallowed ground and thus a suitable place to kill Kit. In the following battle, Sean blows off Cym's head with Ina's shotgun but both he and Nick are injured and Kit forces him to be his new day driver then goes after Ina and Megan. As Kit is about to kill them Sean drives his car through the gas station wall and pins Kit to the wall, hoping to hold him there until the sun rises. Kit pushes the car back when it runs out of gas due to the hole in the tank but Sean then shoots him, knocking him into a beam of sunlight and shoots him again when he manages to escape the light. As Kit starts to combust, Sean, Nick, Megan and Ina flee the gas station; Kit's explosive death ignites the gas. It seems Sean and Megan are finally cured of vampirism, however Nick is not cured as it turns out that the vampire who bit him is descended from the other Forsaken in the United States. Nick takes to the road to try to find and kill the other Forsaken, leaving a letter of thanks for Sean. Three months later, Sean catches up to him driving Kit's car and insists on helping, having discovered that the Forsaken is probably in [[Denver]]. The two set off for Denver.  
The Fourth Angel
 Jack Elgin ([[Jeremy Irons]]) is the European editor of ''[[The Economist]]'', a magazine based in [[London, England]]. Jack has a wife, Maria ([[Briony Glassco]]), and three kids, Joanne ([[Anna Maguire]]), Julia ([[Holly Boyd]]), and Andrew ([[Joel Pitts]]). Jack subtly hijacks the family vacation, changing it from a lazy week of [[Mediterranean]] fun and sun in [[Corfu]], [[Greece]], to a tour of [[India]], because of a story he has to cover. Maria is not as impressed as the kids are.  Jack himself envisioned a chance to simultaneously seize a plum reporting assignment and spend at least a smidgen of quality time with his family. But, on the way to India, their plane, a [[Boeing 747-200]] owned by AM Air, an American airline, makes an unscheduled stopover in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]], because of a mechanical problem. After a while of waiting inside the Limassol airport, everyone gets back on the plane—which is then hijacked by a group of terrorists known as the August 15th Movement, led by a [[Serbs|Serbian]] man named Ivanic Loyvek ([[Serge Soric]]) and his right-hand man Karadan Maldic ([[Ivan Marevich]]). And they are demanding $50,000,000 from the [[U.S. State Department]] in one hour or everyone on the airplane will die.  The demand is met, and Loyvek and Maldic start releasing the women and children, with the men to go last. But as soon as a front passenger door is opened, a local police team gunning for the terrorists opens fire. The flight attendants frantically open the rest of the airplane's doors and start getting passengers out, but the terrorists start killing passengers, leading to an explosion.  Maria, Joanne, and Julia get out of the airplane, and then Jack, holding Andrew, gets out—only to watch Maria, Joanne, and Julia get shot by the terrorists. Jack tries to hide Andrew's face so he can't see it. Maria and Joanne are dead, and Julia is still alive—but Julia burns to death while crying for help. In all, a total of 15 passengers die, and Loyvek and Maldic, the surviving terrorists, escape, knowing that they now have the $50,000,000. Jack feels that the hijacking would never have ended that way if the police team had waited until after the passengers were released from the airplane before getting trigger happy.  Back in London, an absolutely devastated Jack is told that the terrorists were captured, but they were released and deported secretly, with no charges, no arrest—the result of some awfully compromised politics. Jack is understandably enraged that Loyvek and Maldic got off scot-free. While helping Andrew cope, Jack tries all the legal ways to ensure justice for his family, but to no avail.  Jack pays a visit to Henry Davidson ([[Jason Priestley]]), a [[CIA]] agent who works at the American [[Embassy]] in London. Davidson tells Jack that there's little that can be done. Obviously, the American and British governments are completely impotent when it comes to going after Loyvek and Maldic, so Jack must do it himself.  With the help of his friend ex-intelligence operative Kate Stockton ([[Charlotte Rampling]]), who is well-schooled in the finer points of international intelligence, Jack becomes a one-man anti-terrorist squadron, tracking down those who work with Loyvek and Maldic, and turning their own weapons against them. Dogging Jack's trail is FBI agent Jules Bernard ([[Forest Whitaker]]), who's cooperating with [[Scotland Yard]] on anti-terrorist activities, and who suspects that Jack is the man who has been killing anyone involved in the hijacking.  But as it turns out, Jules is on Jack's side, and he's willing to help Jack. After Jack kills Maldic, it turns out that Davidson was behind everything. Davidson had the airplane hijacked so he could get $50,000,000. With Jules's help, Jack sets out to make Loyvek and Davidson pay for the deaths of his family and the other people who died in Cyprus.

Freddy Got Fingered
 Unemployed 28-year-old [[cartoonist]] Gordon "Gord" Brody leaves his parents' home in [[Portland, Oregon]], to pursue his lifelong ambition of obtaining a contract for an animated television series. His parents give him a car in which he drives to [[Los Angeles]] and starts work at a cheese sandwich factory. Gord shows his drawings to Dave Davidson, the CEO of a major animation studio; Davidson tells him that the artwork is not bad, but that the concepts depicted, including a vigilante "X-Ray Cat", are nonsensical. Disheartened, Gord quits his job and returns to his parents.  Gord's father Jim constantly insults and belittles him following his return, telling him to forget about being an animator and "get a job". When Gord pressures his friend Darren into skating on a wooden half-pipe he has built outside the Brody home, Darren falls and breaks his leg. At the hospital Gord impersonates a doctor, delivers a baby, and meets an attractive nurse Betty, who uses a wheelchair, has an obsessive penchant for [[fellatio]], and wants to create a rocket-powered wheelchair. Jim also disparages Betty. After a heated display, Jim smashes Gord's half-pipe, and Gord and his parents go to a family therapy session. There, Gord falsely accuses Jim of "[[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]" Gord's younger brother, Freddy. The 25-year-old Freddy is sent to a home for sexually molested children while Gord's mother Julie leaves Jim, and ends up dating the basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. While in a drunken stupor, Jim tells Gord how much of a disappointment he is to him. Affected by Jim's words, Gord decides to abandon his aspirations to be a cartoonist and gets a job at a local sandwich shop.  After seeing a television news report on Betty's successful rocket-powered wheelchair, Gord is inspired to pursue his dreams once again. He returns to Hollywood with a concept based on his relationship with his father: an animated series called ''Zebras in America''. While Gord is pitching this to Davidson, Jim bursts in and trashes Davidson's office. Thinking Jim's actions are part of Gord's pitch, Davidson greenlights ''Zebras in America'' and gives Gord a million-dollar check. Gord spends a quarter of that money to thank Betty elaborately for inspiring him, and the remainder to relocate the Brody house to [[Pakistan]] with his father inside, unconscious—a response to Jim's earlier put-down that "If this were Pakistan, you would have been sewing soccer balls when you were four years old!"  Gord and Jim soon come to terms, but are then abducted and held hostage. The kidnapping becomes a news item, as Gord's series has already become popular. After 18 months in captivity, Gord and Jim return to America, where a huge crowd welcomes them home.

As children, they play together and sell sexually explicit pictures. In high school, they become smitten with the lead singer of a girl band their age. Joon-seok invites the band to a party at his house, where Sang-taek receives his first kiss from the lead singer, Jin-sook.   In school, Joon-seok and Dong-su get in trouble after a confrontation with a teacher; they apologize and only receive a light suspension. During an outing to the movies, Sang-taek catches the eye of a school kid he had picked a fight with earlier. Joon-seok and Dong-su fend off a whole rival school while Jung-ho protects Sang-taek. Dong-su smashes the school's glass cases with its awards and trophies and drops out of school. After graduation, Sang-taek and Jung-ho go to college but the others do not.  A few years later, Sang-taek and Jung-ho return to find Joon-seok married to Jin-sook. He is suffering withdrawal symptoms and is abusive towards his wife as a result of being addicted to [[Methamphetamine|philopon]]. Later, he recovers from his addiction, divorces his wife, and mourns his father's death. He assumes his father's role as a crime lord, working under Hyung-doo. Dong-su becomes a mobster with a rival organization, led by Sang-gon.  Joon-seok, Sang-taek, and Jung-ho remain close, drinking, singing [[karaoke]], and eating [[galbi]] together. After Dong-su causes Joon-seok's boss to be imprisoned, a rogue assassination attempt, headed by Doruko, is led against Dong-su without Joon-seok's knowledge. The attack fails, and in retaliation, Dong-su mounts an attack on Joon-seok's fishing facilities, during which many of Joon-seok's men, including Doruko, are killed. After the attack, Joon-Seok feels that Dong-Su has turned against him, as he was unaware Doruko had plotted an assassination attempt. Joon-seok talks to Dong-su and asks if he would like to accompany him to see Sang-taek off to [[America]]. Dong-su says no. It is shown that Joon-seok knew Dong-Su is being targeted for assassination. He asks Dong-su to leave to be safe, but Dong-su refuses. Dong-su later decides to see Sang-taek off after all. However, as he is about to leave, he is betrayed by his own gang and stabbed to death by fellow gang members.  A few years later, Sang-taek returns to [[South Korea]] upon finishing his study abroad. Jung-ho explains that Joon-seok's gang sent him into hiding abroad. After two years, he was unable to stand the hiding any longer and had a mental breakdown. He was caught after attempting to kill himself in a foreign bar. Joon-seok stood trial for Dong-su's murder and pleaded guilty to ordering Dong-su's death, even though he is innocent.  Sang-taek visits Joon-seok in prison, and the two talk like old friends. Sang-taek asks why he pleaded guilty in court. Joon-seok simply replies, "Embarrassment. Me and Dong-su are mobsters. Mobsters shouldn't be embarrassed." Sang-taek and Joon-seok part ways, with Sang-taek promising to visit every month. The film ends with Joon-seok walking to his fate in prison life, reflecting on the past when they were all children, when they were all good friends.  
From Hell (film)
  In 1888, [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]] ([[Heather Graham]]) and her small group of [[London]] prostitutes trudge through unrelenting daily misery. When their friend Ann Crook ([[Joanna Page]]) is kidnapped, they are drawn into a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] with links to high society. The kidnapping is followed by the gruesome murder of another woman, [[Martha Tabram]] ([[Samantha Spiro]]); and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down one by one as prostitutes are murdered and mutilated post-mortem.  The murder of Martha and her companions grabs the attention of [[Whitechapel]] [[Police Inspector]] [[Frederick Abberline]] ([[Johnny Depp]]), a brilliant, yet troubled, man whose police work is often aided by his [[psychic]] "visions." His colleague, Sergeant Peter Godley ([[Robbie Coltrane]]), tries to grasp his friend's wild theories. Abberline's investigations reveal that the murders, while gruesome, imply that an educated person is responsible due to the precise and almost surgical method used. Ann is found a few days later in a [[workhouse]] having been [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] after officials and doctors supposedly found her to be insane, though it is implied this was done to silence her.   Abberline consults [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a physician to the Royal Family, drawing on his experience and knowledge of medicine. During this meeting, it is revealed Abberline is struggling with [[opium addiction]]. Gull's findings, coupled with his superiors impeding his investigations, point Abberline to a darker and more organized conspiracy than he originally thought. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love.  Abberline deduces that [[Freemason]] influence is definitely present in these crimes. His superior, a high ranking Freemason himself, then makes direct intervention and suspends Abberline. It is then revealed that Gull is the killer. He has been killing the witnesses to painter [[Walter Sickert|Albert Sickert]] ([[Mark Dexter]])'s forbidden [[Catholic]] marriage to Crook, who bore his legitimate daughter, Alice. Sickert is actually [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], grandson of reigning [[Queen Victoria]] (Liz Moscrop), and therefore Alice is heiress to the British throne. Gull tells Abberline that "mankind will remember him for giving birth to the 20th century." Abberline draws his gun, vowing that Gull will never see the 20th century, but before he is able to shoot Gull, he is knocked out by Ben Kidney, another Freemason.  The Freemasons try to have Abberline eliminated without leaving any witnesses, but Abberline fights back and kills two of the assassins by overturning a carriage. Gull himself is a Freemason and his increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculated, mind. Rather than publicly charge Gull, the Freemasons decide to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] him to protect themselves and the Royal Family from the scandal. Gull defiantly states he has no equal among men, remaining unrepentant up to his lobotomy, resulting in him becoming invalid just as Ann had been.  Abberline tries to save Mary, but arrives too late, and blames his superior for not helping  him or Godley on the cases. Abberline does nothing but watch Mary's mutilated body being taken away. Abberline receives a mysterious letter, which he soon realizes is from Mary, but he decides not to look for her as a way to offer her protection, as the Freemasons may be watching his every move. Abberline decides to burn the letter, knowing that he can never have a normal life.  Mary Kelly was not killed; Gull mistook Ada, whom Liz said was from France (but is from Brussels in Belgium), for Mary and he killed her instead. Mary lives with Alice as her daughter in a cottage on a cliff by the sea. Abberline is found dead of an [[opium]] [[drug overdose|overdose]], knowing he can never see Mary again without endangering her. Sergeant Godley comes to pay his respects for the Inspector.

 Stephen Torcelli lives with his partner Danny Russo in [[New York City]]. When Stephen's parents call to announce a surprise visit for his father's birthday, Stephen and Danny scramble to conceal their double lives. The Torcellis already know that Stephen and Danny are gay; they don't know that they're enforcers for the Patrizzi [[American Mafia|crime family]]. Stephen's father is an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent and if he learns of their criminal affiliation he'll be obligated to report them. Stephen and Danny have told them that they run a catering company, even though neither of them can cook.  Meanwhile, Don Patrizzi's daughter Jenny has announced her engagement. Even though her fiancé is not [[Sicily|Sicilian]], Don Patrizzi decides to throw her a lavish engagement party which gets combined with the birthday party for Mr Torcelli. Mrs Torcelli suggests that the boys cater the party, sending them into a panic. Fortunately one of Don Patrizzi's sons is an excellent chef - and the other is a master decorator - so the Patrizzi boys take care of the food and the decor. As a special treat for Jenny, Don Patrizzi forcibly "invites" a U.S. Senator under his control to the party.  It is this guest who is of the most interest to the Jenningses, the parents of Jenny's fiance. They run a [[Militia (United States)|militia]] group which has declared war on the United States government and they want to take the opportunity to hold the Senator, a representative of that government, hostage.  Oblivious to this threat, Don Patrizzi's soldiers have been enlisted to serve as waiters for the party. Reasoning that a catering company owned by a gay couple would have gay employees, they recruit a flamboyant friend of the Danny and Stephen's to give them a crash course on gay (including such vital information as the correct order of [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s husbands and the proper use of the expression "puh-''lease''!").  At the party all is going well until the Jenningses and their militiamen strike. They take the guests hostage and force the Senator to record a message for the media. Stephen and Danny, fearful that the tape will lead to police action and a deadly shootout, neutralize the militia with the help of the newly gay-acting Patrizzi soldiers and some random [[drag queen]]s that were brought to the party for a vaguely defined purpose. With their cover blown, Stephen and Danny tell Mr Torcelli that they're ready for him to turn them in. However, the birthday he's celebrating is his 60th, meaning that he's been mandatorily retired and is no longer with the FBI. In other happy news for Don Patrizzi, Jenny's fiancé turns out to be adopted and he was actually born Sicilian after all.

Gas Attack (film)
   On a [[pig farm]] in [[Scotland]], a recording is made of the livestock present at the farm, of which a large number are dead or dying from an unknown illness.  Nationwide, Britain is experiencing an intense period of racial tension, with extremist groups clashing with police forces across the country and rioting taking place in major cities, the most severe being in [[Glasgow]]. Some Scottish politicians attribute the deterorating relations to a recent influx of Kurdish asylum seekers in Glasgow, supported by local authorities and handled by the Asylum Seeker Resettlement Project, which they claim is unwanted by the British public and has resulted in a backlash by disaffected citizens.  One such asylum seeker, Sherko Hussein (Sherko Zen-Aloush) struggles to make a living with his illegally underpaid job, having moved from [[Iraq]] with his daughter Resa (Benae Hussein) to northern Glasgow. While in a shopping centre with Resa, he notices that Resa has developed a bad cough and is unwell. He asks ASRP worker Robina Dhoody (Robina Qureshi), assigned to the Husseins, to watch his daughter while he goes out to work, to which she reluctantly agrees. Noticing the poor conditions in which they are living, Robina becomes concerned about Resa's health, and convinces Sherko to take her to Broomyhill Infirmary.  Doctor Annie Millbrook (Morag Calder) diagnoses Resa with acute influenza and prescribes antibiotics to her and admits Resa to the ward. Robina notices that the hospital is inundated with large numbers of other asylum seekers from the same block of flats that the Husseins live in, all presenting with similar flu-like symptoms. However, she is met with a cool response when she encourages Sherko to complain to the authorities, who is fearful he will be discriminated against because of his migrant status and deported back to Iraq, and he implies that Robina does not care or understand their plight, which offends her.  Glasgow Central Police receive an anonymous email with imagery of dead livestock and other threatening media. The force ignores the email.  Meanwhile, a neighbour of the Husseins, Hamaz Mohammed, suddenly deteroriates and despite attempts to revive him, dies from his illness. This concerns the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] community, who worry a similar fate awaits their affected members, and confuses the medical staff treating the asylum seekers, who order a postmortem and hold a meeting with the families of the asylum seekers to reassure them. Robina becomes suspicious about the circumstances of Hamaz's death and becomes convinced that the conditions in which the asylum seekers live is attributable to Hamaz's death. However, she is warned by her superior Bill Grigson (Laurie Ventry) to fall in with the official angle and that investigating her "wildcat" theories will be both fruitless and unhelpful to the situation. Despite this, she becomes determined to act when at the public meeting, Millbrook and other officials accidentally reveal that Hamaz died of an unknown infection and that it could be a serious viral pathogen such as TB, exacerbated by Robina mentioning TB which is picked up by the intrepreter and disseminated to the community.  Robina is convinced that the asylum seekers contracted TB by way of infectious animal ash being blown from an incinerator north of the high-rise flats the Kurdish live in. She attempts to break into the compound discreetly, but is caught by the security firm guarding the facility and removed. Grigson asks her to focus on her job of integrating asylum seekers and to allow the medical staff to treat the contagion without her interference, warning that the council will not tolerate repeated maverick actions. However, Robina ignores this and immediately returns to Broomyhill to interrogate Millbrook.  Overnight, police and racial groups and protesters clash in heavy riots across the UK, particularly in the Glasgow area, and emergency services struggle to maintain order as the social unrest escalates.  At Broomyhill, patients begin to make decisive recoveries and Millbrook begins to discharge the asylum seekers. However, she remains concerned at the unusual pathology and the death of Hamaz. While waiting for the postmortem results, she investigates possible causes of the illness experienced by the Kurdish. She eventually reaches an alarming conclusion; it is possible that Hamaz has been killed by anthrax bacteria. This is confirmed by the postmortem of Hamaz. Grigson learns of Robina's illegal activity in investigating the illness and warns that further scaremongering regarding the epidemic will result in her being sacked. More emails are sent to Glasgow Central, which fails to act despite the threats communicated to them in the email.  An emergency outbreak control team is assembled consisting of personnel from all of the relevant departments; however, the NHS chief executive is adamant that the mounting threat of an anthrax attack be censored from the press, worrying at the public panic and the resulting collapse of the already overstretched infrastructure, and the team are ineffectual in responding to the threat of the illness, treating the potential outbreak as an isolated case and investigating nearby agricultural facilities for sources of anthrax outbreaks,believing that Hamaz may have contracted the virus from moonlighting cheap farm labour. However, this is leaked to the media, which begins to make a connection between the Kurdish epidemic and the illness  
Ghosts of Mars
 Set in the second half of the 22nd century, [[Mars]] has been 84% [[Terraforming|terraformed]], allowing humans to walk on the surface without pressure suits. Martian society has become matriarchal, with women in most positions of authority. The story concerns police officer Melanie Ballard ([[Natasha Henstridge]]), who is sent to a remote mining outpost to transport prisoner Desolation Williams ([[Ice Cube]]). Arriving at the remote mining town, Ballard finds all of the people missing. She learns that they had discovered an underground doorway created by an ancient [[Martian]] civilization. When the door was opened it released disembodied spirits or "ghosts", which took possession of the miners.  The possessed miners commit horrific acts of death and destruction, along with [[self-mutilation]]. When team leader Helena Bradock ([[Pam Grier]]) is murdered, Ballard must assume command, fight off the possessed miners, escape the town and hopefully destroy the ghosts. Unfortunately, killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another human. The team eventually decides to blow up a [[nuclear reactor]] to vaporize all of the ghosts.   Ballard's crew, along with survivors who gathered in the jail, are eventually wiped out by the miners. At one point, Ballard is nearly possessed, but resists when she is given a drug and discovers that the spirits are attacking them as they believe that the humans are invaders and plan to exterminate the humans on [[Mars]] (it is presumed that the spirits are unaware of the fact that martian life has died out). Only Ballard and Williams are left after Sergeant Jericho and the other officers, along with the two train  operators, are killed when they try to finish the fight by causing the settlement's nuclear powerplant to go critical, turning it into a small atomic bomb. Not wanting to be blamed for the massacre, Williams handcuffs Ballard to her cot and escapes from the train. Returning home, Ballard delivers her report, which her superiors refuse to believe. While Ballard recuperates in the hospital, the released spirits, unharmed from the nuclear explosion, attack the city. Ballard and Williams are going to fight to stay alive.

  Josch Klauser (played by [[Roman Knizka]]), Mike ([[Hinnerk Schönemann]]) and their younger sister Nic ([[Marie-Luise Schramm]]) experience ups and downs in search for their first love. Josch is the oldest of the three. He is a big fan of [[Dracula]], and mentally handicapped. He falls in love with Nadine ([[Julia Jentsch]]), who is the girlfriend of his brother Mike.  
Get Over It (film)
 Berke Landers and his girlfriend Allison were the quintessential high-school couple who grew up together and eventually fell in love, but she breaks up with him immediately after the film begins. This leads to an opening musical number of "[[Love Will Keep Us Together]]" by [[Captain & Tennille]], imagined by Berke. He seeks advice from his embarrassing parents Frank and Beverly Landers, who are hosts of a relationship advice show called ''Love Matters'', but they don't help with the situation and constantly focus on his sex life and sexuality throughout the film. Allison then starts a relationship with Striker, a 'foreign' student who was once the lead singer of a boy band called the Swingtown Lads. When Allison and Striker audition for the school's upcoming musical, Berke desperately tries to win Allison back by also auditioning for the play, despite having no theatrical talent and having a busy schedule as a member of the basketball team. Meanwhile, Berke's friends Felix and Dennis try to find a new girlfriend for him.  With the help of Felix's younger sister, Kelly, a talented songwriter and singer, Berke wins a minor role in the play, a modern musical version of Shakespeare's comedy ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' called ''A Midsummer Night's Rockin' Eve'', written and directed by the school's domineering drama teacher, Dr. Desmond Oates. Striker plays [[Demetrius (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Demetrius]], Allison plays [[Hermia]], Kelly plays [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]], and [[Lysander (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Lysander]] is to be played by the school's star actor, Peter Wong. But after Peter is injured in a freak accident, Striker nominates Berke to take over the role of Lysander, and, still intent on winning Allison back, Berke accepts. He gradually improves with continuing assistance from Kelly, but remains unaware of the growing attraction between the two of them. While searching through props backstage, Kelly accidentally shoots Berke in the arm with an arrow gun, thinking it's a prop. Meanwhile, Oates blames Kelly's singing for his own poorly written song and rejects her suggestions to improve it.  Felix and Dennis set Berke up on a date with Dora a very attractive but accident-prone woman. The date ends horribly when Dora inadvertently causes a fire in the restaurant. They try again by taking him to a strip club. However their attempts fail when Burke is locked into a harness and whipped by a dominatrix named Mistress Moira. The night ends with the club being raided by the police, Felix and Dennis abandoning Berke who is then picked up by his parents who, to Berke's shock, congratulate him.  At a party at Berke's house, Kelly kisses Berke, but he insists that a relationship between them could not work because she is Felix's sister. She leaves him, annoyed at his unwillingness to move on with his life, and Felix, coming across the two, punches Berke. At the same party, Berke and Allison catch Striker cheating on Allison with her best friend Maggie ([[Zoe Saldana]]), and so Allison breaks up with Striker. Meanwhile, Frank and Beverly return home to the party and once again congratulate Berke. Berke lampoons them for constantly embarrassing him and not acting like normal parents would to these types of situations.  On the play's opening night, the first half of the performance goes smoothly except for some onstage scuffling between Berke and Striker. During the intermission, Allison confides to Berke that she wants to get back together with him, leaving him with a difficult choice between her and Kelly. Meanwhile, Striker bribes two of the theater technicians to try and blow up Berke using stage pyrotechnics. Before the play resumes, Felix gives the orchestra sheet music for a love ballad written by Kelly to replace Oates' unpopular tune.  After the curtain rises, Kelly sings her song so beautifully that Berke is reminded of their time together and finally realizes he loves her. As the fourth act begins, he abandons his lines from the script and makes up his own verse professing his character's love for Kelly's character Helena. The audience applauds as Berke and Kelly kiss. Striker protests this change, but unwittingly signals the technicians to set off the explosion, blowing him offstage. Felix saves Dora's life and they become a couple. Dennis kisses Kelly's friend and his dancing partner Basin ([[Mila Kunis]]), who kisses him back, suggesting that they also begin a relationship. Kelly and Berke leave the theater after the show, looking forward to their future together as they discuss the next night's performance. The film ends with singers [[Sisqó]] and [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]] singing and dancing along with the cast to the song "[[September (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|September]]" as the credits roll.  
The Gilded Six Bits
 "The Gilded Six-Bits" opens with the description of a house, surrounded by what is described as "a Negro yard around a Negro house in a Negro settlement. But there was something happy about that place." The characters are first introduced when Missie May awaits her husband, Joe, who is returning from work on a pay day, where he comes home and tosses [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollars]] through the front door for Missie May to pick up. Like always, she pretends to be mad that he is throwing the money and playfully chases him, then goes through his pockets to find a little present that he has bought her.  That night, with the silver dollars placed next to Missie May's plate during dinner, Joe tells her that he is going to take her out to a new [[ice cream parlor]] opened by a new rich black man in town from [[Chicago]], who goes by the name of Otis D. Slemmons. To many people in the community, Slemmons is seen as a charismatic and wealthy black man. Joe discusses Mr. Slemmons' fine clothes, all the while Missie May seems to be unimpressed, suggesting that he might be lying about his [[wealth]] and [[Social status|success]], and stated "Aw, he don't look no better in his clothes than you do in yourn. He got a puzzlegut on 'im and he so chickle-headed, he got a pone behind his neck," which is implying that there is no other man that can be better nor look better than Joe. Joe still believes that Slemmons is still a great man and decides to take Missie May to the ice cream parlor so he can show his beautiful wife off in hopes of meeting Mr. Slemmons.  At the ice cream parlor, Missie May still shows that she is not impressed by the man but shows some keen interest in his wealth. After returning home Joe tells Missie May that although he may not have money like Slemmons, he'd rather be broke as long as he has her. Every week, they make their visit to the ice cream parlor. It's not until one night that Joe gets off work early the test of love is finally revealed. Joe arrives home to find Slemmons in the bed alongside Missie May. Missie May pleads and apologizes to Joe by revealing that the only reason she slept with Slemmons was to get money from him. Joe shows anger by attacking Slemmons, but after he leaves he shows no more signs of anger. The next morning, Joe treats the day as if it was just an ordinary day and asks Missie May why she is not eating breakfast. Missie May cannot understand why Joe does not leave her, but he continues to torture her by carrying around the golden coin Slemmons left behind to symbolize the affair.  Days go by and the couple slowly drifts away until Joe comes home complaining of aches and pains. He asks Missie May to give him a [[massage]] and that night they end up sleeping together for the first time in a long time. When Joe gets up that morning, he leaves behind Slemmons' coin, in his attempt to torture her, by paying her for her services. When Missie May examines the coin, she realizes that it is nothing but a [[gilded half dollar]]. She realizes that Slemmons was not a rich man after all, but a liar and a fake. At that point, Missie May feels ashamed and embarrassed by throwing all of the happiness away for something that seemed too good to be true.  A few weeks after this event, Missie May finds out that she is [[pregnant]] and Joe is not concerned whether the baby is his or not. Fortunately at the end of the story, the baby is born, and after some convincing by his mother, Joe accepts the baby as his. Joe is truly happy and takes the gilded coin to the candy shop to buy his wife some chocolates. That night when he returns home, he continues the tradition between the two, by tossing the silver half dollars to Missie May to symbolize the [[happiness]] that is again within the house, and for the first time in a while, they are finally a happy couple again.<ref></ref>  
Ghost World (film)
 Best friends Enid and Rebecca face the summer after their high school graduation. The girls are social [[outcast (person)|outcast]]s, but Rebecca is more popular with boys than Enid. Enid's diploma is withheld on the condition that she attend a remedial art class. Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta, believes that art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as nothing more than "light entertainment".  The girls see a [[Personals|personal ad]] in which a lonely, middle-aged man named Seymour asks a woman he met recently to contact him. Enid makes a [[prank phone call]] to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner. The two girls and their friend, Josh, secretly watch Seymour at the diner and make fun of him. Enid soon begins to feel sympathy for Seymour, and they follow him to his apartment building. Later they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old [[blues]] album from him, and they become friends. She decides to try to find women for him to date.  Enid has meanwhile been attending her remedial art class, and she persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by [[Coon Chicken Inn]], the fried chicken franchise now known as Cook's Chicken, where Seymour works as a manager. Enid presents the poster in class as a social comment about racism, and Roberta is so impressed with the concept that she offers Enid a scholarship to an art college.  Seymour receives a phone call from Dana, the intended recipient of his personal ad. Enid encourages him to pursue a relationship with Dana, but she becomes unexpectedly jealous when he does so.  Enid and Rebecca's lives start to diverge. While Enid has been spending time with Seymour, Rebecca has found a job at a coffee shop and has become more interested in clothing and boys. Enid also finds a job so she can afford to rent an apartment with Rebecca, but she is fired after only one day. The girls argue, and Rebecca abandons the idea of living with Enid.  At the end of the summer, Enid and Seymour's lives fall apart. When Enid's poster is displayed in an art show, school officials find it so offensive they force Roberta to give her a failing grade and revoke the scholarship. Enid turns to Seymour for solace, resulting in a drunken one-night stand. Seymour breaks up with Dana, and is called to account at work when the Coon Chicken poster is publicized in a local newspaper. He unsuccessfully tries to contact Enid, only for Rebecca to tell him about Enid's prank phone call, describing the way they mocked him at the diner. Seymour is upset and ends up in a violent confrontation with Josh, resulting in his being injured and hospitalized. Enid visits him in an effort to apologize, causing him to realize that he has no chance of any kind of future with her.  Enid gives in to her childhood fantasy of running away from home and disappearing. She has seen an old man, Norman, continually waiting at an out-of-service bus stop for a bus that will never come. Finally, as Enid watches from across the street, Norman boards an out-of-service bus. The next day, while Seymour discusses the summer's events with his therapist, Enid returns to the bus stop and boards the out-of-service bus when it arrives.

Go (2001 film)
 Third-generation Korean, Sugihara, is a student at a Japanese high school after graduating from a North Korean junior high school in Japan. His father runs a back-alley shop that specializes in exchanging pachinko-earned goods for cash, which is stereotypically a “common” zainichi occupation.<ref></ref> His father had long supported North Korea, but he obtained South Korean nationality to go sightseeing in Hawaii, which required a South Korean passport.  Sugihara’s school days are filled with fights that always result in his victory; he and his delinquent peers fill the rest of their time with all kinds of mischief. His best friend, Jong-Il is a Korean high-school student who had been his classmate in junior high. When Sugihara decided to leave Korean schools for a Japanese high school, their classroom teacher called him a traitor to their homeland. However, Jong-Il supported Sugihara by saying: “We never have had what you call homeland.”  One day, Sugihara attends the birthday party of one of his friends and meets a mysterious Japanese girl whose family name is Sakurai (she is reluctant to use her first name). He takes her out on a couple of dates and they gradually become intimate. However, tragedy strikes when Jong-Il is stabbed to death by a Japanese youth at a railway station. Jong-Il mistakenly thought that the youth was about to attack a female Korean student at the station. The boy, who is carrying a knife, attacks and kills Jong-Il. Sakurai comforts Sugihara, and that night they attempt to make love. She freezes in bed, however, when Sugihara confesses that he is Korean. She declares that she is afraid of a non-Japanese male entering her, and Sugihara leaves.  In the meantime, Sugihara’s father has been depressed by the news that his younger brother died in North Korea. In an attempt to provoke him, Sugihara blames his father, stating that the second generation of zainichi, with its sentimentality and powerlessness, has caused the zainichi much grief and difficulty. They fistfight, and the result is Sugihara's complete defeat. In the wake of the fight, Sugihara finds out that the true reason for his father’s adopting South Korean nationality was that he wanted to make his son’s life easier.  Six months later, on Christmas Eve, Sugihara is studying hard in preparation for the college entrance examinations. He is trying to fulfill the wishes of the deceased Jong-Il, who always wanted him to go to a (presumably Japanese) university. Sakurai calls him after a long period of silence between them and asks him to come to the place where they had their first date. In this last scene, they recover mutual affection and leave for some unknown place together in a light snowfall.  
The Glass House (2001 film)
 Sixteen-year-old Ruby Baker ([[Leelee Sobieski]]) and her eleven-year-old brother Rhett ([[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]]) lose their parents, Dave and Grace, in a car accident. Their parents' [[Will (law)|will]] is not a recent one but, in accordance with its terms, the children are placed under the [[Legal guardian|guardianship]] of family neighbors from some years back, the childless couple Erin ([[Diane Lane]]) and Terry ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]) Glass, who live in a large glass house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]].  There are early indications that all is not well. The children have to share a room; they are no longer educated privately; Rhett is allowed to play with [[Video game console|games consoles]] at all times; and Ruby is made uneasy by Terry's sexual hints when they are alone. Ruby comes across unlabeled pharmaceuticals and sees Erin injecting herself, though the couple claims this is for [[diabetes]]. Ruby tries unsuccessfully to get the children's estate and [[trust fund]] lawyer Alvin Begleiter ([[Bruce Dern]]) to accept her concerns and a visiting social worker is taken in by the couple's assurances.  Ruby discovers a postcard from the children's maternal Uncle Jack ([[Chris Noth]]) in the trash, along with a letter from a private school indicating the Glasses unregistered the children and pocketed the $30,000+ tuition money. Ruby also finds signs that Terry is in debt to [[loan shark]]s, and she gradually realizes her new foster parents are after the siblings' $4 million trust fund. Ruby becomes suspicious of her parents' death and discovers evidence of the Glasses' involvement from the online news which states that Ruby's parents had been driving a BMW, which was actually one of Terry's cars, instead of their Saab. Moreover, Ruby is expelled from school because her essay, which Terry finished for her seemingly to rekindle their relationship, is found to be plagiarised; it is later revealed that this is Terry's plan to send Ruby to a boarding school far away. After being pushed by the loan sharks to pay off his debt, Terry decides to get money from the financial authority, claiming that it is to be used for the children's benefit. However, his request is denied and he is shown a copy of the un-registration letter from the school, previously faxed to the authority most likely by Ruby, which raises the question of why he needs more money when he has already gotten the tuition money back in his pocket.   Later on, in the middle of the night, Ruby steals Terry's car key, wakes Rhett up, and drives off in his Jaguar, attempting to escape. She is unfortunately stopped by the police who demands to see her driver's license. The kids are recaptured in the car on the road by Terry and Erin who talk the police into letting them go. Back at home, while Ruby attempts to run away again, Terry slaps Ruby, knocking her down, and Erin drugs her. Terry then tells Erin they must get rid of Ruby. Overcome by guilt and having lost her medical license due to her drug abuse, Erin commits suicide. Terry locks the kids in the basement and sabotages his car, expecting the kids to make another escape attempt and consequently die in it. However, the loan sharks, alerted by Ruby, appear at Terry's house, kill Mr. Begleiter (who has come to confront Terry and revealed his complicity, though without being aware of the Glasses'corrupted intention), repossess Terry's Jaguar, and insist on taking a ride. Terry begs them to reconsider, or to at least take another car, the Volvo instead of the Jaguar which he has earlier cut the brake line. Having heard everything, Ruby rushes to stab the tires of the Volvo with a knife, causing the loan sharks to put Terry in the Jaguar and drive away in it. The car then goes over a ledge and crashes, killing the loan sharks, but Terry survives.  Meanwhile, the children are picked up by a friendly cop. The policeman stops at the scene of the accident and, while investigating, Terry knocks him out. After climbing back up the embankment, and armed with a gun, Terry tries to lure Ruby and Rhett toward him. Ruby hits Terry with the police car and kills him instantly. In the end, Ruby and Rhett end up living with their Uncle Jack, who takes them to [[Chicago]], where they visit their parents' grave and embrace each other.  
Girl from Rio
 Raymond Woods, a junior manager in a bank in [[City of London|the City]], is becoming increasingly bored of his life as it takes a downhill tumble. First he finds out that he has missed the promotion opportunity at work by his bad tempered and disapproving boss, Strothers, and then he catches his wife a couple of days before Christmas having an affair with Strothers.  Touching down in Rio, he calls a cab to take him to a nice hotel. The cab driver, Paulo, takes him to a fairly run down hotel. Raymond insists he needs a much nicer hotel with a beach, while Paulo insists Raymond would not be able to afford such a hotel, but suddenly changes heart once Raymond shows him a large wad of cash. Paulo immediately befriends Raymond, with his eyes greedily on his cash as he owes money to the biggest [[Mafia]] leader in Rio. He insists that he is prepared to take Raymond wherever he needs to go and whatever he needs done can be done. Therefore, Paulo takes Raymond to the nicest hotel in Rio. Raymond trips up in a commotion at the door of the hotel, dropping his bag and spreading his cash all over the floor. Once he hastily shuffles it all away, the hotel clerks immediately show him to the [[Presidential suite]]. After a day of shopping and generous spending Raymond reveals to Paulo he has come to Rio to look for the famous samba dancer Orlinda.  Paulo then calls to tell Raymond he has found Orlinda. After dropping Raymond off at the club where Orlinda is performing, Paulo sneaks back to the hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to steal the money. Meanwhile, Raymond and Orlinda dance together, then Paulo drives them back to the hotel. Paulo tells Orlinda about the safe. Raymond enjoys a passionate night with Orlinda, but wakes to find the money gone. Raymond tries to find Orlinda, believing she has been kidnapped along with the money. Realising it is Christmas Eve, Paulo helps Raymond find Orlinda at midnight mass. She confesses to stealing his money, but tells him she doesn't have it, as she owed money to a Mafia leader, Bichero. On leaving mass, Raymond sees Bichero handing out cash, and runs after Bichero's car, but is captured. Bichero is about to have him executed, but instead locks him in a safe and forces him to count Bichero's money.  On Christmas Day, Orlinda visits Raymond to give him a present. Raymond is still angry at the fact that she has ended him up in this situation. She tells him that she wished the money was only a small portion of what he owned and it wouldn't matter that she took it, and tells Raymond he's a "common [[criminal|crook]]". She tells Raymond not to give up hope. Raymond collects a large portion of the money and claims it is his. Orlinda then meets up with Paulo who takes his taxi and ties a rope to pull away at the bars of Raymond's prison.  Raymond decides he should return the money to the bank, as he still has enough time to get back to [[England]] and return the money to the vaults without anybody noticing it had gone. He quickly buys a ticket back to London and hires a taxi driver to rush him back to the bank. However, when he arrives, the police are all over the building. About to rush in and explain to the police inspector, he discovers that over the Christmas period, somebody tunnelled into the vault and swiped the remainder of the money. Confused and relieved, Raymond leaves the bank, intending to return to Rio. Catching a taxi, when a couple leave, he recognises them as his wife and Strothers who have evidently just returned from their holiday in [[Tenerife]]. He tells his wife he'll leave her the address of where he's living in Rio to send the [[divorce papers]], resigns from his job and goes back to Rio. He is next shown living with Orlinda and Paulo some years later with two babies and Bichero as his servant.

Yuri and her team visit the guardian monsters shrine where she finds a stone. Godzilla comes ashore to Magonote and attacks the Bonin Islands, leaving few survivors. Yuri returns to interview Isayama, and discovers that the souls of those who were killed by the Japanese in [[World War II]] are embedded within Godzilla, and wish to destroy Japan as punishment for people's attempts to [[Japanese history textbook controversies|forget]] [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese wartime atrocities]].  A few days later, Godzilla and Baragon battle in [[Hakone]]; Godzilla is victorious and Yuri is injured. When Takeda refuses to take her to Godzilla's location, Yuri leaves. Mothra's cocoon is soon immediately discovered in Lake Ikeda. The JSDF dispatch several fighter jets to fight Godzilla but are wiped out. Tachibana sets up a defense line in Yokohama. Mothra and a yet-to-be-grown Ghidorah awaken and fly towards Yokohama to fight Godzilla. The JSDF incapacitates Ghidorah and Mothra but fail to stop Godzilla.  Furious, Godzilla wipes out the defense line and later kills Mothra. Mothra's spirit merges with Ghidorah and transforms Ghidorah into the 3,000-year-old dragon King Ghidorah. King Ghidorah injures Godzilla and they fight underwater. Tachibana and his colleague join the fight using the Satsuma submarine. Tachibana attempts to shoot the D-03 into Godzilla's wound but fails Yuri and Takeda report the struggle from a bridge that later collapses from Godzilla's atomic breath.  The shrine stone falls from Takeda's pockets and merges with King Ghidorah's head. Yuri and Takeda barely survive the fall and swim to the shore while the monsters continue to fight. Godzilla destroys King Ghidorah, unleashing the spirits of the Guardian Monsters, which sink Godzilla down to the deep. After entering Godzilla's body through its mouth, Tachibana is able to use a D-03 missile on Godzilla's wound. Godzilla surfaces to confront Yuri and Takeda, but the D-03 wounds Godzilla. Godzilla attempts to kill Yuri and Takeda, only to sink once more beneath the water. Tachibana escapes from Godzilla as the monster disintegrates. Japan soon rejoices at their victory against Godzilla, but his disembodied heart is still beating on the ocean floor.

Gosford Park
  In November 1932, the wealthy industrialist Sir William McCordle  ([[Michael Gambon]]), his wife, Lady Sylvia McCordle ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]), and their daughter, Isobel ([[Camilla Rutherford]]), are to have a weekend shooting party at their country estate, Gosford Park. The guests are predominately their relations. When they arrive they enter through the front door and make small talk at tea, while their [[Domestic worker|help]] are directed by the head housekeeper, Mrs Wilson ([[Helen Mirren]]), to their room assignments. Mrs Wilson notices the valet Robert Parks ([[Clive Owen]]), who was raised in an orphanage. Parks takes an interest in lady's maid Mary MacEachran ([[Kelly Macdonald]]). The head housemaid, Elsie ([[Emily Watson]]), guides Mary through the gathering.  After supper, a silver carving knife is found to have gone missing. Lady Sylvia has an assignation with valet Henry Denton ([[Ryan Phillippe]]).    The next morning, the men go on a pheasant shoot, and a stray shot hits Sir William's ear. The ladies join the men for a shooting lunch where Commander Anthony Meredith ([[Tom Hollander]]) pleads with Sir William not to back out of a business scheme.  Before dinner, Constance, Countess of Trentham ([[Maggie Smith]]), is told by Lady Sylvia, while dressing for dinner that Sir William may stop her allowance. At dinner, Lady Sylvia states that Sir William was a [[First World War]] [[War profiteering|profiteer]]. Elsie blurts out her support for Sir William, referring to him as 'Bill'; the room goes silent and Elsie rushes from the room. Sir William abruptly leaves the dining room for the library where Mrs Wilson brings him coffee. He is annoyed; he knocks the coffee cup out of her hand and demands whiskey.  In the drawing room, actor [[Ivor Novello]] ([[Jeremy Northam]]) plays the piano to lighten the atmosphere. Sir William sits in the library slumped in his chair and someone wearing the trousers of a valet or butler stabs him. Louisa, Lady Stockbridge ([[Geraldine Somerville]]) goes to the library; her screams alarm the house.  Bumbling Inspector Thompson ([[Stephen Fry]]) and competent Constable Dexter (Ron Webster) arrive to investigate the murder. No-one is permitted to leave the house. Dexter calls attention to the lack of blood from the stab wound. Denton, the valet of American film producer Morris Weissman ([[Bob Balaban]]), confesses that he is in fact an actor researching a role for an upcoming film. Later, he again visits Lady Sylvia.   The following morning, staff gossip that Sir William was not only stabbed but also poisoned. The head cook, Mrs. Croft ([[Eileen Atkins]]) shares with the kitchen staff that Sir William was known for seducing the female workers in his factories. If a woman became pregnant, Sir William offered two choices: keep the baby and lose your job, or give the baby up and keep your job. Those who gave up their babies were told that the adoptions were being arranged with good families. In reality, Sir William paid orphanages to take the babies.  Later that night, Inspector Thompson releases the guests. He never interviews most of the staff.  Parks tells Mary that Sir William was his father, that a son can hate his father, and that he did not poison Sir William. Mary tells Parks that he did not kill Sir William because he was already dead and anyone should know if they stab a dead body. Parks says that he does not know and does not care if he killed Sir William.  The following morning, Lady Trentham and Lady Sylvia, in the presence of Mary, are talking about Mrs Croft and Mrs Wilson. Lady Sylvia says that Mrs Wilson was earlier known by the name Parks, Parker or Parkinson, which leads Mary to confront Mrs Wilson about her relationship to Parks. Mrs Wilson reveals to Mary that she and Mrs Croft are in fact sisters. She will never tell Parks that they are related: the mark of a good servant is anticipation, that it is not a crime to stab a dead man, and the important thing is that authorities can never touch Parks.  In private, Mrs Wilson grieves the loss of never knowing her son, and Mrs Croft tells her that he is alive and that is what matters.   The last guests, Lady Trentham and the Stockbridges, depart.  
The Gua Sha Treatment
 Grandfather Xu (Zhu Xu) comes from China to visit the family of his son, Datong Xu (Tony Leung), in St. Louis. While there, he gives his grandson, Dennis Xu (Dennis Zhu), a treatment of [[Gua Sha]] to treat a slight fever (being unable to read English labels of medicine).  [[Social work|Social workers]], however, mistake the harmless [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medical treatment]] for [[child abuse]] due to the obvious marks left on Dennis' back.  The life of the family is sent into turmoil when Dennis is taken away by the [[child protection]] agency. In court, the prosecution includes Datong's inclusion of a Chinese legendary character [[Sun Wukong]] (Chinese traditional: 孫悟空; simplified: 孙悟空) in his design of a violent video game. The prosecution implies that since Datong includes violence in his game, he values it. Datong,  who is furious, insists that the prosecution does not understand the cultural value of Sun Wukong<ref></ref><ref></ref> and that the icon's inclusion does not mean he abuses his son. He insists that what he does in his job does not relate to how he runs his home. Meanwhile, Grandfather Xu leaves America because he finds that the living environment is really not suitable for him, as he does not want to live in a place where a simple, harmless treatment like Gua Sha, which is so common in China, is treated as child abuse in America. Furthermore, he cannot converse in English. Datong's friend and lawyer, John Quilin (Hollis Houston), tries Gua Sha and proves that the treatment leaves painful-looking marks that are not actually painful or harmful at all.  Finally, Datong is able to return home and the family is reunited. This movie's story is meant to demonstrate the difference between western and Chinese culture.  
The Grey Zone
 The film opens in October 1944, in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[extermination camp]]. A small group of [[Sonderkommandos]], prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an [[insurrection]] that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four [[crematoria]] and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from [[Polish people|Polish]] citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the men’s camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely [[torture]]d, but they don't reveal the plot.  Meanwhile, a [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian-Jewish]] doctor, Miklós Nyiszli ([[Allan Corduner]]), who works for the [[Nazi]] scientist [[Josef Mengele]] in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the women’s [[labor camp]]. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengele’s orders will keep them from the gas chambers.  A new trainload of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about "delousing", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer ([[Daniel Benzali]]), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the children’s camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, [[SS]]-''[[Oberscharführer]]'' [[Eric Muhsfeldt]] (Keitel) suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics (Buscemi), is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl to scream and to be discovered. Nyiszli then takes Muhsfeldt outside and tells him about the uprising, but cannot tell him where or when it will begin. Muhsfeldt agrees to protect the young girl after the uprising is suppressed.  The insurrection begins, and Crematorium IV is destroyed with the smuggled explosives. All the Sonderkommandos who survive the explosions and gunfights with the SS are captured. They are held until the fire in the crematorium is extinguished, after which they are executed. Hoffmann and a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal (David Chandler), conclude that the girl will not be set free after she is forced to watch the executions. After all captives are shot, the girl is allowed to flee toward the main gate of the camp. Before she can run very far, Muhsfeldt draws his handgun and shoots her. The film closes with a voice-over recitation by the dead girl.  
Goodbye Charlie Bright
 Charlie drifts through life as he and his friends enjoy a lifestyle of [[House party|house parties]], casual sex and drugs. However, after breaking into a house to rob it, Charlie finds a gun (they found the keys and address in a handbag they had recently stolen). During the robbery, three of the friends (Charlie, Justin and Damien) accidentally awaken the owner, a hefty [[Jamaica]]n man who promptly chases them into the street with a golf club. The trio escape, much to the amusement of Justin and Damien. However, despite Charlie promising to tell Justin everything, he decides to keep the gun a secret.  Sometime later the story picks up Charlie and Justin as they walk through a disused car park. After looking in the window of a [[BMW]] it becomes clear that Julie, the girlfriend of Francis (Dyer), another member of 'The Firm', is having sex with "local nutter" Eddie ([[Phil Daniels]]), who is some 20 years older. By this time in the story it has become clear that Charlie is dissatisfied with his lifestyle and would prefer to try to make something of his life, unlike Justin, who would clearly prefer things to remain the same. This point is highlighted when the two attend a party being thrown by Charlie's cousin Hector Moriati (Richard Driscoll), with Charlie being offered a job as an [[estate agent]]. Hector eventually throws Justin out, and Hector in turn asks Charlie to stay (which he does not). On the way back home from the party, the pair begin to fight, Charlie clearly furious that Justin has ruined an opportunity for him to turn his life around. Charlie, as the narrator, informs the audience that from that point on 'Things could never be the same'.  The following day Charlie approaches Francis in the street and the pair head off to a [[boxing]] gym where Francis announces his intention to propose to Julie. Charlie tells Francis about Julie's affair with Eddie. Francis, in a tearful rage, walks out of the room and goes on the hunt for Eddie, baseball bat in hand. When Francis eventually finds Eddie he smashes the window of his BMW, provoking Eddie to run him down. Charlie then arrives as Francis lies [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] in the road. As Charlie waits in hospital he is visibly moved by an upset woman, presumably Francis's mother, and decides to take revenge on Eddie with the stolen pistol. After finding Eddie he loses his nerve, prompting Eddie to tell him to 'Fuck off out my house before you and I fall out'. After leaving, Charlie eventually shows the gun to Justin, who becomes very attached to it and suggests that they should kill Eddie.  Justin is later insulted by a child in the park and threatens him with the gun, going as far as pushing the barrel into the frightened boy's mouth. Horrified, Charlie snatches the gun from Justin and tells him he no longer wishes to be associated with him. A distressed Justin tries to make amends but Charlie refuses, instead giving him the gun as a farewell gift. Instantly Justin runs off, pursued by Charlie who has realised that Justin intends to use the weapon. Charlie catches up to Justin but only watches as Justin shoots Eddie in the leg (he survives the shot and is heard shouting afterwards) and the pair make their way to the top of a high rise building. The police arrive and Justin tells Charlie to leave or risk being arrested. Charlie seemingly forgives Justin and the two hug.  The final scene shows the pair going down different paths: Justin turning himself in to the police with a smile on his face and with a crowd cheering for him, and Charlie as he packs his bags and leaves. A child (who makes several appearances throughout the film) asks Charlie where he's going as he leaves; he simply replies "Somewhere".

Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive.  Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet [[evening gown]], awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's [[prefrontal cortex]], sautés it, and feeds it to him.  After the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She handcuffs his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later seen on a flight with his own boxed lunch, his bandaged arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what is assumed to be part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Lecter shares the brain with the boy, saying, "It's important to try new things."  
The Happiness of the Katakuris
 The Katakuris are a four-generation family of failures: patriarch Masao Katakuri (Kenji Sawada), his wife Terue (Keiko Matsuzaka), his father Jinpei (Tetsurō Tamba), his formerly criminal son Masayuki (Shinji Takeda), his divorced daughter Shizue (Naomi Nishida), her child Yurie (Tamaki Miyazaki, who narrates the film), and their dog, Pochi. The family uses the father's [[Layoff|redundancy pay]] to purchase a large old home situated on a former garbage dump near [[Mount Fuji]] that they have named the ‘White Lover's Inn'.  They have the intention of converting it into a [[bed & breakfast]], since the road running nearby is supposed to be expanded up to the house, which would bring many guests and tourists. However, the road hasn't been expanded yet and the Katakuris subsequently have no guests. When one finally shows up, a TV personality, sans clothes, he subsequently commits [[suicide]] during the night, and the Katakuris make the decision to save their business by burying the body and concealing the death. The second guest, a [[Sumo wrestler]], also dies of a heart attack during a tryst with his underage girlfriend, who also dies.  Somehow, each of their guests ends up dead—by suicide, accident or murder—and pretty soon the bodies in the back yard begin to pile up. The Katakuris soon find themselves sucked into a nightmare of lies and fear (not helped by the arrival of the daughter's con-man boyfriend, an escaped murderer with police in hot pursuit, and an erupting volcano).  Meanwhile, the recently divorced daughter falls in love with Richard Sagawa (Kiyoshiro Imawano),  a mysterious U.S. naval officer who looks suspiciously Japanese but claims to be the nephew of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] herself. Just when Richard bungles onto a clue that might lead him to uncover the string of disappearing guests, a nearby volcano begins rumbling to life.

Hardball (film)
 Conor O'Neill ([[Keanu Reeves]]) is a gambler who secretly bets $6,000 on his (dead) father's account and is now severely in debt with two bookies.  In order to repay the debts, he is told by a corporate friend that he must coach a [[baseball]] team of troubled fifth grade kids from Chicago's [[ABLA]] housing projects in exchange for $500 each week, for ten weeks.  Worried only about getting his $500 check, Conor shows up at the baseball field to a rag tag bunch of trash-talking, street-wise, inner city kids who live in the projects, where people have to sit on the floor in their apartments to avoid stray bullets.  Conor's efforts are hindered from the onset by the fact that he does not have nine kids to make up the team—one kid, having altered his birth certificate to be younger and another, "G-Baby" (DeWayne Warren), who is far too young to play.  The kids tell Conor it is because their teacher, Elizabeth "Sister" Wilkes (Diane Lane), is making several boys finish a book report.  Conor visits the teacher, but his life is threatened repeatedly by his bookies for not paying his gambling debts.  He is visited by the mother of three boys that are allowed to play in exchange for his tutoring them.  Conor works to get the team to support each other and stop trash-talking each other's bad plays; but the team nevertheless, loses its first game 16–1, which fosters hostility between the players.  Conor brings them together by buying them pizza (trading sports tickets for the pizza) and leads the team to win their second game 9–3.  The team starts to come together as Conor tries to kindle a romance with Wilkes.  Conor risks everything and makes a $12,000 bet with a new bookie to cover the $12,000 debt he owes to the other bookies.  His stress, already high from his gambling debts, runs higher at the baseball field because one of his players is pulled from playing after a competing coach questions the boy's age.  Conor takes offense to the league president's threat to be removed, after he voices his objection to his team having to wear ratty T-shirts while the other teams have full uniforms.  In protest, he announces it was his last game which draws dissension and resentment from his players.  Conor barely wins his $12,000 bet, pays off all his debts, and is pressured into making another bet for $24,000 using his $12,000 winnings.  Conor connects with the kids and finds it harder to leave than he thought it would. He surprises them with second row seats (behind [[Sammy Sosa]]'s dugout) to a major league game. He stops gambling; his relationship with Wilkes grows; he gets new uniforms for the players (sponsored by one of his bookies); and he assumes a fatherly role in leading the team to the championship game (called, "going to the ship" by the boys).  Just after Conor drops the kids at home after winning the pre-championship game, G-Baby is struck and killed by a stray bullet. Conor wants to forfeit the game, but G-Baby's older brother rallies the team together.

Heartbreakers (2001 film)
 Max and Page Conners ([[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) are a mother-daughter con artist team. When the film opens, the Conners are finishing a con on Dean Cumanno ([[Ray Liotta]]), an auto-body shop owner and small-time crook. The con, which the Conners have played many times before on other men, involves Max marrying Dean, passing out on their wedding night to avoid consummating the marriage, and then Page (posing as Dean's secretary) luring Dean into a compromising position to justify Max's immediate divorce and hefty settlement. The con is a success.  Page declares that she wants to go solo. Max initially relents, but when they go to the bank to split their earnings, they're confronted by an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] agent ([[Anne Bancroft]]) who declares that they owe the government a considerable sum on top of the rest of their savings, which have already been seized. Page reluctantly agrees to work one last con with Max in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], to get enough money to pay off the IRS and set Page up to work on her own. For their target, they choose widower William B. Tensy ([[Gene Hackman]]), a tobacco baron who is addicted to his own product.  While working the main con with Tensy, Page attempts a side con without her mother's knowledge. Page targets beachfront bartender Jack ([[Jason Lee (entertainer)|Jason Lee]]), who is worth $3 million,telling him that her name was Jane, but develops genuine feelings for him. Max learns of the side con and tells Page to break the relationship off, which Page does reluctantly.  Tensy proposes to Max ahead of schedule, but before they can get married, he accidentally chokes and dies while trying to initiate sex with Max. While Max and Page are deciding what to do with the body, Dean arrives, having tracked Max down to apologize and propose to her again. Dean figures out that Max and Page conned him, and threatens to call the authorities. Max offers to return Dean's divorce settlement money if he'll help them make Tensy's death look like an accident. Max tells Page that their money wasn't really taken by the IRS; the agent was Max's mentor, Barbara, who agreed to help prevent Page from leaving. However, when Max, Page and Dean go to the bank, the money really ''has'' gone, having been liquidated in an act of betrayal by Barbara.  In order to help Max, Page returns to Jack and accepts his proposal, planning to work it as a regular con. Page insists that Jack will not cheat on her, but is heartbroken when, on their wedding night, she breaks into her mother's room and finds him in a compromising position with Max. After the divorce settlement is paid, Dean confronts Max about the ethics of their con, pointing out that even a "goody-goody" like Jack is only human. Max reveals that Jack actually turned her down and that she had to drug him, but she defends her actions by saying that Jack would hurt Page eventually. Dean counters that Max has no right to keep Page from the man she loves because of what "might" happen.  Chastened, Max tells Page the truth, admitting that her efforts to protect her daughter have only hurt her in other ways. Page returns to Jack, giving him back the bar he'd had to sell to pay the settlement, and tells him her real name. Max and Dean also get together, Dean having admitted that he still loves Max despite what she put him through. The final shot of the film is of Dean &mdash; using the name 'Stanley' &mdash; romancing Barbara, with Max watching them via binoculars, implying that Max and Dean are now working together to get Max's money back from Barbara.  
Haunted Castle (2001 film)
 A young, aspiring American musician and singer named Johnny (played by Jasper Steverlinck, singer of [[Belgium|Belgian]] rock band [[Arid (band)|Arid]]) has been notified by a British law firm that his mother (voiced by Kyoko Baertsoen, leader of another Belgian band, [[Lunascape (Belgian band)|Lunascape]]), an aging rock star whom Johnny hasn't seen or heard from since he was 3 years old, has died in a helicopter accident. Johnny has been willed her castle and all of her property and money, but he must visit the actual estate, located in England, to claim these things. As he drives up to the castle, a lightning bolt hits a grave on the castle grounds, and a glowing sphere emerges.  As Johnny enters the building, he walks through a hall with several suits of armor. The suits come alive and begin attacking him when suddenly the light sphere appears and destroys them all, then a demonic entity beckons Johnny further into the castle. Johnny stumbles on a room of instruments levitating and playing on themselves, and then walks into a great hall with an orb embedded into the ground that begins projecting the image of Johnny's mother. (This segues into a rather lengthy musical number in which this holographic image (Baertsoen) sings an operatic number while the cameras circle around her. The song is named 'Lane Navachi' from [[Lunascape (band)|Lunascape]]'s album 'Reflecting Seylence').  Suddenly, a demonic face appears in the fire. It is the [[devil]] (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], and referred to as "Mr. D"), who explains to Johnny that his mother sold her soul for her fame. Part of the agreement was that the devil could "not touch" Johnny, but now that she has died, Mr. D offers Johnny a similar agreement. Johnny declines, but is enticed to explore the castle further. He enters a cathedral-like room, whose floor begins to descend. Soon, Johnny is in Hell proper. At this point, the film begins to take a very dark and gothic turn, as Johnny's tour guide, [[Mephistopheles|Mephisto]] (Mr. D's chief lieutenant, also voiced by Shearer), guides him through the sections of [[Hell]], where musicians, who have sold their souls, are violently tortured. Mephisto reveals that there was a time when luring people to Hell with fame in music was unsuccessful - until the invention of [[Rock and Roll]].  Johnny is taken on a roller coaster ride through Hell, but as he proceeds, the glowing sphere - revealed to be the spirit of his mother - appears before him time and time again, warning him of the danger awaiting him should he give in to the Devil's offer. Eventually, Johnny is sidetracked into a decrepit [[opera]] hall, where the worst of tortures are taking place. Mephisto reveals to Johnny that Mr. D once had a romance with an opera singer, who broke his heart, and now Mr. D has a particularly violent aversion for opera music.  Johnny eventually ends up back in front of Mr. D, who once again entices him to sign. Mephisto gives Johnny a guitar, and he considers the offer, then throws the guitar into the flames, and begins to sing '[[I Pagliacci|Recitar!...Vesti la Giubba]]' at the top of his lungs, sending the Devil into a frenzied tantrum which collapses the entire castle. As this occurs, the soul of Johnny's mother returns to its resting place once more.  The film jumps ahead six months later, and we see that Johnny is now a famous rock and roll star through his own talent. The last five minutes of the film features a performance by [[Arid (band)|Arid]], as the credits float by them in little bubbles burst by a floating demon.

   [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], professors of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], deliver an orphaned infant named [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] to his only remaining relatives, the Dursleys. Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys, inadvertently causing an accident during a family outing, and begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. Finally, Hagrid re-appears and Harry learns he is actually a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwarts, against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to Diagon Alley to buy his supplies for Hogwarts including a uniform, a wand and a pet owl named Hedwig (as a birthday present), Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry is the orphaned son of two wizards who met their demise at the hands of [[Lord Voldemort]], a malevolent, all-powerful wizard, by a [[Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses |Killing Curse]], with Harry being the only survivor in the chaos thus, leading to his fame in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived". Harry is then taken to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] to board a train to the school.  While on the train, Harry meets [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. He also encounters [[Draco Malfoy]], a spoiled child from a wealthy wizarding family, who eventually becomes Harry's biggest rival. At school, the students assemble in the Great Hall, where Harry and all the other first-year students are sorted by The Sorting Hat between four houses: [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Slytherin]]. Harry is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.  At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning wizardry and discovers more about his past and his parents. Harry is also recruited for Gryffindor's [[Quidditch]] team as a [[Seeker (Quidditch)|Seeker]], which is rare for first-year students. While exploring the school one night, Harry and his friends discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. They later find out Fluffy is guarding the [[Philosopher's Stone]], an item that can be used to grant its owner immortality. Harry suspects that potions teacher [[Severus Snape]] is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. The children learn from Hagrid that Fluffy will fall asleep if played with music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to try and find the stone before Snape does, but discover that Fluffy is already asleep. They get past Fluffy and face a series of safeguards, which include surviving a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and a dangerous life-sized game of [[chess]].  After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Professor Quirrell]] who was trying to claim the stone, and that Snape was protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort to be living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Professor Dumbledore, Harry finds himself in possession of the stone. Voldemort attempts to convince Harry to give him the stone by promising to bring his parents back from the dead.  When Harry refuses, Quirrell attacks, but Harry's touch burns Quirrell's skin and reduces him to dust, killing him. When Harry gets back up, Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and passes through Harry, knocking him unconscious.  Harry wakes up in the school's hospital wing with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are both fine. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell; when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. However, Neville Longbottom is awarded 10 points for attempting to stop his friends, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.

   ===Prologue===  Danny ([[Noah Taylor]]), enters the lounge of his Sydney flat late at night and discovers that his roommate Flip ([[Brett Stewart (actor)|Brett Stewart]]) has died in front of the TV holding a [[Falafel|felafel sandwich]].  ===House #47: Brisbane, Australia===  Nine months prior, Danny and Flip are sharing a house in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]], with housemates Taylor ([[Alex Menglet]]), Milo ([[Damian Walshe-Howling]]), Otis ([[Torquil Neilson]]), Sam ([[Emily Hamilton]]), Jabber ([[Haskel Daniel]]), and Derek ([[Robert Rimmer]]).

The next morning, Danny types out a horror story about masturbation and posts it to ''Penthouse''. While checking the mail, he is devastated to find an invitation to his ex-girlfriend's wedding. A young Japanese girl, Satomi ([[Sayuri Tanoue]]), who speaks little English, comes in, declaring, "I move in now." After Satomi produces a wad of cash, Sam offers to let her stay in a narrow storage closet in the screened veranda surrounding the house. Anya's party turns out to be a pagan ritual, and a drunk Milo gets tied to the pole of the washing line. Taylor also invites over a gang of [[skinheads]] to help confront the landlord's thugs. Milo escapes from the [[neopagan]]s as the skinheads start looting and vandalizing the house with chainsaws. Anya kisses Sam just as the skinheads manage to remove the entire back wall of the house.

Taylor checks the telephone directory for local prostitutes. Sam lies in bed with Danny and asks him to make love. Danny declines on the grounds that "we're mates." Danny is awakened in the middle of the night by loud music. He discovers Sam in the bath with her wrists cut. Danny comforts her, and she kisses him. In the morning, the two are awakened by two policemen ([[Tim Robertson]] and [[Robert Morgan (actor)|Robert Morgan]]), who drag in an unconscious Taylor and lecture Danny about morality. The policemen line up Danny, Sam, Flip, and Iain in the lounge to interrogate them. The cops threaten them, checking all their arms for heroin needle [[Drug injection|track marks]] and declares Flip a "pincushion." Danny asks Flip what's going on, but Flip reveals he has checked into a [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] bootcamp. The policemen reveal that Taylor had stolen Danny's credit card and charged over $8000 to it during a night of drunken mayhem. They also tell Danny that he owes more than $7,000 to the Brisbane landlord. Iain demands a lawyer and one of the cops draws his gun. Iain panics grabs for the gun, and gets shot in the ear. The cop warns Danny to be careful and Danny takes it as a threat, deciding to leave.  ===House #49: Sydney, Australia===  Three months later, Danny is living in a tidy flat in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] with housemates Nina ([[Sophie Lee]]), 'Uptight Ivan' ([[Ivan Tatarovic]]), Dirk ([[Francis McMahon]]), and Taylor.

An agent ([[Clayton Jacobson (director)|Clayton Jacobson]]) from a department store credit bureau arrives, looking for a "Mr. Corcoran." Danny shows the man a drawer full of collection letters addressed to Robert J. Corcoran. Anya arrives, and soon after, so does a policewoman, Sgt. P. O'Neill ([[Skye Wansey]]), also looking for Corcoran. Anya and Sam argue about their broken relationship, which quickly escalates into loud sex. Nina urges Danny to get rid of them. Danny tells Anya that he just wants to be left alone, but Anya begins kissing him passionately. Sam appears at the door and sees them. Sam begins angrily packing her things while Danny apologizes. Sam declares Anya a "chaos freak" and heads out the door.  The roommates all complain to themselves about their problems. Dirk enters to declare that he's gay, but is disappointed by the lack of reaction from the roommates, who had all assumed as much. Danny loses his temper with Dirk, urging Dirk to chill out, since he isn't the only one with problems. Danny then locks himself in his bedroom with a telephone sitting on his chest. Taylor slides food to him under the door. Several hours later, Anya slides a cigarette through, and, sitting on the other side of the door, tells Danny a story about lovers, the plot of [[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]. Danny takes the cigarette. Taylor discovers that ''Penthouse'' has published Danny's story. As Taylor gives Danny the good news, Flip arrives at the door, and reveals that he has left rehab. Sgt. O'Neill arrives with a partner ([[Simon Wheeler]]). She adds up the amount due in Corcoran's bills as $28,000, and issues a summons to Danny to appear in court.

O'Neill and identifies the now-deceased Flip as Robert J. Corcoran, and he and Sam set off down the street together.  
Heist (2001 film)
 Joe Moore ([[Gene Hackman]]) runs a ring of professional thieves, which includes Bobby Blane ([[Delroy Lindo]]), Don "Pinky" Pincus ([[Ricky Jay]]) and Joe's wife Fran ([[Rebecca Pidgeon]]). During a robbery of a [[New York City]] jewelry store, Joe's face is captured by a security camera after he takes off his mask in an attempt to distract the store's last remaining employee. As both the picture and a witness can identify him, Joe retires from crime and plans to disappear on his sail boat with his wife.  This does not sit well with Joe's fence, Mickey Bergman ([[Danny DeVito]]), who runs a garment business as a front. After accruing a number of expenses in setting up another robbery, Bergman decides to withhold the payment due to Joe and his crew. He insists they go through with the other job — robbing an airplane carrying a large shipment of gold. Bergman further insists that his nephew, Jimmy Silk ([[Sam Rockwell]]), be a part of the crew. Joe accepts, but a series of shifting loyalties changes the complexity of their task, including Jimmy's interest in Joe's wife and Bergman and Jimmy's belief that Joe's skills are declining.  They attempt to rob the plane twice. In their first attempt, while setting up explosive devices along the border of the airport, they are stopped by a passing officer. While Joe and Bobby talk the officer into leaving, an agitated Jimmy draws his gun but is stopped by Pinky. He forces his team out of finishing the job after he finds out that Pinky didn't destroy the getaway car, covered in the team's fingerprints. Bergman doesn't accept the team's departure and forces them to finish the job.  The plane robbery is a series of misdirects. Pinky poses as a guard while Joe, Bobby, and Jimmy pose as airport security personnel. They stop the jet, pretending to be responding to an emergency. They fill a van with what they take from the plane, then move the van to a rented garage on the airport grounds, where they re-brand it and call for a tow truck to have it hauled away.  Jimmy betrays the others to steal the gold and Fran. He knocks out Joe and tells Fran he knew Joe changed the plan, including Fran seducing him. He and Fran take the van, but Jimmy finds out that the hidden compartments are filled with metal washers. Joe avoids arrest and returns to the plane in disguise. He and Bobby remove a shipment of goods they had booked on board the same Swiss flight, which they insist now must be driven to its destination due to the plane's delay. Inside the shipment is the stolen gold, which Joe and Bobby melt into long rods.    Bergman apprehends Pinky, who is walking his niece to the school bus. Pinky discloses the plan in order to save his niece, though he is killed after. Bergman and his crew arrive at Joe's sail boat along with Jimmy and Fran, where they hold Joe at gunpoint. They assume that the boat's golden railings are the gold. Fran leaves with Jimmy, pleading with Bergman to let Joe go. Just as Bergman discovers that the railings are not the gold, a hidden Bobby opens fire. Bergman's men are killed and Joe kills Bergman.  Bobby gives Joe the address to send his share. Joe waits to meet Fran with a truck filled with black-painted rods. Fran has taken up with Jimmy for real and they take the truck from Joe at gunpoint. Joe gets into a second truck to leave. A black bar in the truck scrapes the garage door, revealing gold underneath. Joe lifts a tarp in the truck bed, revealing the gold rods. He covers the rods with the tarpaulin and drives away.  
Hearts in Atlantis (film)
 ''Hearts in Atlantis'' tells the story of Robert "Bobby" Garfield, a middle-aged man recollecting his past, in particular the summer when he was eleven years old. During that summer, he and his two friends, Carol Gerber and John "Sully" Sullivan, experienced many things together, the most mysterious of which was meeting an older gentleman named [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Ted Brautigan]].  Bobby lives with his single mother, the self-centered Liz Garfield, who takes in Brautigan as a boarder. Ted takes the lonely Bobby under his wing, while his mother is busy with her job — including entertaining her boss as a way of paying off debt supposedly left by Bobby's late father. The two form a paternal father-son bond, and it slowly becomes evident that Ted has some psychic and [[Telekinesis|telekinetic powers]]. These same powers are the reason that Brautigan has come to this sleepy town. In due course Ted entrusts Bobby with the knowledge that he has escaped the grasp of the "Low Men", strange people who would stop at nothing to get him back in their control.  After reading Bobby's mind and realizing that the boy dreams of owning a bicycle; Ted kindly offers Bobby $1 a week in exchange for his reading a newspaper out aloud. Bobby quickly figures out that Ted has some other purpose in mind. Mysteriously, Ted asks Bobby to keep an eye on the neighborhood looking for any signs of the "low men", like announcements about missing pets. Bobby sees one, but does not tell Ted, afraid to lose his new friend.  Bobby, Carol and John have frequent conflicts with the local town bully, Harry Doolin, whom Ted is able to scare away by looking into his mind and finding out that his violence is used to cover up the fact that he is secretly a [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresser]]. However, at one point, Harry hurts Carol, and when Ted manipulates her dislocated shoulder into place, Liz arrives, after being raped by her boss, and mistakenly believes that Ted is a [[Child molestation|child molester]]. She is confronted by Ted's ability to tell her the truth about what she has been through, and how her behavior is affecting her relationship with her son, providing another reason that Ted must leave. That and the "low men" are closing in on him.   Ted is eventually captured with the help of a tip from Liz. As some form of closure, Ted yells to Bobby as he is being driven away that he wouldn't have missed a moment "not for all the world", and later Bobby mirrors the same feelings. Bobby is later confronted by Harry but Bobby grabs the latter's baseball bat and beats him with it. Liz later finds a new job in Boston and moves the family there. Before he leaves, Bobby and Carol say their goodbyes and share a final kiss.  At the end of the film, a grown up Bobby (who has travelled back to attend Sully's funeral) meets a young girl named Molly, who turns out to be Carol's daughter. Bobby produces a picture of a young Carol (who died in recent years) and gives it to Molly to keep.  
Help! I'm a Fish
 The film follows the adventures of three children: a skateboarding mischief-maker named Fly, his sweet younger sister, Stella, and their cousin Chuck, a cautious, intelligent and overweight [[genetics]] prodigy. When their babysitter, Aunt Anna, falls asleep, the three children sneak off to go fishing only to stumble across the [[boathouse]] home of Professor MacKrill, an eccentric [[Marine biology|marine biologist]]. Reasoning that [[climate change]] could melt the [[polar icecap]]s within the next century, MacKrill has developed a potion that turns people into fish so they can survive the rising sea level and also an antidote to reverse the process. Unbeknownst to all, Stella drinks the potion mistaking it for lemonade, and painfully transformed into a [[starfish]] and gets tossed out of the window into the sea. Since Stella's transformation was caught on camera, the tragedy is immediately discovered, so Fly, Chuck and Professor MacKrill head out onto the ocean in a desperate search. When a storm blows in, Fly recognizes the futility of their search, drinks the potion and jumps overboard, becoming a "[[California flyingfish|Californian Flyfish]]". The boat capsizes and, because Chuck cannot swim, he's forced to drink the potion to survive, becoming a [[jellyfish]]. The Professor, the boat and all of its contents sink beneath the waves.  A Sand tiger shark and a [[pilot fish]] come across the leaking bottle of antidote and gain the human characteristics of speech by inhaling the liquid. Using his newfound gifts, the pilot fish, who now calls himself Joe, sets about creating an underwater civilization of intelligent fish. They take residence in a sunken [[oil tanker]] and begin to transform it into a monument. Fly, Chuck and Stella are reunited, along with a [[short-snouted seahorse|seahorse]] named Sasha, but are horrified to discover that the antidote has been lost. If they don't find it before tomorrow's sunset, they will stay fish forever. Some traveling fish tell them about Joe and his "magical potion". Thinking it must be the antidote they are looking for, the children travel to Joe's oil tanker empire. At the tanker, Fly attempts to steal and drink the bottle of antidote, but is warned by Chuck that if they turn back into humans this far beneath the ocean, they'll die. Intrigued by this, the villainous Joe has the children arrested and demands they manufacture more of the antidote or he'll have them eaten by the Shark.  Meanwhile, Fly and Stella's parents, Lisa and Bill, arrive home to find Aunt Anna frantic with worry. They find that Fly's fishing equipment is gone, so they head to the beach to search and come across Fly's roller blades instead. There, they meet Professor MacKrill who, having survived the storm, explains that their children have been turned into fish. Though the parents are skeptical at first, a showing of the video recording from earlier validates his story and causes Aunt Anna to faint. He and Bill head out to search for the children in a cobbled-together ship fitted with a large water pump.  The next morning, the children manage to escape with the help of Sasha. With no chance of going back to retrieve the bottle of antidote, they decide that their best hope is to find the ingredients to recreate the antidote themselves. Just as they complete the formula, they are found by Joe, the Shark and their army of crabs. During the standoff, Joe and the Shark get into a heated argument as Joe imbibes more of the potion, developing hands and growing in size. Taking this opportunity to escape, the children are stopped by the leader of the crabs who attacks Fly, striking him with his claw, then drinks the antidote himself, growing in size and developing hands and feet. Just as the new "King Crab" and his army are about to capture the children yet again, a tremendous underwater twister, generated by the Professor's water pump ship, sucks all the crabs (and the Shark, who eats the King Crab in the middle of the twister) to the surface. The Shark remains stuck in the tube.  Now alone, with Fly dying, and only twelve minutes until sundown, Chuck realizes their last hope is to make it back to the Professor's lab, where a whole jug of antidote is stored. Showing unexpected courage and determination, Chuck carries both Fly and Stella through the dangerous seawater intake pipes back to the lab. However, they are pursued by Joe, who overpowers them and steals the antidote. While Chuck fights off the Professor's escaped [[piranha]]s, Fly manages to catch up to the fleeing Joe as he escapes into a water intake pipe and tricks him into drinking enough antidote to become mostly human by asking him various questions on science. After drinking some of the antidote to answer the questions correctly, Joe becomes near-human, but he is no longer able to breathe underwater, thus, he drowns.  Fly drags the jug of antidote back to the lab and collapses. Chuck uncorks the jug just as Lisa and Aunt Anna open the door to the laboratory, causing everyone to get swept away. As the water drains away, Chuck and Stella have become human once more and are reunited with their parents. After a few tense moments in which a stuffed fish is mistaken for the limp body of Fly, the human Fly emerges from one of the lab's pipes (with a broken leg). Later on, while playing by the beach, Stella is reunited with Sasha, who is turned into an actual horse by the Professor and Chuck. We zoom out to see the beach with Stella riding Sasha in horse form as the film ends.  
The Heist (2001 film)
 After three thieves steal an [[Armored car (valuables)|armored truck]] and kidnap a witness, the abandoned building they use to transfer the cash to another vehicle happens to be the home of Moe, a penniless [[saxophone]] player, who is being visited by his small-time criminal brother Jack. While good-natured Moe only wants to save the hostage, Jack wants to steal some of the money in the truck for himself. Meanwhile, two of the thieves plan to betray the third, not knowing that he too has a plan of his own.  
Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)
 Hansel Schmidt is an [[East Germany|East German]] "slip of a girly boy" who loves rock music, and is stuck in East Berlin until he meets [[Sergeant]] Luther Robinson, an American soldier. Luther proposes marriage to Hansel. This plan will allow Hansel to leave communist East Germany for the capitalist [[West Germany|West]]. However, in order to be married, the couple must consist of a man and a woman and according to Luther, there will be "a full physical examination." Hansel's mother, Hedwig, gives her child her name and passport and finds a doctor to perform a [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change]]. The operation is botched, however, leaving Hansel – now Hedwig – with a dysfunctional one-inch mound of flesh between her legs, the [[eponym]]ous "Angry Inch".  Hedwig goes to live in [[Junction City, Kansas]] as Luther's wife. On their first wedding anniversary, Luther leaves Hedwig for a man. That same day, it is announced that the [[Berlin Wall]] has fallen and East Germans are flooding freely into the West, meaning as material gains go, Hedwig's sacrifices have been for nothing. Hedwig recovers from the separation by picking up some "odd jobs" and returning to her "first love" of music by forming a rock band composed of Korean-born Army wives. Babysitting for "the commander of the nearby fort," she befriends Tommy Speck — a shy and misunderstood teenager questioning his Christian upbringing. For six months, she teaches him "rock history, lyrics, grooming, and vocal training" taking him from playing the occasional guitar masses to the two of them "out-grossing monster trucks in Wichita." Hedwig gives him the stage name "Tommy Gnosis" (stating that ''[[Gnosis]]'' is the Greek word for "knowledge") for his graduation. Feeling her "inch," Tommy leaves her and goes on to become a wildly successful rock star by stealing the songs Hedwig wrote alone and with him during the time they collaborated.  The "internationally ignored" Hedwig and her band, the Angry Inch (now composed of Eastern Europeans including her husband, Yitzhak), are forced to support themselves by playing in a chain of failing seafood restaurants called Bilgewater's and other small venues. Hedwig is following Tommy's tour while pursuing a copyright lawsuit. In between songs, she reflects on her life story through flashbacks and stories told directly to either disinterested restaurant patrons or her small, but loyal group of fans.  Throughout the film, Hedwig refers to [[Aristophanes]]' speech in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''. This myth, retold by Hedwig in the song "[[The Origin of Love (song)|The Origin of Love]]", explains that human beings were once round, two-faced, four-armed, and four-legged beings. Angry gods split these early humans in two, leaving the separated people with a lifelong yearning for their other half.  Near the end of the film, Hedwig is down and out, her band and her manager having abandoned her in disgust after she tears up Yitzhak's passport. While working as a streetwalker, she finally reunites with Tommy and they reconcile. After the two of them accidentally drive Tommy's limo into a News truck, paparazzi burst onto the scene, Hedwig becomes famous and Gnosis' popularity tanks. Reunited with her band, Hedwig performs at [[Times Square]] Bilgewater's culminating in a violent removal of her drag.  Entering the final chapter of the film, it seems to take place in a non-real space, perhaps Hedwig's mind. Now in male form, Hedwig discovers herself alone in front of Tommy on a huge stage. He sings to her, pleading forgiveness and saying goodbye; she realizes that she created her "other half" from within herself. Hedwig then finds herself back at Times Square Bilgewater's, but the space seems transformed, with ambient white lighting. The band members, dressed all in white, are already in their places on stage. Hedwig gives Yitzhak her blonde wig and sings a song of triumph and solidarity with "all the misfits and losers" of the world. A brief animated sequence symbolizing the union of the separated Platonic halves leads to the final shot: Hedwig walking naked down a dark alley and into the street.

The idea is that the money will later be used to purchase a large amount of expensive medical equipment for the hospital where Shannon works as an overworked and underpaid nurse. Frances, a failing American actress who has resorted to doing voice acting for children's cartoons, wants the money so that she can get out of the rut she believes she is stuck in, and also because she wants a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] to replace her aging [[Pontiac Firebird]].

As the film progresses, the danger the women are in becomes more obvious, and just as it appears that they are out of their depth - Frances' car is blown up and Shannon is almost kidnapped - they successfully break into Mason's house and confront him and one of his gang. A mass shoot-out occurs after it becomes clear that the girls have stolen all of Mason's guns and have bagged all the money. They manage to get away in the gang members' [[Porsche Boxster]] with the [[bags of money]]. The hospital equipment is delivered to Shannon's hospital anonymously, as Shannon and Frances look on. They then drive off into London in the [[Mercedes CLK]] that they have bought with some of the money, happy that they have done the right thing.

The Hole (2001 film)
 Preparatory school student Liz resurfaces, disheveled and bloody, after disappearing 18 days prior along with her peers Mike, Geoff, and Geoff's girlfriend, Frankie. Liz is interviewed by a psychiatrist, Dr. Philippa Horwood. Liz recounts how her friend Martyn arranged for the four to spend the weekend in an abandoned underground [[Fallout shelter|nuclear fallout shelter]] to avoid a school field trip.   When Martyn fails to return for them, the four belatedly realize they are trapped, and begin to turn on one another. They discover hidden microphones in the shelter which were placed there by Martyn. Attempting to get Martyn's attention, Frankie pretends to be ill, while Mike and Liz feign hatred for one another; Martyn has had unrequited romantic feelings for her since their childhood. Liz claims they woke up one morning and found the hatch opened, allowing them all to finally escape.  Philippa is skeptical of Liz's story. Martyn is subsequently taken into police custody, where he tells an entirely different story: He claims Liz and Frankie orchestrated the scheme in order for Liz to get to know Mike better, and for Frankie to spend time with Geoff. Meanwhile, Liz returns home, where she experiences disturbing flashbacks about what happened. An enraged Martyn goes to visit Liz, believing she is framing him. She runs from him through the garden and approaches a [[weir]]. Martyn cries, and Liz hysterically says that she knew they would let him go because they could not prove anything.   At their next meeting, Liz tells Phillipa that she cannot remember what happened in the shelter. Phillipa decides to bring her there, hoping to invoke her memory. Once inside, Liz reveals the truth: She had locked herself and her friends inside in the hopes of winning Mike's affection, with whom she was obsessed. After discovering that both he and Geoff had slept with Frankie, she spontaneously decided to lock the door, isolating them and giving her the opportunity to become closer to him. Initially, the four had planned to drink and do drugs in the shelter, but the realization that they were unable to escape initiated group hysteria. After several days, Frankie died from side effects of her [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]].  Liz, Mike, and Geoff gradually ran out of food and water. When Mike discovered that Geoff was hoarding [[Coca-Cola]] in his backpack, he killed him in a fit of rage.

When Mike realized she had the key all along, he attempted to chase after her, but fell to his death from the ladder.   After Liz finishes recounting the story to Phillipa, Phillipa asks her to make an official statement corroborating Martyn's version of events; Liz refuses, having murdered Martyn when he visited her at her home the day prior. Police arrive at the shelter, and Liz begins screaming for help, pretending Phillipa was attempting to hurt her. Meanwhile, Martyn's corpse is fished out of the river; in his pocket, police find the key to the shelter, which implicates him in the events. The police attribute his death to suicide. Liz is allowed to go free. She leaves the shelter in the back of an ambulance, smiling at Phillipa from the window as it drives away.

The movie begins with pig butcher, Mr. Chu ([[Glen Chin]]) and his sons, Tiny ([[Leung Sze Ping]]) and Ming ([[Ho Sai Man]]) who are all obese.  Keung ([[Won You Nam]]), also a resident of the town, is preoccupied with [[internet porn]] which leads him to meet [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] prostitute Hung Hung ([[Zhou Xun]]), who advertises her services online and whom he pays for a night of torrid sex in the bushes outside Plaza Hollywood.    Hung Hung slowly infiltrates the lives of the town's characters, befriending Chu's family, especially Tiny.  She goes by the alternative name of Tong Tong.  At first, Tong Tong seems a refreshing, welcoming presence in the depressing, mundane life of Chu's family.  Nevertheless, after Tong Tong seduces Ming for sex, the light, almost happy dynamic of the movie begins to shift and Tong Tong's "sweet innocence" is replaced by an opportunistic bitterness.    Tong Tong disappears from the town and sends letters to Ming and Keung claiming [[statutory rape]] as she is allegedly under sixteen. She extorts them for money to avoid legal repercussions and jail. When Keung refuses payment he is chased down by [[gangster]]s and his hand hacked off and flung far away. In a sick twist of black humour, Tiny finds what he believes to be Keung's hand and a quack doctor re-attaches it, only to find that it is the wrong hand. Angered, Keung joins Ming and with machetes they run to Plaza Hollywood to hack down Tong Tong.  But by the time Tong Tong is long gone. In a fit of despair Keung commands Ming to cut his wrongly attached hand off.  In the end no one's story ends happily. Tong Tong however allegedly makes her way to the real Hollywood.

During her 20s, Lila decides to leave society and live within nature where she feels free to exist comfortably in her natural state. She writes a successful book about her naked, savage, happy, and free life in the woods embracing nature. Then, at age 30, strong sexual desire causes her to return to civilization and have her hair removed in order to find a partner.  The partner she finds is Dr. Nathan Bronfman, a psychologist researching the possibility of teaching table manners to mice. Lila and Nathan go hiking in the woods one day. Lila sights a naked man in the woods who has believed himself to be an ape his entire life. Lila discards her clothes and chases him until he's cornered on a tree branch. The man falls off the branch and fall unconscious as Nathan comes along. Nathan brings this man to his lab where the man is named Puff. This name is after his French research assistant, Gabrielle's ([[Miranda Otto]]) childhood dog. We discover later from her phone call to an unknown person that she is actually an American with a fake French accent. First with the help of Gabrielle and later with Lila’s help, Nathan performs extensive manner training on Puff, so that he can speak and go through the motions of appreciating high culture, though he still has difficulty controlling sexual urges.   To demonstrate his success, Nathan takes Puff on tour. Puff secretly drinks heavily and patronizes prostitutes. Meanwhile, Nathan and Lila's relationship deteriorates and Nathan has an affair with Gabrielle. Eventually Lila decides to take Puff back into the forest to undo his manner training and return him to his natural state.  Lila and Puff live naked in the woods together until Nathan finds them one day and Puff kills Nathan. Lila turns herself in as the murderer and asks Puff to testify on the waywardness of humanity before he returns to his home in the forest.  After the reporters and spectators leave, Puff comes back out of the forest and gets into a car with Gabrielle. They both drive off to get food (she still speaks with a French accent).  At the end of the film, there is a philosophical passage read while the credits appear. It is an excerpt of [[William of Ockham]] from ''Opera Theologica'' in which Ockham explains his theory of intuitive cognition.<ref>Opera Theologica p. 31.</ref> "Intuitive cognition is such that when some things are cognized, of which one inheres in the other, or one is spatially distant from the other, or exists in some relation to the other, immediately in virtue of that non-propositional cognition of those things, it is known if the thing inheres or does not inhere, if it is spatially distant or not, and the same for other true contingent propositions, unless that cognition is flawed or there is some impediment."  
How High
 Two underachieving [[Cannabis smoking|pot smokers]], Silas ([[Method Man]]) and Jamal ([[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]) are visited by the ghost of Silas's recent deceased friend Ivory (Chuck Davis). Ivory was cremated and Silas used his ashes as [[fertilizer]] for a new batch of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. While both are sitting in the parking lot before taking their "THC" (Testing for Higher Credentials, a parody of the [[SAT]] in allusion to [[Tetrahydrocannabinol]]) exams for college, neither is able to smoke his individual marijuana stash without the help of the other.  They soon discover that smoking Silas's new batch summons the ghost of the recently deceased Ivory, visible to just the two of them. Ivory tells them the test answers as they take the test and they both score perfect scores. Several dubious colleges offer the pair [[scholarship]]s, but none of them are appealing. Eventually, Chancellor Huntley ([[Fred Willard]]) suggests the two apply to [[Harvard University]].  Once there, they meet Bart (Chris Elwood), captain of the [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] team, his girlfriend Lauren ([[Lark Voorhies]]), I Need Money ([[Al Shearer]]), and their roommates Jeffrey (Justin Urich) & Tuan (Trieu Tran). Once they are settled in, they visit Dean Carl Cain ([[Obba Babatundé]]) who tells them that per the terms of their scholarship, they must maintain a minimum [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|grade point average]] of 2.0 in order to remain at Harvard, or else face [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]].  Jamal joins the rowing team hoping to outrank Bart. Silas enrolls in the [[botany]] class to develop his [[Marijuana|"herbal"]] skills. They both enroll in [[African-American history|black history]] together, although there are two other classes in which they have enrolled alone. Throughout the first half of the school year, they pass every test with the help of Ivory. Silas continues to woo and study with Lauren, while Jamal dates the [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. vice president]]'s daughter Jamie ([[Essence Atkins]]).  Also during the first half of the [[Academic term#Terminology|semester]], they pull pranks and steal, which angers Bart, Jeffrey (who is pledging for a [[Final Club]]), and Dean Cain. Things go downhill after Silas and Jamal's raucous [[Halloween]] party. At the party, Gerald ([[T. J. Thyne]]), the volunteer officer whose bicycle was stolen and crushed by I Need Money, steals and smokes the Ivory plant, leaving the pair without access to Ivory.  Silas begins working on a [[truth serum]] for his Botany class, using plant extracts. Silas concludes that, if his experiment works, he will earn an A in Botany, and a guarantee of a next semester. His experiment fails numerous times. Before [[Academic term|midterm]] [[Final examination|examinations]], Jamal suggests they go to a graveyard, dig up a "smart dead guy", and smoke his remains which they attempted to do so with John Quincy Adams; Silas suggests simply that they study hard for a few hours a day while [[Substance intoxication|high]]. They try Silas's plan, but it does not pan out, as they end up failing almost all of their midterm exams.  Desperate to stay in Harvard, they try Jamal's plan, but it proves fruitless, as well. Meanwhile, Gerald, who has morphed into a complete stoner, sees Ivory during one of his binges, and, at Ivory's behest, returns the remnants of the Ivory plant to Jamal and Silas. Due to Gerald's abuse of the plant very little remains and Jamal and Silas continue to fail their classes, which pleases Dean Cain.  With the last final exam approaching, Jamal and Silas resign themselves to give up. However, Jeffrey reminds Silas of his guarantee of another semester if he can successfully fix his truth serum experiment. Silas ultimately does, having found a solution in which the last of Ivory's leaves could be used to counteract nausea.  Nonetheless, because of their low grades, Jamal and Silas do not receive an invitation to the Harvard [[Alumnus|Alumni]] party. Dean Cain, clearly thrilled with this result, tells Bart he does not have to worry about the pair showing up or staying in Harvard. However, that changes when Jamie invites them both as her dates, as her father is an alumnus. At the party, Silas makes things a bit more interesting by testing out his truth serum experiment, which proves successful.  At Lauren's presentation at the alumni party of Benjamin Franklin's artifacts, she shocks everyone with her discovery: the artifacts turn out to be a [[bong]]. Dean Cain is outraged by this finding, but the Chancellor decides that he has had it with the Dean and fires him. Jamal and Silas are proud that the serum worked, a celebration that was almost short-lived, as Dean Cain returns and unsuccessfully attempts to kill them both. He is eventually apprehended by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. At the end, Jamal and Silas are able to stay, Jamal and Jamie get approval of Jamie's father to date, and Lauren leaves Bart for Silas because Bart "can't satisfy her".  
How to Make a Monster (2001 film)
 When a test group says the company's latest [[video game]], ''Evilution'', is too boring, the game's development team is fired. Businessman Peter Drummond hires three new programmers: A weapons expert named Hardcore, a [[game artificial intelligence]] designer named Sol, and a sound effects creator named Bug. Faye Clayton promises $1 million to the programmer who makes the game the "scariest", igniting a fierce rivalry between the trio. During a storm three weeks later, [[lightning]] strikes the building and causes all of the computers and electronic equipment to go offline. After a meeting with Drummond, the three programmers decide to try out the game with the help of Clayton Software intern Laura Wheeler. The game involves a motion capture suit that is connected to the computer network and used to program the game's movements. Peter places a backup CD into the external drive while the others set up. Bug, Hardcore, and Sol soon lose the game, and are surprised to see Laura get all the way to the [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]].  Sol inserts his new AI chip into the mainframe and begins to play the game. As he advances to the game's third level, the motion capture suit connected to the computer network comes alive. Simultaneously, the suit attacks Sol in real life while an in-game monster drags Sol's video game character away. The following morning, Bug and Hardcore discover that Sol has been killed and the backup CD has been stolen. Hardcore attempts to review the security camera tapes with his PDA, but accidentally touches the motion capture suit, which has merged itself with Sol's dead body. The suit attacks Hardcore; although he initially manages to fight it off, he is later killed. The suit then merges itself with Hardcore's muscular body and takes all of his weapons, giving it a striking resemblance to the monster in the game. Bug theorizes that the lighting strike combined with Sol's powerful AI chip has caused the suit to believe the real world is part of the video game. Bug, Laura and Drummond decide to pull the computer's plug, although doing so will likely erase all of the game's data.  While Bug tries to figure out which set of wires to pull, Drummond is attacked by the monster in Hardcore's body. With Bug's help, Drummond manages to escape, but the security system malfunctions, seals all exits, and leaves Laura, Bug, and Drummond in near darkness. Bug travels through ceiling shafts and falls into the kitchen area, where he is attacked by the monster. As the monster draws closer, Bug exposes a gas line and lights his lighter, killing both himself and the monster. The monster returns to the motion-capture suit and attacks Drummond, but Laura saves him by virtually fighting the in-game monster. Laura later tries to beat the game but becomes frustrated and hysterical. Drummond suggests that she try a [[virtual reality]] headset, promising to stay with her while she fights. However, in the midst of the game, Laura realizes Drummond has left her. The monster appears and, in the real world, Laura escapes to the kitchen. There she finds a [[PDA]] displaying a video of Drummond stealing the game's backup CD the night of Sol's death; had Drummond not stolen it, the CD would have allowed the programmers to reverse compile the game and shut down the monster. Laura finds and confronts Drummond at gun point, forcing him to drop the CD. Drummond makes a speech stating that everyone is ultimately a monster. Laura shoots him in the knee and allows the monster to kill him. Laura then dons the VR headset and gloves, acquires a sword, and simultaneously battles the monster in both the real and virtual world. In the real world, she lures the suit toward a fish tank and electrocutes it with the water inside. She then stabs the monster with her sword, finally killing the monster.  With everyone else who made the game dead, Laura turns in the final version of the game and demands the million dollar bonus for herself.  The whole event has changed her, making her more jaded and world weary.  The video game finally impresses the game testers. Laura uses the game's success to become the new ruthless [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the company, which is renamed Wheeler Software.

I Love the Sound of the Kalachnikov It Reminds Me of Tchaikovsky
 An autobiographical documentary film that goes beyond the barriers of the genre and is something between videoart, experimental film and home video and seeks to throw light on the consequences of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, which forced the director´s family to emigrate to France. In the spirit of [[Bertolt Brecht]]´s theory of art and distanciation, Khazarian frees himself from reality, combining in the film amateur films about his own family and contemporary footage from the battlefield in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. His film is not a recapitulation of historical fact, but rather a visual meditation on the fetishist aesthetics of war, diverse sexual orientations and the consequences of emigration. The film deals with topics such as war, destruction and sexuality, which, in the director´s view are indissolubly linked.  
Ichi the Killer (film)
  In a flashback, Ichi masturbates on an apartment balcony while watching a [[pimp]] assault a [[prostitute]] within.   Off-camera, sadistic crime underboss Anjo is brutally murdered. An expert cleaning crew run by Jijii ([[Shinya Tsukamoto]]) immediately removes any trace of Anjo's remains, and credits Ichi for the kill. Later, Kakihara ([[Tadanobu Asano]]), Anjo's [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] enforcer, and other crime lords visit the spotless apartment, concluding that Anjo fled town with the prostitute and [[yen|¥]]3 million of the gang's money.   Kakihara visits an underworld night club with other gang members. He tells Anjo's girlfriend, an English-speaking Chinese prostitute named Karen ([[Alien Sun]]) that Anjo must still be alive, though perhaps kidnapped by a rival gang. He also greets Jijii and the cleaning crew at another table, unaware they were in town, and asking them to contact him if they learn anything of Anjo's status.   Jijii feeds Kakihara rumors suggesting that Suzuki ([[Susumu Terajima]]), a member of the rival Funaki clan, has kidnapped Anjo. Kakihara captures Suzuki and tortures him with [[Suspension (body modification)|suspension]] and [[Body piercing|piercing]], but when Suzuki turns out to be innocent, Kakihara [[yubitsume|slices off the end of his own tongue]] and offers it to Suzuki's boss (Jun Kunimura) as penance.  Kakihara and gang members raid a hotel room and capture Kano, a drug-addled member of the cleaning crew. Kano has had facial plastic surgery since Kakihara last saw him, but admits his identity and past acquaintance with Kakihara when he believes he will be killed. He reveals that although he helped clean up the murder scene, it was Ichi who killed Anjo, and Kakihara has now been targeted.   Returning to the opening flashback, Ichi is stepping in from the balcony to kill the pimp brutalizing Sailor, a prostitute whom Ichi patronizes. Afterwards, he tells her that he will be the one beating her up now. When Sailor assaults him, Ichi reflexively kills her as well.   At Suzuki's prompting, Kakihara is kicked out of the [[organized crime|syndicate]], but the entire Anjo gang defects with him. Suzuki then promises Jijii a million yen to 'squash' Kakihara. Jijii, it is revealed, is secretly orchestrating events in order to pit ''[[yakuza]]'' clans against one another, with the help of Ichi. Though a normally unassuming and cowardly young man, Ichi becomes [[homicidal]] and sexually aroused when enraged. Jijii is able to manipulate Ichi's weak personality by implanting several false memories &mdash; a [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] rape in particular &mdash; and uses the unstable Ichi as an assassin.  While bicycling in the evening, Ichi assaults one of three boys bullying a fourth named Takeshi. Takeshi is the son of Kaneko, one of Kakihara's henchmen. Jijii incites Ichi to enter an apartment containing several criminals of the old Anjo gang, and slaughter them all. Afterward Ichi sees Takeshi, who thanks him for the earlier protection. Kaneko finds a brothel-keeper assaulting Ichi in an alley and, remembering his own long-ago rescue by a member of the Anjo gang, helps Ichi out.  Kakihara enlists the help of [[Police corruption|corrupt]] twin police [[detective]]s, Jirō and Saburō ([[Suzuki Matsuo]]), to find Myu-Myu, a prostitute connected with Ryu Long, a member of Jijii's gang. When Jirō fails to get information from her through torture, Saburō sniffs her body to get Long's scent and tracks him down. Though Long outruns the brothers, Kakihara captures him and with the twins tortures him for leads to Jijii.  To turn Ichi into a complete killer, Jijii has Karen, Anjo's woman and Jijii's friend, seduce Ichi by pretending to be the woman in his false memory. When Ichi becomes confused by Karen's claims that she desired for him to rape her, he kills her. Jijii calls Kakihara to let him know Ichi is coming to kill him but is spotted by one of Kakihara's men, Jiji is caught and held at gunpoint but Jiji disarms him and grotesquely breaks his body.  Kaneko, Kakihara and Ichi chase each other to a rooftop. Due to Jijii's [[psychological manipulation]], Ichi believes that Kaneko is his brother and confronts him. Kaneko shoots the side of Ichi's leg, causing Ichi to slit Kaneko's throat in front of Takeshi. Takeshi attacks Ichi as he lies on the roof begging for forgiveness. Kakihara realizes Ichi cannot hurt him and inserts skewers into his ears to drown out Ichi's cries. Suddenly he sees that Ichi has chopped off Takeshi's head. Ichi charges Kakihara, embedding one of his razor-bladed boots in the center of his head. Kakihara falls from the roof to his death. However, when Jijii finds him, Kakihara has no wound in his head; he hallucinated Ichi's attack as he jumped to his death while Ichi cried.  Years later, Jijii's corpse hangs from a tree in a park. A young man resembling an older Takeshi leaves the park with a group of schoolchildren.

In Praise of Love (film)
 The first half of the film, shot on black and white film, follows a man named Edgar who is working on an undefined "project" about what he considers the four stages of love: meeting, physical passion, separation, and reconciliation, involving people at three different stages of life: youth, adulthood, and old age. Edgar keeps flipping through the pages of an empty book, staring intently as if waiting for words to appear. He is unsure whether the project should be a novel, a play, an opera, or a film. In Paris, he interviews potential participants from all walks of life (including those people [[Victor Hugo]] dubbed [[les misérables]], whom Edgar considers important to the project), but is continually dissatisfied. The person Edgar really wants is someone he met two years ago, a woman who "dared speak her mind." At the urging of his financial backer Mr. Rosenthal, an art dealer whose father once owned a gallery with Edgar's grandfather, Edgar tracks down the woman, named Berthe, where she is working at night cleaning passenger cars at a railroad depot. Berthe remembers Edgar (and marvels at his memory) but emphatically does not want to be involved in his project. She holds down several jobs and also cares for her three-year-old son. Edgar continues to interview people, to his continuing dissatisfaction. He is able to visualize the stages of youth and old age but keeps having trouble with adulthood.  Edgar runs into Berthe at a lecture at a Parisian bookstore by expatriate American journalist Mark Hunter about the [[Kosovo War]]. Edgar makes it a point to tell Berthe that Hunter is an example of a "good American." Afterwards, the two wander the city of signs and monuments, talking through the night and into the next day, eventually stopping at an abandoned Renault plant, where they contemplate the collapse of the workers movement. They part company, and later Berthe speaks with Edgar over the phone; they talk about when they first met and she questions him as to why he has stopped talking about his project. They end the conversation with an air of finality. Edgar visits a homeless shelter and selects a man sleeping in one of the beds. In a tender but brief moment, Edgar directs two young people, to whom he had earlier assigned the roles of [[Perceval]] and his love Eglantine, to bathe the man in a shower. Mr. Rosenthal is there to witness the scene, but the status of "the project" is unclear. In the final scene of the black and white section, Edgar goes to meet a man who has some news for him about Berthe.  The second section of the film is shot in video with over-saturated color. An intertitle announces that it is two years earlier. Edgar arrives in Brittany and is met by the same man he has just seen at the end of part one. The man, a minister of culture for the area, is there to take Edgar to meet [[Jean Lacouture]], whom Edgar proceeds to interview about the role of Catholics in the [[French Resistance]], in connection with a cantata he is writing for [[Simone Weil]]. This encounter leads Edgar to meet an elderly couple who fought in the Resistance and have been together ever since. The couple is meeting with delegates from the American state department who are helping to broker a deal on behalf of "Spielberg Associates." The company wants to purchase the rights to the couple's story for a film written by [[William Styron]] and starring [[Juliette Binoche]]. The couple's granddaughter, in training to be a lawyer, is attempting to get them out of the contract, as they are afraid they have been shortchanged. The granddaughter is Berthe, and this is when she and Edgar first meet. Berthe attempts to nullify the contract by arguing that the signatories are not members of a defined nation, referring to themselves simply as "Americans," when "America" is a term that encompasses two continents with many countries – but it is a futile effort.  After spending time with Berthe, Edgar takes the train back to Paris, and reflects on his encounters. When you think of something ("de quelque chose"), he muses, you are always thinking of something else. If you see a landscape that is new to you, for example, you are comparing it to a landscape you already know. What Edgar cannot know is what awaits him in the future, about which he is informed at the end of the first part of the film – that Berthe commits suicide.  
I Wish I Had a Wife
 Bong-soo (Sol Kyung-Gu) has been working as manager of a small bank in an apartment complex for three years. During his three years there, 23 years if you count his school days, Bong-soo has never been late. However, he purposely decides to skip work one day. There is only one reason. Inside a subway train that has suddenly stopped on his way to work, everyone around him reaches for their cell phones to call someone. At that moment, he realized that he does not have a single person to call. He does not know that inside the educational center across the street from the bank where he works, a 27-year-old woman Won-ju (Jeon Do-Yeon) is looking over to him, nourishing a small love. Bong-soo and Won-ju run into each other every day, at the Ramen restaurant, at the bank, at the bus station.  All kinds of trivial incidents occur but Bong-soo still does not truly recognize Won-ju's presence. One day, while looking over the bank's CCTV tapes, Bong-soo discovers someone pitifully calling out his name to the small, closed-circuit camera that does not even record sound.  
I.K.U.
 The film is set in or about the year 2030. The [[multinational corporation|multinational]] Genom Corporation is developing a product called the "I.K.U. Chip", which is plugged into a portable device allowing consumers to download and experience orgasms from the I.K.U. server without need of physical contact. The corporation sends their cybernetic shapeshifter Reiko, known as an I.K.U. Coder or [[replicant]], to collect orgasm-related information catering to various [[sexual orientation]]s.

Ice Planet (film)
 The movie takes place some thirty years after a devastating war between the Union and the Consortium that resulted in the death of 10% of the Earth's population. The Newton 5 space colony is suddenly attacked by a vast extraterrestrial spacecraft, killing 200,000 people in the process. The alien spaceship then proceeds to annihilate a military base on [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].  Base commander Noah Trager, aided by recently graduated space cadets, manages to escape to the nearby ''Magellan'' research vessel commanded by professor Karteez Rumla. Rumla (encouraged by Senator Jeremy Uvan who was on the military base) insists that the ''Magellan'' continue its original classified mission rather than return to Earth. Pursued by the alien spaceship, the refugees head toward section 9 in space—the ''Magellan'''s original destination—when the research vessel suddenly is ejected into hyperspace by an unknown space phenomenon. After traveling through interstellar space, the vessel is drawn towards an unidentified [[ice planet]] where it lands automatically in a crater. The planet has a breathable atmosphere and earth-like gravity, but an unknown force field keeps the ''Magellan'' and the 1426 refugees on board trapped on the surface. The planet's orbit is also highly unusual, resembling that of a spacecraft rather than a planet. It is located so far from Earth even the [[Andromeda galaxy]] is not visible in the sky. The ''Magellan'' is stranded and its crew has to cope with the fact that returning to Earth is impossible.  Rumla now reveals to the astonished crew that six years previously, a [[meteor]] crashed into a remote area of [[Sumatra]]. The meteor contained an extremely old and heat resistant [[crystal]], named "ICE-13" by Earth scientists who discover an encryption in the crystallized structure itself. Rumla managed to crack the code and discovered that it contained specifications for the construction of an advanced space vessel. The crystal contains space coordinates to sector 9 as well as dire warnings about some undefined threat in space, so a decision was made to build the ''Magellan'' and discover the source of the meteor. The mission was kept secret from the public although the Union leadership was informed about the threat.  The ''Magellan'' crew soon starts to explore their immediate surroundings. A ground survey team discovers a vast subterranean energy network with a power source located some 500 kilometers from the ship. Meanwhile, in orbit around the icy planet, two reconnaissance craft launched by the ''Magellan'' are attacked and destroyed by the same enormous alien spacecraft that destroyed Newton 5 and the Io military base. One pilot manages to eject, and the ''Magellan'' rescue team trying to locate him discovers an artificial cavern where the power source is located. A [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]-like tribe called the "Inaku" also lives there and it is not clear how they ended up billions of light years away from Earth. Finally, a strange glowing tree-like crystalline organism is discovered, and analysis of a small sample of its tissue reveals vast amounts of encoded information about Earth civilization including dozens of extinct languages including [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].  Back on the ''Magellan'', a hostile life form suddenly invades the vessel and kidnaps a dozen people. It is revealed that the icy planet serves as a safe haven to an alien intelligence, but they have now been discovered by the "Zedoni" who launched the vast spaceship that also attacked the Newton 5 colony. The alien refugees deliberately transported the ''Magellan'' across space and time for some unknown purpose. The aliens show a vision of the Earth burnt to a cinder, but it is not clear if we see the present or the future ("you must play your part", offers the alien).  As the alien attack on the ''Magellan'' resulted in a kidnapping of a dozen people, the military launches a counterattack as the alien intelligence on the planet weakens the attacking Zedoni ship's defences. The movie ends as the ice planet is transported through another space rift into a different solar system having four moons—the same moons previously seen in a vision by Professor Rumla.

In the Bedroom
 The film is set in the Mid-Coast town of [[Camden, Maine]]. Matt ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) and Ruth Fowler ([[Sissy Spacek]]) enjoy a happy marriage and a good relationship with their son Frank ([[Nick Stahl]]), a recent college graduate who has come home for the summer. Frank has fallen in love with an older woman with children, Natalie Strout ([[Marisa Tomei]]).  Frank is about to begin post graduate school for architecture, but is having second thoughts and considering staying in town to continue working as a fisherman and, more important, to be near Natalie. Natalie's ex-husband, Richard Strout ([[William Mapother]]), tries to find a way into his ex-wife and children's lives, going to increasingly violent lengths to get his intentions across to Natalie. Ruth is openly concerned about Frank's relationship with Natalie, while Matt thinks it is only a fling.  Midway through the film, Richard kills Frank during a confrontation at Natalie's house following a domestic dispute. Though equally devastated, Matt and Ruth grieve in different ways, with Matt putting on a brave face while Ruth becomes reclusive and quiet. Richard is set free on bail, paid by his well-to-do family, and both Matt and Ruth are forced to see Richard around town.  The tension between Matt and Ruth increases when they learn that the lack of an eyewitness to Frank's shooting means Richard will instead be charged with accidental manslaughter. An argument erupts between the couple in which each one confronts the other. With the air cleared, the couple is finally able to find common ground in their grief.  Matt then abducts and kills Richard. He and a friend bury the body on the friend's wooded property. Matt returns home to Ruth, who is awake and smoking in bed. She asks him, "Did you do it?" Matt appears troubled and unresponsive. He climbs into bed and then turns away from her. Finally, Ruth gets up to make coffee. Matt rolls over onto his back and pulls a band-aid from a finger he injured hauling traps. Ruth calls from the kitchen, "Matt, do you want coffee?" Matt doesn't answer.  
In the Time of the Butterflies (film)
 The film begins with pictures and video of the actual victims of Trujillo. During the montage, a title card appears that says:  :''From 1930 to 1961, General Rafael Leónidas Trujillo held absolute control of the Dominican Republic''. :''His secret alliance with the church, aristocrats, intellectuals and the press were the foundation of his dictatorship''. :''His formula to remain in power was simple: murder anyone who opposed him''. :''More than 30,000 people were executed during his regime of terror...''  The scene shifts to a prison cell, where one of his victims, Minerva Mirabal (Salma Hayek), recounts the events of the story.  Minerva and her three sisters, Patria ([[Lumi Cavazos]]), Dedé ([[Pilar Padilla]]), and María Teresa "Mate" ([[Mía Maestro]]), live on a farm in rural [[Salcedo, Hermanas Mirabal|Ojo De Agua]]. Minerva, the outspoken sister, convinces her father, Enrique Mirabal (Fernando Becerril), to send her, Patria, and Mate to a boarding school. The sisters spend five years away at school, during which time Minerva captures the attention of Trujillo (Edward James Olmos), who notices her at a school play.  When school is over, Minerva wishes to study to become a [[lawyer]], but women are not allowed in law school. The sisters return to the farm, and Minerva soon meets and falls in love with Virgilio "Lio" ([[Marc Anthony]]), a member of the Dominican resistance, who gives her the nickname "Butterfly", or Mariposa in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Lio's activities during a college protest are noticed, and he is forced to leave the country out of fear for his life, though he continues to write to Minerva.  Minerva, along with her family, is invited to a formal ball at Trujillo's palace, where she dances with him. During their dance, Minerva asks for permission to attend law school, but Trujillo declines. He grabs Minerva inappropriately, and she responds by recoiling and slapping him in the face. Her family quickly rushes to her side, and Trujillo allows them to leave. The next day, the chief of police, Captain Peña ([[Pedro Armendáriz, Jr.]]), arrives at the family farm and takes Minerva's father away. The sisters spend several weeks dealing with the police bureaucracy, trying to locate their father, before it's suggested that there is a way Minerva can get her father out of prison. Minerva goes to the palace, and Trujillo suggests that her father can leave if she stays. Minerva points out that her mother is waiting outside and would "appreciate his hospitality" too. Trujillo decides that they should leave it to chance (a [[dice]] roll) to determine if Minerva and her family go free, or if Minerva stays at the palace while her family is released. Minerva accepts, but asks to "up the stakes"—if she wins, she goes free and also gets to attend law school, and if she loses, Trujillo can "have his wish". She rolls the dice and wins, and Trujillo lets her leave.  Minerva's victory is hollow. Her father is released from prison, but has been [[torture]]d and soon dies. While attending his funeral, the police chief delivers to Minerva a letter permitting her to attend law school. Minerva's hatred of Trujillo is intense, but she decides to accept his "gift" because she views it as her only way to effectively oppose him.  While in law school, Minerva discovers that Lio has been killed by Trujillo supporters even though he was out of the country. She meets other members of the resistance, who, through Lio, know of her as "Butterfly". She becomes a member of the resistance, and over time Patria and Mate learn of her activities and become involved too. She falls in love with Manolo Tavárez ([[Demian Bichir]]), a fellow law student and member of the resistance, and they are married.  When Minerva graduates from law school, Trujillo is present to pass out the diplomas. All the other students receive diplomas, but he refuses to give Minerva hers, saying he agreed to allow her to attend law school, not to practice law.  After law school, Minerva has children but continues her resistance activities. After a series of increasingly dangerous events, she, Mate, and many resistance members are arrested and sent to jail. Minerva becomes a symbol, and many prisoners, guards, and outsiders secretly voice their support for "the Butterflies".  Eventually, Minerva and Mate are released from jail, but their husbands and Patria's are still held captive. The women continue their efforts to locate their husbands. Trujillo stops by to visit Minerva at her home, and she asks for his help to get their husbands released. Trujillo vows to help Minerva "end her troubles".  While returning from a trip to visit their husbands, Minerva, Patria, and Mate are stopped on the road by a large group of Trujillo's men. They are taken some distance off the main road, and the men surround them and beat them to death.  Another title card appears at the end that says:  :''The Death of the Mirabal Sisters was the final blow to the regime of Leónidas Trujillo, who was assassinated six months later''. :''Several of the children of the Mirabal sisters held important posts in the later democratic governments of the Dominican Republic''. :''The day of the sisters' death, November 25th, is observed in many [[Latin American]] countries as the International Day Against Violence Towards Women''.

Invincible (2001 drama film)
 Zishe Breitbart ([[Jouko Ahola]]) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural [[Poland]]. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labour all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish [[shtetl]] home and convinces him to move to [[Berlin]], where he can find work as a strongman.  Hanussen (an allusion to the real-life figure [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], played by [[Tim Roth]]), an epic [[con-man]] and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a [[Northern Europe|Nordic]] helmet and calls him "[[Sigurd|Siegfried]]" so as to identify him with the [[Aryan]] notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely [[Nazi]] clientele, and he is a big hit.  This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin.  Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis.  Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed.    A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an "Aryan", and calls himself a new Jewish [[Samson]]. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power.  Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of [[Hitler]]'s future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of [[Himmler]] and [[Goebbels]]. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the [[Brownshirts]]. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the [[Holocaust]] and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people of its coming. Unfortunately, no one believes him and he accidentally dies from an infected wound, according to the final titles, two days before Hitler takes power in 1933. In the final scene he is in a delirium as a result of the infection. In a dreamscape surrounded by [[Christmas Island red crab]]s, he has a vision of his younger brother Benjamin flying safely away from the looming Holocaust.

The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells
 Each episode adapts — and sometimes quite radically changes — two of Wells's short stories. The first episode adapts "[[The New Accelerator]]" and "[[The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper]]." The second episode adapts "[[The Crystal Egg]]" and "The Remarkable Case of Davidson's Eyes," and the third, "[[The Truth About Pyecraft]]" and "The Stolen Bacillus". Each episode is written as if it were a "real" incident that Wells had investigated with his girlfriend, Jane Robbins, and as if it had served as an inspiration for a short story.  Each short story adaptation is presented as a flashback to 1893 within a [[frame story]] set in 1946, near to the end of Wells's life, when he is interviewed by members of a secret military research institute interested in his past exploits.  
Indian (2001 film)
 Raj Shekhar Azad ([[Sunny Deol]]) is an honest Deputy Commissioner of Police  whose sole intention is to wipe out corruption. From his name to his aim, emerges unflinching patriotism. But for every such patriot, there is an equally motivated terrorist.  Waseem Khan ([[Mukesh Rishi]]), a dreaded terrorist, is aided in his mission by Raj's father-in-law ([[Raj Babbar]]), an influential industrialist ([[Danny Denzongpa]]) and several police officers.  Raj's path is laden with hurdles, but he leaves no stone unturned, within the realm of law, to wage a war against the evil doers. The film is notable for the Sunny Deol's portrayal DCP Azad. The sublime toughness and solidity that the acclaimed actor manages to bring to the character of Rajshekhar Azad in his trademark sedate style is the high point of the film. Raj Babbar too comes of in with a powerful performance though his role disappears within the first hour. The peerless Danny Dengzongpa, is powerful in his portrayal of Singhania Saab in the film.

From the beginning, he spoils her and teaches her to hate the "bastard Jan". Waad, in return, treats Jan like her own son and despises the spoiled and bratty Kaew.  Later, another of Khun Luang's women, the sophisticated [[nymphomania]]c Boonlueang, moves into a guesthouse on the estate, and she teaches Jan his first lessons in the ways of love.  Jan is then framed for the rape of Kaew, who was having relations with the son of one of the family's [[domestic worker|maids]]. But it is Jan who ends up punished for Kaew's transgressions. Later, it emerges that Kaew is [[pregnancy|pregnant]], with the seed of her own father. To smooth over the damage to the family's reputation, Jan is asked to return to the family estate and is forced into an [[arranged marriage]] with his half-sister Kaew. He does so, as long as he is promised the deed to the estate, which he views as a form of vindication against his father for the abuse he endured from him during his childhood.  Kaew gives birth to Luang's child and curses it after it has emerged from her womb. The child displays classic dysmorphic features found in genetic mutations such as trisomy 21, commonly known as Down's syndrome.  Kaew, meanwhile, enters into a [[lesbian]] relationship with Boonlueang. When Jan discovers this, he demands that Kaew give him his own child and forces himself upon her repeatedly. Kaew becomes pregnant with Jan's child but she refuses to have the baby she is carrying, and with Boonlueang's assistance, performs a bloody, self-administered [[abortion]].  Jan subsequently finds himself repeating the libidinous patterns of his father, going as far as to have sex with a maid in his father's sitting room, in front of the portrait of his mother. Jan wonders why he can't escape the cycle of sexual abuse started by his father. Then it is revealed that Jan is the product of a gang [[rape]] of his mother.

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
  After getting a [[restraining order]] from [[Randal Graves]] (''[[Clerks]]'') for [[Illegal drug trade|selling drugs]] outside the Quick Stop, [[Jay and Silent Bob]] find out from [[Brodie Bruce]] (''[[Mallrats]]'') that ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]'', the comic book based on their likenesses, has been adapted into a film in production by [[Miramax Films]]. In response, the two visit Holden McNeil (''[[Chasing Amy]]''), the co-writer of ''Bluntman and Chronic'' and demand royalties from the film. However, Holden tells Jay and Silent Bob that he sold his part of the creative and publishing rights of the comic over to his former friend Banky Edwards. Upon learning of the film, as well as the negative reaction it has received so far on the Internet,<ref></ref> the two set out on a quest to [[Hollywood]], to prevent the film from being made and tainting their image, or at the very least receive the money from the royalties owed to them.  On the way, they befriend an animal liberation group, consisting of four women: Justice, Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy; and one man, Brent, who they had picked up for the cause. It is revealed that the organization is a front; Brent is a patsy, intended as a diversion by freeing an animal from a testing laboratory while the girls rob a diamond depository nearby. Jay tricks Brent and throws him out of the van in order to get closer to Justice, with whom he is smitten. Justice, who becomes close to Jay and Silent Bob (particularly the former), reluctantly accepts the two as the new patsies.  While the girls are robbing the diamond depository, Chrissy farts loudly enough to set off the alarm, forcing them to break the glass and steal the diamonds.  While this is going on Jay and Silent Bob free the animals and take an [[orangutan]] named Suzanne with them. They escape outside to see the police arriving and the van exploding, which they believe has killed the girls.  Jay then takes the orangutan with him as a memorial to Justice.  Quickly afterwards, Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly (whose name is taken from the three characters in the TV show [[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|''Land of the Lost'']]: Marshal, Will and Holly) shows up at the scene. Blinded to the diamond heist, he claims to have jurisdiction because of the large number of animals that escaped. He learns that all the animals have been recovered except for the orangutan. The officers then find and watch footage of a video Sissy recorded of Jay making remarks about "the [[Clitoris|clit]]", claiming to be "the Clit commander". The literature accompanying the tape says that "Clit" is an acronym for ''Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers''. Willenholly blindly finds this as an act of [[terrorism]] and calls for police support to hunt down what he considered "the two most dangerous men on the planet."  When the officers later have the trio cornered inside a diner and threaten to open fire, Jay and Silent Bob dress the orangutan as a child and walk out, claiming that they want to get their "son" out of the danger zone. Willenholly, thinking about the political repercussions of arresting a [[gay]] couple, decides to let them leave, but he quickly realizes his mistake and resumes the chase. When they jump into a sewer system, only Willenholly himself follows them while the other police officers, led by the Sheriff, leave him, and he is soon tricked into jumping off a dam.  Having escaped the law, Jay and Silent Bob once again return to their quest to reach Hollywood, only to have Suzanne taken by a Hollywood animal acting agency car. Now on a quest to rescue Suzanne and clear their names, the two arrive in Hollywood and find themselves in the background of an ''[[E! News]]'' newscast about their online threat against Miramax. Justice watches the news and takes the diamonds to Hollywood to set things right. Marshal Willenholly learns of their mission to reach Hollywood and leaves to find them.  After a long chase with studio security and reclaiming Suzanne from a fictional [[Scream (film series)|''Scream 4'']] in production, Jay and Silent Bob end up in [[Jason Biggs]] and [[James Van Der Beek]]'s dressing room, where they quickly realize that these are the actors that will play the roles of Bluntman and Chronic. Suzanne beats both of them up effortlessly and Jay and Silent Bob assume the roles of their characters. Production staff throw them on stage with [[Racism|racist]] director Chaka Luther King, and they must engage in a duel with [[Mark Hamill]] playing a comic book supervillain called Cocknocker. Eventually Willenholly arrives to capture Jay and Silent Bob, but Justice arrives to save them. Justice admits that the CLIT organization was not real and that the two were used as a diversion while she, Missy, Sissy and Chrissy, were stealing jewels. As the rest of jewel thieves arrive, a climactic final battle ensues, after which Jay and Silent Bob get their royalties to the film from Banky, and Justice turns herself and her former team in to Willenholly in exchange for a shorter sentence and letting Jay and Silent Bob go.  The film ends with Jay and Silent Bob spending their royalty to locate everyone who expressed negative opinions on the internet about the movie and characters, ranging from kids to clergy, and traveling to their towns to beat them up. The scene then cuts to everyone leaving a movie theater, having just watched the Bluntman and Chronic movie and expressing negative reception. Jay and Silent Bob, with Justice and Willenholly, then go across the street to enjoy a performance from [[Morris Day]] and [[The Time (band)|The Time]].  After the credits, God closes the [[View Askewniverse]] book.  
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius
 The film begins at an Air Force base somewhere in Colorado. The Air Force radar detects an unidentified flying object (UFO), so they send planes up to examine the situation. The pilots discover that it is a rocket carrying two boys and a robotic dog: [[Jimmy Neutron (character)|Jimmy Neutron]], [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Carl Wheezer|Carl Wheezer]] and [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Goddard|Goddard]]. Jimmy is attempting to launch a [[communications satellite]] made out of a toaster, in the hopes of communicating with an alien, and believes that an alien species exists somewhere out in the universe, despite his parents [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Hugh Neutron|Hugh]] and [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Judy Neutron|Judy]]'s protest in talking to strangers.  After school, Jimmy, Carl, and their friend [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Sheen Estevez|Sheen]] spot a poster for an amusement park called "Retroland." However, Jimmy's parents refuse to let him go that night because it is a school night, and as a result, Jimmy is grounded for causing a fire with one of his inventions.  Meanwhile, Jimmy's communications satellite is picked up near the planet Yolkus, home to an alien race called the Yolkians, who commandeer their warships that look like a fleet of rubber chickens. [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#King Goobot V|King Goobot V]] and his assistant, [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Ooblar|Ooblar]], watch a pre-recorded message from Jimmy, featuring him introducing himself and explaining about life on Earth, with Goobot declaring "the search is over". Jimmy, Carl, and Sheen subsequently choose to sneak out and visit the park advised by [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Nick Dean|Nick Dean]], a popular kid.  As the three are at the park, the Yolkians kidnap all the adults in the city, leaving fake notes on the refrigerators to tell the kids that they have gone to [[Florida]] for an "extended vacation". Coincidentally, Carl spots a shooting star (actually a Yolkian ship), so he, Jimmy and Sheen wish for no more [[parental control|parents]] so they can have fun all the time.  The next morning, the kids discover the parents have all disappeared and celebrate for the whole day. However, all the children quickly begin to miss their parents. The following day, after hearing a message from his parents that Goddard had recorded while posing as Jimmy last night, Jimmy becomes suspicious of the fact that his parents said that they would see him in the morning despite not being there. He discovers what has really happened.  Jimmy organizes the other children in town to build spaceships from the Retroland rides to travel to Yolkus and get their parents back. Eventually, they are captured by Goobot, who tells them that the parents are to be sacrificed to their god, [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Poultra|Poultra]]. He shows the kids Jimmy's video, thanking him for helping him find suitable species for their ritual, before having the children locked up in their cells, with the exception of Goddard, who is taken by Ooblar to the lab, where he will be dismantled.  With Jimmy feeling guilty over the fact that his actions led to the Yolkans abducting the parents in the first place, his rival [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Cindy Vortex|Cindy Vortex]] convinces him to stand up and think of an escape plan. After breaking out with the help of Goddard, the children (with the exception of Nick, as he turns out not so brave what he previously seemed to be), in accordance with Jimmy's plan, manage to stop the parents from being sacrificed to Poultra the giant chicken.  Everyone escapes aboard a Yolkian ship, but Goobot follows them in his ship at the head of the Yolkian fleet. With the exception of Goobot's ship, all of the Yolkian ships are destroyed when Jimmy baits them into flying too close to Yolkus' sun. Jimmy and Goddard then use an experimental shrink ray to grow to the size of a planet, and blow Goobot's ship into an asteroid: Goobot and Ooblar survive the explosion, and Goobot declares that they have not seen the last of him and vows revenge. Jimmy and the rest of the kids reconcile with their parents and head home.   In a final scene of the film, Jimmy and Carl have breakfast during which Jimmy's parents drink one of his experiments (that causes significant belching), thinking it is ''real'' soda and they all laugh out loud.  
Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)
  Trish Jenner and her brother Darry are traveling home from college for [[spring break]]. As they drive through the Florida countryside, an old rusty truck tries to run them off the road. The vehicle eventually passes them, and they later see the same truck parked next to an abandoned church with a man sliding what appears to be bodies wrapped in blood-stained sheets into a large pipe sticking out of the ground. The man notices Trish and Darry watching him and attempts to run them off the road a second time.  After escaping, Darry convinces Trish to go back to the church and investigate. At the church, Darry hears noises coming from within the pipe and crawls inside with Trish holding on to his feet, but ends up falling in. At the bottom, he finds a dying man with stitches running down his stomach, and hundreds of other bodies sewn to the basements walls and ceiling. After Darry escapes, the two flee the scene and attempt to contact the police at a diner. At the diner, they are phoned by a strange woman who warns them that they are in danger. Confused and frightened, they ignore her warning. Later, Trish and Darry leave, with two police officers providing a security escort. As they travel, the police learn that the church has caught fire, and any evidence of bodies has been destroyed. The police are then attacked and killed by the mysterious driver, who loads their bodies into his truck.  Trish and Darry stop at a reclusive old woman's house, and beg her to call the police. The woman complies until she notices the driver hiding in her yard. She attempts to kill him, but the driver kills her and reveals his inhuman face to Trish and Darry, before pursuing them once again. Trish runs the driver over with her car, but they are horrified to see a giant wing tear through his trench coat and flap in the air. They drive to the local police station, where they are approached by psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman. She reveals herself as the woman who called them at the diner and tells them the true nature of their pursuer: It is an ancient creature, known as "the Creeper", which awakens every twenty-third spring for twenty-three days to feast on human body parts, which then form parts of its own body. She also tells them that it seeks out its victims through fear, and, by smelling the fear from Trish and Darry, it has found something it likes, but she does not know what.  The wounded Creeper arrives and attacks the police station. After cutting off the power, it gains entrance to the cells and eats prisoners to heal. The Creeper is swarmed by police but kills a number of them and evades capture. Trapped, Jezelle warns Trish and Darry that one of them will die a horrible death. Darry demands to know who, and Jezelle looks at Trish. The Creeper finds them, but spares Jezelle as she does not have anything it wants. The Creeper corners Trish and Darry in an upstairs interrogation room, and after sniffing and tasting them, the Creeper throws Trish aside and chooses Darry. Trish offers her life for her brother's, but the Creeper escapes out of the window and flies away with Darry. The next day, Trish is picked up by her parents, and Jezelle returns home in regret. In the Creeper's new hideout, an abandoned factory, it is revealed that the Creeper has removed the back of Darry's head and taken his eyes.  
Jason X
 In the year 2010, [[Jason Voorhees]] ([[Kane Hodder]]) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist [[Rowan LaFontaine]] ([[Lexa Doig]]) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson (Jeff Geddis) places a blanket on Jason, Dr. Wimmer ([[David Cronenberg]]), Sergeant Marcus (Markus Parilo), and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason's rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead, instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer. Rowan lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it. Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both.  445 years later (2455), Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron ([[Chuck Campbell]]), Janessa ([[Melyssa Ade]]), and Azrael ([[Dov Tiefenbach]]), are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe ([[Jonathan Potts]]), who is accompanied by an Android robot, KM-14 ([[Lisa Ryder]]). They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the ''Grendel''. Also on the ship are Lowe's remaining students, Kinsa (Melody Johnson), Waylander (Derwin Jordan), and Stoney ([[Yani Gellman]]). They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe's intern, Adrienne Thomas ([[Kristi Angus]]), is ordered to [[Dissection|dissect]] Jason's body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ([[Robert A. Silverman]]), of the ''Solaris'', who recognizes Jason's name and notes that Jason's body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector.  While Stoney and Kinsa are having sex, Jason thaws out and attacks Adrienne, then freezes her face with [[liquid nitrogen]] before smashing her head to pieces on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him to his death, to Kinsa's horror. Sergeant Brodski ([[Peter Mensah]]) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael's back. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears; after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them one by one.  Lowe orders Pilot Lou ([[Boyd Banks]]) to dock in on ''Solaris'', a nearby [[space station]]. As he is talking with the ''Solaris'' engineer, he is hacked apart by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through ''Solaris'', destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the ''Solaris''. The crash damages one of the Grendel's pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] Lowe.  With the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for ''Grendel''s shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou's remains, Crutch (Philip Williams) and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch by electrocution. On board the shuttle, Kinsa hears of Crutch's death and has a [[panic attack]], she attempts to escape alone and leave everyone else for dead by launching the shuttle but forgets to release the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship's hull and explode, killing her. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. She cartwheels and fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a [[Nanotechnology|nanite]]-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm, left leg, right rib cage, and, finally, part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle.  The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful [[cyborg]] called Uber Jason. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head, Jason attacks them but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, [[Space exposure|blowing out]] Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] to fix it.  Meanwhile, a hard light [[Virtual reality|holographic simulation]] of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, along with two virtual teenagers to distract him, which works at first but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors; however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, [[Atmospheric re-entry|incinerating]] them. Tsunaron, Rowan, and KM-14 celebrate having escaped successfully, and Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her.  On Earth Two, a pair of teenagers beside a lake see what they believe is a [[Meteor|falling star]] as Jason's charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake. The teenagers go to investigate.

Josie and the Pussycats (film)
 In the 1970s, Wyatt Frame ([[Alan Cumming]]) is an executive with record label MegaRecords. The label, headed by the trend-conscious and scheming Fiona ([[Parker Posey]]), manufactures faddish pop bands for consumption by the teenage market. Conspiring with the [[United States government]], they add [[subliminal message]]s under the music to brainwash teens into buying their records and other consumer products, creating "a new trend every week". The government's theory is that economic growth is too slow from older Americans who save part of their income or pay bills, and spend the rest on cheap, ordinary goods, whereas teenagers tend to squander their income from menial jobs buying expensive, hip items, which will cause a meteoric rise in consumer spending. When a member of Wyatt's wildly successful 1990s [[boy band]], DuJour, uncovers one such message and asks Wyatt about it aboard their private jet, Wyatt and the pilot ([[Harry Elfont]]) parachute out of the plane, leaving it to crash and kill the band members.  Wyatt lands just outside the town of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]] and meets an unappreciated rock band, the Pussycats: lead vocalist/songwriter/guitarist Josie McCoy ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), drummer/backup vocalist Melody Valentine ([[Tara Reid]]), and bassist/backup vocalist Valerie Brown ([[Rosario Dawson]]). Because they are struggling financially, the Pussycats accept Wyatt's lucrative record deal despite its implausibility. They are flown to [[New York City]] where they are renamed "Josie and the Pussycats", much to the girls' discomfort. All goes well and their first single climbs rapidly to the top of the charts, but Valerie grows increasingly frustrated that all media attention is focused on Josie rather than the band as a whole. Melody, too simple to notice the undue attention Josie receives, uses her uncanny behavioral perception and becomes suspicious of Fiona and Wyatt.  Before Valerie and Melody's suspicions can reveal the conspiracy, Fiona orders Wyatt to kill them. He sends them without Josie to a fake television appearance on the [[MTV]] show ''[[Total Request Live]]'', where a Carson Daly impersonator and the real [[Carson Daly]] assault them with baseball bats. The girls survive due to their attackers' incompetence. Meanwhile, Wyatt prevents Josie from attending a [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]] by Alan M ([[Gabriel Mann]]), Josie's love interest, by telling her it was canceled. Instead, Josie listens to a remix of their latest single. The remix contains a subliminal message track designed to brainwash her into desiring a solo career, and into seeing Valerie and Melody are impediments to that goal. After an argument with her bandmates, Josie realizes that the recording caused the fight. Her suspicions are confirmed when she uses a [[Mixing console|mixing board]] to make the subliminal track audible, but she is caught by Fiona.  MegaRecords have organized a giant [[pay-per-view]] concert, whereby they plan to unleash their biggest subliminal message yet. They force Josie to perform solo on stage by holding Melody and Valerie hostage. The badly injured members of Du Jour—who survived by grounding their plane, but landed in the middle of a [[Metallica]] concert where they were severely beaten by Metallica fans—appear just in time to stop Wyatt and Fiona from launching the message. In the resulting fight, Josie destroys the machine used to generate the messages. The new subliminal message is revealed not to promote the band, the label, or a corporate sponsor, but to make Fiona universally popular. Fiona suffers a breakdown and reveals that she had been a social outcast in high school. Wyatt reveals that his appearance is a disguise—that he went to the same high school as Fiona, but was a persecuted and unpopular [[albino]]. Fiona and Wyatt immediately fall in love. The government agents colluding with Fiona arrive, but because the conspiracy is exposed, they arrest Fiona and Wyatt as scapegoats to cover-up the government's involvement in the failed scheme.  Josie, Valerie, and Melody perform the concert together, and for the first time their fans are able to judge the band on its merits, free of subliminal persuasion.  Alan M arrives and confesses his love for Josie on stage, and she returns his feelings. The audience roars their approval as the film comes to a close.  
Joe Dirt
 Joe Dirt is the janitor at a [[Los Angeles]] radio station. A producer drags him into the studio to talk live on the air with famous [[disc jockey]], [[shock jock]] Zander Kelly.  Joe tells his life story. As a baby he had a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]] wig installed because the top of his skull had never formed. At age 8, he was left behind by his parents and sister at the [[Grand Canyon]]. He does not know his real surname. After growing up in a series of foster homes and travelling on the road as a kid while camping in the woods, Joe arrived in Silvertown, a small town in the [[Pacific Northwest]], where he met the beautiful Brandy and her dog, Charlie, and became a target for jealousy from Robby, the town bully.  After Brandy's alcoholic father shoots Charlie dead, Joe decides to try to find his parents. He strikes up a friendship with Kicking Wing, an unsuccessful Native American fireworks salesman. In Indiana, Joe has an encounter with a skin cannibal named Buffalo Bob. This brings him unwanted attention from the media, but helps his search.  He travels to Louisiana and works as a high school janitor with "Clem Doore", a former NYC mobster in the [[Witness Protection Program]], with whom he becomes good friends. Joe discovers the address of his old family home and travels to [[Baton Rouge]].  Listening to Joe's life story, both Zander and the radio audience initially find him an object of scorn, but Joe's kindness, his optimistic outlook on life, and his good-natured [[self deprecation]] win them over.  Eventually, Joe lands the janitorial job at the Los Angeles radio station, where he recounts how, after discovering his old home vacant and his parents long gone, he gives up the search and returns to Silvertown to be with Brandy. However, Robby informs him that Brandy found Joe's parents, but instructed Robby not to tell Joe. Robby shows a note from Brandy to prove it. Hearing this, Zander calls Brandy on the phone on air, to find out why. Brandy says she wanted to tell Joe in person, but never had the opportunity. Brandy tells Joe his parents were killed the day they were at the Grand Canyon; she pleads with Joe to return to Silvertown. Upset by the news, Joe stays in Los Angeles.  Joe is unaware that he has become a media sensation but he quickly discovers his newfound fame. An appearance on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' with [[Carson Daly]] results in a phone call from a woman claiming to be Joe's mother. Joe realizes that she is indeed his mother and finds his parents' current house, where he and the media discover that his parents intentionally abandoned him at the Grand Canyon, and that they reconnected with him in order to take advantage of his newfound publicity to boost their sales of clown figurines. Angry and sad, Joe storms out, cutting ties with his parents.  Joe intends to commit [[suicide]], but Brandy appears and says that she only told him his parents were dead to protect him from their greed.  She invites Joe to come home with her, saying he "was home all along." Before Joe can come down from the ledge, he suffers a head injury in a freak accident when a policeman tries to prevent him from falling using a rope.  Joe wakes up in Brandy's house, surrounded by his friends: Brandy, Kicking Wing (who now owns 30 successful firework stands), Clem (now renamed Gert B. Frobe), and Charlene (another friend who is engaged to Doore). Brandy got Joe a new rastafarian dreadlock wig following his head operation. Brandy has retrieved Joe's [[Plymouth GTX|Hemi]], and she has a new dog that Charlie fathered.  Robby drives up and tells Joe that no one wants him in Silvertown, no matter how famous he is. Clem threatens Robby, and Charlene insults Robby's car. They all realize that they are like family to Joe. They ride off, leaving a frustrated Robby in the dust, his windshield broken by the stones thrown up by Joe's car. As they drive away, Zander plays a song for Joe on the radio, and fireworks go off in the sky (with special thanks to Kicking Wing).

Joe Somebody
 Joe Scheffer ([[Tim Allen]]) is a recently [[divorce]]d [[single parent]], and a talented audio/visual specialist at STARKe Pharmaceuticals, his place of employment. One day Joe pulls into the parking lot at work to find his co-worker Mark McKinney ([[Patrick Warburton]]) parking in a spot that has been reserved for those who have worked for the company for 10 years. However, McKinney has only worked there for 7 years. When Joe confronts McKinney about this, McKinney assaults him in front of his young daughter Natalie ([[Hayden Panettiere]]). Joe falls into a state of self-pity until Meg Harper ([[Julie Bowen]]), the Wellness Coordinator at STARKe, accidentally ignites a fuse in him when, in a fit of frustration, she asks Joe, "What do you want?" Joe is suddenly stirred to action by this question, and decides he wants a rematch to reclaim his dignity and self-respect, which he felt McKinney took from him.  After issuing the challenge to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex [[B movie]] star-turned-[[martial arts]] instructor named Chuck Scarett ([[Jim Belushi]]) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy ([[Greg Germann]]), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who also happens to be attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.  The day of the fight, Joe makes it all the way to the school where the brawl is to take place. However, he finally realizes it would be immature to fight, and not worth the price he would have to pay. When Joe tells McKinney and his other co-workers the fight is off, McKinney offers him an apology, which Joe accepts. Joe then goes and makes up with Meg for not understanding her reasoning before.

Jurassic Park III
  Ben Hildebrand and 12-year-old Eric Kirby go [[parasailing]] around the waters of [[The Lost World: Jurassic Park#Plot|Isla Sorna]], tethered to a boat below. The boat crew mysteriously disappear in a brief moment obscured by fog, forcing Ben to detach the line; he and Eric drift towards the island. In the United States, Dr. Alan Grant has become famous after his involvement at [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], while Ellie Sattler is married to a [[State Department]] employee named Mark and has two children. Grant discusses with Sattler how raptors are far more intelligent than they had previously believed. At a dig site, Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan, demonstrates how he can use a [[3D printing|3D printer]] to replicate a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' [[larynx]].  Paul and Amanda Kirby, an apparently wealthy couple, offer Grant funding for his research if he will give them an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant is desperate for research funding and reluctantly agrees. He flies there with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' [[mercenary]] associates, Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. On the plane, Grant learns that the Kirbys actually plan to land on the island. When Grant opposes, he is knocked out by Cooper and wakes to discover they have landed. A ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' approaches the group, who board the plane to escape, without waiting for Cooper. The ''Spinosaurus'' devours Cooper on the runway, and the plane crashes in the forest after hitting the dinosaur. The ''Spinosaurus'' destroys the plane, stranded on a treetop, killing Nash in the process. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the ''Spinosaurus'' but encounter a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. The ''Spinosaurus'' returns, but the group escapes while the two dinosaurs fight each other, with the ''Spinosaurus'' winning by breaking the ''T. rex'''s neck.  Grant, demanding the truth from the Kirbys, learns they are actually a middle-class divorced couple, who are looking for their son Eric, and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who have been missing on the island for eight weeks. Later, the group finds the parasail with Ben's corpse attached. The group takes the parasail, and then encounter raptor nests. They find an abandoned InGen compound, where they are chased by a raptor which eventually contacts the rest of its pack. The humans flee into a herd of ''[[Corythosaurus]]'' and ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', causing a stampede, separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Udesky is attacked by raptors, who leave him barely alive on the ground in an attempt to lure the others out of the tree they had climbed into. Amanda is nearly killed by the raptors when she tries to descend to help Udesky, and upon the failure of their trap, the raptors kill Udesky before departing.  Elsewhere, Grant suspects that the raptors are searching for something while observing two of them communicating. He becomes cornered by the raptors, but is rescued by Eric, who managed to survive in an overturned water truck. The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite phone ringing and are reunited with the Kirbys and Billy. Paul explains that he gave the phone to Nash before he was devoured. The group is then chased by the ''Spinosaurus'', the source of the ringing phone. After the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy took two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. Grant decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large [[aviary]] used to house ''[[Pteranodon]]s'', which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric by using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and seemingly killed by the ''Pteranodons''. The rest of the group escapes the aviary, unintentionally leaving the door unlocked. They make their way downriver using a boat.  That night, the group retrieves the ringing phone, buried in the feces of the ''Spinosaurus''. As rain falls, Grant tries to contact Sattler, but the ''Spinosaurus'' attacks the boat. Grant sets the boat's fuel on fire and burns the ''Spinosaurus'', causing it to flee. The next day, the group makes their way towards the shoreline, but are surrounded by the raptors. The eggs are surrendered to the raptors, while Grant uses the replicated raptor larynx to confuse the pack, who run off with the eggs. The humans flee to the coast and find that Sattler had called in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] to rescue them. They discover that Billy, while seriously injured, is still alive and has also been rescued. As they leave the island, they see the ''Pteranodons'' flying free, and Grant muses they are "looking for new nesting grounds."  
Just Visiting (film)
 The backstory takes place in 12th century [[England]], where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the [[Earl of Warwick]] gives Thibault a potion which makes him [[hallucinate]] (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté ([[Christian Clavier]]) to find a wizard ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century.  They end up in a [[museum]] in [[Chicago]] where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte ([[Christina Applegate]]), a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while [[yachting]] a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where [[norm (sociology)|norms]] from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter ([[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]]). Meanwhile, Andre falls for a pretty [[gardener]], Angelique ([[Tara Reid]]) who presents him with the world of equal rights for all people.  The wizard realizes his mistake and decides to time travel into the future to help Thibault, who is also getting accustomed to 21st century life. After he finds him, he successfully prepares a potion for returning to the past. André confronts Thibault, that he does not want to return to the 12th century, after Julia convinces Thibault that he should set him free, Thibault agrees. Hunter decides to prevent Thibault by interfering with his plans but Julia finds out his real intentions and breaks up with him. Before he leaves, Thibault tells Julia that she will meet a new and better boyfriend. Then, he and the wizard drink the potion in the museum and return to the past just before the killing of Princess Rosalind. Hunter finds the remainder of the potion which sends him to the 12th century where he is captured. Julia decides to reclaim her ancestral castle, much to the firm's delight, and meets a man named Francois Le Combier, who knows much about her family's history. In the last scene, André and Angelique are seen driving in a hot rod towards [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], which makes André wonder one thing, who would protect him from the Devil. Angelique simply replies "Hey, at least you got me, babe", to which André happily agrees.  
Joy Ride (2001 film)
 University students Lewis Thomas ([[Paul Walker]]) and Venna Wilcox ([[Leelee Sobieski]]), Lewis's childhood friend and crush, prepare to go home for the summer holiday. Lewis, a University of California student, offers to come by Venna's campus (she attends University of Colorado) to drive her home instead of both of them flying back; Venna happily agrees. After refunding his plane ticket to buy a 1971 [[Chrysler Newport]], Lewis calls his parents to announce the change of plan and learns that his older brother Fuller ([[Steve Zahn]]), the family's black sheep, has been arrested once again. Lewis drives to [[Salt Lake City]] and bails out Fuller, who then tags along for the trip.  At a gas station, Fuller has a [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] installed on Lewis's car for $40, and the two begin listening in on truckers' chatter. Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a prank on a truck driver nicknamed 'Rusty Nail' (voiced by [[Ted Levine]] (uncredited)). Lewis pretends to be a woman named Candy Cane and sets up a meeting with Rusty Nail in the motel where Lewis and Fuller will be spending the night. Lewis tells Rusty that "she" is in room 17, the room of an irritable businessman with whom Fuller had earlier argued, but the guys are actually in room 18. When Rusty Nail arrives at the man's room, an argument and sounds of a scuffle are briefly heard. The next morning, Sheriff Ritter announces to Lewis and Fuller that they found the businessman on the highway, still alive with his lower jaw ripped off. Ritter figures out the two are involved in the incident, but lets them go, as he already has his hands full, and they do not know anything other than the man's nickname (CB handle). However, he orders them to leave the state by sundown.  On the road, Rusty Nail is heard again on the CB radio looking for Candy Cane. Lewis talks to him and reveals that he is Candy Cane. Rusty Nail demands an apology, but Fuller insults him, instead. Rusty Nail simply notes that they should get their taillight fixed, indicating that he is right behind them, causing the duo to panic and speed up. At the next gas station, they unsuccessfully attempt to contact Ritter. Seeing an ice truck pulling into the gas station, the already paranoid pair drives away. The ice truck driver chases them down. However, the driver turns out to be merely trying to return Lewis's credit card, which he left behind in panic. The real Rusty Nail then shows up in his truck and crushes the ice truck and its driver. He then slowly pins Lewis's car against a tree. The two hysterically apologize, and Rusty Nail drives away, declaring his actions to be simply a retaliatory joke.  Believing themselves safe, the brothers arrive at the University of Colorado and pick up Venna. They stop at a motel and drink at a bar. Lewis goes to sleep, but Rusty Nail calls him, revealing he knows of Venna. The three flee the motel. Rusty Nail contacts them, announcing that he has kidnapped Charlotte, Venna's friend. He directs them to a cornfield, where he gets them to split up, and kidnaps Venna.  Rusty Nail sets up a meeting at another motel in room 17, mirroring the false date with which he was pranked. He sets up a trap that will kill Venna if the room door is opened. Fuller attempts to get in the room by a window, but is injured by Rusty Nail and stuck outside the room. Rusty Nail's truck appears uphill and begins rolling down toward Venna's room. Lewis frees Fuller, and the brothers save Venna just in time. As the police investigate Rusty Nail's truck, they see a dead body in the driver's seat and Charlotte, still alive, on the floor.  Lewis, Fuller, and Venna are treated for their injuries at an ambulance. At this point, the dead man turns out to be the ice truck driver. A CB in the ambulance is on, and the group hear Rusty Nail's voice, learning that he is still alive and free.  
K-PAX (film)
 After claiming he is an extraterrestrial from the planet 'K-PAX', 1,000 [[light years]] away in the [[Lyra]] constellation, prot (not capitalized and pronounced with a long O, rhyming with boat) is committed to the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan. There, psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell attempts to cure him of his apparent delusions. However, prot is unwavering in his ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself, K-PAX, and its civilizations. His medical examination only reinforces his story, as prot can see ultraviolet light and he is completely resistant to the effects of [[Thorazine]]. Powell introduces him to a group of astrophysicists who are befuddled when prot displays a level of knowledge about his claimed star system that was unknown to them.  Prot also wins over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. prot, who claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of "light-travel", explains that he can take one person with him when he returns. Thereafter, most of the patients at the Institute ask prot to take them with him.  Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Powell confronts prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma. Powell decides to subject prot to [[Age regression in therapy|regression hypnosis]], which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego of Robert Porter, a man from [[New Mexico]] who attempted suicide in 1996 after his wife and child were murdered. Powell tries to confront prot with this knowledge, but prot's reaction is one of bemusement, and he cryptically tells Powell that he hopes he will take good care of Robert now that he has found him.  On July 27 as the hospital staff watch, the camera in prot's room cuts to static at the precise time prot said he would leave Earth. Powell finds Porter lying on the floor in his room, [[catatonia|catatonic]], prot having apparently left Porter's body for the light travel back to K-PAX. The other patients do not recognize Robert, as he is being wheeled out of the room. In addition, one of them is missing: Bess, a woman who had remained [[muteness|mute]] since her home was destroyed in a fire and who had been among the patients that asked to go to K-PAX with prot. She is never found. Powell continues to take care of the catatonic Porter and tells him about how the patients he helped have gone on to live normal lives again, but Robert does not respond. Powell is left with no absolute answer as to whether prot was in fact an alien entity or just a coping mechanism of the traumatized Porter, but seems far from convinced that Porter's behavior was a delusion.  The final scene's [[voiceover]] is prot explaining to Powell that the people of K-PAX have discovered that [[eternal return|our universe will repeat its events again and again]], so the mistakes we make will be repeated forever. prot encourages Powell to make this time count, as it is the only chance we have. Inspired, Powell begins a new, better life by reconciling with his estranged son.

Meanwhile, Alicia and George find themselves falling for each other. When they arrive at the home of Alicia's family, who are meeting Alicia's fiancé for the first time, George wants to leave. But Gerard convinces him to stick around for the night, telling him to "jump tomorrow."  Alicia's fiancé ends up in bed the whole time after Alicia's uncle, a [[deaf-mute]], offers him a spicy dish his stomach can't handle. The uncle takes a liking to George and teaches him a Spanish dance. Gerard finds himself attracted to Alicia's mother, a widow. They all enjoy the party that night, and George gets a chance to make his move, but he is too shy to proceed. Gerard spends the night with Alicia's mother, but in the morning she rebuffs him for moving too fast with their relationship.  Gerard and George leave for the wedding. After dropping off George, Gerard heads towards Niagara Falls, where he again considers suicide until a boy standing there tells him that he gets his best ideas when he is by himself. At the ceremony, George declares "I am [[Jorge]]" (the Spanish form of George) and calls the wedding off. He and his fiancée Sophie agree that their intended marriage was for convenience and not an ideal match. Gerard and George catch up to Alicia and her fiancé at the border of [[Canada]], and George finally expresses his love for her.

Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth. This is known to everyone in the Raichand household, except Rohan. The Raichand household is highly patriarchal and follows traditions. While grown up, Rahul ([[Shahrukh Khan]]) comes across the vivacious Anjali Sharma ([[Kajol]]), and they eventually fall in love, but their love is forbidden, because Anjali is from a low-income background. Yash and Nandini soon send Rohan (Kavish Majumdar) to a boarding school, which all the males in their family have attended. Yash announces his desire for Rahul to marry Naina ([[Rani Mukherji]]), as he believes that parents have the right to choose their offspring's spouse, but Naina learns that Rahul is in love with Anjali, and encourages him to pursue her. When Yash comes to know of this, he is enraged, and Rahul promises not to marry Anjali, as he wants to please his father. ''En route'' to tell her of his promise, he discovers that her father ([[Alok Nath]]) has died, and decides to marry her despite his father's hostility. Yash learns of the marriage and disowns Rahul, whereupon Nandini and Rahul share a tearful goodbye. Nandini sends Sayeeda ([[Farida Jalal]]) (Rahul and Rohan's nanny) to watch over him, so that he does not feel separated from a mother's love. Rahul visits Rohan in the Boarding School and begs of Rohan never to ask where he went or why he left, and asks that he take care of Nandini.  Ten years later, Rohan ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) returns home from boarding school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers ([[Achala Sachdev]] and [[Sushma Seth]]) concerned Rahul's adoption and the reason why Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and her younger sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to [[London]], and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree to let him go. In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish (Jibraan Khan). Pooja ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that he has come to London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. Right before the family attends Krish's school function, Sayeeda and Anjali find out his real identity, though they promise to keep quiet. At Krish's school function, Krish leads his class in singing ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' (Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this advice ten years ago, now realizes that Rohan is his brother. Also at this point, Rohan and Pooja fall in love.  Rohan begs Rahul to come home, but Rahul refuses. Pooja convinces Rohan to invite his parents to London; Rahul and Nandini are overjoyed to see one another, but Rahul still refuses to talk to his father. When Yash goes to a store, Anjali stumbles by and Rohan reveals that they have been living in London the whole time. Yash soon learns that his mother had died and that her last wish was for Yash, Rahul, and Rohan to light her funeral pyre together. Therefore, the entire family attends the funeral, and Nandini tells Yash that she thought he was wrong for disowning Rahul. Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul to talk to Yash, who apologizes and allows Rahul and Anjali into the house. Rohan and Pooja are married, and the family hold a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.

Kakashi
  The opening text narrates the tradition of "Kakashi", where humans would burn animal and human hairs to prevent evil spirits from entering Earth. They eventually began to burn human effigies made of straws as it also attract the spirits of the dead so they can interact with them. Little they know that it may bring consequences far greater than they thought.  Opening [[in medias res]], lead protagonist, Kaoru Yoshikawa ([[Maho Nonami]]) is shown screaming in front of flames, asking why it had to be done to her. In the beginning, Kaoru is a young woman who has close relationship with her brother, Tsuyoshi; their parents had been dead a long time ago. Unable to contact him for a week, she goes to his apartment and finds an envelope near his telephone. Inside it are bits of straws and a letter from Izumi Miyamori, a former friend of Kaoru who wants Tsuyoshi to meet her. The letter's address comes from Kozukata Village, located in the hills of a mountain. While going there, Kaoru sees a missing person poster of a Chinese woman named Sally Chen, nearby which she finds a tunnel leading to the village. Going inside the tunnel, her car breaks down, forcing her to walk on foot. On the way, she hears a woman's laugh. Kaoru does arrive at Kozukata, but all of the villagers act cold to strangers, only informing her about the upcoming "Kakashi Matsuri" (Scarecrow Festival). Arriving at a red-draped windmill, Kaoru meets Sally ([[Grace IP]]), who is playing with a little girl, Ayumi Noji ([[Mizuho Igarashi]]), whose father, Shusaku ([[Yoshiki Arizono]]) hastily arrives to take her, warning her not to talk to strangers. Finding Sally quickly leaving the scene, Kaoru heads to the Miyamori residence and meets with Izumi's parents. While Izumi's father, Kozo ([[Kenzo Kawarasaki]]), greets her warmly, his wife, Yukie ([[Lily (entertainer)|Lily]]), acts cold like the other villagers. He offers to let Kaoru stay for several days and tells her that Izumi is in the hospital.  On her first night, Kaoru dreams of meeting Izumi ([[Kou Shibasaki]]) who seemingly dislikes her appearance, as well as an Izumi-shaped scarecrow. Heading to the local police station to fix her car, she meets Sally again who antagonizes her when she discovers her father sitting in the desk. The next night, Kaoru dreams of seeing Tsuyoshi making an Izumi-shaped scarecrow. Going back to the station the next day, she is shocked to learn that Sally's father is in fact a living scarecrow, and she is promptly attacked by other citizens of the village who are also living scarecrows. Sally instructs her to leave while she takes care of them. In the Miyamori residence, Kaoru heads upstairs and finds Izumi's diary, where she learns that Izumi had fallen in love with Tsuyoshi, but Kaoru's overprotective attitude prevents her from reaching him, making her cursing Kaoru for her entire life. She meets Izumi's ghost who says that Kaoru is jealous of her brother being taken away from herand that she will go alive that night. Running away, Kaoru confronts Kozo who admits that Izumi had actually been dead several years ago, and that his appearance in the village is merely trying to celebrate the festival as he believed it will give chance for him and his wife to reunite with her. This act is not only done by them but also all other villagers, including Sally who travels from far away to reunite with her dead father. However, he realizes that the scarecrows will turn into mindless monsters once they are made, which are further fueled by Izumi's malevolent spirit who haunts the village since she died grieving.  Kozo takes Kaoru to the clinic where her brother ([[Shunsuke Matsuoka]]) who had been in a trance since his arrival, is staying. Kaoru manages to bring him out by slapping him. After convincing and picking up Sally, the trio escape from the scarecrows while making their way to the tunnel before the festival starts. Meanwhile, Ayumi, revealed to be a scarecrow, kills her father and Kozo. As the festival starts, Izumi's scarecrow is the first to come to life and she subsequently kills her mother by snapping her neck. The trio stumbles to the windmill where Izumi waits. While embracing Izumi, Tsuyoshi ignites his lighter, setting both of them ablaze, with Izumi laughing at Kaoru, who can only watch helplessly. Kaoru and Sally hastily go to the tunnel while other scarecrows come to life. Just as they are about to reach outside, Tsuyoshi's spirit appears and calls Kaoru. Realizing that she has no place to go back and Tsuyoshi being the only one who cares her, she goes after Tsuyoshi, despite Sally's protests.

Kate & Leopold
 On 28 April 1876, Leopold, His Grace the 3rd [[Duke of Albany]], is a stifled dreamer. He has created a design for a primitive elevator, and has built a small model of this device. His strict Uncle Millard has no patience for what he characterises as a sign of Leopold's disrespect for the Monarchy, chastising him, and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. In response to his uncle's accusations of his blemishing the family name, Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences and inventions.  One day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser, an amateur [[physicist]] (and great-great-grandson of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at [[John August Roebling|Roebling's]] speech about the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], after he was laughing at the word "erection." Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.  Leopold awakens in 21st century [[New York City]]. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the [[elevator]] shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century appears to have caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent for his own device.  Leopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay, Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her [[Palm Pilot]] stylus. He observes that she is a "career woman" and that her field, market research, is a fine [[avocation]] for a woman, and states that he once dated a librarian from [[Sussex]]. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog for a walk. Leopold is overwhelmed to see that Roebling's bridge is still standing. Back at the apartment, he befriends Charlie, Kate's brother and an actor between gigs, who believes him to be an actor as well, steadfast to his character.  Kate and Leopold become romantically involved as they dine and tour New York.  Leopold agrees to act in a diet margarine commercial for one of Kate's clients, but walks off the set after finding the product disgusting. He and Kate argue, with Leopold chastising her about integrity, and Kate bristling about his moralising and countering that he lacks connection with reality. Realising that their time together is nearly over, both spend the evening in subdued contemplation. Stuart suddenly returns to his apartment, having escaped from the [[mental hospital]], and sends Leopold back to his own time.  Afterwards, Stuart and Charlie notice Kate in the photos Stuart took at Leopold's ball, and realise that her destiny must be to go back and be with Leopold. That night, while Kate is accepting her promotion at a company banquet, he and Charlie race to meet her and show her the pictures. Kate initially rejects their overtures and goes on to give her acceptance speech, but it is there that she sees Stuart's picture and realises that she truly wants to be with Leopold.  Kate abruptly ends her speech, and the three of them rush to the Brooklyn Bridge. Kate makes it to the portal before it closes and reappears in 1876, where Leopold appears resigned to his marriage of convenience. Just before Leopold announces his bride, Kate bursts into the building, and he announces her name instead, referring to her as being one the ''McKays of Massapequa.'' In amongst the shocked guests, Kate and Leopold reunite with a kiss and dance a bridal waltz.

Another night, Clive and Carter scatter strips of meat around the camp, which attracts a grizzly bear that tears down Kevin's tent and scares him and his dogs off. After the duo blow up Kevin's grandfather's cabin with dynamite, Kevin soon finds out of Clive's and Carter's plan and warn them both to stay away from him and his team.  While camping in a snow cave during a blizzard, Bonnie and Kevin discover a map inside Kevin's jacket that belonged to his grandfather. The map tells them of a place known as Wolf Mountain, where Kevin believes that his grandfather hid his gold. When the storm clears, they reach Wolf Mountain and recovered the chest full of gold nuggets underneath the snow.   Unfortunately, Clive and Carter arrive, take the chest of gold, and take Bonnie hostage after burying Kevin in the spot where they uncovered the gold. However, Kevin orders his lead dog, Farty to dig him out and he follows Clive and Bonnie all the way to Nome, which is the finish line of the Iditarod Sled Dog race. He manages to beat Parker and Carter, wins the race, and races onward to cut off Thornton's escape. He rescues Bonnie and Clive draws out a gun and fires at them, but he misses.

Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sick&mdash;which she says earlier in the film never happens to her&mdash;Jessica is there to care for her.  The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an [[IBM]] executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica.  Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother reminds Jessica of when she was little and had been given the lead in the school play, but after the first rehearsal, Jessica had deemed her co-star not to be up to the task. She quit the play because she thought the play wouldn't be "the best ever." Her mother says that she worries about Jessica having this attitude towards life, and that sometimes she thinks back to that night and thinks that if Jessica went on, maybe it wouldn't have been the best, but it might have been pretty good&mdash;and who knows, maybe it would have been the best ever. She then tells Jessica that she thinks Helen "is a very nice girl."  This acceptance on her mother's part gives Jessica the confidence to come out in the open with her relationship with Helen, and invites her as her guest to her brother's wedding. Helen quickly becomes popular with the other women at the reception, who don't seem to mind at all her lesbian relationship with Jessica. At the same time, Jessica gets a love confession from her ex-beau and current boss Josh, who declares he's had feelings for her for a long time. Jessica rejects him, explaining that she already has Helen. Jessica and Helen move in together, but their relationship, while good in most respects, begins to suffer from [[Lesbian bed death|a lack of frequent sexual intimacy]]. Jessica's behavior towards Helen is more akin to that of a best friend rather than a sexual partner. The relationship ends amidst Jessica's tears and Helen's realization that she wants more than Jessica is willing to offer.  After moving beyond the heartbreak, Jessica and Helen appear to remain friends, and it is suggested that Jessica might now have a renewed interest in Josh, after both have left the newspaper where they previously worked.  
Kingdom Come (2001 film)
  ===Summary=== ''Kingdom Come'' is a story of a family called the Slocumbs, living out in the country, who must come together after the death of a family member, whom no one seems to remember with much fondness. It is based on the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''Dearly Departed''.  First, there's Woodrow "Bud" Slocumb, the man in question, whose wife, Raynelle ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), is pretty nonchalant about his death from a stroke. Then, there's Ray Bud ([[LL Cool J]]), a recovering alcoholic who has a problem with seeing his father dead because of their rocky relationship; his wife, Lucille ([[Vivica A. Fox]]), is a loving, devoted housewife who goes out of her way to make sure that everyone has everything they need, but can't have the one thing she wants out of life: a child. Next, Junior ([[Anthony Anderson]]) has blown all of his money on a failed invention, and his loud mouthed wife, Charisse ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]), is no help; she hits the roof after his infidelity and reminds him often that she could have been married to his rich lawyer cousin, who, it is later revealed, left his own wife Juanita ([[Toni Braxton]]). Then, there's Marguerite ([[Loretta Devine]]), a pious, overbearing mother who usually calls her wayward son, Royce ([[Darius McCrary]]), a "Demon Seed"; she fears that he will end up in jail like his brother, and the latter is an unemployed worker who is irated by his mother's unsolicited and shrill advice on how to live his life.  ===Story Plotline=== The film begin with the a radio morning announcement by Rev. Beverly H. Hooker ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]). Raynelle receives and reads her sister Marguerite's letter (much to Bud's annoyance), which says that she was expecting Bud to attend Sunday service, but assumed that he decided to watch wrestling again like he'd always did, but wonders that there was going to be television in hell. She had also heard about Junior's and Charisse's business going bad, and wonders that would he ever learn. She thinks that both her nephew and her own son could learn from Buster Kincaid's child, Tiny. She had him over the weekend, and he did some chores around the house; as a reward, she gave him three dollars for his birthday the following week instead of the actual two dollars. Moreover, she says that she has decided to come over to visit after church; she believes that one of them needs to get things right with the Lord, and she is the woman for the job. She decides that they are going to spend of whole day in prayer, discussing scripture, and singing hymns until they wear her down, like it says in 2 Peter 3:8, "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years." After Raynelle finishes reading, Bud, who both agrees and disagrees with some things said in the letter, collapses and dies, with the former noticing.  Later, Royce is awaken by a loud ring of his phone. The one calling is his mother, who starts singing too pitchy, getting him annoyed that he hangs up. After he answers again, he calls her off for waking him up, in which she replies that she says that he's taking the Lord's name in vain. Royce talks harshly to his mother, but she talks back and asks why he is still in his bed. She tells him that it's 7:00 in the morning and why he isn't up looking for a job, but he replies that it's not that at all. She assumes that he has a love hangover and begins accusing him of laying with a harlot, in which she starts slapping her phone to get back at him. He tells her to stop that and asks what does she want. She thought that he want to know that his uncle Bud has died this morning. He seems to be compassionate, saying that he is sorry to hear that and asking how his aunt Raynelle was doing. She replies that his aunt is not doing well, as his uncle dropped dead at a breakfast table in the middle of her letter. He then pretends to be sympathetic about the cause of his uncle's death. She says that they are going to their house and giving them comfort and some Christian counsel.

A Knight's Tale
  At a [[jousting]] tournament in [[Middle Ages|14th-century Europe]], young squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir Ector, has died. If he had completed one final pass he would have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Ector's armour to impersonate him, winning the tournament and taking the prize.  Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is now inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their winnings and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in [[Rouen]], the trio encounters a young [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who is also destitute and agrees to forge the [[patent of nobility]] that will allow William to enter under the [[assumed name]] of "Sir [[Ulrich von Liechtenstein]]" from [[Guelders|Gelderland]]. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment.  In the course of competition, William's armor is damaged. He goads Kate, a blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the tournament's sword event. In the joust, he faces a Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honor of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust, Adhemar defeats William.  Kate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armor. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. While Adhemar does not dare to endanger the future King of England, William continues the match and then addresses Edward by name, further earning his respect.  Adhemar is called away to the [[Battle of Poitiers]], and William achieves several victories in his absence. William proves his love for Jocelyn by complying when she first asks him to deliberately lose (in contrast to the countless knights who promise to win in her name), and then, just before he would be eliminated, to win the tournament in her name after all.  The group travels to London for the World Championship. William recalls leaving his father to squire for Sir Ector and learn to become a knight, hoping to "change his stars". Adhemar has also arrived in London and announces that he is in negotiations with Jocelyn's father for her hand in marriage. William dominates at the tournament, but when he returns to visit his father, now blind and living alone in [[Cheapside]], Adhemar discovers his true identity and alerts the authorities.  William is placed in the [[pillory]], but is defended from the hostile crowd by his friends. Just as the mob reaches its frenzy, Prince Edward emerges from the crowd. He acknowledges William's honor and an ability to inspire his friends' dedication that is in the best traditions of knighthood. Edward then announces that, William is in fact, "beyond contestation", descended from an ancient noble family, and knights him "Sir William".  William returns to the tournament to face Adhemar in the final match, but Adhemar cheats with an illegally sharpened lance, seriously injuring William. Entering the final pass, William is losing by two lances and must unhorse Adhemar to win. He demands to be stripped of his armor while Chaucer buys time by performing the introduction of William that he omitted earlier. William, unable to hold the lance due to his injuries, asks Wat to strap it to his arm. Finally he tilts against Adhemar, with his father and Jocelyn in attendance. Bellowing his true name as he charges, he knocks Adhemar to the ground with a crushing blow.  Over his defeat, Adhemar experiences a vision of William and his friends mocking him that he has been weighted, measured and found wanting (like Adhemar did to William before). In the ensuing celebration, as Jocelyn and William embrace, Chaucer remarks that he should [[The Canterbury Tales|write this whole story down]].  
Knockaround Guys
 Matty Demaret ([[Barry Pepper]]) is the son of a mob boss, but he is used as little more than an errand boy. His relative and friend Chris ([[Andy Davoli]]) shares this urge to be part of something bigger, and Matty finally convinces his father to give him a job, with the help of his father's right-hand man Teddy ([[John Malkovich]]). Matty and Chris get their friend Johnny Marbles ([[Seth Green]]) to fly up to retrieve a bag full of money for Matty's father Benny "Chains" Demaret ([[Dennis Hopper]]), as there have been mysterious shortages in their money lately.  On the way back with the cash, Marbles stops in a small Montana town to refuel his personal plane.  He has been instructed to guard the bag with his life so he takes the bag with him as he goes to pay for the fuel.  However, Marbles sees the sheriff & his deputy and is paranoid that they may question him about the bag's contents.  Marbles is also in possession of cocaine which he dumps on the runway.  He drops the bag amongst a pile of luggage waiting to be loaded onto another flight, and despite telling the cashier to keep the change, the other flight takes off before he can retrieve his bag.  Unknown to him, the bag of money was taken by two local teenage pothead skateboarders who work as [[baggage handler]]s at the airport.  He calls Matty and tells him the news. Matty, though upset, knows that he must fix the situation quickly and quietly if he ever wants to work for his father. Matty, Chris, and their friend Taylor ([[Vin Diesel]]) fly to the small town of [[Wibaux, Montana]] to help Marbles search for the missing money.  While in town, Matty and the other guys attract the attention of two local law-enforcement officers ([[Tom Noonan]] and [[Shawn Doyle]]) who find out about the money and want to keep it for themselves. The mob guys then try to negotiate with the officers to get the money back but are turned away. Matty calls Teddy and Teddy arrives in Wibaux with two other mob henchmen. Chris decides to leave for home and disappears. Marbles hangs around in a bar with the two mob henchmen who secretly hate him, while Taylor and Matty wait in their hotel for word from the Sheriff. After taking him outside in a friendly manner, the two mob men throw Marbles to the ground and ask where Chris is. Marbles, defending his friend, tells them he doesn't know and one of the men shoots him dead and puts his body in a trunk.  Later that night, a deal is arranged for the Sheriff and Deputy to meet Matty and Taylor in a warehouse. When they arrive, the lawmen are planning to kill Matty and the others and keep the money, but Teddy and the two mob men show up when Matty and Taylor do and the entire thing turns into a [[Mexican standoff]]. Chris arrives and shoots the Sheriff's cousin who came to help the Sheriff, and Matty and Taylor inquire about Marbles. Chris says that he thought he was with them. Teddy gives a signal to the two henchmen and they all fire on Chris who is killed. The Sheriff and Deputy, in the chaos, shoot the two mob men. Taylor then kills both of the lawmen. As Teddy prepares to shoot Matty, Taylor is shot instead in the arm when about to defend his friend from the bullet. Teddy's gun is out and Matty holds him at gunpoint. Matty says that it is Teddy that has been stealing and causing shortages from his father all along. Teddy tries to reload and shoot Matty claiming that Matty doesn't have the guts to shoot him. Teddy turns around and attempts to shoot Matty but Matty quickly shoots Teddy in the chest several times, killing him. Matty and Taylor get the money and return home. Matty hands the bag of money to his father and quits the family business. Matty and Taylor then drive off as the credits begin to roll.

The Knights of the Quest
   
Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
 A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged [[sifu]], and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has romantic feelings for him.  While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people kick him in the groin, but is knocked out after being hit. When he wakes up, a mysterious woman named Whoa warns him not to rush to fight Betty. After flirtily fighting The Chosen One, Whoa flies off into the sky.  Ignoring the advice, The Chosen One sets off to find Betty. He comes across one of Betty's evil companions: Moo Nieu (pronounced [[Mooning|"moon you"]]), a [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cow]] gifted in karate, with a large udder that can squirt milk as a weapon. They fight in a scene parodying ''[[The Matrix]]'', and The Chosen One eventually incapacitates Moo Nieu by milking her until her udder is empty. He sees Betty at a waterfall and confronts him. Master Doe, Ling's Father, shows up and tries to stop the unprepared Chosen One, and is wounded by Betty. The Chosen One takes Master Doe to Master Tang; it turns out they are old friends. However, as Tang massages Doe's wound, it doesn't close and Doe dies that night. Out of depression, Ling confesses her feelings for The Chosen One.  Confused, The Chosen One journeys out to a field and consults the heavens for confidence. Suddenly Mu-Shu Fasa, a large sentient [[lion]], appears in the sky and dispenses advice in a scene parodying a portion of ''[[The Lion King]]''. He returns to town and finds that Betty's hostility has expanded to the entire town, and they are killing anyone who may be his allies. He finds Wimp Lo, Ling, Master Tang and even his Dog heavily maimed. However, except for Lo, they all survive. After taking Ling and his dog to safety, The Chosen One begins training himself. Believing Betty's weak points are the pyramid spikes embedded in his chest, The Chosen One makes wooden dummies, embeds similar spikes onto their chests and attempts to pluck them out with his bare hands. His hands are battered and he is exhausted, but after Ling treats his wounds and gives an inspiring speech, he finds himself rejuvenated and successfully pulls off the attack.  Meanwhile, Betty is called by the mysterious Evil Council and learns that The Chosen One is alive. The Chosen One confronts Betty at the temple. They fight evenly, until the Evil Council shows up revealing themselves to be [[France|French]] aliens, and gives Betty supernatural powers. Betty viciously beats up The Chosen One, who, in a semi-unconscious state, sees visions of Whoa and Mu-Shu Fasa giving him advice. Mu-Shu instructs him to open his mouth. As soon as he does, Tonguey flies out and attacks and destroys the mother ship, causing the entire Evil Council armada to panic and retreat, leaving Betty vulnerable. The Chosen One eventually rips the pyramid spikes out of Betty's chest, killing him. As The Chosen One returns home with Ling, his tribulations are far from over, as presented in a trailer for a sequel, ''Kung Pow 2: Tongue of Fury'', that immediately follows the final scene.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Master Tang, who has been left behind, asks someone to help him from a hungry [[golden eagle]] pecking his leg.

Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi
 Raj Khanna ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) is a wealthy businessman who lives with his wife Archana ([[Rati Agnihotri]]), stepsister Devyani ([[Mita Vasisht]]), her spouse ([[Pramod Moutho]]), and her son Teddy (Mayur), in a mansion. Raj and Archana's lives are marred by marital discord, until they separate. Shortly before separating, Archana gives birth to identical twins: one of these is taken by Devyani and handed to Raj without Archana's knowledge. This infant becomes an embittered young woman sentimentally named Sweety ([[Kajol]]), and Raj becomes a helpless alcoholic. Archana has moved to London with the other daughter, Tina ([[Kajol]]). In contrast to Sweety's ferocity, Tina is meek, compassionate, sympathetic, and demure. Each year, Archana buys two identical presents, gives one to Tina on her birthday, and locks the other into a closet to symbolize giving to Sweety, whom she believes is dead.  Sweety is of marriageable age, but refuses to marry the man of her aunt's choice, and runs away to London. Once there, she is mistaken for her sister by Archana. Later, when the twins meet, they realize that Devyani has been scheming to keep Raj under her control, and change places in hope of freeing Raj and reuniting their family: each according to her own personality, but under the name of her sister. Tina goes to India to cure their father of alcoholism, while Sweety remains in England to acclimate their mother to her habits.

Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure
  In 1911, just two days before the Fourth of July, Lady and Tramp have three well-mannered daughters, Annette, Danielle, and Colette, and a rambunctious son named Scamp. After chewing Jim Dear's favorite hat and causing a mess while chasing after a ball in the house, Scamp is chained to a doghouse outside as punishment. His parents, Tramp and Lady, are distraught that their son cannot settle down and live in a home. Tramp tries to reason with Scamp, but loses his temper at his son's insistent desire to be wild. Scamp then sees a pack of stray dogs harassing the dogcatcher and becomes intrigued. He manages to break free from the chain and runs off to find the pack.  Scamp finds a young member of the pack, Angel, and the two go to a junkyard with the pack, named the Junkyard Dogs. Just after Scamp leaves, Lady walks out to reconcile with her son but notices that he has disappeared. She alerts Tramp and the Darlings start a search party. Scamp attempts to join the Junkyard Dogs right away, but their leader, Buster, gives him the first test in the alley, where Scamp has to grab a tin can from a large, savage dog named Reggie. This results in a chase involving him and Angel; they manage to evade Reggie, who is caught by the dogcatcher. They then head to a park, where Sparky, another member, tells a colorful story about Tramp escaping from a group of dogcatchers. Buster, who was once good friends with Tramp, angrily reminds them that Tramp fell in love with Lady and became a house pet. Scamp is in awe that his father used to be a Junkyard Dog. After Scamp and Angel narrowly escape from a train and fall into a river, they start to fall in love.  Meanwhile, Scamp and Angel find Scamp's parents, along with Jim Dear, Darling, Jock, and Trusty, as they search for him. Angel, who was once a house pet herself, is disgusted that Scamp would choose living on the streets over a loving family. Later, as the Dear family has a picnic, the Junkyard Dogs see them and Buster realizes that Scamp is Tramp's son. He then tells him to steal a chicken from his family's picnic, claiming it was the second and final test for Scamp to join the Junkyard Dogs. Scamp does so and heads into an alley, where Tramp confronts and asks him to come home. Scamp refuses and chooses to stay with Buster. Buster, pleased to see Tramp distraught, officially declares Scamp a Junkyard Dog by removing his collar.  While Scamp celebrates his newfound freedom, Angel scolds him for not listening to his father, and reminds him that his family loves him. Scamp then reveals that Angel wants to be a house pet, and Buster exiles her from the pack. She leaves the Junkyard, angry at Scamp. Having a change of heart, Scamp searches for her. Buster, still wishing revenge on Tramp, arranges Scamp's capture by the dogcatcher. Realizing this, Scamp wishes that he was home with his family. Angel sees Scamp on his way to the pound and goes to alert Tramp. Meanwhile, Scamp is placed in a cage with Reggie. Tramp, arriving just in time, fights off Reggie and rescues his son. Before they head home, Scamp apologizes to his father for running away, and the two dogs reconcile. They head to the junkyard, where Scamp retrieves his collar and traps Buster under piles of junk. The gang members abandon him and go to find families. Angel accompanies Scamp and Tramp home, and the family decides to adopt her.  
Lagaan
  In the small town of [[Champaner]] (in the state of [[Gujarat]], [[western India]]) during the height of the [[British Raj]] in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell, the commanding officer of the Champaner [[cantonment]], has imposed high taxes ("Lagaan") on people from the local villages. They are unable to pay due to losses because of a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan, the villagers pay a visit to [[Raja]] Puran Singh to seek help. Near the palace, they witness a [[Cricket in India|cricket]] match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into an argument with one of the British officers who insults them. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province for three years if the villagers can defeat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their current taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villagers in the province, despite their dissent.  Bhuvan begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth, who feels that her brother mistreated the villagers. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri, who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reciprocates Gauri's feelings, the woodcutter Lakha, who is in love with Gauri, grows jealous of Bhuvan and becomes a spy for Russell. He orders Lakha to join the villagers' team but not contribute in any way. Eventually, the villagers realise that winning equals freedom and one by one, they join the team. Short one player, Bhuvan invites an [[Dalit|untouchable]], Kachra, who can bowl spin. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers and convinces them to accept Kachra.  On the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra to bowl only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball&nbsp;— new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha [[Match fixing|deliberately drops many catches]]. Later that evening, Elizabeth notices Lakha meeting with Russell and immediately informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.  The next day Lakha redeems himself by taking a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score 295 runs, losing only three [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl with a now-worn ball, and takes a [[hat-trick]], which sparks the collapse of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings after the British are dismissed for 322 runs. Bhuvan and Deva, a Sikh who has played cricket earlier when he was a British [[sepoy]], give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board. In desperation, the villagers pray for success.  On the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his [[century (cricket)|century]], while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half-century, reducing the target to 30 runs of 18 balls. The game comes down to the last [[over (cricket)|over]] with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals [[no-ball]]. Bhuvan returns to bat and hits the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell runs backwards and catches it, believing that his team has won, until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.  Bhuvan's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realizing that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life. It is revealed, during the [[epilogue]], that Bhuvan and Gauri get married. But despite the historic triumph, Bhuvan's name was lost in the pages of history.  
Lan Yu (film)
  In the movie, Lan Yu (藍宇 / 蓝宇 Lán Yǔ), played by [[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]], a poor architecture student from northern China desperately needed money.  (According to the novel, he was about 16 or 17 years old and a virgin.) It is the late 1980s.  Meeting an acquaintance, Li Zheng (Li Huatong), who suggested to Lan Yu that the youth turn to prostitution, supposedly for one night only, to remedy his financial situation.  Naively, Lan Yu agreed.  That night, he arrived at Li's bar and pool hall to meet his John.  While there, Li introduced him to a successful businessman and international trader named Chen Handong ([[Hu Jun]]).  (Li is also Chen Handong's lieutenant and one of the few people knowing of his sexual inclination.) Lan Yu is evidently smitten for he left with the older man rather than the man he was to meet.  The night they spent together was not only a sexual, but also an emotional awakening, for the boy.  While Lan Yu immediately fell in love with Chen Handong, the older man, who was very closeted, wanted no emotional relationship, only sex.  He tried his best to avoid any attachment whatsoever with the youth, instead he showered Lan Yu with money and expensive gifts.  His efforts to turn Lan Yu's love for him into a dependent, loveless relationship failed until Lan Yu discovered Chen in the middle of the seduction of a young college athlete.  Crushed, Lan Yu left Chen's apartment.  They would not meet again until 4 June 1989, when Chen went looking for Lan Yu, fearing for the youth's safety amid the army's Tiananmen Square crackdown. Finding Lan Yu dishevelled and distraught, the incident reunited the two and opened a new chapter in their relationship.  Although Chen Handong still could not commit totally to Lan Yu, he now gave the youth time and attention as well as money, a car, and an expensive villa in the Beijing suburbs.  None of the material things were what Lan Yu really wanted although he now accepted them.  Chen now lived, somewhat surreptitiously, with Lan Yu and that was all that mattered to the latter.  Unfortunately, Chen Handong, being the only son of a top government bureaucrat, was under increasing pressure to marry.  After a whirlwind courtship, Chen Handong married Jingping (Su Jin), a translator who helped him negotiate a successful business deal with the Russians.   Upon this marriage, Lan Yu moved out of the villa (although it was in his name and legally his) and Chen Handong and he lost all contact.  Shortly thereafter, Chen Handong and Jingping divorced.  A chance meeting at the airport and Lan Yu's invitation to a home-cooked meal reunited the pair.  Finally, Chen Handong reciprocated the love and commitment Lan Yu had so freely given and the two were truly a couple.  But, Chen Handong's company, perhaps because of the Russian deal, had aroused government suspicion.  An investigation of charges of smuggling and money-laundering started.  With his father dead and no longer able to protect him, Chen Handong faced a long prison term, if not execution.  Lan Yu took his savings and the proceeds of the sale of his villa and all of Chen's other gifts and raised enough funds to get Chen Handong out of legal and financial trouble.  Unfortunately, just as he realised that the younger man was truly his beloved and his destiny, Lan Yu is killed in a traffic accident.  Three years later, Chen Handong is still grief-stricken and that is how the film begins with his thinking back on the past and what might have been.

Lajja (2001 film)
 Vaidehi ([[Manisha Koirala]]) lives with her husband Raghu ([[Jackie Shroff]]). On the outside, she lives a sophisticated life, but behind closed doors, her husband is abusive and has extramarital affairs. When she takes a stand for herself, she is banished from the household. She goes back to her parents' house but they too reject her. Vaidehi soon finds out that she is pregnant.  Raghu gets into a car accident, which results in him being unable to father a child. When he discovers that Vaidehi is pregnant, he calls her, faking remorse, and asks for her to return. Vaidehi agrees, thinking Raghu has mended his ways. Raghu and his father plot for the child to become their heir and if Vaidehi intervenes, she will be killed. Meanwhile, Vaidehi is informed by a friend about Raghu's true intentions, and so she escapes from his henchmen. She is helped by Raju ([[Anil Kapoor]]), a petty, but kindhearted thief. He hears Vaidehi's story and gives her money from his heist to help. To hide from Raghu and his henchmen, Vaidehi gatecrashes a wedding procession.  At the wedding, she meets Maithili ([[Mahima Chaudhry]]), a bride-to-be from a middle-class family. Maithili is marrying a man who hails from a rich background. The two women witness Maithili's father being hassled by demands for an opulent wedding, which he cannot afford, and is forced to pay dowry. Vaidehi tries to convince Raju to give his money from the heist. He initially refuses but changing his mind, he returns to give his heist money to Vaidehi. The groom's friend attempts to rape Maithili. As the wedding ceremony progresses, one of the guest recognises the heist money which initially belonged to him. Moreover, the groom's friend tells the groom's family that he spotted a man (Raju) in Maithili's room. Maithili is accused of having sexual relations with Raju in return for money, which leads Raju to accept his theft as the situation worsens. Having tolerated enough, Maithili insults the groom's family and they flee from the wedding.  Meanwhile, Vaidehi is found by Raghu, and forced into going with him. On the way, they encounter a protest mob. Raghu gets out of the car, which gives Vaidehi the chance to escape. She arrives in Haripur, a small town, where she meets Janki ([[Madhuri Dixit]]), a theatre actress in love with her colleague. Janki is pregnant, but not married. She doesn't care for society's norms. She is lusted after by the theatre director, Puroshottam ([[Tinu Anand]]), an older man who keeps his wife, Lata ([[Jaya Bhattacharya]]), confined to their house. Puroshottam talks against Janki to her lover, which creates a rift between them. She is asked to abort the child by her lover, as he suspects that he might not be the real father, indirectly accusing Janki of having sexual relations with the theatre director. Janki is outraged and messes up a scene during a performance of the Ramayan. This leads to an outcry from the audience and she is assaulted by the audience, leading to her having a miscarriage. Vaidehi confronts Puroshottam, who threatens to call her husband. However, Lata intervenes and takes Vaidehi to the station and puts her on a train.  The train is robbed by bandits but the passengers are saved by Bhulwa ([[Ajay Devgn]]), a local [[dacoit]]. Vaidehi faints at the sight of blood, and Bhulwa takes her to the local midwife, Ramdulaari ([[Rekha]]). Ramdulaari bravely opposes the village leaders Virendra ([[Gulshan Grover]]) and Gajendra ([[Danny Denzongpa]]) who exploit innocent women, young and old. When her educated son Prakash ([[Sharman Joshi]]), who is trying to educate the villagers against the wishes of Virendra and Gajendra, falls in love with Gajendra's daughter, Sushma ([[Aarti Chhabria]]), all hell breaks loose. Gajendra slyly locks Ramdulaari in her house and sets out to find Prakash. When Prakash runs away with Sushma, Virendra and Gajendra, along with their goons, rape Ramdulaari and burn her alive. In a fit of rage, Bhulwa and his army kill Virendra and his goons. Vaidehi escapes with Sushma and Prakash.   Gajendra is making a move into politics, so when he is applauded by the local authorities, Vaidehi intervenes and exposes Gajendra as a rapist and fraud through a heart-wrenching speech, which drives all the women in the audience to assault Gajendra, who is later killed by Bhulwa. The speech changes Raghu's attitude towards Vaidehi and he decides to mend his ways. The two return to New York as a proper married couple. Vaidehi gives birth to a daughter who is named Ramdulaari. She meets Raju again, who is now a taxi driver and married to Maithili. She invites him to a charity dance show with Janki in the main role, wherein all the money from her shows goes to fund women's organisations in India.  
Landscape Suicide
 Prior to the release of ''Landscape Suicide'', Benning had already built a reputation for his exceedingly long, stationary camera shots of landscapes and industrial scenes. ''Landscape Suicide'' merged the mesmerizing monotony of these structuralist film approaches with the fact-finding ethos of documentary filmmaking. <ref>https://www.closeupfilmcentre.com/film_programmes/2012/james-benning-landscape-suicide/</ref> The film recounts, and parallels, two murders that took place thirty years apart: Bernadette Protti's stabbing of high school friend Kirsten Costas in Northern California in early 1984, and the infamous double homicide and taxidermies committed by Ed Gein in Northern Wisconsin three decades prior.   In the words of Chicago Tribune film critic Dave Kehr, "It`s part of Benning`s project in ''Landscape Suicide'' to reclaim these deaths from the realm of popular fiction and place them again in a real world. His method is, alternatively, both to refuse to look (the killings, made familiar and even banal by their endless cinematic representation, are not depicted) and to look harder than anyone else."<ref>http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-05/features/8701090926_1_ed-gein-camera-cinematic</ref>  By focusing his camera on the sunny tennis courts and barren fields of each setting, Benning indicts the psychological role that each environment (and its inhabitants) might have played in the murders as much as he might the murderers themselves.  
Lara Croft: Tomb Raider
  In pursuit of a diamond, [[Lara Croft]] battles a large robot in an Egyptian tomb; she disables it by ripping out its circuits. The diamond, revealed to be a memory card, is inserted into a laptop computer inside the robot to play music. The fight took place in a practice area of Lara's home and the robot was programmed by her technical assistant Bryce to challenge her in combat. The first phase of a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|planetary alignment]], culminating in a [[solar eclipse]], arrives. In [[Venice]], the [[Illuminati]] search for a key that will rejoin halves of "The Triangle", which must be completed by the final phase. Manfred Powell, an Illuminati member, assures that they are almost ready, but actually has no idea of the location.  Hilary, Lara's butler, tries to interest her in several projects, but on account of the anniversary of her father's disappearance, Lara is not interested. She dreams of her father telling her about the alignment and an object linked to it, the Triangle of Light, and awakens to a clock ticking. Lara finds the clock and Bryce discovers a strange device hidden inside. Lara consults a clock expert friend of her father's, Wilson, who claims no knowledge of the clock or the Triangle when Lara mentions a possible connection. Wilson gives Lara's name to Powell in regards of the clock. Lara encounters Alex West, a fellow tomb raider with unscrupulous methods and for-profit attitude.   Lara shows Powell photographs of the clock; she later points out to Bryce that Powell was lying about his knowledge. That night, armed commandos invade the house and steal the clock despite Lara's attempts to fend them off. The next morning, a letter from her father, arranged to arrive after the beginning of the alignment, explains that the clock is the key to retrieve the halves of the Triangle of Light, an object of phenomenal destructive power which grants its wielder power over time and space. The Triangle destroyed the city it was housed in after misuse of its power. It was then separated in half; one was hidden in a [[Cambodia]]n tomb, the other in the ruined city, now part of modern-day Siberia. Her father urges her to find and destroy both halves before the Illuminati can find it.  [[Image:Temple Facade-Angkor.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Ta Keo]] at [[Angkor]].]] In Cambodia, West figures out part of the puzzle on how to retrieve the triangle half. However, West is incorrect and Lara figures out the true puzzle, informing West and Powell that what they thought was the correct holder for the key was but a reflection. She reminds Powell that they only have so many seconds before the opportunity is gone for another 5,000 years. Powell, realizing West was wrong and that Lara is right, and that she is the only one who can solve the puzzle, throws her the clock. Lara proves she is right as she inserts the key and the half of the triangle is revealed. Before everyone can leave, the liquid metal which came out with the piece brings the statues in the temple to life and attacks the team killing some members. Lara is left to fight off and destroy a huge six-armed guardian statue which is the last one to come to life. She successfully defeats it and leaves the temple by diving through a waterfall. She then travels to a Buddhist town where a young monk welcomes her. After a worship service, an aged monk who serves as the chief gives Lara some tea and as they converse, he reminds her to get a much needed rest to continue her father's mission, implying that that monk might have been Lara's father's acquaintance.  She and Powell arrange to meet in Venice, since each of them has what the other needs to finish the Triangle. Powell proposes a partnership to find the Triangle, and informs Lara that her father was a member of the Illuminati, which she vehemently denies. Though hesitant at first, she, along with Bryce, meets with Powell for the trip to Siberia.  Entering the tomb, the teams discover a giant model of the solar system, which activates as the alignment nears completion. Lara retrieves the last half of the Triangle, but when Powell tries to complete it, the halves will not fuse. He realizes that Lara knows the solution to the puzzle, and kills West in order to persuade her to complete the Triangle to save both West's life and her father's. Lara reluctantly complies, and they then struggle for control of the Triangle, with Lara prevailing and saving West's life.  Lara then finds herself in a strange alternate existence facing her father Lord Richard Croft ([[Jon Voight]]). He explains that it is a "crossing" of time and space, and urges her to destroy the Triangle instead of using it to save his life. Lara leaves her father and returns to the chamber, where time is slowly running backwards from the point where Powell killed West. Croft takes the knife Powell threw into West's chest and reverses it, then destroys the Triangle, which returns time to its normal flow and directs the knife into Powell's shoulder. The chamber begins to self-destruct. As everyone turns to leave, Powell reveals to Lara that he murdered her father and stole his pocket watch with a picture of Lara's mother inside as a trophy. Lara and Powell engage in a hand-to-hand fight. Lara kills him, retrieves the pocket watch, and escapes as the chamber crumbles.  At the mansion, Hilary and Bryce are shocked to see Lara wearing a dress. She goes into the garden to her father's memorial, then returns inside, where Bryce has a reprogrammed SIMON, ready to challenge Lara once again. Hilary reveals a silver tray holding Lara's pistols, which she takes with a smile.  
The Last Castle
 [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] Eugene Irwin ([[Robert Redford]]) is brought to a maximum security [[military prison]] to begin a ten-year sentence for his decision (in violation of a presidential order) to send U.S. troops on a mission in [[Burundi]], resulting in the deaths of eight soldiers. Colonel Winter ([[James Gandolfini]]), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.  Winter, who has never seen combat, resents the remark. He then takes exception to what he perceives as Irwin's attempt to change the attitudes of the prisoners, his admiration for Irwin fading fast. On one occasion, Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, Corporal Ramon Aguilar ([[Clifton Collins, Jr.]]), who had made the mistake of saluting Irwin in the prison yard.  Continuing to observe acts of cruelty, Irwin attempts to unify the prisoners by building a "castle wall" of stone and mortar at the facility, which in many ways resembles a medieval castle. Envying the respect Irwin is clearly receiving, Winter orders his guards to destroy the wall. Aguilar, directly involved in its construction, takes a stand before the bulldozer. Winter orders sadistic sharpshooter Cpl. Zamorro (David Alford) with a coded hand gesture to fire a normally non-lethal [[rubber bullet]] directly at Aguilar's head, killing him.  After the wall is destroyed, Irwin and the inmates pay final respects to Aguilar in formation. Winter later tries to make amends with Irwin, who calls him a disgrace to the uniform and demands his resignation.  The prisoners begin to behave like soldiers around Irwin, using code words and gestures, infuriating the commandant. Winter reaches out to an anti-social prisoner named Yates ([[Mark Ruffalo]]), a former officer and Apache helicopter pilot convicted of running a drug-smuggling ring. Yates is bribed to inform about Irwin's plans in exchange for a reduced sentence.  He lets the commandant know that Irwin intends to take over the prison, then raise the flag upside down, a signal of distress.  Irwin organizes a plot to throw the prison into chaos. His intent is to show a friend, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Wheeler ([[Delroy Lindo]]), the commandant's superior officer, that the commandant is unfit and should be removed from command under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. During a visit, Winter receives a letter threatening the kidnapping of General Wheeler by the prisoners. After ordering his men into action, Winter discovers that the scheme was a just a bluff.  Irwin uses the event to gain intelligence on how the prison guards would react during an actual uprising.  Yates discreetly steals a U.S. flag from the warden's office during one of his visits and reveals he is on Irwin's side; Winter orders all the prisoners to be outside in the yard in an attempt to prevent their plot, but this was part of their plan as well, and the riot commences.  Using improvised weapons, the prisoners capture an armored vehicle and the prison helicopter, which Yates uses to kill Zamorro. The prisoners place a call to Wheeler's headquarters and inform him of the riot. Winter has little time to regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege, so orders the use of live ammunition against the prisoners.  Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's ultimate goal is to raise the American flag [[Flag desecration#United States|upside down]], a classic signal of distress. Irwin's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards, armed with live ammunition. The colonel orders that men to lay down, but they refuse.  He order them again, telling them that the sharpshooters that are now in place above them will fire if they do not obey.  Just before he gives the order, Irwin orders his fellow prisoners to lay down.  The colonel then tells Irwin to give him back his flag, to which Irwin replies, "It's not your flag."  Irwin then turns and begins walking toward the flagpole in order to raise the flag.  The colonel, increasingly unsettled, tells Irwin, "You will not raise that flag upside down."  But Irwin continues to walk, while the colonel continues to order him not to raise the flag upside down.  Seeing that he is having no effect on Irwin, the colonel orders the shooters to fire on Irwin.  But they do not.

But after Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he lifts the flag.  As his life ebbs away, Irwin continues to raise the flag.  Peretz places the Colonel under arrest for the shooting of Irwin. The prisoners, now standing again, begin to salute the flag.  To his astonishment, Winter now sees that Irwin has actually raised the flag in the correct manner, which means that the colonel had shot Irwin for no good reason.  The flag flies above the prison's walls as General Wheeler arrives.  Colonel Winter is led away in handcuffs. The inmates build a new wall as memorial to their fallen comrades. Aguilar and Irwin's names are among those carved onto the castle's wall.

Valerie had run off, leaving behind her shoe.  Paula goes to Jane's house to get her children, where she tells her that Nik is innocent of Valerie's disappearance.

Nik and Paula are seen happily spending time with their kids.  The movie ends with Sonja and Leon dancing together seductively.  Leon, who at the beginning of the film finds dancing with his wife difficult, now appears to be doing well.  He looks Sonja directly in her eyes and dances, just as she always wanted.

Encouraged by her sorority sisters, Elle decides to also enroll in Harvard Law in order to win Warner back. After much effort, Elle manages to gain admission but soon discovers that the personalities and atmosphere in Harvard are very different from hers and she is thrown out of class during her first day by the strict Professor Stromwell and a classmate named Vivian for not having prepared for the lecture. Elle is later horrified to discover that Vivian is Warner's fiancee.   None of Elle's classmates take her seriously and she is friendless at the university aside from Emmett, an associate at Harvard who gives her advice on handling each of her professors, and a beautician named Paulette who encourages her to try to win over Warner. Elle repeatedly tries to fit in with the others but is repeatedly rebuffed. Vivian even goes so far as to lie to Elle about a party invitation, falsely telling her that it was a costume party, humiliating her in front of her classmates. She is also ridiculed by Warner after informing him of her intent to apply for a prestigious internship with Professor Callahan, as Warner tells her that she is not smart enough and is wasting her time. This motivates Elle to prove herself, as she begins to study law seriously and even manages to use her knowledge to help Paulette reclaim her dog from an ex-boyfriend.   After several months of dramatic improvement, Elle, along with Warner, Vivian and another student Enid Wexler, is given an internship at Callahan's law office, where they will be working on a murder case, defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who refuses to produce an alibi for the murder. Recognizing her as a personal role model and former Delta Nu member, Elle manages to discover the alibi but keeps it secret due to a personal promise with Brooke, which impresses Vivian and leads to the two women beginning to bond after it was revealed that she was keeping the alibi confidential and that Warner blatantly said to sell out her friend for benefits; during their alone time, Vivian revealing to Elle that Warner only got into Harvard via a call from his father (a distinguished alumni) to the school board, because he was on the waiting list.  During the trial Elle manages to find holes in the prosecution's case such as proving that the prosecution's main witness was lying/perjuring about having an affair with Brooke, pointing out that he is gay. Seemingly impressed, Callahan invites Elle to his office later that evening, where he makes a sexual pass at her. Vivian witnesses the pass but not Elle angrily spurning his advances and angrily accuses Elle of using her looks to get ahead. Elle considers leaving Harvard and goes to Paulette's salon to let her know, but is encouraged by Professor Stromwell, who happened to be at the salon.  When the trial resumes, Emmett explains to Brooke how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, leaving Vivian to regret her actions towards Elle. Brooke then decides to fire Callahan and replace him with Elle, who is able to defend her due to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court rule 3.03, which allows Elle to legally appear on a defendant's behalf under Emmett's supervision, as he is a licensed attorney. Although nervous, Elle manages to catch Brooke's step-daughter Chutney in a lie during cross-examination, as she claimed that she could not have heard the gun shot because she was washing her hair after getting a perm earlier that day. Elle then points out that freshly permed hair cannot be washed within a 24 hour period without deactivating the perming chemical [[ammonium thioglycolate]], which Chutney should know as she had received over 30 perm treatments during her life.

The movie reveals the princess' boldness through scenes where she breaks tradition by walking among the commoners to meet her lover Prince Pirenthorathep, who in turn pledges that he will come to her aid whenever she wants.  Her father insists that she must marry Prince Thienraja, the son of the second king of the realm. In an attempt to escape a marriage she does not want, she runs away and is captured by the principal king who explains the possible problems her marriage to Piren might cause to Siam. For the good of the kingdom, she marries Prince Tien to keep peace in the royal families. From this point on she remains loyal to the man she likes but does not love and remains strongly independent.  The principal king dies, and Tien's father inherits the throne. A few years later, [[smallpox]] makes its first appearance in Siam and the king is stricken with the disease. On his deathbed he extracts a promise of support for his young son from Chai Raja, his nephew, and Tien. [[Burma]] invades in the north and Chai Raja assumes the throne to protect Siam. He executes the child king, which Tien protests but on Suriyothai's advice accepts Chai Raja as his ruler.  Chai Raja's wife, Queen Jitravadee, dies shortly after giving birth to the heir Yodfa. The king takes a new consort, Srisudachan, and has a son by her. After several years of peace, Chai Raja leaves the capital, [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], for a military campaign in the north. Soon after, Srisudachan, descended from the deposed U-Tong dynasty, takes Boonsri Worawongsa, another U-Tong descendant, as a lover and starts plotting to take over the throne.  The king is wounded in battle and comes back to the capital to recuperate, where Srisudachan poisons him and attempts to blame the deed on Tien. Tien saves his own life by becoming a [[Buddhist]] monk. Srisudachan proceeds by naming Worawongsa as regent and promptly poisoning young Yodfa, thereby assuming power. Suriyothai then summons her old friend Piren, who was Chai Raja's troop commander, to help set things right. His troops ambush and kill Worawongsa and Srisudachan, and Tien accepts the throne despite his monkhood.  Upon hearing this, Burmese King Hongsa invades again and lays siege to Ayutthaya. In a dramatic finale, however, the Burmese invade the new kingdom, and Queen Suriyothai heroically rides into battle with her husband and her unrequited childhood love at her side.<ref>MovieGuide.

The Legend of Zu
 Peacekeeping immortals living in clans inhabit a mythical mountain range called Zu, which is situated between Heaven and Earth. A demon called Insomnia desires to rule Zu and the world below, so it begins to destroy the various clans. In the [[Kunlun Mountains]], Dawn sends away her apprentice, King Sky, because she believes that their emotional attachment to each other hinders their progress. She gives him her weapon, the Moon Orb, to help him train. He is to return only after he has attained a higher level. If she cannot be found, the Moon Orb will find her. Moments after they part, Insomnia attacks Dawn and disintegrates her.  200 years later, at [[Mount Emei|Omei]], Grandmaster White Brows senses darkness coming and despatches his student, Red, to investigate. King Sky joins Red and the Omei clan to fight Insomnia. White Brows engages and weakens Insomnia with his weapon, the Sky Reflector. Insomnia retreats into the legendary Blood Cave after its defeat with Omei's top warriors in pursuit. At the cave, King Sky notices Enigma, an Omei member who resembles Dawn. White Brows warns them that the cave is capable of draining the powers of those who venture near it. Red and King Sky risk their lives to battle Insomnia in the cave, and narrowly escape after White Brows sacrifices the Sky Reflector to save them. With Insomnia absorbing the cave's energy, White Brows orders Red to guard the cave entrance while the Omei members regroup and return to base.  White Brows tries to combine Enigma's Heaven Sword with Hollow's Thunder Sword, the two guardian weapons of Omei, to form a new weapon, the Flaming Sword of Thunder. Unfortunately, the fusion process fails and rebounds, causing Hollow to die and Enigma to be seriously injured. King Sky rescues Enigma. White Brows tells King Sky that Enigma is Dawn's reincarnation. He then appoints King Sky as the chief of Omei while he enters a new dimension to find a weapon to destroy Insomnia. Before leaving, he resurrects Hollow, who is renamed Ying, in the hope that the reborn Hollow can wield the Thunder Sword in their most desperate hour. However, when Ying turns out to be rather inept, King Sky tries to take his place and use the Thunder Sword himself, but fails and ends up being burnt to death. Enigma mourns his loss and buries his charred remains.  In the meantime, Red is possessed by Amnesia, a flower demon, while standing guard outside the Blood Cave. He returns to Omei, decimates the clan, and captures Enigma. Amnesia then destroys the rest of Omei. To the Omei survivors' frustration, Ying has yet to reawaken his past avatar and unlock his abilities. However, during a match against Thunder, an Omei swordsman, Ying suddenly recalls his past life and regains his powers. Concurrently, King Sky returns to life just in time to intercept and receive the new weapon found by White Brows. With the new weapon, King Sky joins Ying and the Omei survivors in confronting the possessed Red at the Blood Cave.  After Ying rescues Enigma, they return to Omei to stop Insomnia's final assault. King Sky exorcises Red, but the latter sacrifices himself to destroy Amnesia. At Omei, Enigma and Ying successfully fuse their swords to form a new weapon to defeat Insomnia. King Sky joins the duo and they weaken Insomnia. Enigma possesses Insomnia to prevent the demon from escaping, giving King Sky a chance to destroy it. Just as Insomnia is destroyed, Enigma remembers herself as Dawn and tells King Sky she is happy to find him again before disappearing. After the battle, Enigma is reincarnated as a new immortal and Mount Omei is restored. King Sky parts with the Omei to rebuild his clan.

Lijmen/Het Been
 The film is set around 1938. During an [[auction]], Mr. Boormans is put into a [[psychiatric hospital]] after he bid 32,000 [[Belgian franc]]s for a wortheless piece of paper. Frans Laarmans visits the [[psychiatrist]]s claiming Boormans is not crazy and there is a story behind the bid.  When Laarmans's mother dies, the Laarmans family decides that Laarmans should pay for the [[embalming]] of her [[corpse]]. As he does not have the money, Laarmans visits Boormans, who is the publisher of the ''World Magazine for Finance, Trade, Industry, Art and Science'', a publication Boormans claims is sold worldwide and translated into many languages. He represents it as a reputable consumers' journal, comparing different companies in the same industry. Boormans informs Laarmans that, by coincidence, the next edition is about the funeral and undertaking industry.  Boormans visits the undertakers and a deal whereby his company will be featured in the magazine. The offer comes with two conditions, namely that in addition to the normal print and distribution, the undertaker must order a large number of copies for own purposes, and that the purchase of the magazines will be at a significant discount if the undertaker in turn gives Laarmans a discount for the embalming services. The undertaker agrees.  Boormans, who is looking for a new assistant, hires Laarmans and sends him out in search for new customers. Mrs. Lauwereyssen, the owner of a business in [[elevator]]s, is interested. In addition to the copies of the magazine distributed by Boormans, she agrees to purchase a further 100,000 copies for own purposes.  Laarmans then finds out the "World Magazine" is a fraud, in that the magazine is not distributed to the public, but only the copies purchased by the featured company exist. The magazine does not have any subscribers and is, in effect, merely an expensive advertising brochure using unproven figures and fake competitors. Only the information of the customer is "valid", although it too is also based upon lies and twisted figures.  It turns out Mrs Lauwereyssen only placed the order as her company is almost [[bankrupt]]. She now hopes to become an international awarded entrepreneur. The extra money she is about to earn will be used for acute surgery on her infected leg. Laarmans feels sorry for Mrs Lauwereyssen and tries to convince her not to sign the contract or to reduce the amount of obliged prints, but is not able to convince her. Later he speaks with Boormans in an attempt to void the contract or to reduce the price and Boormans agrees that Mrs Lauwereyssen can pay the invoice on 12 month terms. In meantime Mrs Lauwereyssen is aware she has been swindled. She is so upset she refuses not to pay last instalment.  Some time later, Boormans and Laarmans meet Mrs Lauwereyssen at the market. Her leg has been amputated. Boormans feels remorse and makes up tells her there has been a calculation error and offers 32,000 Belgian francs as a credit note. However, Mrs Lauwereyssen does not want to take the money. A dismayed Boormans decides to give the money to Mr Van Kamp, another customer he cheated, and who is now in financial problems. Van Kamp also refuses Boormans money.  Boormans conscience continues to trouble him and he sues Mrs Lauwereyssen in an attempt to force her to take the money. The judge dismisses the case as there is no evidence that Mrs Lauwereyssen paid too much. Some time later the elevator company becomes bankrupt.  When Boormans and Laarmans attend an auction, Boormans, still having moral qualms, bids 32,000 Belgian francs for a wortheless piece of paper.  Laarmans resigns and starts a shop selling cheese. He meets Mrs Lauwereyssen who forgives him, as she feels that she should have known the magazine was a fraud. Furthermore, when she signed the contract she knew that her leg was not able to be saved and that an amputation was inevitable.  The film ends when Laarmans meets Boormans in a museum. Boormans intends to talk the [[curator]] into taking 1.5 million copies for the next release of the "World Magazine".

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
  In the Second Age of [[Middle-earth]], the lords of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] are given [[Rings of Power]]. Unbeknownst to them, the [[Sauron|Dark Lord Sauron]] forges the [[One Ring]] in [[Mount Doom]], infusing into it a great part of his power to dominate, through it and at a distance, the other Rings, so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of men and elves battles Sauron’s forces in [[Mordor]], where Prince [[Isildur]] of [[Gondor]] severs Sauron's finger, and the Ring with it, thereby destroying his physical form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. Unfortunately, the Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, and, rather than destroy the Ring, Isildur takes it for himself. Isildur is later killed by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, until it is found by [[Gollum]], who owns it for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a [[Hobbit]] named [[Bilbo Baggins]].  Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], reuniting with his old friend, [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]. Bilbo reveals that he intends to leave the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted by the Ring and tries to keep it for himself, Gandalf intervenes. Gandalf, suspicious of the Ring, tells Frodo to keep it secret and to keep it safe. Gandalf then investigates the Ring, discovers its true identity, and returns to warn Frodo. Gandalf also learns that Gollum was tortured by Orcs, and that Gollum uttered two words during his torture: "Shire" and "Baggins." Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]]. Gandalf rides to [[Isengard]] to meet with fellow wizard [[Saruman]] the White, but learns that he has joined forces with Sauron, who has unleashed the [[Ringwraith]]s to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrives, and they are instead aided by a ranger named [[Aragorn|Strider]], a friend of Gandalf's, who escorts them to [[Rivendell]].  The Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, and one stabs Frodo with a cursed [[Morgul blade]]. [[Arwen]], an elf and Strider’s lover, comes to Frodo’s aid and successfully takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed. Frodo meets Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on the back of a giant [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]]. Arwen’s father, [[Elrond|Lord Elrond,]] holds a council that decides the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While the members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf [[Legolas]], dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], [[Boromir]] of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur’s heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman’s magic forces them to travel through the Mines of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], much to Gandalf's displeasure.  The Fellowship discovers that the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and they are attacked by Orcs and a cave [[troll]]. They defeat them, but are confronted by an ancient demon called a [[Balrog]]. Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but it drags Gandalf down into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now commanded by Aragorn, reaches [[Lothlórien]], home to elves [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest, and that one of his friends will try to take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of [[Uruk-hai]] to track down and kill the Fellowship.  The Fellowship leaves Lothlórien by river to [[Parth Galen]]. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to take the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone. The Fellowship is then ambushed by the Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain. After slaying the chieftain, Aragorn watches Boromir die peacefully. Sam follows Frodo, accompanying him to keep his promise to Gandalf to protect Frodo, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry and Pippin.

When they hear that Mary's mother has died, Paulie nicknames her "Mary Brave."   Mary observes the intimacy between her two dormmates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. Paulie and Tori's relationship is close and Paulie is full of life. At one point she turns a quiet afternoon on the campus into a music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch. In another moment, she defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who humiliates her when she does not understand basic math.  When the three are running one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal. While she is tending to the falcon, Mary and Tori come across some boys from the nearby boys school. One flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he likes her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, "He liked my tits." When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, "And have all those gross guys groping me? I'd rather stay home."  Over time, Paulie and Tori become more comfortable showing affection in front of Mary. It progresses from a quick kiss on the lips in front of her, to the two sharing a bed while Mary is sleeping.  One morning, Victoria's sister and friends rush into the room to wake up the older girls. Paulie is lying in Tori's bed, and it is clear that the two are topless. Horrified silence falls over everyone.  Mary pushes Tori's sister out of the room and closes the door. Tori angrily tells Paulie to get out of her bed. When confronted by her sister, she tries to extinguish her sister's suspicions by telling her Paulie has an unrequited crush on her and crawled into her bed. Her sister promises to "fix" the rumors about Tori and not tell their parents anything. As she walks away from this conversation, Victoria collapses into tears.  In the library, Victoria explains to Mary that her family, her parents and her sister, are strongly homophobic, and she must stop the relationship to prevent their rejection.  Mary sympathizes with both of her friends, as she too feels rejected by her father, who does not bother to show up to a father/daughter dance. The break up is not clean however.

Meanwhile, Victoria dates the guy she met from the boys school and hardly speaks to Paulie.  Victoria has sex with her boyfriend, which prompts Paulie to declare a duel with him. After she kicks his leg, during a fencing match, throwing him to the ground, she demands that he give up her queen. When he brushes her off, she stabs her sword into his leg. Mary rushes to stop her. Paulie then runs off. Mary runs to Victoria's soccer match, which is being watched by the principal and the main teacher. Just after reaching the group, Mary sees Paulie, sobbing from the top of a building. Crying out for her beloved, she jumps to her death.

The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
 In 1961, scientist Dr. Paul Armstrong ([[Larry Blamire]]) and his  wife Betty ([[Fay Masterson]]) drive into the mountains. Dr. Armstrong is searching for a [[meteorite]] that has fallen in the nearby woods, suspected to contain the rare element [[Fictional elements, isotopes and atomic particles|atmosphereum]]. Another scientist in the area, Dr. Roger Fleming ([[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]]) questions Ranger Brad (Dan Conroy) about Cadavra Cave, a site rumored to contain a "Lost Skeleton."  That evening, both the Armstrongs and Dr. Fleming observe another falling meteor. A short time later a farmer (Robert Deveau), encountered by the Armstrongs on their way to the cabin, is mutilated by a mysterious beast. The second meteorite is actually a spaceship carrying two aliens. Kro-Bar ([[Andrew Parks]]) and Lattis (Susan McConnell) are from the planet Marva and are now stranded on [[Earth]], in need of the element atmosphereum to repair their powerless ship. The ship's pet mutant ([[Darren Reed]]) escapes from its cage while they are distracted.  The next day, Dr. Roger Fleming finds Cadavra Cave and locates the Lost Skeleton. The Skeleton commands Fleming to bring atmosphereum to return him to life. Meanwhile, Dr. Armstrong and Betty venture into the woods, discovering the meteorite just outside Cadavra Cave. Dr. Fleming overhears them and plots to steal the meteorite from the pair. Kro-Bar and Lattis also journey into the woods, locating the cabin with  the meteorite. Using a device called the "transmutatron," they disguise themselves as "Earth people" and clumsily manage to talk their way into the cabin, having been mistaken for the property owners. Not long after they arrive, Dr. Fleming discovers the aliens' transmutatron, left outside the cabin since it would ruin their disguise. He uses it to create an ally for himself, the alluring Animala (Jennifer Blaire), created from four different animals. After briefly teaching Animala the basics of human interaction, he leads her to the cabin and convinces the Armstrongs to invite him inside.  Soon it becomes clear to Lattis and Kro-Bar (calling themselves "Turgaso" and "Bammin" on Earth in an effort to pass as earth humans) that Fleming knows their secret. They soon cooperate in stealing the meteorite, after Betty is psychically attacked by the Skeleton and Dr. Armstrong is entranced by Animala's dancing. The evil scientist tricks the pair, however, and the Skeleton uses his [[Psychokinesis|mind powers]] to freeze the aliens in their tracks once Dr. Fleming has the meteorite. Dr. Fleming and Animala soon use the atmosphereum to resurrect the Skeleton. Meanwhile, Betty, waiting for Dr. Armstrong to come back, encounters the Mutant, who appears to fall in love with her, but she is terrified and faints.  While Fleming and Animala are resurrecting the skeleton, Armstrong arrives and encounters the unfrozen aliens. They also find Betty, who has realized that the mutant has some sort of feelings for her.  After bonding over a meal, the four head off to try to obtain the meteorite before it can be used to resurrect the skeleton, but they are attacked by the Mutant. Dr. Armstrong is injured in the fight, but realizes that the monster does not want to harm Betty.

The film commences with Kaitlyn in a mathematics class. She is ecstatic because she has won a prize on a lottery ticket. It is soon revealed that Kaitlyn and her friends are saving money in order to travel to Amsterdam. Kaitlyn is a young girl who is willing to take extreme risks in order to get what she wants. She seems academically inclined. For example, she is quick to answer a question correctly even though she was not paying attention in class. She also seems to be well-respected and popular in school. For example, many of her classmates attend her birthday where they play poker and Kaitlyn manages to win the game.  Kaitlyn views the recent sequence of events as a means by which to raise money for her trip. She soon becomes involved in sporting gambling in order to make more money for her trip. Her parents view her enthusiasm for sports such as basketball and football as merely a phase. Her mother suspects that Kaitlyn watches the sports in order to watch the opposite sex. Her father, however, advises her to be cautious and to never make a bet over five dollars. He also uses Kaitlyn's new interest as a means by which to teach Kaityln's brother mathematics.  As Kaitlyn begins to lose money, she starts behaving more erratically. She steals her mother's credit card, becomes addicted to Internet gambling, neglects her personal appearance and some of her male classmates assault her physically because she did not pay them the money that she had promised. Because of this she then borrows money from a shady [[loan shark]]. The stakes increase when Kaitlyn becomes involved in illegal gambling. By this time, her life is out of control, she lies about the extent of her problems and she loses more money than she ever thought possible.  Once her parents discover the true nature of Kaitlyn's troubles, she is at the point where she is forced by the loan shark, to use her body as a means by which to overcome her debts. Her mother rescues her and Kaitlyn admits to her family how gambling has overtaken her life.

Mad Love (2001 film)
 [[Tordesillas]], 1554. Seventy-four years old, Queen Joanna of Castile, called Juana la Loca (Joanna the Madwoman), is still mourning the loss of her husband who died a half century before. Joanna remembers with emotion the man she loved passionately, but who brought her ruin. She does not fear death, she says, because death would allow her to be reunited with her husband. Their story goes back almost 60 years.  In 1496, Joanna, the third child of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], is leaving Spain through the port of [[Laredo, Cantabria|Laredo]]. She is headed to [[Flanders]] to marry the Archduke of Austria, Philip, nicknamed the Handsome, a man she has never laid eyes on. The marriage has been arranged for political purposes. Joanna's siblings and her mother, Queen Isabella, bid her farewell.  Once in Flanders, Joanna, young and inexperienced, is immediately smitten by her handsome fiancé. He is equally pleased with his beautiful bride and orders the marriage to take place at that very moment so they can consummate their marriage without any delay. Their union is initially a great success. The political alliance between their two countries has been consolidated and Joanna and Philip are very attracted to each other. With his good looks and bed manners, Philip completely captivates his wife. Their passionate love making soon produces results. Joanna has a daughter, followed shortly after by a son. She gives birth to her son in an emergency bathroom delivery without any assistance, cutting the umbilical cord afterwards with her teeth.  A combination of love, lust and emotional dependency make the passionate Joanna deeply attached to her husband. Her love becomes consuming, but the intensity of her passion turns Philip away. He is a restless man who finds entertainment in going hunting and in the arms of other women. The deaths of Joanna's brother, the stillbirth of her brother's daughter, her older sister's death and her sister's son's death unexpectedly make her heir of the Castilian and Aragones crowns. However, she is not interested in government. Obsessed with her husband, Joanna surprises him in bed with a lover, who Joanna later successfully identifies as Inés de Brabante, one of the court ladies. In a fit of jealousy, Joanna cuts the long red hair of her rival. While Joanna despairs at her husband’s unfaithfulness, she receives further bad news. Her mother has died. Joanna thus becomes Queen of Castile and has to return to her kingdom. Her tantrums over her husband’s infidelities have made her start to become known as Joanna the Mad.   At the Castilian court in Burgos, the Queen is happily greeted by her subjects, but her marital life is still in turmoil. Philip is soon bewitched by the charms and spells of Aixa, a Moorish prostitute who uses her sexual attraction and black magic to secure Philip's favour. With this new lover, the King becomes noticeably indifferent toward his wife, which adds to her increasingly insane jealousy.  Against the background of this troubled marriage, there are two opposed political parties at court, one Flemish, the other Castilian. The conspiring Flemish usurpers are headed by Señor de Veyre, Philip's right-hand man. Their objective is to have Joanna declared insane and for Philip to take power away from her. Joanna has her own set of supporters, the loyal Castilian royalists, headed by the Admiral of Castile. The Admiral and the Queen's friend and confidant, Elvira, try unsuccessfully to rescue Juana from her marital obsessions.  However, it is not the government that is on the Queen's mind; she is fixated on retaining her husband’s love. To avoid any temptations at court, she hires only ugly-looking maids of honour to serve her, but in fact Aixa has been brought to court by Philip, passing as one of the court ladies under the name of Beatriz de Bobadilla. Unaware of this, the Queen relies on Beatriz to find a spell to help her retain her husband's love. Joanna is equally misguided in her attempt to regain Philip's attention by simulating a love affair with Captain Álvaro de Estúñiga, a close friend from her childhood. The Queen’s lack of control permits the manipulation of her enemies to have her declared incompetent to rule. The King, encouraged by Señor de Veyre, resolves to take the rule of the kingdom for himself and shove Joanna out of the way. He finds an unlikely ally in Joanna's own father, king Fernando, who has remarried and has no further interest in either the fate of his daughter or in the kingdom of Castile.  While her fate is decided at a court assembly, Joanna is able to successfully make her case, counting on the unquestionable support of her subjects. However, her powerful speech coincides with Philip falling gravely ill. Although she devotedly takes care of her husband, the doctors are unable to do anything for him. On his death bed, Philip apologises to his wife for his past excesses. After the death of her husband Joanna, heavily pregnant, takes on a long journey to the south of the country to bury her husband. She does not go far. Forced to stop to give birth to a daughter, Joanna never reaches her destination. Although she retains her title as queen, at the age of 28 she is locked as a madwoman in the castle of Tordesillas for the rest of her long life.   Philip's body was laid to rest in a nearby monastery, which Joanna was allowed to visit from time to time.  
Mach 2 (film)
  U.S. Senator Stuart Davis, running against the Vice-President, plans a trip to the Balkans to negotiate the release of American servicemen being held hostage by terrorists.  Before he leaves, he receives a disk documenting evidence that the Vice-President has been trying to revive the American economy by causing a war in the Balkans.  He announces his plans at Washington Dulles International Airport to show it to both sides in the hopes of ending the situation.  He boards Concorde flight 209 to Paris along with some Air Force Officers and news employees.   Unexpected Secret Service agents turn up and board the Concorde.  After takeoff, the secret service agents led by Barry Rogers, shoot an Air Force officer and his men hijack the Concorde in mid-flight.  Barry takes Stuart and the others hostage and forces him to hand over the disk in order to prevent the war being averted. In the cockpit, Barry announces to the Dulles International Airport air traffic controller that the agents are armed with a nuclear device and threaten to crash the Concorde into Paris.  Air Force Officer, Jack Tyree, arrives at the cockpit, where Stuart is held hostage, and overpowers one of Barry's men, accidentally shooting the co-pilot in the process.  Jack helps fly the Concorde and later frees Stuart. Later, another agent arrives and shoots Captain Roman and takes Jack hostage.  Having brought with them two pairs of parachutes, the men jump off the plane, after revealing that there was no nuclear device aboard the aircraft.  The two men land and steal a car and escape along some cliffs.   Elsewhere, two French Secret Service Agents that have apparently overheard the hijacking, chase Rogers and his men down the road towards a pre-prepared road block.  Rogers sets an electromagnetic pulse bomb to destroy the French car, until the officer at the roadblock fires a shell at the agents. They skid off the road, violently roll down the cliffs and break up, killing Barry and his men instantly.  On the Concorde, Jack and news employee Shannon Carpenter attempt to fly the Concorde but Jack can't fly an aircraft and is nicknamed "washout".  The aircraft's radio is damaged due to the previous fight with one of Barry's men. Since Shannon is a former mechanic, she repairs the radio and restores contact with Paris Air Traffic control.  Meanwhile, with it having been rumoured that the agents planted a nuclear device on the Concorde, Dulles air traffic control orders a nearby aircraft carrier to launch a fighter aircraft to intercept the Concorde before it reaches Paris.  On the aircraft, Shannon announces to Dulles and Paris Orly airport that there is no device on the aircraft. She barely manages to order the fighter to abort, after two near misses from its missiles.  Because of the explosion of a nearby missile fired from the fighter, the Concorde's fuel line is torn and is leaking fuel, compromising the arrival at Paris.  With the plane low on fuel, Jack, is instructed via radio to land the Concorde at the airport. The landing is successful and the passengers depart safely.  Shannon, having hidden the actual disk in the trash, hands over the disk containing confidential files to Stuart, making it possible for the war to be averted.

In an instant, his new film ''Ashes to Ashes'' is pushed back for a few months, the credit is given to someone else, his movie star girlfriend Sandra Sinclair leaves him, and his contract with the studio is dropped. Peter gets drunk and goes for a drive up the coast where he accidentally drives his car off a bridge to avoid an [[opossum]].  He comes to on an ocean beach experiencing [[amnesia]]. He is found by Stan Keller who helps him to the nearby town of Lawson, California and the local doctor named Doc Stanton to tend to his wounds. As the town welcomes him, Harry Trimble arrives and believes Peter to be his son Luke who went [[Missing in action|MIA]] during [[World War II]] nine years ago. Due to his amnesia, Peter accepts himself being treated as Luke by the rest of the town led by Mayor Ernie Cole as Sheriff Cecil Coleman tells Doc to "tell her slowly." Peter warms up to the town including getting to know Harry and Luke's girlfriend Adele Stanton who is Doc's daughter.  Peter adjusts to the new life and helps to renovate the Majestic, a movie theater that had become derelict due to hard times. Bob Leffert, a veteran of the war who knew Luke, does not believe Peter is Luke and fears Peter may be setting the town up for heartbreak given they had lost sixty other young men during the war. Despite this, Peter helps to restore the theater, invigorate the town, and encourages Mayor Cole to display a memorial commissioned by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] after the war that the town did not previously have the heart to display.  Meanwhile, Peter's disappearance leads [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Congressional committee]] member Elvin Clyde to believe Peter is a communist and he sends two federal agents Ellerby and Saunders to California to search for him.   Peter recovers from his amnesia when the Majestic shows his first movie, ''Sand Pirates of the Sahara'', just as Harry suffers from a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] before the reel change. Doc reports Harry's time is short and Peter cannot come to admit the truth allowing Harry to die believing he is Luke.  After the funeral, Peter admits the truth to Adele, who had already suspected it, and supports his decision to tell the rest of town. Before he can do so, federal agents Ellery and Saunders as well as Leo and some police officers arrive. When Sheriff Coleman asks if they need any help with anything, the federal agents reveal Peter's true identity to the whole town and give Peter a summons to appear before a congressional committee in Los Angeles. During their meeting, Leo advises Peter to agree to reveal a list of other named "communists" as to clear his own name. Peter has an argument with Adele over this decision and she gives him a letter she had gotten from the real Luke.  On the train station, Peter reads the letter which contains both Luke's awareness he might die in the war for a real cause, as well as a pocket-sized version of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Peter changes his mind at the session which is watched by all of Lawson and confronts Congressman Doyle during the televised session. Peter gives an impassioned speech about American ideals, which sways the crowd and forces the lawmakers to let him go free. As Peter discusses the result with Kevin, he learns that the girl he met in college was the one that had named him to the committee.  Peter attempts to return to his former career, but finds he cannot deal with the ridiculousness of their ideas and leaves Hollywood. Peter instead returns to Lawson fearing an unwelcome reception. Instead, he receives a hero's welcome from the town's citizens who have come to respect him as an individual. Peter then resumes ownership and management of The Majestic, he gets married to Adele, and the two have a son together.

A customer named Creighton Tolliver tells Ed that he is a businessman looking for investors to put up $10,000 in a new technology called ''dry cleaning''. Ed decides to collect money by anonymously blackmailing Doris's boss, "Big Dave" Brewster, whom he knows to be having an affair with Doris. Dave embezzles money from his department store to pay the blackmail. However, he soon pieces together the scheme, and beats Tolliver until he implicates Ed. Dave confronts Ed at the store and attempts to kill him, but Ed stabs Dave fatally with a cigar knife.  After Dave's funeral, his wife comes to Ed and confesses that, one day, she and Dave saw a UFO. Later, irregularities in the store's books are found. The police arrest Doris for embezzlement and Dave's murder. Ed is persuaded to hire Freddy Riedenschneider, a defense attorney from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], who arrives and takes up residence in the most expensive hotel in town. He proceeds to live lavishly on Doris's defense fund, which Frank obtained by mortgaging the barber shop. It is all for nothing, because on the morning of the trial Doris hangs herself in her cell. It is later revealed that she was pregnant when she hanged herself, but had not had sex with Ed for many years. Riedenschneider leaves town, and Frank, now deeply in debt, starts drinking heavily.  Ed makes regular visits to Rachel "Birdy" Abundas, a friend's teenage daughter, to hear her play the piano. Tormented by loneliness, he imagines helping her start a musical career and becoming her manager. The fantasy is crushed when a music teacher tells him that Birdy has no talent. Driving back from visiting the teacher, Birdy makes a pass at Ed and attempts to perform oral sex on him, causing Ed to lose control of the car and crash.  Ed awakens in a hospital bed and two police officers arrest him for murder. Tolliver's beaten body has been found with Ed's investment contract. The police speculate that Ed coerced Doris into embezzling the investment money, and when Tolliver found out, he was killed. Ed engages Riedenschneider for his defense. During Riedenschneider's opening statement, Frank attacks Ed, then a mistrial is declared. With no wealth left, Ed throws himself on the mercy of the court. The tactic fails to work, and the judge sentences him to death.  While waiting on death row, Ed writes his story to sell to a pulp magazine. Shortly before his execution, Ed sees a UFO outside the jailhouse. As Ed is electrocuted, he reflects on his fate, regretting none of his decisions and hoping to see Doris in the afterlife, both of them free of the mortal world's imperfections.  
The Man Who Sued God
 Advocate Steve Myers (Billy Connolly) is a disillusioned lawyer who becomes fed-up with the perceived corruption within the judicial system. He quits the law business and buys a small fishing boat and takes up fishing for a living.  His fishing boat is struck by lightning and explodes into pieces, burns and sinks. He informs his insurance company, which reviews and then subsequently declines his claim on the grounds that it is not liable as his fishing boat was destroyed due to an "[[Act of God]]".  Frustrated that his claim is repeatedly declined, Steve files a claim against God, naming church officials as representatives of God and thereby the respondents. The church leaders, their respective lawyers and their insurance company get together to find a way to settle this dilemma, which catches the fancy of the media. It is in Court that God's representatives will have to admit that the destruction of Steve's fishing boat was actually God's Act, accept and compensate him, or deny it altogether thereby denying God's existence, leaving the onus on Steve to prove his claim.  Myers's battle brings media attention leading to a meeting with journalist Anna Redmond (Judy Davis) who helps to raise his public profile, enlisting the support of others who had fallen victim to insurance companies' "Acts of God" clause. He also faces heavy criticism and protests from religious groups as his profile grows, and he backs the church into a disadvantageous position.  However, the attention takes its toll on Myers' family, who are exploited by the media, his ex-wife already crippled by debt as the guarantor of the boat. Steve faces a reality check as his family considers moving to Perth, on the other side of the country. Meanwhile, Anna Redmond comes under fire for a history of disputes and attacks on insurance companies, drawing criticism that the case is little more than a publicity stunt. Facing a drawn out legal battle and the impact it would have on those around him, Steve decides he has won a moral victory, and withdraws from the case but not before convincing the judge that insurance companies' use of the term "Acts of God" is a misleading term.

Max also learns that an animal shelter he visits next door to the school is being closed down to build Jindrake's opulent football stadium.  When Max's father, Donald ([[Robert Carradine]]), reveals that he is moving to [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]] for his boss, because he is unable to stand up for himself, Max realizes that he can do whatever he wants to his tormentors, facing no consequences because he will be gone by then. Enlisting his equally socially outcast friends, Robe ([[Josh Peck]]) and Megan ([[Zena Grey]]), Max sets up a variety of pranks, which include traumatizing Troy by playing the main theme song of the children's television show, ''MacGoogle the Highlander Frog'' (which frightened him as a child), then trapping him in the gym with a MacGoogle costume wearer; instigating a fight between Dobbs and the Evil Ice Cream Man by stealing the coolant coil for the ice cream truck and Dobbs's [[Personal digital assistant|handheld device]]; and ruining Jindrake's chances of becoming superintendent to succeed the current superintendent, Bobby "Crazy Legs" Knebworth ([[Clifton Davis]]) (an alumnus/star football player of the school) by planting animal pheromones within his breath spray, instigating a food fight in the cafeteria, and later by sabotaging his TV announcements by placing a cardboard cutout of Max mocking him.

Once inside, he is immediately beaten by the prison guards for misbehaving, and is subsequently approached by the prison governor. The governor offers Meehan a job as coach of the prison wardens' football team; not wanting to make enemies with the other prisoners, Meehan declines, and instead offers to train a team consisting of other inmates, who will take on the wardens in a practice match. Meehan then recruits the resident contraband dealer, Massive, as his right-hand man, and receives advice from an elderly convict, Doc, who teaches Meehan prison lore and warns Meehan to avoid making mistakes by revealing he was in prison for killing an enemy as well as the enemy's wife and child with a grenade.  Meehan wins the respect of the other inmates after he attacks an officer, Mr. Ratchett, who is severely beating Massive, and is then occupied with the task of training up his team of cons, including a maximum-security con named Monk. Meanwhile, the governor of the prison gets himself into trouble with "Barry the Bookie," an unlicensed bookie who was recommended to him by Sykes, the resident prison boss, and decides to try to make back the money he owes by betting on the prison guards' team. Doc is killed when Nitro, an unstable inmate and bomb expert, plants a bomb in Meehan's locker at the encouragement of Mr. Ratchett. Nitro is subsequently sent to another facility, but not to the minimum-security hospital he was promised – he is sent to an alternate facility where Ratchett reveals he will be heavily sedated all the time.  The match commences shortly after Doc's death. At half time, the inmates' team, Mean Machine is winning 1–0, and things are going well until the governor, fearing what will happen if he loses a second bet, attempts to blackmail Meehan into throwing the match. At first he puts his own interests before that of the team's, deliberately playing badly but as the final moments of the game tick down, he redeems himself, bravely using a square-ball to fellow inmate 'Billy the Limpet' to win the game for the cons. Afterward, the Captain of the Guards, Mr. Burton, refuses to co-operate with the governor's attempts to get revenge on Danny, instead congratulating him on the match. The governor's vehicle explodes, and Sykes informs him that he, and Barry the Bookie, will retaliate if he tries anything. Danny and Massive walk triumphantly across the pitch.

Later on, Marina runs over to Holly's house to tell her that she's found out about a party that Nat's girlfriend, Carolyn, is having.

Nat's girlfriend soon leaves with the other two guys;  while Marina wants to follow them, Holly begs her not to. However, when Marina gets up to leave, Holly kisses Nat and the two end up sleeping together. Marina sees them and becomes angry, telling Holly that Nat only had sex with her because he was stoned and probably didn't even recognize her.  The next morning, Nat wakes up Marina and asks her to leave a note with Holly that says what happened last night was "beautiful" but a case of bad timing, and that he looks forward to their future. However, Marina angrily rips up the note and goes to see Holly who is sitting in her yard reading a book. When Holly asks Marina if Nat said anything about the night before, Marina lies, and says "no", but reassures Holly that they will always have each other.

Ultimately, the three of them are reunited at a [[New Year's]] party, where Nat announces his intent to marry his girlfriend Isabel.  The next scene finds the girls in their late 20s, in 1989.

Eventually, Stone becomes President of the [[European Union]]<ref group=note>, preceded by Stone accepting a lesser position with the European Union in 1976.

To consolidate his power, Stone pressures the [[President of the United States]] Richard Benson ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) to join his global community.<ref group=note>In the movie’s dialogue, the United States is sometimes equated with "the North American Zone"; however, a stylized world map appears to show all of [[North America]] as a single zone, and [[Mexico]] is portrayed in the film as a country distinct from the United States.</ref> Stone summons Benson to meet with him in [[Rome]].

During an informal meeting on [[Air Force One]], David and Col. Howard warn the president to keep his distance from Stone, due to a [[CIA]] report, which indicates that over 200 people who had opposed Stone in the past had died under questionable circumstances after close contact. Unfortunately, Benson fails to grasp just how ruthless Stone really is; Stone kills him with a supernaturally induced [[heart attack]]. David is sworn in as the new President at the hour of President Benson's death.  Much to Stone's disappointment, his brother also refuses to join his [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]. [[Secretary of State]] Breckenridge ([[Jim Metzler]]) however, wants the [[United States]] to join the global community aligned with Stone.  After failing to convince David to fall in line with the World Union, he publicizes a doctored video of David murdering his father. In reality, it was Stone who killed him.  Breckenridge orders the [[FBI]] to arrest the president. After a heated exchange of gunfire, the president escapes by helicopter to [[Norfolk Naval Base]], where the [[U.S. Navy]] brass provides him with transport to the Sixth Fleet on an [[amphibious assault ship]].

Following the raid, Colonel Howard receives word that Breckenridge is sending U.S. troops to Israel to join Stone's military coalition, which are on the plains of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] planning a strike on [[Jerusalem]].  Following the special operations raid in Rome, David and Colonel Howard move quietly to join with U.S. forces already in Israel. Unknown to Stone, the [[Mexican Armed Forces|Mexicans]], [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese]], and Americans are really there to destroy Stone and his army. David attempts to kill Stone himself but is soon captured.  Later, Stone's triumph is shattered as Chinese tanks open fire upon his European troops from one side while U.S. and Mexican forces attack from the other. Shortly afterwards, Stone's troops are hit by air strikes as well. Taken completely by surprise, and with his forces being quickly overrun, Stone instructs all his soldiers to fight to the death.  After overrunning Stone's armored and artillery positions, the Mexican tanks charge headlong, targeting the enemy headquarters.  Stone and his officers are swallowed in a huge fireball as tank shells rain in.  David barely manages to break free and jump away before the headquarters explodes behind him.  David is stunned as Stone walks out of the ashes, and morphs into a massive demon with ram's horns and huge leathery wings. After seriously wounding David, he summons up his dark brethren as reinforcements, and revives his dead army.  In a full display of his supernatural powers, he even darkens the sun, plunging the whole battlefield into darkness.  The reinforcements soon outnumber and overrun the Mexican, Chinese, and American forces. In triumph, [[Satan]], celebrates as he cries out loudly that he is lord.  At this boast, a bright white light lances down into the ruins of the headquarters, and begins dropping meteors of light upon the battlefield. All of Satan’s soldiers are killed, while all of the allied survivors remained untouched, and are freed from their bonds. Stone's former Guardian is dismayed at Satan's defeat, and tries to run from the battlefield. A globe of light chases him and quickly impales him with swords of pure light, causing him to be vaporized. Satan himself is driven to his knees, and forced to admit that [[Jesus Christ]] is the one true Lord. The light then pulverizes the ground beneath him, dropping [[Satan]] into a deep pit of molten lava, the [[Lake of Fire]]. There he finds he is chained, and screams in anguish, defeated. As David lies on the ground looking up into the sky, the light becomes brighter, and then fades away, revealing a scene of Earthly paradise. A scripture is revealed on screen that God has established his home with man, and that He shall reign forever, and ever.

Merdeka 17805
 In early 1942, the army of the [[Empire of Japan]] occupies the [[Dutch East Indies]] and overthrows its Dutch colonial leaders. During a visit to a [[Java]]nese village, Captain Takeo Shimazaki (Jundai Yamada) and his translator Yamana (Naomasa Musaka) are told that their arrival was predicted by [[Jayabaya|King Jayabaya]] centuries before. Touched by this pronouncement, Shimazaki promises to free the archipelago from colonialism. Later, he is assigned to sneak into the last Dutch stronghold in [[Bandung]] and negotiate the unconditional surrender of the Dutch Army, a mission he completes successfully.  With control of the archipelago assured, General [[Hitoshi Imamura]] allows the military training of the indigenous population, with promises that it will lead to Indonesian independence. Shimazaki becomes a teacher at the Seinen Dojo ("Youth School"), and his students&nbsp;– including Nurhadi (Muhammad Iqbal), Asep (Aulia Achsan), and Parto (Fajar Umbara)&nbsp;– are willing to fight to the death for the independence of their homeland. Although this school is dissolved after Parto beats a Japanese soldier for flirting with his sister, the three remain fiercely dedicated to fighting for independence, and they join the [[Pembela Tanah Air|Defenders of the Homeland]] (PETA) after it is established; Shimazaki holds a leadership role.  After Japan's defeat in the Pacific and subsequent [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]], Shimazaki is conflicted in his loyalties, wondering if he should go back to Japan, or stay in the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|newly proclaimed]] Republic of Indonesia and fight to defend its sovereignty. At first, he does not abandon his duties to Japan, and refuses to give PETA weapons to the Indonesian guerillas, said weapons having been earmarked for surrender to the Allies. Armed only with ''[[bambu runcing]]'' (sharpened bamboo spears), these guerillas are easily killed by the returning Dutch forces and their allies. Finally, a group of former PETA soldiers&nbsp;– led by Nurhadi, Parto and Asep&nbsp;– go to the Japanese headquarters to force Shimizaki to give them the weapons. After a lengthy stand-off, he agrees to surrender the weapons and to accompany the guerrillas in fighting, saying goodbye to his friend Lieutenant Miyata (Naoki Hosaka).  Shimazaki is captured by Dutch forces, but saved by his fellow guerillas; many die in the effort, including Parto. In reciprocation, the Dutch capture Miyata, accuse him masterminding Shimazaki's escape, and execute him. Learning of this, Shimazaki hardens his resolve to fight for Indonesian independence. After marrying a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] nurse, Aryati, Shimazaki goes with several other Japanese soldiers to retake the republican capital at [[Yogyakarta]], which had been occupied during [[Operation Kraai|Operation Crow]].  The troops, under the leadership of Shimazaki and Nurhadi, face off against better-equipped pro-Dutch troops. Shimazaki's fellow Japanese soldiers are killed during the battle, as are many Indonesian guerrillas, but the battle invigorates the nationalistic spirit of the fighters. When Shimazaki and Nurhadi return to camp, they discuss the meaning of freedom. Later, as Shimazaki goes through the [[dog tag|tags]] of the fallen and mourns their loss, he is killed by a sniper. After killing the sniper, Nurhadi, Aryati, and the guerrillas bury Shimazaki while singing the Indonesian national anthem, "[[Indonesia Raya]]".  Decades later, at [[Kalibata Heroes Cemetery]] in [[Jakarta]], Miyata's daughter Fumiko lays flowers on the graves of Miyata and Shimazaki. She is accompanied by Aryati (Mila Karmila) and Nurhadi (Eman Sulaeman), and has accepted the sacrifice of her father and his comrades, remarking that they had become "stars for freedom".

The Mexican
 The story follows Jerry Welbach as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, ''The Mexican'', and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese, who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman. Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha, with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship.  Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck, the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by [[celebratory gunfire]] from a nearby festival.  Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck.   Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy, who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank, who then has a relationship with Leroy.  Another hitman follows them to Las Vegas and kills Frank to make it look like a suicide. Leroy kills him in an act of vengeance, and flees with Samantha. Jerry finds out that Ted, his friend and colleague, wanted to kill him and take the pistol to Margolese, but hesitated and ends up getting handcuffed to a pawnshop owner, after he received the gun from a policeman when Jerry was being interrogated for the bloodstain on the front passenger seat of his car. Jerry then finds out he accidentally grabbed Ted's Passport and tries to retrieve his own, but Ted has already fled. Jerry decides to pick up Samantha and Leroy at the airport, where Jerry recognizes him, but Leroy doesn't recognize Jerry. Without a passport, Jerry is stuck in Mexico until further notice by the American Consulate.  After their car has a blowout, Jerry kills Leroy and finds out that he is one of Nayman's men named Winston Baldry, and that the real Leroy was the man Winston killed. Samantha begins to realize that Leroy was not who he appeared to be when they first met. Jerry realizes that Nayman's plan was to make it look like Jerry double crossed Margolese. Shocked by this, Samantha decides to go home, but also decides to stay with Jerry to see the situation to the end. Jerry gets assaulted and taken to Margolese who was released from prison a few days earlier. He tells Jerry that he didn't double cross him as it was Bernie who wanted to sell the pistol to the highest bidder.  A gunsmith, who is the great-grandson of the gunsmith from the story, wanted to bring the pistol back to where it belongs. He thanks Jerry for risking his life for the pistol he was going to give to his greedy boss. Samantha gets kidnapped by Bernie in order to get the pistol from Margolese. After opening the trunk to his car, she pulls the gun on Bernie, blaming him for ruining her life, where it ends in a [[Mexican standoff]]. Samantha gets the upper hand and kills Bernie with the pistol he desperately needed. Jerry and Samantha rekindle their romance and get married in Mexico, while Margolese finally gets his prize, as well as the gunsmith. The film ends with Jerry and Samantha arguing over the story of The Mexican on their way to Vegas.  
Millennium Actress
 The film opens with a woman leaving to embark on a spaceship from the moon to Earth. An earthquake occurs and it is revealed that this is simply a scene from a movie being played out on a television. Genya Tachibana, a TV interviewer, and his cameraman Kyoji Ida head off to a new job: Ginei Studios, a prestigious but bankrupt movie studio is being torn down and its best known star Chiyoko Fujiwara has agreed to do a rare career retrospective interview. When they meet, Genya gives her a key he believes she lost at the studio, which causes Chiyoko to reflect on her career. As she's telling her life story, Genya and Kyoji are drawn in, literally, to Chiyoko's past, as they are blended into various scenes that concurrently reflect Chiyoko's filmography and life story at once.  Chiyoko, as a girl in 1930s Japan, is approached to become an actress by a famous director. While walking on the street, Chiyoko encounters a man running away from a certain scarred military policeman, and she manages to hide him away in a storage barn. It turns out he is a revolutionary against [[Sino-Japanese War (1931-1945)|the war in China]], as well as a painter; he escapes, but leaves a key behind. After his departure, she decides to become a film actress in hopes that he will see one of her movies, and heads to [[Manchukuo]] with the film crew for her first movie to try and give the key back to him. She meets Ginei Studios' lead actress, who treats her with contempt, as well as the director's young son, also planning to be a director. On a train however, local bandits attack. At this point, scenes are played from different movies from Chiyoko's career, ranging from [[Jidaigeki|samurai]] to [[kaiju]]: all with the theme of Chiyoko chasing down the mysterious painter. Various characters are seen again and again, such as the military policeman, and even Genya and Kyoji, who continually save Chiyoko and allow her to continue on her quest.  Through this narrative, it is seen that a younger Genya became an assistant at Ginei Studios. Chiyoko loses the key during filming one day, and resigns herself to marrying the director's son, who has become the lead director. Eventually, after the war, Chiyoko finds the key hidden away in one of the sets, and confronts her husband about it; the other lead actress reveals that she stole it for the director out of jealousy for her youth. Right after, the military policeman, now a crippled veteran, comes to the studio to apologize for his war crimes, and gives Chiyoko a letter from the painter. After Chiyoko leaves to resume her desperate search north, Genya hears from the scarred policeman that the painter was tortured and killed after his arrest.  As Ginei Studios begins filming the last scene of a movie, an earthquake shakes the studio and causes the roof to collapse on to the set, the spaceship from the first scene. Genya jumps in and saves Chiyoko by shielding her from debris with his body, but after the earthquake, she runs away inexplicably, leaving behind the key for Genya to pick up. Finally back in the present, Genya asks why Chiyoko abandoned her search, and she replies that she was no longer the girl of her youth; the painter would no longer recognize her now.  During the interview, another earthquake strikes as Chiyoko has a heart attack, and Genya once again shields her from debris as she collapses. He and the cameraman drive her desperately to the hospital, but despite their efforts are told that she won't make it. On her hospital deathbed, Chiyoko surprises them by saying that it doesn't matter if she finds the man or not. As the film returns to its opening scene, she explains that despite never seeing the man again, she realized that it wasn't the man she loved, but the chase for him – before blasting off in the spaceship to continue her search.  
Mike Bassett: England Manager
 England manager Phil Cope suffers a heart attack during qualification for the World Cup, which started out well but has gone badly wrong of late. The FA heads meet to decide who should be the new England manager, but soon run into trouble.   The most successful [[Premier League|Premiership]] manager is Scottish (based on [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]), the second most successful is a former England captain who is interested in the job, but the FA decide that he is too much of a "loudmouth" and refuse to consider him (a reference to the numerous times [[Brian Clough]] was passed over for the England job), while none of the other English managers in the Premiership are interested. They are forced to look to [[Football League First Division|Division One]], and Bassett, who has just won the [[Mr Clutch|Mr Clutch Cup]] with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].  Bassett takes over the England team and appoints his assistant manager Lonnie Urquart ([[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]]) (a reference to [[Lawrie McMenemy]] under the [[Graham Taylor]] era) who is very old-fashioned in his beliefs and still acts like a used car salesman and often compares the England players' performances to cars, and coach Dave Dodds ([[Bradley Walsh]]), a spineless "yes man" who once managed with Mike at [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] (a reference to [[Phil Neal]] under the [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] era). The team need one win from three World Cup qualifiers to get to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Finals]] in [[Brazil]].  With a squad featuring a pony tailed goalkeeper (based on [[David Seaman]]). Kevin Tonkinson, an alcoholic Mackem (based on [[Paul Gascoigne]]). Rufus Smalls, a striker going through a very poor run of form (based on [[Andy Cole]]); Steve Harper, a playboy midfielder (based on [[David Beckham]]) and Gary Wackett, an extremely aggressive centre back (based on [[Stuart Pearce]]/[[Vinnie Jones]]). He plays an old fashioned 4–4–2 formation, and attempts to bring football back to where it belongs. Unfortunately, he loses his first two games in charge, and his managerial career is already on the rocks.   Needing to beat [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in the final qualifier to make it to Brazil, England can only manage a draw. However, a shock 2-0 win by [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] sees them go through on goal difference. He and his team record the official England World Cup song with girl group [[Atomic Kitten]] and "hellraiser" [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]].  So, England are on their way to Brazil. When they arrive, progress is not smooth as they start their tour by brawling with the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish]] and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish]] teams. A difficult group stage sees them on the verge of heading home after they can only manage a goalless draw with unfancied [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] before losing 4-0 to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. To make matters worse, Bassett also receives a phone call from his wife back in England, informing him that his son was bullied at school for the Egypt draw, resulting in his eyebrows being shaved off (a reference to an Egyptian custom, in which a family, when mourning a death of a pet cat, would shave off their own eyebrows).  One of England's training sessions is rendered pointless after Urquart locks the footballs in his [[Opel]] and goes shopping. Captain Gary Wackett is sent home for taking part in hooliganism. Midfield playmaker Tonkinson accidentally gets involved in a drunken tryst with a transsexual. Assistant manager Urquart is sacked after punching Bassett for berating him as useless and when Mike mixes flaming sambucas with anti-depressants, it seems things can get no worse.  The morning after his drunken incident, he is involved in a press conference where he is expected to step down from the managerial position. When he announces that he is carrying on, the press begin to get hostile and Bassett responds by the reciting of "[[If—]]" by [[Rudyard Kipling]], which he finishes by saying that "England will be playing [[4–4–2|4–4–fucking–2]]" and storms out.   Following this, England need to beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] to get through to the second round. England succeed when Tonkinson dribbles past the Argentinian defence and blasts a shot which deflects off the crossbar. Tonkinson then punches the ball into the net.  England advance to the knock-out stages, where they beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[France national football team|France]]. Rufus Smalls scores a hat trick against Romania and becomes England's top goal scorer with 52 international goals. But in the semi-finals, England lose to host nation Brazil. On their plane journey back to Britain, Bashir states that England equalled their best performance since they won in 1966 (in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished fourth). This implies that England lost the third place playoff, which is not seen in the film. At the airport, the team depart the plane to a cheering crowd, where Bassett confirms to the waiting press that he will remain as manager.  
Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse
 After a successful Christmas Eve show, Mickey wishes the guests a safe trip home. However, Goofy points out that they and the guests cannot leave the House of Mouse as a [[snowstorm]] has blocked up all the exits. The guests are worried, but Mickey decides to hold a free-of-charge Christmas party for them until the storm lets up. Unfortunately, Donald isn't feeling the Christmas spirit. So Mickey and Minnie play different Christmas cartoons to get him in the spirit.  The cartoons they show include Donald trying to ice-skate and constantly destroying snowmen Huey, Dewey and Louie are building in a competition, Pluto trying to get Chip and Dale out of Mickey's x-mas tree, the Mickey version of the Nutcracker, along with [[Ludwig Von Drake]]'s "The Science of Santa", Mickey decorating his house in blinding lights that can be seen outside of town, and interviews about what everyone wants for Christmas or feels grateful for.  After all this, everyone, including villains like Jafar, are happy that everyone is enjoying Christmas. However, the crowd's mood quickly sours when Donald yells "hum bug!" to when Mickey asks if he's feeling the Christmas spirit. Mickey heads to the roof, where he tells Jiminy Cricket that all he wanted was for his friend to enjoy Christmas; Jiminy advises him to wish upon a star. Mickey does so and the star falls into his hands. Mickey returns to Donald, who he offers the honor of putting the star on the tree. Donald does so, instantly becoming jolly. The star magically begins redecorating the club, turning the reefs golden and giving the Magic Mirror a Santa hat, while turning Jafar's staff into a candy cane. Various languages saying Merry Christmas appear on the television as Mickey announces one last cartoon before a carol.  After ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', everyone gathers on the stage, singing "The Best Christmas of All"; the camera catches Hades, Hook and Jafar not singing, prompting them to do so once they notice. Mickey wishes everyone a Merry Christmas as Tinker Bell ends the film.  
Metropolis (2001 film)
  Humans and robots coexist in the futuristic city of Metropolis, although robots are discriminated against and segregated to the city's lower levels. A lot of Metropolis' human population are unemployed and deprived, and many people blame the robots for taking their jobs.  Duke Red, the unofficial ruler of Metropolis, has overseen the construction of a massive skyscraper called the Ziggurat, which he claims will allow mankind to extend its power across the planet. A wayward robot disrupts the Ziggurat's opening ceremony, only to be shot down by Rock, Duke Red's adopted son and the head of the Marduk Party, a vigilante group whose aim is to promote anti-robot sentiments. Private detective Shunsaku Ban and his nephew Kenichi travel to Metropolis to arrest Dr. Laughton, a mad scientist wanted for organ trafficking. Unknown to Shunsaku, Duke Red has hired Laughton to build an advanced robot modeled and named after Red's deceased daughter Tima. Red intends for Tima to function as a central control unit for a powerful secret weapon hidden in the Ziggurat. However, Rock learns of Tima's existence and, not wanting a robot to overshadow Red, shoots Laughton and sets fire to his laboratory.  Shunsaku comes across the burning laboratory and discovers the dying Laughton, who gives Shunsaku his notebook. Meanwhile, Kenichi finds the activated Tima. The two fall into the sewers and are separated from Shunsaku. While Shunsaku searches for his nephew, Kenichi and Tima search for a way back the street level. They grow close as Kenichi teaches Tima how to speak. Neither are aware she is a robot. The two are hunted relentlessly by Rock and his subordinates, and encounter a group of unemployed human laborers who stage a revolution against Red.  The president and the mayor of Metropolis try to use the revolution to overthrow Red and gain control of Metropolis, but they are assassinated by the president's top military commander, General Kusai Skunk, who has sided with Red. The duke then imposes martial law to suppress the revolution. In the aftermath of the failed revolt, Kenichi reunites with Shunsaku, only to be wounded by Rock, who reveals Tima to be a robot. Rock, however, is disowned by Red and stripped of his command of the Marduks for attempting to kill Tima. Duke Red takes Tima away to the Ziggurat.  Still determined to dispose of Tima and regain his father's affection, Rock kidnaps and deactivates Tima, who is now confused about her identity. Shunsaku rescues her and, after following instructions from Laughton's notebook, reactivates Tima. The two discover Kenichi is being held in the Ziggurat, but are then captured by Duke Red and the Marduks on their way to save him. Brought to the top of the Ziggurat, Tima confronts Duke Red about whether she is a human or robot. Duke Red tells her she is a "superhuman" and destined to rule the world from her throne. Disguised as a maid, Rock then shoots Tima, exposing her circuitry.  The sudden shock of realizing she is a robot causes Tima to go insane. She proceeds to sit on the throne, where she orders a biological and nuclear attack on humanity. While the others flee, Kenichi tries to reason with Tima. Robots drawn by Tima's command attack Duke Red. Not wanting his father to die at the hands of "filthy robots", Rock kills himself and Duke Red in a massive explosion. As the Ziggurat starts to collapse around them, Kenichi finally reaches Tima and separates her from the throne. Seemingly lost, Tima tries to kill Kenichi, but falls off the tower in the struggle. Out of love for her, Kenichi tries to save Tima and pull her up using one of the cables still grafted to her. As the cable begins to fray, Tima remembers the time Kenichi taught her language and asks Kenichi, "Who am I?", before she loses her grip and falls to her presumed death. The Ziggurat collapses, destroying a large part of Metropolis.  In the aftermath, Kenichi searches the ruins and discovers a group of robots have salvaged some of Tima's parts in an effort to rebuild her. While Shunsaku and many other human survivors are evacuated, Kenichi chooses to remain behind; he eventually rebuilds Tima and opens a robot workshop.  ===Differences between manga and anime=== In [[Osamu Tezuka|Tezuka]]'s original manga, the story revolves around a humanoid named Mitchi, who has the ability to fly and change gender. Mitchi is pursued by [[Duke Red]] and his "Red Party" who intend to use Mitchi for destructive purposes. However, Shunsaku Ban and his nephew Kenichi find Mitchi after her creator, Dr. Charles Laughton, is killed and protect her as they search for her parents. Unlike Tima's desire to be human, the cause for Mitchi's destructive rampage in the manga's climax is the revelation that, as a robot, she does not have parents.  However, this cinematic adaptation of Tezuka's story integrates far more elements from the [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.<ref></ref>  When making the original [[Metropolis (manga)|Metropolis manga]], Tezuka said that the only real inspiration he got from [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' was a still image from the movie where a female robot was being born.<ref>[http://en.tezuka.co.jp/manga/sakuhin/m011/m011_01.html Explanation section on the Metropolis manga section of TezukaOsamu@World] Accessed on June 5, 2007.</ref>  In addition to adopting set designs of the original film, this version has more emphasis on a strong and pervasive theme of class struggle in a [[dystopian]], [[plutocratic]] society and expands it to examine the relationship of robots with their human masters.  (This relationship was explored by Tezuka in great detail with his popular series [[Astro Boy]].)  The anime adaptation also removes many of the more fanciful elements out of Tezuka's manga, such as a flying, gender swapping humanoid.  Here, Mitchi is replaced by "Tima", who is permanently female and cannot fly. In this version Kenichi is an assistant to his uncle, and he forms a very strong friendship with Tima even though neither know she's a robot. Tima and Kenichi seem to care for each other deeply, as seen when Tima is worried about Kenichi when he's unconscious. Kenichi even goes so far as to remove Tima from the throne in an effort to save her and not allow her to become a weapon of evil. Tima was taught language by Kenichi and that she was someone unique. She also considered him her only family because he was kind to her and protected her; it seems that she loved Kenichi very much.  It can be assumed that Kenichi fell in love with Tima, shown in many scenes when he blushes when he sees her writing his name so she wouldn't forget him. Kenichi didn't seem to care if Tima was robot or not, showing that he was willing to rescue her because of how much he cared for Tima. Tima only remembered Kenichi when he tried to save her because of everything he taught her. Tima's relationship with Kenichi ends, however, when Tima accepts her identity as a robot over that of a female human, triggering a robot revolution.<ref></ref>  Also, Duke Red is shown to be a cruel and evil man both as a leader and father; it is shown many times that he does not care about Rock or consider him his son even though he adopted him; the character Rock is also a deviation from the manga.<ref name="makela"></ref> He only sees Tima as a weapon to destroy humanity and even considers Tima and Rock inferior to him and anyone who is loyal to him. While his real daughter died and was also named Tima, he only rebuilt her humanoid self just to use her, and has no regard or affection for what she needs and ignores her questions about her being human or not, showing that he does not care if Tima feels emotions or not.  The movie's Ziggurat is a combination of the New Tower of Babel from Lang's original film and the Cathedral from the manga.<ref></ref>  ===Portrayal of robots===  The [[Shinto religion]] has a very abstract delineation between the animate and inanimate. Shinto [[kami]] can be spirits, humans, objects, or in this case, robots. Therefore, robots are viewed with a favorable view both in the manga and in the movie, but especially in the movie, where there is a nearly equal amount of robot and human characters. Most humans, like Kenichi and Shinsaku Ban, tend to be sympathetic to robots, causing the Marduks and their hostile attitude toward robots to be viewed as antagonistic by the audience.<ref name="makela"/>

Mockingbird Don't Sing
 In [[Los Angeles]], 1970, Katie Standon (Tarra Steele), a girl who has been imprisoned in her room (and without any human contact) since the age of one, is now thirteen years old. Her mother Louise (who has [[cataract]]s; [[Kim Darby]]), has taken enough abuse from her domineering husband Wes ([[Jack Betts]]); she gets her son, Billy (a few years older than Katie; Michael Azria), to help her and Katie escape their home.  At a welfare office a social worker notices something peculiar about Katie and guesses her age to be about seven while, in fact, she is thirteen. Katie is taken to Children's Hospital, and Louise and Wes find themselves being arrested for "what authorities are calling the worst case of child abuse they've ever seen". Shortly before his trial begins, Wes kills himself. The doctors and psycholinguists investigating the case form the "Katie Team", a group of experts dedicated to helping Katie learn to speak and interact with others. One of the team members, Judy Bingham ([[Sean Young]]), a special education teacher, sees Katie as a pawn whom she can use to attain international fame. She claims Katie will make her "the next [[Anne Sullivan]]." [[UCLA]] graduate student Sandra Tannen ([[Melissa Errico]]) is one of the people who appear to have Katie's welfare at heart.    Katie comes to live with Dr. Norman Glazer ([[Joe Regalbuto]]) who works at Children's Hospital, and his family, where she stays for four years. His family helps Katie become a civilized human being. Although Katie shows outstanding progress in some things (such as learning vocabulary words and sign language, preparing hygiene, showing off anger, and certain other activities), she never really learns grammatical structure. Meanwhile, Louise has surgery to remove her cataracts and visits Katie off and on.  When Katie turns eighteen, the funding for her help is cut off and she returns to Louise's care. Soon, it comes to the point where Louise does not know how to handle Katie herself and Katie gets placed in another foster home. One day, Katie is [[Physical abuse|physically punished]] for [[vomiting]] and responds by never eating or speaking because she was afraid if she opened her mouth she would vomit and be punished again.  Sandra does all that she can to make sure that Katie is handled in the proper way and even has Norman help her. Katie is taken back to Children's Hospital, and Sandra is suggested by social services to have Katie live with her. Before any decisions are made about this, Louise takes Katie out of the hospital and puts her in another foster home. Sandra is not allowed to say goodbye to Katie. Louise even threatens to take legal action on Sandra if she ever sees Katie again.  Sandra finally asks Louise why Katie was placed in extreme isolation before her discovery. Louise tells the entire story; Wes loved his mother very much, and when she died due to an accident, he projected his feelings for her onto Katie. After a doctor examined Katie sometime later, she was diagnosed as being retarded and Wes locked her up, afraid that the doctors might take her away, and because Louise was starting to go blind, Wes took care of Katie.  Sandra then leaves the house, running into Judy again. It is now clear that she knew Louise for a long time. Sandra and Judy have a quick argument, after which Judy enters Louise's house, leaving Sandra almost crying. At this point, different kinds of footage of Katie appear on screen; Sandra looks at tape recordings of Katie on her TV. She then is seen writing something on a typewriter, while her voice addresses the viewers; she's hoping to see Katie once more. The camera then turns to her and her boyfriend, now holding a baby of their own. The screen fades while she sings the "[[Hush, Little Baby]]" lullaby. The screen fades, and footage of Katie on the beach can be seen.  Messages appear, saying what has happened to everyone after the movie: Judy continues to harass the "Katie Team" until her death in 1988; Louise, who is now once again blind, resides in a nursing home in Southern California; Sandra Tannen is now a professor of linguistics at [[UCLA]] and has two teenage daughters, however, she is still not allowed to have any contact with Katie, who lives in a foster home nearby. The last message before the screen turns black and the credits appear, reads: "Katie's inability to learn a language proved the legitimacy of the [[Critical Period Hypothesis]]".  
Monkeybone
 Stu Miley is a disillusioned cartoonist whose comic strip features a rascal monkey named Monkeybone. Stu is in love with a sleep institute worker named Dr. Julie McElroy, who helped him deal with his terrible nightmares by changing his drawing hand. One night, Stu crashes his car after accidentally activating an inflatable Monkeybone raft, causing him to fall into a coma.  His spirit ends up in Down Town, a [[limbo]]-like carnival landscape populated by human beings, mythical creatures and figments of people's imaginations where nightmares are entertainment. In Down Town, Monkeybone is real. During that time, Stu befriends a [[catgirl]] named Miss Kitty. When Stu learns that his sister Kimmy is about to pull the plug on him, he asks [[Hypnos]], God of Sleep, for advice. Hypnos tells Stu that to get back to the living, he has to infiltrate the Land of Death to steal an Exit Pass from Death which are given out to coma victims by Reapers giving them permission to leave Down Town and awaken from their coma. Stu successfully steals an Exit Pass, but Monkeybone steals it from him in turn and enters the Land of the Living in Stu's body through the Revive-O as Hypnos states that they have plans for Stu's body.  When Stu is locked up, Hypnos later visits the jail cells, where Stu finds himself locked up with [[Attila the Hun]], [[Jack the Ripper]], and [[Stephen King]], who reveals his nightmare of [[Cujo]] pulled the same trick Monkeybone pulled on Stu. Hypnos explains to Stu that he plans to use Stu's body to get a chemical substance named Oneirix that Julie developed that gives people and animals nightmares, which gives him more power. Upon being sent to the institute by Hypnos upon reminding him of his mission, Monkeybone (in Stu's body) ends up successfully stealing the Oneirix, switching it with another juice. Monkeybone obtains the Oneirix and puts it inside stuffed monkey toys of himself (Monkeybone) so that those who touch them will be infected and given nightmares. With help from Miss Kitty, Stu escapes from his imprisonment.  Monkeybone in Stu's body prepares a pinata for the Monkeybone farting dolls at the party. Meanwhile, Stu reveals Hypnos' plan to Death upon capture and convinces her to send him back for only an hour, only to find himself in the body of a dead athlete organ donor. As he flees the morgue attendants, Stu finds out about Monkeybone's planned party and heads there with the extractors still in pursuit. At the party, Stu's agent, Herb, exposes himself to the Oneirix in the Monkeybone doll and ends up seeing in the mirror that his clothes are coming to life. This causes Herb to run through the party naked, telling everyone that the clothes have come to life and turned evil. After that, Monkeybone in Stu's body tells everyone to forget about it as he brings down the Stu [[piñata]] containing the Monkeybone dolls. Stu uses Monkeybone's main characteristics from the comics to cause him to panic and escape. A chase ensues, culminating with Stu and Monkeybone battling each other while clinging to a giant Monkeybone balloon. The balloon is eventually shot down by a passing incompetent police officer and both Stu and Monkeybone fall barely enough to be non-fatal and fall unconscious.  Stu and Monkeybone are falling toward Down Town where the residents cheer on their fight. Just then, all the rides stop and a giant robot emerges near the Revive-O causing everyone to flee the area. When Stu and Monkeybone are caught by it, the operator of the robot is revealed to be Death, who seems quite cheerful despite the circumstances. Monkeybone tries to have Death let him go to the bathroom, but Death places Monkeybone back in Stu's head which is where he belongs. Death then uses her robot to send Stu back to the living.  Stu wakes up in his own body. Stu then proposes to Julie and they get married. An erratic Herb breaks the [[fourth wall]] urging the audience to take off their clothes and the film cuts to an animated sequence where cartoon characters strip their human disguises revealing monkeys underneath.

Momo (2001 film)
   
Monsters, Inc.
  The city of Monstropolis in the monster world is powered by energy from the screams of human children. At the Monsters, Inc. factory, skilled monsters employed as "scarers" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams, through doors that activate portals to children's bedroom closets. It is considered dangerous work, as human children are believed to be toxic. Energy production is falling because children are becoming less easily scared, and Monsters, Inc.'s chairman, Henry J. Waternoose, is determined to find a solution.  James P. "Sulley" Sullivan and his partner, Mike Wazowski, are the organization's top employees, but their chief rival, Randall Boggs, is close behind. One day, Sulley discovers that Randall has left a door activated on the scare floor and a small girl has entered the factory. After several failed attempts to put her back, Randall sends the door back into the factory's door vault and Sulley conceals her and takes her out of the factory. He interrupts Mike's date with his girlfriend, Celia, at a sushi restaurant, and chaos erupts when the child is discovered. Sulley and Mike manage to escape with the child before the Child Detection Agency (CDA) quarantines the restaurant. They soon discover that she is not toxic after all; Sulley grows attached to her and calls her "Boo," while Mike is just anxious to be rid of her.  The duo smuggle her back into the factory disguised as a baby monster in an attempt to send her home. Randall discovers Boo and tries to kidnap her, but mistakenly kidnaps Mike instead. He straps Mike to a large machine called "The Scream Extractor", which he intends to use to revolutionize the scaring industry and solve the monster world's energy problems by forcefully extracting screams from kidnapped human children. Before Randall can use the machine on Mike, Sulley disables the machine, frees Mike and reports Randall to Waternoose. Waternoose, who is secretly in league with Randall, initially indicates anger at hearing of Randall's actions, but instead exiles Mike and Sulley to the [[Himalayas]] after revealing he is involved in Randall's plot. The two meet [[Yeti|the Abominable Snowman]], who tells them about a nearby village, which Sulley realizes he can use to return to the factory. Sulley prepares to return, but Mike refuses to go with him.   Meanwhile, Randall is preparing to use the Scream Extractor on Boo, but Sulley suddenly arrives and saves her, destroying the machine in the process. Randall and Sulley battle, and after Mike returns and helps Sulley overpower Randall, the two reconcile, take Boo, and flee.  Randall pursues them to the door vault, and a wild chase ensues among the millions of doors as they move in and out of the storage vault on rails to the factory floor. Boo's laughter causes all the doors to activate at once, allowing the monsters to freely pass in and out of the human world. Randall attempts to kill Sulley, but Boo overcomes her fear and attacks him, enabling Sulley to catch him. Sulley and Mike then trap Randall in the human world, where two residents at a trailer park mistake him for an [[american alligator|alligator]] and beat him with a shovel.  Sulley and Mike take Boo and her door to the training room. Waternoose appears and demands Sulley surrender Boo to him. Sulley inadvertently baits Waternoose into shouting "I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die, and I'll silence anyone who gets in my way"; the confession is videotaped by Mike, who then plays the recording to the CDA, who quickly arrest and imprison Waternoose. Roz appears, revealing herself to be the CDA's director who worked for nearly three years to expose Waternoose as a fraud and kidnapper. She thanks Mike and Sulley for revealing his true colors, but orders the CDA to destroy Boo's door; they do so and Sulley is left saddened by Boo's departure.  With the factory temporarily shut down, Sulley is named the new CEO of Monsters, Inc. Under his leadership, the energy crisis is solved by harvesting children's laughter instead of screams, as laughter has been found to be ten times more potent. Mike takes Sulley aside, revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door. It needs one final piece, which Sulley took as a memento, in order to work. Sulley puts the door chip into place, enters and joyfully reunites with Boo.  
Monster's Ball
  Hank Grotowski, a [[widower]], and his son, Sonny, are correctional officers in a prison in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Louisiana.]] They reside with Hank's ailing father, Buck, a retired correctional officer whose wife committed suicide.  Hank, the prison's deputy warden, oversees the [[Capital punishment in Georgia (U.S. state)|execution]] of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove. As explained to Sonny by Hank, at the diner bar the night before, a "Monster's Ball" is what the execution team calls that night's get-together. The proceedings prove too much for Sonny, who, as he is leading Lawrence to the [[electric chair]], vomits, and then collapses.  Hank confronts Sonny in the prison's bathroom afterwards and slaps him for being so "soft" and for "ruining a man's last walk". At home, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed, and tells him to leave the house. Sonny grabs a gun and threatens his father, who backs off. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank at gunpoint, lying on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him. After his father calmly confirms that he does, and always has, Sonny responds, "Well I always loved you," and then shoots himself in the chest, dying instantly.  Hank buries Sonny in the back garden with an abbreviated [[funeral]] because, as Buck comments, "He was weak." Hank subsequently resigns as deputy warden, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny's room. He purchases a local gas station in an attempt to find common ground with his father, and to provide a diversion in his retirement. During the years of Lawrence's imprisonment, his wife, Leticia, has been struggling while raising their son, Tyrell, who has inherited his father's artistic talent. She abusively berates the boy, regarding his [[obesity]]. Along with her domestic problems, Leticia struggles financially, leading to the loss of the family car; as well as an [[eviction#The eviction process|eviction notice]] on her house. In desperate need of money, Leticia takes a job at a diner, frequented by Hank.  One rainy night, Leticia and Tyrell are walking down a soaked highway, when Tyrell is struck by a car. Hank happens to be driving along and sees the two. After some hesitation, Hank drives them to a hospital, where Tyrell dies upon arrival. At the suggestion of the authorities at the hospital, Hank drives Leticia home.  A few days later, Hank gives Leticia another ride home from the diner. They begin talking in the car about their common losses, and she invites him in. Hank finds out that Leticia is Lawrence's widow, though he does not tell her that he participated in her husband's execution. They drown their grief with alcohol and have sex.  Leticia stops by Hank's home with a present for him, but he is not there. She meets Buck, who insults her and implies that Hank is only involved with her because he enjoys sex with black women. Leticia, affected by the remarks, refuses to interact with Hank. The incident proves to be the last straw for Hank, who decides to send his father to a [[nursing home]].  Leticia is evicted from her home for non-payment of rent, and Hank invites her to move in with him. She later discovers Hank's involvement in her husband's death when she finds a drawing of Hank done by Lawrence as he awaited execution. She is upset, but is there waiting for him when he returns from town with ice cream. The film ends with the two of them eating ice cream together on the back porch, content with each other.  
Monsoon Wedding
 The film's central story deals with the organisation of an enormous, chaotic, and expensive wedding that is due to take place in a modern Indian family. Lalit Verma ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) and his wife Pimmi ([[Lillete Dubey]]) have [[arranged marriage|arranged a marriage]] for their daughter Aditi ([[Vasundhara Das]]) to Hemant Rai ([[Parvin Dabas]]). Hemant is the son of a family friend who lives in Texas, and Aditi has only known him for a few weeks. As so often happens in Indian culture, such a wedding means that, for one of the few times in each generation, the extended family comes together from all corners of the globe, bringing its emotional baggage along.  Lalit and Pimmi are helped with the main planning by Pimmi's sister Shashi and her husband C.L ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]), who have arrived earlier from Oman. A few days before the engagement, Tej Puri ([[Rajat Kapoor]]), Lalit's extremely wealthy brother-in-law, arrives from the U.S.. Tej is married to Lalit's sister and has helped the Verma family regain their financial footing after the [[Partition of India]] left them penniless many years ago. Tej offers to pay for Aditi's cousin, Ria Verma ([[Shefali Shah]]) to attend university in the U.S., after the family consults him for advice. Ria and her mother live with the Verma family, who took them in after the death of Ria's father. Despite his generous offer, Ria stays away from Tej and is not comfortable in his presence.  Lalit begins experiencing difficulty in paying for the final, smaller aspects of the wedding and is embarrassed when he has to borrow money from friends and colleagues. Meanwhile, P.K. Dubey ([[Vijay Raaz]]), the eccentric wedding planner, falls in love with Alice, the Vermas' maid. Ria grows concerned after she witnesses what appears to be Tej [[pedophilia|flirting with a younger relative]], ten-year-old Aliya. Aditi's younger brother Varun (Ishan Nair) plans an elaborate dance for the pre-wedding party with another cousin, Ayesha ([[Neha Dubey]]), but Lalit worries that his son is becoming too effeminate and plans to send him to boarding school. Dubey's workers see Alice trying on Aditi's wedding jewellery, and the men accuse her of stealing. The incident causes her to become withdrawn from Dubey and he grows depressed.  A few days before the wedding, Aditi sleeps with an old lover, her married boss Vikram; and confesses this to Hemant. The incident only serves as a reminder to Aditi as to why she stopped seeing Vikram. Though he is initially angry, Hemant is glad for her honesty and is confident that they can put it behind them and be happy together. The workers apologize to Alice and she reconciles with Dubey. The night before the ceremony, Varun refuses to dance due to the comments made by his father, and Ayesha performs with the help of Rahul ([[Randeep Hooda]]), Pimmi's nephew from Australia. Aditi and Hemant grow closer and they share a few intimate moments, which re-affirms their faith in the marriage. After a night of jokes, drama and dances, Ria catches Tej trying to take Aliya for a drive alone. Ria stops them from driving off and takes Aliya away from him, revealing to Lalit and others that Tej had molested her as a child. Lalit's sister does not believe her, attributing her accusations to her character and unmarried status. Emotionally distraught, Ria leaves.   The next day, Lalit pleads with Ria to return to the wedding, admitting that he can't possibly imagine what she has gone through but also saying that he can't disown Tej, since they are family. Ria is not pleased but agrees to return for the sake of Aditi. Hours before the wedding, however, Lalit changes his mind and tells his sister and Tej to leave the wedding and the family home. Tej's wife insists that Ria's accusation was a small matter but Lalit stands his ground.  The Monsoon rains begin as Aditi and Hemant are married in an elaborate wedding, while Dubey and Alice simultaneously wed in a simple ceremony, and later celebrate with the Verma's. Ria moves on from her past life, and is finally able to freely enjoy the festivities.

Meanwhile, we are shown that across the way there is a [[temple]] where instead of doves of peace, there is a python near a large group of snarling, drooling old men in orange robes, with funky hairstyles who are cringing at the voice of the nearby priest. So enraged are they by his voice that they hatch an evil scheme in collusion with the local godless firangi gora's (white men - who worship only money) to bring about the end to the voice once and for all.  As the villains try to gun down the lecturing Imam, their guns suddenly malfunction by divine intervention and when the ghastly Hindus decide to fire some heavy artillery and rocket launchers at the mosque (it appears divine intervention only disables rifles and pistols but not rocket launchers) the super-human maulvi appears magically leaping in the way of the projectiles, thwarting any attempt at desecrating the mosque. Then, while in the background people turn from peace mode to crusade mode, the Maulvi mumbles a few pious utterances and launches his "tasbees" (holy beads) into the air to see it transform in mid-air into a holy sword. He dramatically catches the falling blade and proceeds to hack to death the entire lot of goons who had dared to try to attack the mosque. As the Imam finally caves in, he says to his child Moosa, "sorry Moosa" the maulvi says in slow motion at the death scene, his eyes burning with the fire of vengeance.  Moosa grows up in a cave somewhere, having turned his back on his religion due to the disillusionment that he felt when his father was murdered. He has instead taken to living alone in some distant cave with his horse Sheru to keep him company. Moosa ([[Shaan (actor)|Shaan]]) has turned into a cold-hearted [[mercenary]] but all that is soon to change with [[Saima Noor|Saima]]'s arrival.  She shows up, dressed to kill with her father. He clearly had his own reasons for bringing his daughter to this place but when the goons start making moves on her, he turns defensive and starts throwing moralizing lecture, and for this he gets shot by one of the goons. Shamoon ([[Shafqat Cheema]]) sporting his usual bizarre "get up" with flowing pony tail becomes obsessed by Saima's voluptuousness, Shamoon imprisons Saima. However, in keeping with the film's utterly warped manner, Saima chooses to stab herself to death rather than to compromise her [[Izzat (Honor)|"izzat"]] (honour). Shamoon has her stitched up in the nick of time, yet she remains merely a captive pet for her tormentor, waiting for the first opportunity to flee. Saima is rescued from Shamoon's clutches one night by Moosa and whisked away to freedom, but just when she is beginning to take a fancy to her rescuer, it's revealed that all he intended to do was use her as part of a transaction or agreement. Saima is stunned when Moosa gives her over to another set of captors. Saima begs him not to do this, but he continues to walk away, stone faced and impassive. As Moosa is about to mount onto his horse and ride off into the distance, Saima comes up with an idea; she takes to covering her head with a [[scarf]] (in dramatic slow-motion) and starts reciting the words (with added echo effect) of the [[Quran]] in a last-ditch effort to get through to the stubborn Moosa. When Saima reaches a crescendo with the retort of "Kya tum Moosa nahin ho" (Are you not Moosa?) her words finally seem to hit the right spot and suddenly Moosa assumes the role that his father the saintly priest had always dreamed of.  Moosa forcefully bludgeons his way through the fully armed opposition and rescues her again and makes away with Saima to the safety of the forest where they are joined by his childhood chum Jan Rambo. Love blossoms and Saima and Moosa get married and build their dream home away from the troubles of the world but Shamoon's henchmen are constantly searching every inch of the forest in order to recover Saima and destroy Moosa and it is a matter of time before they discover the mountainside home. Meanwhile, Saima gives birth to a child and forces her husband to bury his weapons and to take to praying for solace.  One fateful day, while the child and father are away hunting, Shamoon's horrible henchmen show up. There follows the usual bloodbath and mayhem as child and dad return to begin their fight. In one of the more hysterical scenes of the movie, we have Moosa performing his prayers when a goon with a huge machine gun arrives firing shot after shot at Moosa, but these giant bullets float in [[The Matrix|Matrix]]-like slow motion towards our hero and each time by divine intervention they somehow fail to hit their target. In a moment of sublime ridiculousness, Moosa in fact catches the last bullet in mid-air and tosses it aside disdainfully before striding out, ([[angels]] in full battle cry by now) to purge the land of all evil.  
Monrak Transistor
 The story begins in a jail, where a prisoner is being interrogated. The action is taking place in the background, behind bars and is blurred. The focus is on a bottle of laxative. Seems the prisoner has stolen a necklace and swallowed it. Soon, the necklace is passed. And it's not even real gold.  The old jailer picks up the story, saying the prisoner is a boy named Pan from his home village. Pan is a simple country boy. In the words of the jailer, he thinks about entertainment too much and is not respectful enough of his elders. In other words, he's not too bright. Yet, he is a good singer, and the story [[flashback (literary technique)|flashes back]] to a village fair, where he's up on stage singing his heart out, with his lyrics being composed on the spot and directed toward Sadao, a pretty village girl who is dancing in the crowd.  A local rich kid pulls up in his truck and asks Sadao to dance. Then, when the rich kid goes to the drinks stand, Pan hands his microphone over to another performer and moves to dance with Sadao. The rich kid returns, and Pan bumps into him, spilling the drinks. The rich guy, with his thuggish friends in tow, orders Pan to clean up the mess. Pan does so by spitting on the guy's shoes. A fight breaks out, but the music keeps going, with a guitarist picking up the beat and screaming a punk song as the fight intensifies.  Pan and Sadao retreat to Sadao's home, where Pan breaks into another song, expressing his love. But before long, Sadao's irascible father shows up with a shotgun, causing Pan to jump into the river to escape the shotgun blasts.  Pan is not easily deterred. Via his sister, he sends Sadao a pretty blue blouse, accompanied by a love note. He then shows up one day to dig a pond for Sadao's father, explaining that the man Sadao's father had originally hired was sick. He insists on calling the man Dad.  "Stop calling me Dad. When did I fuck your mother," the old man cruelly admonishes Pan.  The old man is complaining of various aches and pains. Pan offers to get him some folk medicine, something involving foot pollen, which because of the [[Culture of Thailand#Customs|cultural]] association of the foot being the basest part of the body, gravely offends him. Pan is back in the doghouse with Sadao's father.  Yet the two become married. For a present, Pan presents Sadao with a new [[transistor]] radio. They have a baby on the way and they enjoy being together.  "The movie could end here," the narrator chimes in, "and you'd be heading for exits with a happy ending. But there is more to this sad tale."  Pan's run of bad luck starts when he draws the wrong number in the draft lottery and must enter the [[Royal Thai Army|army]]. He heads off to basic training before his wife gives birth to their child. He promises to write her a letter every day.  A musical interlude depicts Pan and the other soldiers singing the mournful song "Mai Leum" ("Don't Forget) as they crawl on their backs in the mud under barbed wire, and during their haircuts.  One day Pan sees a poster for a singing contest and at the urging of his army buddies, he enters. He nervously gets up on stage and says he wants to sing "The Sad Soldier". The band doesn't know the tune, so Pan sings it [[a cappella]]. Though he wows the crowd, he faints onstage when the song is complete. Along with a local girl, Dao, Pan wins the contest and without giving thought to the [[Absent without leave|consequences]], he's on a bus headed for [[Bangkok]], where he hopes to become a big singing star.  He ends up locked inside the music company's office, where he spends the night. The next day, he meets his new boss, a sleazy producer named Suwat, who insists Pan call him "Daddy". He lectures Pan about all the hard work he'll need to do before making it as a star.   So Pan pitches in around the office, mopping floors and running errands. Months go by. He mops the floor while the other singer who won the contest, Dao, receives training as a singer. Pan keeps mopping. Soon, 27 months have gone by. He's still mopping floors.  Meanwhile, Sadao is left alone to raise the couple's child. She has not heard a word from Pan and is looking careworn. The radio she was given as a wedding present is starting to wear out.  Pan sleeps in a storage closet, a room he shares with an old man named Yen, who reveals that he, too, wanted to be a singing star, but it's the young women who usually get all the breaks first, he tells Pan.  So Pan keeps mopping floors, washing cars and running errands. He also becomes close with Dao, whom he assists one night after she becomes ill.  Finally, one night at a show, Pan gets his big break when the star male singer doesn't show up. Pan is hastily thrown into a [[Lamé (fabric)|gold lame]] tuxedo and pushed onstage.  What he doesn't know is that out in the crowd is Sadao and her father. They have finally tracked down Pan and have come to visit him. She's brought him bottles of rainwater from the village, figuring the water in the city is dirty and unfit to drink. Pan and Sadao enjoy a brief reunion after the show, but Pan is quickly whisked away by Suwat, to Suwat's home, which is decorated with animal skins.  Suwat tells Pan to relax and goes to change. He comes out with some beers, wearing just a silk bathrobe and his underwear. Suwat puts on a [[pornography|porn tape]] – it's a film of the girl singer, Dao. Suwat tells Pan to strip and has him pose for photos. Suwat becomes bolder and bolder, and eventually sexually assaults Pan. Pan reacts in surprise and confusion, pushing Suwat off of him. Suwat lands on a glass table and is killed.  Pan runs out into the street. He sees a policeman. Now, not only is he AWOL from the army, he's also a murderer. He then spots a truck loaded down with other men, so he hops aboard, hoping to hop back off when the truck stops. But the truck doesn't stop until it's taken Pan to a remote [[sugar cane]] plantation, where he's set to work cutting cane in torturous conditions.  Meanwhile, back in the village, a smooth-talking [[Vendor (supply chain)|travelling salesman]], peddling deworming medicine from his boat, is passing through. He's taken a liking to Sadao, giving her some medicine for her sick baby and inviting her to a movie screening that night. He further charms her at the screening, by demonstrating his talents as a [[Cinema of Thailand#Film dubbing|film dubber]], improvising lines to tell her how beautiful she is.  Back on the sugar-cane plantation, the workers, tired of their diet of vegetables and rice, are restive. Pan has made friends with one of the workers, Siew, but Pan is also well liked by the tough boss, Yot. One night at a card game, Yot finds that Siew has won all his money. A fight breaks out. There is running through the jungle. Dead bodies are uncovered. The horror! Pan and Siew keep running, and eventually wind up in the city.  Starving and their clothes ragged, they happen upon a luxury hotel where they see beggers, street cleaners and motorcycle taxi drivers – poor people – being ushered in, Pan and Siew walk in and start helping themselves to the buffet, shoving food into their pockets. It's a charity ball where the elite are dressing up as the poor, and Pan and Siew win the prize for most authentic costume. But when all the food in their pockets is discovered, they are kicked out of the hotel.  Desperate for money, Pan and Siew hatch another plan. Siew snatches a woman's necklace, and, as she chases him, he passes it Pan, who is then chased by the police. Eventually Pan is caught, and this brings the story back to where it started in the jail.  Pan ends up serving two years in prison, where he and the other inmates work on the prison farm, fertilizing crops with their own [[feces]] and [[urine]]. While dipping a bucket into the [[sewage]] well, Pan falls in, and is covered in the brown substance.  On his release, Pan waits on the street for a ride. A truck pulls up. It is Siew, who is wearing a track suit, lots of jewelry and is carrying a [[cellular phone]]. With his hair dyed blond, he calls himself Peter and announces he is now a drug dealer, and has made quick money. And, to add more indignity to the situation, he's married a former singing star and porn actress - Dao.  Finally, Pan returns to Sadao. She looks more careworn than ever. In addition to a little boy, there's an infant in a crib. "Whose kid is that?" Pan asks when he sees the younger baby. "His father was a dog," she explains. "They are all dogs." Pan looks around. A photo of Sadao's father is on the wall. He's died. The transistor radio lies in a corner, broken and covered with dust. The pretty blue blouse is faded and stained and crumpled on the floor in another corner.  There's a final musical reprise of "Mai Leum", with all the characters in the film putting in an appearance to sing the chorus. Sadao reluctantly accepts Pan back into her life, and breaks down, weeping profusely as the couple embraces.  
Morgan's Ferry
 A trio of escaped criminals hide out in a woman's home as they await to catch a ferry.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/206866/Morgan-s-Ferry/overview New York Times]</ref>  
Moulin Rouge!
 In the year 1900, a British writer named Christian ([[Ewan McGregor]]), suffering from depression, begins writing on his typewriter ("[[Nature Boy]]"). As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the [[Montmartre]] district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] movement. He soon discovers that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] ([[John Leguizamo]]). Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, ''Spectacular Spectacular'', that they wish to sell to the owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]], Harold Zidler ([[Jim Broadbent]]). The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his "Diamond Dog Dancers" perform for the audience ("Zidler's Rap Medley"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine ([[Nicole Kidman]]), the star [[courtesan]], in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler has been promising Satine to the wealthy and psychopathic Duke of Monroth ([[Richard Roxburgh]]), a potential investor in the cabaret ("Sparkling Diamonds").  Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things confidentially ("[[Rhythm of the Night (song)|Rhythm of the Night]]", "Meet Me in the Red Room"), but soon learns he is just a writer ("[[Your Song]]"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for ''Spectacular Spectacular''. With Zidler's help, Toulouse and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil [[maharajah]] attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who loves a poor [[sitar]] player ("The Pitch (''Spectacular Spectacular'')"). The Duke backs the show on the condition that only he may see Satine. Satine contemplates Christian and her longing to leave the Moulin Rouge to become "a real actress" ("[[One Day I'll Fly Away]]"). Christian goes back to Satine to convince her that they should be together, and she eventually falls for him ("Elephant Love Medley"). As the cabaret is converted to a theater, Christian and Satine continue seeing each other under the pretense of rehearsing Satine's lines. The Duke becomes suspicious of their frequent meetings and warns Zidler that he may stop financing the show; Zidler arranges for Satine to dine with the Duke that evening, but she falls ill from [[tuberculosis]] ("If I should die ([[Górecki (song)|Górecki]])"). Zidler makes excuses to the Duke, claiming that Satine has gone to [[Confession (religion)|confession]] ("[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]"). Zidler learns from the doctor treating Satine that she does not have long to live, but keeps this knowledge from Satine. Satine tells Christian that their relationship endangers the show, but he counters by writing a secret love song to affirm their love ("[[Come What May (2001 song)|Come What May]]").  As the Duke watches Christian rehearsing with Satine, Nini, a jealous performer, points out that the play is a [[metaphor]] for Christian, Satine and the Duke. Enraged, the Duke demands the ending be changed with the courtesan choosing the maharajah; Satine offers to spend the night with the Duke to keep the original ending. At the Duke's quarters, Satine sees Christian on the streets below, and realizes she cannot sleep with the Duke. ("El Tango de Roxanne ([[Roxanne (song)|Roxanne]])"). The Duke attempts to rape her, but she is saved by Le Chocolat ([[Deobia Oparei]]), one of the cabaret's male dancers. Reunited with Christian, he urges her to run away with him. The Duke tells Zidler he will have Christian killed if Satine is not his. Zidler reiterates this warning to Satine, but when she refuses to return, he finally informs her she is dying ("A Fool to Believe"). Zidler tells Satine that to save Christian's life, she has to tell him that she will be staying with the Duke and she doesn't love him ("[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]"). Christian tries following her, but is denied entry to the Moulin Rouge, and becomes depressed, even though Toulouse insists that Satine does love him.  The night of the show, Christian sneaks into the Moulin Rouge, intending to pay Satine her fee as a courtesan ("Hindi Sad Diamonds"). He catches Satine before she steps on stage and demands she tell him she does not love him. Suddenly they find themselves in the spotlight; Zidler improvises and convinces the audience that Christian is the sitar player in disguise. Christian denounces Satine and walks off the stage. From the rafters, Toulouse cries out, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return", spurring Satine to sing the song Christian wrote to express their love. Christian returns to the stage, joining her in the song and reaffirming his love for her. The Duke orders his bodyguard ([[Linal Haft]]) to kill Christian, but is thwarted, while the Duke's own attempt is stopped by Zidler. The Duke storms out of the cabaret as Christian and Satine complete their song ("Come What May (Reprise)", "Coup d'État (Finale)").  After the curtain closes, Satine succumbs to tuberculosis. Before she dies, Christian and Satine affirm their love and she tells him to write their story. A year later, the Moulin Rouge has closed down, and Christian finishes writing the tale of his love for Satine, a "love that will live forever" ("Nature Boy (Reprise)").  
Mostly Martha (film)
 Martha Klein ([[Martina Gedeck]]) is a chef at Lido, a gourmet restaurant in [[Hamburg]], Germany. A perfectionist who lives only for her work, Martha has difficulty relating to the world other than through food. Her single-minded obsession with her culinary craft occasionally leads to unpleasant confrontations with customers. Consequently, the restaurant owner, Frida (Sibylle Canonica), requires her to see a therapist ([[August Zirner]]) to work out her poor interpersonal skills. Martha's therapy sessions, however, turn into monologues on food, and her approach to stress management usually involves briefly retreating to the restaurant's walk-in refrigerator.  Martha's life takes a dramatic turn when she learns that her sister is killed in a car accident, leaving behind an eight-year-old daughter, Lina ([[Maxime Foerste]]). Martha must now look after her niece, who is understandably depressed, withdrawn, and refuses to eat. The girl's Italian father, Giuseppe Lorenzo, has been out of the picture for years living somewhere in Italy. While coping with her sister's death and raising the young girl, Martha's world is further complicated when Frida hires fun-loving and unorthodox Mario ([[Sergio Castellitto]]) as a [[sous-chef]] to replace Lea (Katja Studt), who is expecting a child any day. Martha looks on in horror as Mario transforms her kitchen of precision and logistics with his relaxed banter and eclectic jazz music.  Unable to find an acceptable babysitter, Martha starts to bring Lina to the restaurant with her. Lina begins to emerge from her depression in the presence of Mario's playfulness, and even begins to eat when Mario leaves her unattended with a plate of spaghetti he's prepared. Touched by Mario's kindness and concern for the child, Martha becomes more accepting of Mario. She even asks for his help in locating Lina's father in Italy and translating a letter she's written to him.  Just as Martha's strained relationship with Lina seems to be improving, she forgets to pick the girl up from school while helping Lea, her very-pregnant sous chef, get to the hospital to deliver her baby. Lina is angry at being forgotten at school, and the incident appears to cause a serious setback between her and Martha. To make amends, Martha offers to grant Lina any wish. For her wish, Lina wants Mario to cook for them. Mario agrees, and prepares a picnic-style dinner in Martha's living room. Despite the mess left behind in the kitchen, the evening of stories and games brings the three closer together.  The renewed warmth between Martha and Lina is immediately tested when Martha is told by the school principal that Lina has not been attending school regularly, and that when she does come to school, she falls asleep. He also tells Martha that when he asked the girl why she was always so tired, she told him that she was forced to work in a kitchen for her room and board. Angered by Lina's behavior, and also having been warned by the restaurant owner, Martha tells her she can no longer come to the restaurant. Lina storms off, nearly getting hit by a car, and later attempts to run away to Italy. Mario continues to support Martha emotionally, and their relationship becomes romantic.  Lina's father, in answer to Martha's letter, finally arrives and takes his daughter to Italy to live with his new wife and family. Distraught and conflicted by the separation, Martha rejects Mario's loving support, and after another confrontation with a customer, she quits her job. Soon after,  Martha asks Mario to accompany her to Italy to retrieve Lina. After reuniting with the girl, Martha and Mario get married, and the three begin their lives together as a loving family.

Mulholland Drive (film)
 A dark-haired woman is the sole survivor of a car crash on [[Mulholland Drive]], a winding road high in the [[Hollywood Hills]]. Injured and in shock, she makes her way down into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment. Later that morning, an aspiring actress named Betty Elms arrives at the apartment, which is normally occupied by her Aunt Ruth. Betty is startled to find the woman, who has amnesia and assumes the name "Rita" after seeing a poster for the film ''[[Gilda]]'' starring [[Rita Hayworth]]. To help the woman remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key.  At a diner called Winkie's, a man tells his companion about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Meanwhile, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.  While trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkie's and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name "Diane Selwyn." They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to a soundstage where a film called ''The Sylvia North Story'', directed by Adam, is being cast. When Camilla Rhodes auditions, Adam capitulates to casting her. Betty locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying she is late to meet a friend.  Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom, they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. She and Betty have sex that night. At 2 a.m., Rita insists they go to a theater called Club Silencio. The emcee explains in different languages that everything is an illusion; [[Rebekah Del Rio]] comes on stage and begins singing the [[Roy Orbison]] song "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" in Spanish, then collapses while her vocals continue—her performance was a recording. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor with a thump.  Diane Selwyn wakes up in her bed in the same apartment that Betty and Rita investigated.

The Mummy Returns
  In 3067 BC, the [[List of characters in The Mummy series#Mathayus (The Scorpion King)|Scorpion King]] leads his army on a campaign to conquer the world. Seven years later, his army is defeated while attacking [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere, where his men die of heat exhaustion. After vowing to give [[Anubis]] his soul for the power to defeat his enemies, an [[oasis]] forms to hide the Scorpion King's [[pyramid]] and he receives a legion of jackal warriors. The Army of Anubis sweeps across Egypt, but once their task is finished, Anubis claims the Scorpion King's soul and his army.  In 1933, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell explore a ruined mortuary temple in ancient Thebes with their son, Alexander, where they find the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, the bracelet locks onto Alex, showing him a vision directing him to Ahm Shere. Alex has seven days to reach the oasis before the bracelet will kill him when the sun's rays shine on the Scorpion King's pyramid.  Evelyn is captured by an Egyptian cult who resurrect [[Imhotep (character)|Imhotep]]; they wish to use his power to defeat the Scorpion King, giving him command of Anubis's army to take over the world. The cult, led by Baltus Hafez, the [[British Museum]]'s [[curator]], includes a warrior named Lock-Nah and Meela Nais, the latter being a reincarnation of Imhotep's lover [[Anck-su-namun]]. Rick sets out to rescue Evelyn, accompanied by her brother Jonathan and the [[Medjay|Medjai]] Ardeth Bay.  Hafez attempts to sacrifice Evelyn but a fight ensues between Rick and Imhotep. Imhotep awakens mummified soldiers to kill Rick and the others. Freeing Evelyn, they flee on a double-decker bus. Alex is kidnapped by Lock-Nah, and along with the cult travels to Egypt. The O'Connells pursue along with Rick's associate from past adventures, Izzy, a pilot who provides the group with transportation.  The bracelet gives Alex directions to Ahm Shere and they travel there by train. Alex leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy's [[dirigible]]. Imhotep uses the Book of the Dead to give Meela Nais the soul of Anck-su-namun, but inadvertently allows Evelyn to recover her memories of her previous life as Princess Nefertiri, the bracelet's keeper and [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]'s daughter. Lock-Nah finds Alex leaving clues, so Imhotep makes a wall of water that attacks the dirigible, causing the O'Connells to crash into the jungle of Ahm Shere. Izzy stays with the dirigible to repair it. The O'Connells attack the cult, and both groups are attacked by pygmy mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth Bay kills Lock-Nah. They escape the pygmies, who kill the cult except for Baltus, Imhotep and Anck-su-namun.  Rick and Alex make it to the pyramid before sunrise, where the bracelet detaches from Alex's arm. Ardeth regroups with the Medjai in case Anubis's army rises. Evelyn is mortally stabbed by Anck-su-namun. Baltus puts the bracelet on and revives the Army of Anubis. Imhotep's powers are taken by Anubis, forcing him to fight as a mortal. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the Scorpion King and fights him, but the Scorpion King interrupts them, and Imhotep claims that Rick intends to kill him. The Medjai battle Anubis's army of jackal warriors. While Rick and the Scorpion King fight, Baltus is killed. Jonathan and Alex steal the Book of the Dead from Anck-su-namun and use it to resurrect Evelyn, who confronts Anck-su-namun while Alex and Jonathan help Rick.  The scepter Jonathan has been carrying extends into a spear that can kill the Scorpion King. The Medjai defeat Anubis' army, but find they have only defeated the vanguard. Rick sends the Scorpion King and his army back to the Underworld by killing the Scorpion King with the spear of Osiris, causing the oasis to be sucked back into the pyramid. Rick and Imhotep hang above a pit that leads to the underworld. Evelyn risks her own life to save Rick, but Anck-su-namun abandons Imhotep, who chooses to fall to his death after witnessing his lover's betrayal. Anck-su-namun falls into a pit of [[scorpion]]s and is eaten alive. The O'Connells reach the top of the sinking pyramid, and Izzy arrives with a modified dirigible and rescues the O'Connells as the oasis and the pyramid disappear. They depart into the sunset.  
The Musketeer
 The young boy, d'Artagnan witnesses the murder of his parents at the hands of Febre ([[Tim Roth]]), chief henchman of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] ([[Stephen Rea]]). [[d'Artagnan]] is nearly killed after using his dead father's sword to fight Febre, who is then left with a permanent scar and blind in one eye. d'Artagnan is taken in by family friend Planchet ([[Jean-Pierre Castaldi]]), a former [[musketeer]], one of the loyal protectors of [[King Louis XIII]] ([[Daniel Mesguich]]).  Fourteen years later the grown d'Artagnan ([[Justin Chambers]]) finds on his arrival in Paris that the musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu, who is usurping the king's authority with the help of Febre. Richelieu is also trying to foment hostility between [[France]], [[England]], and [[Spain]] to gain more political power for himself. d'Artagnan convinces two of the musketeers, [[Porthos]] ([[Steve Speirs]]) and [[Aramis]] ([[Nick Moran]]), to free the imprisoned head of the musketeers, Treville ([[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]]), thus earning their trust. He takes a room at a Paris [[boarding house]], where he takes a fancy to the chambermaid, Francesca ([[Mena Suvari]]), who is the daughter of the deceased seamstress to the Queen. Febre, on orders from Richelieu, incites a mob to attack the French Royal Palace during a State dinner for Lord Buckingham ([[Jeremy Clyde]]), a visiting English dignitary. d'Artagnan, with the help of Porthos, Aramis, and another musketeer, [[Athos (character)|Athos]] ([[Jan Gregor Kremp]]), saves King Louis, the Queen ([[Catherine Deneuve]]), and Lord Buckingham from being hurt or killed. Francesca recruits d'Artagnan to make a clandestine trip to the north coast of France with the Queen to meet with Buckingham in whose honor the State Dinner was being held, to keep peace between the two countries. d'Artagnan's landlord, however, overhears them and tells Febre.  During the trip, d'Artagnan fights off repeated attacks by Febre's henchmen. He and Francesca become intimate, only to have Febre discover them and kidnap her and the Queen. Febre forces the Queen to write a letter to Buckingham asking him to meet her at a heavily fortified castle of his choosing, using the Queen's ring to convince him of the authenticity of the message. Richelieu, finally, realizes just how far Febre is willing to go. He means to start a war between France and England and Spain, a war that will cripple France. Knowing he has lost control of his chief henchman, he secretly visits d'Artagnan and tells him of Febre's plans and pleads for his help to stop Febre. d'Artagnan agrees but only because Febre is holding Francesca. d'Artagnan returns to Paris and convinces the surviving musketeers that their responsibility to the Crown remains their highest priority. They join him at the castle where Francesca, the Queen and Lord Buckingham are being held. They charge the castle on horseback, losing several of their number in the process. The diversion they create allows Planchet to drive his carriage in front of the castle gates below the field of cannon fire from the castle. He is able to fire a mortar directly into the castle gates.  The remaining musketeers battle the remaining cardinal's guards, while d'Artagnan engages Febre in a massive sword fight, finally killing him and avenging the death of his parents. d'Artagnan and [[The Three Musketeers]] are given medals for their service. d'Artagnan covertly threatens Richelieu. At the movie's end, d'Artagnan and Francesca are seen to be married.  
Musa (film)
 In 1375, a small diplomatic mission from the Korean kingdom [[Goryeo]] travels to [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] to meet the [[Hongwu Emperor]], but they are arrested in retaliation for the death of a Chinese diplomat in Goryeo. They are put in chains and taken across a desert. However, Mongol raiders suddenly show up and kill the Chinese soldiers transporting them, while killing some Koreans in the process. The Mongols ride off, leaving the rest of the Koreans to die of hunger or thirst.  The head of the Korean soldiers in the group, General Choi-Jung, takes command because the two diplomats are dead. Later, they discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Hongwu Emperor's daughter so they ambush the Mongol convoy and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, a former slave of one of the diplomats, defeats the Mongol general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows the latter to live and escape.  The Koreans flee with the princess, determined to return her safely to the Chinese capital, [[Nanjing]], to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols give chase in the hope of recovering the princess and presenting her to their [[Khan (title)|Khan]] while the Koreans head towards a coastal fortress the princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up some Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.  Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honour. The lower-class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper-class. They have little confidence in their young general, and prefer taking orders from their veteran sergeant, Dae-Jung. The princess has difficulty adjusting to the rough necessities of her position on the run. Choi-Jung and Yeo-sol become nemeses, competing for the affections of the princess and exchanging blows on several occasions.  When the group finally reaches the fortress, they are disappointed to see that it is nothing more than abandoned ruins. At the same time, the Mongols have caught up with them and have set up a camp outside the fortress. As the Koreans prepare to make a last stand, the princess attempts to give herself up to the Mongols in exchange for peace, but Yeo-sol and Choi-Jung stop her. A fight breaks out between the two men and the Mongols, resulting in Yeo-sol being captured. Rambulwha, who is impressed with Yeo-sol's skill, offers to let the latter join his army but Yeo-sol refuses and returns to the fortress to help his fellows. In the final battle, the defenders' gunpowder traps backfire when the Mongols launch a fire attack and stage a raid on the fortress. Yeo-sol sacrifices himself to save the princess while Choi-Jung and Rambulwha kill each other. All the Koreans perish along with their Mongol enemies, except for Dae-Jung. The princess stays with the peasants at the fortress and promises to tell her father of the Koreans' sacrifice while Dae-Jung builds a makeshift raft and sails back to Goryeo.  
Mullet (film)
 In the film, Eddie (Ben Mendelsohn) returns to his home town on the south coast of [[New South Wales]].  Having left for the city without explanation 3 years ago, he tries to pick up the pieces of his life and fit back into the lives of those he left, including his ex-girlfriend Tully (Susie Porter) and brother Pete (Andrew Gilbert).  The title of the film comes from Eddie's nickname and from his attempts to make a living [[poaching]] [[mullet (fish)|mullet]].  The film succeeds in a very human portrayal of the difficulties in living on the fringe of a close-knit community.  The drama of the developing relationships is supported by very dry comedy (archetypical [[Australian humor|Australian humour]]) and detailed but understated design.  
Murari (film)
 Set up in the 18th century, during [[Amavasya]], the [[dark moon]] lunar phase, a greedy, and lavish alcoholic [[zamindar]] insults principal [[Deity]] [[Durga]] and attempts to steal the [[Panchaloha]] idol from the Royal Family's Temple in a state of [[inebriation]] so that he can repay his huge debt to the [[British people|British]] officers. Subsequently, he along with the British officer's are killed by the enraged Goddess Durga. The goddess infuses a mythical curse on the family's heirs, and every 48 years on the day of Diwali, one male heir from the Royal Family is succumbed to death. The present year 2001 denotes end of another 48 years, and Murari (Mahesh Babu), the Grandson of Sabari whose husband died 48 years back because of the curse, is expected to be the next heir to be succumbed to the curse. Murari lives with his father Sattipandu, Sister-in-law Gopi, brothers Sreenayya, Baachi and Soori and their respective wives and kids along with Sabari. Murari is named after Sabari's husband and thus is called with utmost respect by all family members except Gopi who calls him either by his name or as Kanayya. She treats him like her son and even decides to go for abortion clandestinely so that she would not neglect him once she has her own offspring. Thus since his childhood Murari considers Gopi as his mother since his mother died giving birth to him.  In another village, a beautiful city-bred Agricultural student called Vasundhara lives along with her big combined family and is the cynosure of all eyes and affection in the family. Sattipandu and Vasundhara's father Chanti are blood related and actually Gopi is Chanti's adopted daughter. These two families are separated because of a feud at Gopi's marriage because of Chanti's evil son Rambabu. Every year, Gopi is allowed to go there without any escort from her husband and when a tussle happens regarding this, Sreenayya apologizes and tries to patch up with her. At that point, Murari comes to know about Gopi's sacrifice for him when he secretly listens their conversation. For the first time, Gopi gets an escort in the form of Murari after this incident. There after few incidents, Murari falls in love with Vasundhara but leaves the house because of a land dispute with Rambabu with Gopi staying back there for few more days. Vasundhara tries to convey her love but she had no chance and returns to Hyderabad.  Back at Murari's home town, the temple priest Seshayya comes to know that Murari is going to be the victim of Devi's curse but he does not disclose the same to Sabari who goes for a pilgrimage. Meanwhile with assurance from his father, Murari goes to Hyderabad and unites with Vasundhara. They go back to Murari's house where Vasundhara lies that she came for Agricultural research. Slowly the couple gets the nod from all the members of both of the families. Meanwhile Sabari, who returns from the pilgrimage, upon being informed by Seshayya that Murari would be subjected to death by Devi this year, refuses for the marriage. Rambabu announces marriage of Vasundhara with her cousin Bullabbayi that day and when informed by Chanti, Murari tries to quit the temple to save her but is stopped by Sabari. Then she reveals the dark secret that is kept under wraps about Durga's curse to her family when they all are at the temple offering prayers for [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. Murari promises to Sabari that he would come alive along with Vasundhara to complete his [[Abhisheka]].  Murari goes to Vasundhara's place and saves her from Bullabbayi but once they are about to leave, Murari is fatally stabbed by Bullabbayi unintentionally and thus runs away on seeing Murari bleeding. In extreme pain, Murari realizes this as Goddess Durga's ploy and with all strength he manages to come back to the temple along with Vasundhara. He manages to convince everyone that he is safe and sound as he covered his wounds with soil and a cloth but Soori notices blood stains. Before he could say anything, Murari tells him to call an ambulance immediately and takes part in the rituals despite extreme pain and internal bleeding. By the time the rituals of Abhisheka, Yajna, and Arti end, the blood of Murari spills over the Holy Idol invoking the soul spirit, and as a result Murari loses his consciousness and is in critical condition. Seeing this, Sabari drowns herself in the holy river as a sacrifice to the Goddess, and saves Murari's life. Murari revives and marries Vasundhara.

My Sassy Girl
   === Part one === The film tells the love story of a male [[engineering]] [[college]] student, Gyeon-woo, and "the Girl" (who is never named in the movie). Gyeon-woo just cannot seem to catch a romantic break. One day, at dinner and drinks with his college friends, Gyeon-woo is interrupted by a call from his mother, telling him to visit his aunt and meet a potential date. At the train station on his way to his aunt's, he observes a drunk girl, standing precariously close to the edge of the train platform as the train approaches; he pulls her to safety just in time.  Inside the train, Gyeon-woo cannot help but stare at the girl who is his "type" but repulsed by her drunkenness. Finally, she throws up on a passenger and faints but not before she calls Gyeon-woo "honey". The passenger aggressively chides Gyeon-woo and tells him to take care of his "girlfriend". Gyeon-woo, completely flustered, leaves her on a subway platform bench, but his conscience compels him to take her to the nearest hotel for safety. While the girl is passed out on the bed, her phone rings and Gyeon-woo picks up. He gives vague answers in regards to the girl's whereabouts and perhaps through GPS tracking, police raid the room and Gyeon-woo gets maced and sent to jail. He is sent home from jail the next morning, and to his surprise he gets a phone-call from the girl, who demands they meet by the train station so she can figure out what happened the night before. Over ''[[soju]]'' the Girl cries, admits to breaking up with her boyfriend the day before and gets thoroughly drunk, resulting in a second trip to the same hotel. Thus begins his comically ill-fated relationship with the Girl.  After this second overnight stay at the hotel, she begins to become a more active part of his life. She visits Gyeon-woo in school and pulls him out of class, telling the teacher that Gyeon-woo is the father of her soon-to-be-aborted baby. The Girl's mood swings wildly from joyful to downright violent, but Gyeon-woo puts up with it and lets her abuse him for her amusement.  She is an aspiring scriptwriter and throughout the movie gives Gyeon-woo three different [[screenplay]]s from different [[genre]]s. The first is an action movie—''The Demolition Terminator''—which switches gender roles, symbolically having the Girl save her helpless lover (Gyeon-woo). The second is a wild perversion of a Korean short story—''[[Sonagi]]''—in which the Girl, having died, asks that her lover be buried along with her—even though he's still alive. The last is a ''[[wuxia]]/[[chambara|samurai movie]]'' spoof full of genre ''[[cliché]]s'' and [[anachronism]]s. All three feature the same common thread: the Girl is from the future.  Despite all the horrible things Gyeon-woo endures, he is determined to help cure the girl's pain. He decides to surprise her on her birthday and takes her on a nighttime trip to an [[amusement park]] which ends up quite differently from how he planned: the pair encounter an [[AWOL]] soldier who holds them hostage and rants about his misery after being jilted. Gyeon-woo convinces him to release her, and she in turn convinces the soldier to free Gyeon-woo and go on with his life and pursue another love.  === Part two === The Girl and Gyeon-woo's relationship takes a turn for the better; her cruel treatment toward's Gyeon-woo is her way of showing affection and the two grow closer. After a day of hanging out, he walks her home in the pouring rain and she demands he meet her father, who is a habitual drinker. Her parents do not take to Gyeon-woo and on leaving, he overhears an impassioned argument between the girl and her mother over her relationship with him.  He does not hear from her for quite some time and his life without her begins.  One day however, the Girl calls him and tells him to bring her a rose during class (the Girl attends an all-girls college) to commemorate their 100th-day anniversary.  He does this, leading to a touching and romantic scene where he arrives in disguise as a food delivery person into a packed auditorium and watches her play the melody of [[George Winston]]'s [[Variation (music)|variations]] on [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel's]] ''[[Canon in D]]'' on a [[piano]] onstage. He presents her the rose and the two hug while the classmates applaud in approval at his romantic gesture. As part of their celebration, they hit the bars and clubs together dressed in high-school uniforms; she gets drunk and as Gyeon-woo carries her on his back, a stranger slips him a condom. Gyeon-woo drops her off inside and is confronted at her house by her parents again; the father interrogates him and forces him to empty his pockets, where he embarrassingly presents the condom. Her father demands the two to break up.  The Girl does not contact him again and Gyeon-woo naturally thinks they have broken up, until one day seemingly out of the blue, she calls Gyeon-woo to meet her for dinner as she is on a blind date.  The Girl introduces Gyeon-woo to the date, who thinks Gyeon-woo is a great friend of hers based on how highly she speaks of him. She is unusually soft and gentle as there is clear awkwardness between the two. She excuses herself to the washroom and appears to not be handling the break-up so well. The Girl returns to the table to see Gyeon-woo gone; he left while she was in the bathroom, but not before offering the blind date ten rules to follow to ensure her happiness; only order coffee at cafes, prevent her from over-drinking, give in to her at every circumstance, when she hits you pretend it hurts when it doesn't and vice versa, surprise her with roses, learn [[Kendo]] and [[Squash (sport)]], and more. While the blind date recites these rules to her, she realizes how well Gyeon-woo understands her and realizes her love for him. She abruptly leaves her date and searches for Gyeon-woo at the subway station.  They cross paths several times, but never run into each other, so she goes into the subway security office to see the security monitors. She sees him standing close to the edge of the platform (just like she was in the beginning). While an employee makes an announcement in the microphone, she yells his name; he hears and they re-unite at the office.  Once reunited the two realize they are at a turning point in their relationship, but, for some unspeakable reason, the Girl decides it is time for them to part.  As a gesture to their happy times the two write letters to each other and bury them in a "time capsule" under a particular tree on a mountain in the countryside.  They agree to meet again at the tree after two years to read the letters together.  After burying the "time capsule" they go their separate ways for good.  === Overtime === During the two-year span, Gyeon-woo works hard to improve himself; he practices Kendo and Squash and learns to swim. To pass the time, he also began writing about his dating experiences with the Girl on the internet as a means to cope. His stories gain so much notoriety that he is approached by movie producers to turn his letters into a movie; he is ecstatic because the Girl's life-long dream was to have one of her screenplays made into a film. He so desperately wants to share this news with her, but chooses to wait until they agree to meet.  Two years have passed and on the agreed date, he travels to the tree on the mountain-top, but the Girl does not show up. He comes day after day without opening the time-capsule in hopes that she would appear, but she never does. Eventually, he opens the time capsule and reads her letter and learns the root of her angst and behavior: Gyeon-woo reminds her of her previous boyfriend who, rather than breaking up with her, actually died before she met Gyeon-woo. On the day they met on the train platform, she was supposed to go on a blind date set up by the mother of her deceased ex-boyfriend, with whom she kept a close bond with. Because of her chance meeting with Gyeon-woo, part of her feels that it was her ex that brought them two together and she develops guilt for falling in love with him. She needs time apart to heal and move on from her ex alone.  A year after Gyeon-woo visits the tree, the Girl finally arrives. Sitting under the tree is an old man. She reveals that she was supposed to meet someone at the tree a year ago, but lacked the courage to do so. She believed that if she was truly meant to be with him, destiny would bring them together. During their conversation the old man reveals the secret of the tree, that it is not the same tree; the original tree had been struck and killed by lightning a year before and a similar tree had been planted by a young man so that his special someone would not be sad. The tree was dead and split into two. After the girl reads his letter, she tries to call Gyeon-woo repeatedly, but is unable to contact him.  Some time later, the Girl is on the train and the door closes right before a man tries to board. She has her back turned to him, so she doesn't realize it is Gyeon-woo, who realizes it is her and chases it down the platform to no avail. They fail to cross paths again.  As it turns out, the Girl is on her way to lunch with her deceased boyfriend's mother, where she plans on introducing her to her nephew for a blind date. The nephew arrives and it turns out to be Gyeon-woo; as it turns out, Gyeon-woo is the boy that she had been trying to introduce to the Girl for years. The mother offers reasons as to why they'd be a great match for one another, but Gyeon-woo and the Girl are too busy gazing into each other's eyes. The mother asks "Do you two know each other?"; the camera pans out and they are holding hands under the table.  
My Life as McDull
  McDull is not the brightest kid on the block, but he continually tries to do his best and please his mother. Although it seems that he may not be destined for great things in life as his mother wishes, McDull never gives up.  The story focuses on several tales about [[McDull]] and his childhood. This is told as a narrative reflection of a now adult [[McDull]]. These tales muddle up in imaginative uses of [[Cantonese]] and heaps of local [[Hong Kong]] culture. From tales about a [[turkey meat|turkey]] dinner to dreams of following in [[Lee Lai-shan]]'s footsteps, McDull faces ebbs and flows with his demanding but devoted mother.  There is a significant amount of material in the movie which is culturally relevant to Hong Kong. For example, a large proportion of the humour and appeal of the movie arises from its complex wordplay and subtle hints of Hong Kong's historical legacy and dynamic.  The songs featured in the film are bright and beguiling, and are not overbearing as some musical animations are likely to become. The film's animation is trouble-free and colourful changing at times as stories alter, but echoing the fashion of the innovative artwork. It uses a number of contemporary [[Computer Graphics]] animations in several scenes to illustrate an urban Hong Kong, but it skillfully shows Hong Kong as the dirty [[conurbation]] it is rather than the high-pitched clean cityscape that many travel advertisements like to portray.  The genial and timid piglet McDull has cheered up the lives of kids, professors, housewives and CEOs, because he epitomises the uncontainable and happy-go-lucky spirit of Hong Kong. His no-holds-barred porcobiography is a frame-by-frame account of life growing up in the slums of [[Shamshuipo]], set against the colourful campaign of a post-97 Hong Kong trudging along regardless of downturn woes. Pouncing shots of busy [[Kowloon]] streets, slimy cafés, plus sights and smells of local flavour fused with animation, live object shooting and 3-D computer graphics define the film.  
My First Mister
 In an effort to secure employment at the upscale [[Westfield Century City|Century City Mall]] in [[Los Angeles]], Jennifer (Sobieski), a 17-year-old "[[Goth subculture|goth]]-[[punk subculture|punk]]" girl who just graduated from high school, makes a nuisance of herself at a clothing store run by 49-year-old Randall Harris (Brooks), who eventually hires her on a trial basis as a stockroom clerk. Jennifer refers to herself simply as "J", and thus asks Randall if it's okay if she calls him "R", to which he accedes.  One day, as there is nothing more to be done in the stockroom, J makes her way to the front of the store and begins to interact with customers. Encouraged by her initiative but concerned that her appearance may frighten away potential customers, Randall buys her an appropriate [[Clothing|outfit]] and promotes her to saleswoman.  Feeling isolated from the other people in her life, J finds she is attracted to Randall. After an incident that makes him question whether he can continue to trust her, J demonstrates her trust in him by revealing that she engages in [[self harm]]. The two thus strike up an unlikely friendship as they realize that neither has anyone close with whom they can confide. Made aware that J is unhappy living with her mother (who seems to pay more attention to her two [[pug]]s than her daughter) and stepfather, Randall offers her an advance on her [[salary]] so she can afford her own place, then helps her find an [[apartment]].  As their friendship progresses, Randall consents to getting a (very small) [[tattoo]] at J's urging, only to realize at the last possible moment that he can't go through with it. In a fit of despair he declares that they can't continue as friends. Confronted by J at his home a short time later, Randall confides his many [[phobia]]s, which endears him to J even more. Their friendship restored, Randall reluctantly accompanies J to a [[cemetery]] to lie on the [[graves]] of the deceased to feel their "energy", something she does regularly. Due to the lateness of the hour, they go back to Randall's where they bond over tea and J spends the night on the couch.  The following morning J discovers Randall collapsed in the street after having told her he was going "for a [[running|run]]." She learns that Randall has had [[leukemia]] for many years and doesn't have long to live, and is initially very angry that he didn't share this with her.  While collecting some of Randall's personal items from his home, J discovers the name and address of his ex-wife. Unable to contact her by phone, J drives to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] only to find her (and Randall's) son Randy, a deeply [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] young man who tells her that his mother died in a car accident six months earlier, and had told him that his father had died before he was born. Although he initially refuses to drive to L.A. to see the father he's never known before he dies, he ultimately does so. Because of J's intervention, Randall and his son have a brief time to get to know one another, for which Randall is very grateful.  J's friendship with Randall inspires her to seek a closer relationship with her family, especially her mother. In Randall's final days, Jennifer organizes a dinner at which his son and Jennifer's family come together to celebrate his life.  
My Wife Is a Gangster
 Eun-jin was separated from her older sister Yu-jin when they were kids at an orphanage. While growing up, Eun-jin became a [[Kkangpae]] (Korean Mafia) gangster and adopted the nickname "Mantis." Upon discovering that Yu-jin had cancer, Eun-jin demanded that the doctors perform an operation; however, they refused. The dying Yu-jin wished that her sister would marry soon, so Eun-jin went on a blind date under the advice of her underling Romeo, who invited a stylist to design the appropriate makeup for Eun-jin. However, the date was a disaster and Romeo was sent to find someone else more suitable.  Later, while Eun-jin was smashing up a car in retaliation against two men, a man ran up to protect her, but was accidentally hit in the head by Eun-jin. The man, Kang Soo-il, was a simple but kind-hearted man.  He seemed perfect for Eun-jin and he later married her. Yu-jin spoke to Eun-jin about her desire to have children and Eun-jin set out to get pregnant. She forced her husband into several occasions of sexual intercourse.    While Eun-jin was out for a meal with her group, she was approached by a man from a rival gang, the White Sharks. He was asked to leave after he had a drink from Eun-Jin, but still lingered. Annoyed, she stabbed him in the head, barely missing his eyes.  The next day, there was a meeting between Eun-jin and the White Sharks and a showdown was arranged between Eun-jin and Nanman.   Eun-jin and Nanman fought fiercely.  It seemed that Nanman had the upper hand after stabbing Eun-jin in the stomach.  However, as he went to finish her off, she moved out the way and Nanman fell down a cliff.  However, Nanman managed to climb back up and tries to strangle Eun-jin.  Eun-jin found a way to escape and stomps on Nanman's groin after she stabs the ground right next to his face, refusing to kill him.  Soo-il eventually found out that Eun-jin was a gangster after seeing her tattoo on her back, and wanted her to give it up. Eun-jin discovered she was pregnant and told Yu-jin.  Later, Yu-jin then died in front of Eun-jin after telling Eun-jin that her baby deserves a father.   Later, Romeo died in the arms of Sherry, after being stabbed by five street punks. Sherry uses the public telephone to call Andy that Romeo has been stabbed. Andy mistakenly believed it was Nanman and the White Sharks who killed Romeo and set out to take revenge on them.  Upon arriving at the White Sharks' warehouse, Andy and the rest of his group discovered that they were heavily outnumbered.  The pregnant Eun-jin went out to fight the gangsters, but suffered a miscarriage after suffering a vicious attack by Nanman.  Eun-jin told Nanman to stop kicking her in the belly as she was pregnant. Nanman then revealed that he had become a eunuch after his earlier showdown with Eun-jin.   As Nanman was about to stab Eun-jin, her boss turns up and pleads to the White Shark to spare her life in exchange for some documents. Soo-il found out that Eun-jin was pregnant when she was in the hospital.  He takes revenge on White Shark by dousing the gang and him with kerosene. As he was holding up the lighter, Soo-il was restrained but White Shark foolishly ignites himself, along with 64 other men, when attempting to light his cigarette. The film ends with Soo-il as the leader alongside Eun-jin, who is starting a showdown with another gang leader.

Nabi (film)

People come from all over the world on guided tours of the city deliberately seeking the virus. Victims of lead poisoning are [[quarantine]]d in [[sanatorium]]s for the protection of tourists, and forced [[abortion]]s are carried out to prevent the births of deformed babies.  Anna Kim ([[Kim Ho-jung]]) is one such tourist who arrives in the city having booked a tour with the Butterfly Travel Agency. Anna wishes to become infected with the virus in order to forget the painful memories of her abortion. Her "virus guide", Yuki ([[Kang Hye-jung]]), is seven months pregnant and unwell, but needs the money to support herself and her unborn child. K ([[Jang Hyun-sung]]), their driver, is new to the agency and starting his first assignment. An orphan with no memory of his real family, he keeps an old photograph of himself as a child on the dashboard of his taxi; he picks up other passengers in the hopes that someone will recognize him, even though this is against agency policy.  After meeting Yuki and K at the airport, Anna is taken to a number of virus exposure sites, but their early attempts at finding the virus are cut short by acid rain storms. Finding out about Yuki’s pregnancy and poor health, Anna requests a new guide. K, suspicious of Yuki’s behaviour, reports her to the authorities as a suspected lead poisoning victim. Nevertheless, after Yuki treats Anna for exposure to acid rain, a bond starts to develop between them, and the three spend some time together. Anna cooks a meal for Yuki, and in return Yuki reveals her collection of personal items from previous clients, memories she is safeguarding should those people ever wish to remember their past again. After Anna leaves, Yuki is taken away by the city authorities.  Continuing without Yuki as a guide, K continues to drive Anna around the city. At first Anna is frustrated by K's efforts to learn about his own past, but they begin to understand each other as they spend more time together. One night, they are involved in a road accident and their taxi veers over the side of a bridge; Anna rescues K from the water below and manages to resuscitate him, though she later requires treatment herself.  Having recovered from the accident and with her time in Korea drawing to a close, Anna begins to make arrangements for her return home. However, she decides to track down Yuki and uses the last of her money to buy her release. They resume their search for the virus, but are cut short once again when Yuki’s [[Rupture of membranes|water breaks]]. Knowing that she will not survive the birth, Anna urges Yuki to put her own health first, though Yuki is adamant that she will have the baby. Unable to reach the hospital in time, Anna fulfils Yuki’s wish to have a [[water birth]], and, assisted by K, takes her down to the beach where she delivers the baby in the sea. Yuki later dies in hospital.  As Anna and K search through Yuki’s belongings, they discover an old passport with Anna’s photo in it, suggesting that this is not the first time she has been to the city in search of the virus. Having no memory of such a visit, Anna goes to the Butterfly Travel Agency headquarters where she demands answers, but as she has signed a waiver they refuse to divulge any information. Later, she tells K how she wanted to adopt Yuki’s son in order to make a fresh start, but that she knows he needs the child more than she does.  Three years later, K is still working as a driver for the agency. No longer searching for answers to his past, he now keeps a photograph of Anna in his taxi, along with one of him and his adopted son.

The men are informed by their supervisor that they are now working for a company called East Midlands Infrastructure, and are competing with rival track companies.  On a maintenance job, one of the workers is sent away because his depot is now owned by a rival firm. His departure leaves the rest of the crew unable to finish the job. The railwaymen are introduced to their new managing director, Mr Hemmings, by watching a video about the "age of change" in Britain's rail industry. Hemmings says that the culture will change too, and the days of a job for life are over, though new opportunities have arisen for those prepared to take the initiative. East Midlands Infrastructure is renamed Gilchrist Engineering.  Gerry argues with his boss about procedures being imposed without consultation. Management make a concession that the crew points out is no concession at all. The Managing Director visits the depot in person, and demands that, since "the slate has been wiped clean", there must be no concessions or agreements, forcing the supposed concession to be withdrawn.  To the railwaymen's surprise, they are ordered to destroy their old equipment with sledgehammers as it no longer meets current standards. They are interrupted with news of a derailment at Dore. There they meet a former colleague, Len, who is working for an agency and earning much more than he did with the company.  After his pay is reduced to pay for additional child support, Paul agrees to take voluntary redundancy and join an agency. John follows suit. Mick and Gerry try to talk them out of it, pointing out that they will lose any job security. However, the few remaining Gilchrist employees are soon notified that the depot is no longer competitive and will be closed. They are given twelve weeks' notice of their redundancy.  Mick visits an employment agency and discovers that, while work is available, he will receive no sickness benefits and must pay for his own transport, equipment and training. He goes to a job but the crew he joins is four men short and includes builders with no railway experience. Mick argues with the supervisor, and is given a negative report which leaves him unemployed for weeks. He finally manages to get another assignment that leads a reunion with his former colleagues. Their happiness at working together again is marred by a passing train spewing toilet waste over them.  The men are given a job pouring a cement signal base, but they are next to an active track with no look out. After dusk, Jim is hit by a locomotive and badly injured. Since they could be barred from working for breaching safety procedures, Mick and Paul carry Jim to the side of a road so that they can claim he has been hit by a car.  Jim dies from his injuries. Gerry is now the only one of the original five remaining at Gilchrist, and his job is due to end in days.  
Nayak (2001 Hindi film)
 The plot focuses on the protagonist, Shivaji Rao ([[Anil Kapoor]]). He happens to be an ambitious TV reporter, working for "Q TV" along with his friend Topi ([[Johnny Lever]]). While on the job, Rao records a conversation in which the Chief Minister Balraj Chauhan ([[Amrish Puri]]), takes an indifferent stand during riots triggered by a fight between some college students and bus drivers, so as not to lose his voter base. Due to police inaction, there is loss of life and damage to property. To explain his actions, Chauhan later agrees to a live interview with Shivaji, during the course of which Rao raises these issues and airs the Chief Minister's stand he had caught on tape.  In response to Shivaji's allegations about the mismanagement by his government, Chauhan redirects the question by instead talking about how difficult his job is due to red tape and bureaucracy, and challenges Shivaji to be the CM for a day and experience those problems himself. Shivaji reluctantly accepts the challenge to prove Chauhan wrong. Educated and vigilant, Shivaji takes care of issues that affect the populace everyday, giving the slum their rightful apartments, getting jobs for the unemployed, suspending inefficient and corrupt government officers. He is assisted by the secretary, Bansal ([[Paresh Rawal]]) who serves as a side kick. As the last act of the day, Rao gets Chauhan arrested as he is the root cause of all the corruption. Later, Chauhan bails out, and passes an ordinance to nullify all orders passed by Shivaji when he was the CM. Taking Shivaji's success as an insult, Chauhan sends hitmen to get him killed and destroys his house on false grounds.  Meanwhile Shivaji falls in love with Manjari ([[Rani Mukerji]]), a naive and carefree villager. When Rao asks her father ([[Shivaji Satam]]) her hand in marriage, he refuses on grounds that Rao is not employed by the government. After his tenure as a one-day CM he starts preparing for the Indian Civil Service Examination to win Manjari's hand in marriage. However, Bansal shows up and tells him that Shivaji's popularity has rocketed sky-high and people want him to become the next CM of the state. He is reluctant at first, but when Chauhan's henchmen vandalise Q TV premises to intimidate him, and the people show their support by thronging to his place in huge numbers, he agrees to take part in the elections.  In the ensuing state elections, he wins by a vast majority. But Manjari’s father, angered by Shivaji's decision, refuses to let his daughter marry him. Here, Chauhan’s political allies desert him causing his defeat. On becoming the chief minister, Shivaji brings about lots of improvements and quickly becomes an idol in the people’s eyes. However his growing popularity is threatened continuously by Chauhan who uses his henchmen to kill him or at least tarnish his image as a public hero. But Shivaji promptly answers by digging out all accusations against Chauhan and his allies. This, however, causes a reunion of Chauhan and his allies. After a failed attempt on Shivaji's life by hiring an assassin, a bomb is detonated at his home killing his parents ([[Neena Kulkarni]] and [[Kitty (actor)|Kitty]]).  In the final attempt, Chauhan orders Pandurung ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) to destroy law and order and cause bomb explosions in various parts of the city. But a priest is able to overhear a few men planning to detonate bombs. He immediately notifies Shivaji's office via the "Complaint Box" department. Pandurung is arrested and under tactical inquiry by Shivaji and his secretary, he discloses the location of the 4 bombs. A Bomb Squad is able to defuse 3 bombs, but the 4th one explodes before they could reach to it. Chauhan, however, uses this success against Shivaji by blaming the young CM for the bomb. Seeing no way out, Shivaji summons Chauhan to the secretariat and creates a situation such that it would seem as if Chauhan was there to shoot Shivaji but failed. Shivaji takes up a gun, but pointing it to his arm, shoots himself, and then hands over the gun to Chauhan. Now getting to know that Shivaji had set a trap, an enraged Chauhan attempts to shoot Shivaji, but his shot misses. The security guards then shoot down Chauhan killing him. Shivaji, secretly tells Bansal the truth and says that "finally they have turned me into a politician too" but Bansal believes that Chauhan deserved death saying "he instituted politics for a long time for corruption and evil; you did it only once for good" . Manjari's father also comes to realize that Shivaji is in fact a great man who sees duty before everything else and allows Manjari to marry him.  In the end, the city develops under the governance of Shivaji Rao and his colleagues. The complaint box, where people were supposed to fill in their complaints and information about various threats anonymously, is shown to be empty, signifying that the reasons to be afraid have been taken care of.

Nariman (film)
 Manu ([[Vijayakumar (Malayalam actor)|Vijayakumar]]), the accused in the notorious couple murder case, attempts an escape during his prison transfer, but ends up shot by the police multiple times. Dr. Giri ([[N. F. Varghese]]), a senior surgeon takes pity on the escaped criminal who is to be hanged for his crime. Manu is accused to having murdered his elder brother ([[Ashokan (actor)|Ashokan]]) and sister-in-law out of lust for the latter, in an attempted rape. For various reasons Dr. Giri believes Manu to be innocent. He convinces his friend Shekharan ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardhanan]]), the Chief Minister of Kerala, to re-open the case and assign the case to a sincere and brilliant, yet aggressive police officer Ashok Nariman ([[Suresh Gopi]]). Initially termed "hopeless" by legal advisors—due to the excellent way the case was framed, Nariman finds loopholes. He learns that the crime was committed by the intelligent Adv. Padhmanabhan Thampi ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) and his friends Kochunarayanan ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]), SP Philippose ([[Spadikam George]]) and their allies including Musthafa Kamal (a.k.a. Karate Kamal) ([[Bheeman Raghu]]) -- who executed the crime. Nariman submits the report and the case comes to the Sessions Court. To everyone's disappointment, the Judge refuses to have a second hearing of the case—as earlier the case had gone up to Supreme Court and even the President of India did not have any pity on the "perpetrator" Manu. The Judge believes the case to be a publicity stunt as the result of change in Government and the Court cannot be deceived by any.  Although disappointed at the happenings, Nariman takes over a new case—Ammini missing case. Ammini ([[Anju (actress)|Anju]]) was an ally, a prostitute, a pimp and an outlet for the illegal liquor dealings of Kochunarayanan. Lately, she had a change of mind to turn back from her wrong way of life, to be with her daughter who hated Ammini's activities. This provoked Adv. Thampi as she knew many of their secrets, even to an extend more than they know of each other. He even had suspicion of her being the reason for the police storming the secret hide-out of Kamal. Nariman reports the four guilty of murder and the case reaches the same Sessions Court. The four were found to be guilty by Court, even with an experienced senior lawyer (Adv. Vaikuntam ([[Rajan P. Dev]])) appearing for them against the inexperienced public prosecutor Adv. Sethulekshmi ([[Samyuktha Varma]]), the love interest of Nariman.  While the Judge ([[Kozhikode Narayanan Nair]]) reads his judgement, Nariman—to everyone's surprise—interrupts the Judge to say the four are innocent. He presents Ammini, the very same Ammini that the Court declared dead. He confesses his act on how the four became 'culprits' and how the case was framed using strong, but fake evidences (as in couple murder case). If an average officer could easily deceive the Court, he exclaims what will happen if an evil genius with a group of powerful allies sets out on a rampage. If the Court, where common people seek justice, fails to stop them, then there would be a state of anarchy where people won't hesitate to act worse. Through his drama, he pleads justice for Manu.  Although initially furious with his actions, the Judge realizes that the Court can be deceived at times and allows for a second hearing in Manu's case. Through the proceedings months after, Manu is found innocent by the Court and the guilty quadraplet-Adv. Thampi, Kochunarayanan, Philipose and Kamal-get their punishment.

Never Again (2001 film)
   
No Man's Land (2001 film)
  Two wounded soldiers, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] (Čiki, portrayed by [[Branko Đurić]]) and a [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] (Nino, portrayed by [[Rene Bitorajac]]) are caught between their lines in the no man's land, in a struggle for survival.  The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. They trade insults and even find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier (Cera, portrayed by [[Filip Šovagović]]) who wakes from unconsciousness. A [[land mine]] had been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, it would be fatal.  A [[French Army|French]] sergeant (Marchand, portrayed by Georges Siatidis), of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), gets involved in effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the [[humanitarian aid]] convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander. Luckily, an [[English people|English]] reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the United Nations high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers.  A row between the stressed out and fatigued Čiki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued. Eventually, Čiki shoots Nino and is in turn shot by a Peacekeeper. Meanwhile, it is found that the mine cannot be defused. The UNPROFOR high command tries to save face: they lie, saying that Cera has been saved and they leave the area, along with the reporters and everyone else.  In reality, Cera is left alone and desolate in the trenches, still immobilized by the mine. Meanwhile, the UNPROFOR commander has arranged false information to be passed to both Bosnian and Serb troops, to make them believe their enemies will be trying to reoccupy the trench at night (which each side would try to counter with an [[artillery]] barrage that presumably will kill Cera and obliterate the evidence).  
Not Another Teen Movie
 In the stereotypical high school community of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] High in [[Southern California]], attractive Priscilla ([[Jaime Pressly]]), a popular [[cheerleader]], separates from her talented [[American football|football]] star but [[slacker]] boyfriend, Jake Wyler ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]).  After Jake discovers that Priscilla is now dating timid and weird Les ([[Riley Smith]]) just to spite him, one of Jake's friends, Austin ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]), makes a bet with him to turn Janey Briggs ([[Chyler Leigh]]), a "uniquely rebellious girl", into the [[prom queen]].  Jake attempts to court Janey's love, but faces adversity from his own sister, Catherine ([[Mia Kirshner]]), who is [[Incest|sexually attracted to him]]; Janey's unnoticed admirer and best friend, Ricky Lipman ([[Eric Jungmann]]); and memories from his past football career.  Catherine eventually assists her brother by slightly altering Janey's appearance (by simply removing her glasses and ponytail), instantly making her drop dead gorgeous.  Meanwhile, Janey's younger brother, Mitch ([[Cody McMains]]), and his friends Ox ([[Sam Huntington]]) and Bruce ([[Samm Levine]]), make a pact to lose their virginity by graduation despite still being in their freshman year.  Mitch tries to impress his longtime crush, the beautiful yet perverted Amanda Becker ([[Lacey Chabert]]) with a [[love letter]].  Bruce says that he does not have a chance with her, mockingly stating, "Keep dreaming!"  As the prom draws near, Jake draws infamy among his peers after he fails to lead his football team to victory at the state championship game the year before.  The situation is further worsened when Austin tricks Jake into telling Janey about his bet to spite Priscilla by pretending to whisper the secret bet in Janey's ear, causing her to immediately leave Jake in anger.  During prom night, Austin and Janey go together; a jealous Jake and Catherine have a dance-off with Austin and Janey, with Catherine dancing in a sexual manner.  Janey runs off crying.  Meanwhile, Mitch and his friends are having a lousy time at the prom until Amanda arrives and Mitch gives her the letter (to which she responds that she does not have sex with every loser who does such, but will give them [[handjob]]s), horny Bruce hooks up with the equally horny international student Areola (unrated version), and Ox later hooks up with Catherine after sharing a romantic and rather odd connection.  Jake is awarded prom king and the principal reads out that the votes for prom queen are tied.  Everyone thinks that it is between Janey and Priscilla, but they are shocked to find that Kara ([[Samaire Armstrong]]) and Sara Fratelli ([[Nectar Rose]]), [[conjoined twins]], win prom queen.  During the traditional prom king and queen dance, Janey supposedly left with Austin to go to a hotel.  Jake goes to the hotel room where he finds Austin having wild sex with a girl, but is shocked to find that it is Priscilla and not Janey, while Les videotapes them with his pants down.  Austin tells Jake that Janey "ran home to her daddy". Jake coldly punches Austin and Priscilla, knocking them unconscious for their part in Janey's humiliation.  He then punches Les for "being really weird" (he also punches a plastic bag that happens to be floating next to Les); afterwards he runs to Janey's house only to learn from her father that she is going to [[Paris]] for [[art school]].  Jake arrives at the airport and confronts her before she can board the plane, but uses a plethora of [[cliché]]d lines from other films (such as ''[[She's All That]]'', ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'', ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'', and ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'') to convince her to stay home in America.  His final (and only original) speech suggests they would be better off separated, but Janey mistakenly believes he is quoting ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and she decides to stay with him.  
No Such Thing (film)
  Beatrice ([[Sarah Polley]]) is a young woman working in a media center under a woman known only as The Boss ([[Helen Mirren]]). She receives a recording from her fiancé Jim, who has been sent as part of a small production crew to Iceland to investigate a Monster that lives there. Determined to find her fiancé, Beatrice convinces her boss to send her to Iceland, but her plane crashes. She is the only survivor and, in order to walk again, undergoes an extremely painful, radical surgery. As she recovers, she befriends Dr. Anna ([[Julie Christie]]), who helps her travel to the remote village where the monster lives.  After cajoling Beatrice into drinking herself into unconsciousness, the villagers strip her and leave her as an offering to the Monster himself ([[Robert John Burke]]), a foul-mouthed, alcoholic beast old enough to remember human ancestors crawling from the seas. Beatrice shows him no real fear, although the Monster tells her he has killed her friends and might kill her, too. He tells her that he wants to die, but is indestructible. In an effort to force Beatrice to try to kill him, he proves that he killed Jim and his crew. She shoots him twice and he reacts in obvious pain, but heals almost instantly. He tells her of a mad scientist, Dr. Artaud ([[Baltasar Kormákur]]), who had discovered a way to kill him, but Dr. Artaud had been "taken away in a straight jacket." Beatrice offers to help him find Dr. Artaud if the Monster comes with her to New York and promises not to kill anyone while he is there.  In New York the Monster becomes a celebrity, with the Boss staging a media frenzy as they search for Dr. Artaud. They find that he is working for the government. While Beatrice revels in the attention, the Monster remains miserable and drunk. The Boss makes a deal with a government scientist to study the Monster and he's rushed away by army guards who  mislead him into believing he is going to see Dr. Artaud. Instead, he is subjected to torturous experiments as the scientists try to discover the key to his indestructibility, one of them noting that he can't seem to tolerate new information. One of those experiments involves the Monster being ridiculed and beaten on the street to study his behavior. The Monster holds true to his promise to Beatrice and does not kill anyone.  Meanwhile, Beatrice meets Dr. Artaud by chance. With Margaret ([[Annika Peterson]]), a remorseful former coworker of Beatrice's, they hatch a plan to escape back to Iceland with the Monster. They make their escape, but are pursued by the government, who fears the Monster and Artaud might fall into the wrong hands. Artaud builds a machine that will kill the Monster. Beatrice bids the Monster a tearful farewell, and kisses him goodbye. As the machine starts, the army storms their hideout. As the lights flicker on and off and the machine moves the Monster into place (in a process mirroring Beatrice's surgery), the Monster and Beatrice face each other one last time. Her face flickers in his vision for several minutes before the screen blackens.

O (film)
 During a high school basketball game, Odin James ([[Mekhi Phifer]]) scores the basket that wins the game for his team. Later at an awards ceremony, the coach, Duke Goulding ([[Martin Sheen]]) presents the [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] award to Odin for his efforts, an award he shares with his teammate Michael Cassio ([[Andrew Keegan]]). In giving Odin the award, Duke passes over his son Hugo ([[Josh Hartnett]]), Odin's teammate and best friend. At a party celebrating the victory, Hugo plans with school outcast Roger Calhoun ([[Elden Henson]]) to go to the school's dean, Bob Brable ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]) and tell him that Odin raped his daughter, Desi ([[Julia Stiles]]), whom Odin has been dating. Hugo promises Roger that Desi will be his after Odin is out of the way, but Roger is only a pawn in Hugo's ultimate plan to destroy Odin.  Later, in another game, Odin's team wins once again. At the celebration party, Hugo engineers a fight between Roger and a very drunk Michael, who is temporarily suspended from the team. Hugo tells Michael to ingratiate himself with Desi so that she will talk to Odin on his behalf. Soon afterward, Hugo tells Odin that Michael and Desi have been spending a lot of time together, and that she may be cheating on him. Odin doesn't believe this at first, but gradually comes to suspect them. Odin questions Desi, but she calms him down and he believes her. Nevertheless, the stress of the situation drives Odin to begin using drugs.  Hugo manipulates his girlfriend Emily ([[Rain Phoenix]]) into stealing a scarf for him that Odin had given to Desi. Hugo, in turn, gives it to Michael in hopes that Odin will believe that Desi gave Michael the scarf, and so is cheating on him.  Meanwhile, Odin and Desi are having sex at a motel, during which Odin sees an image of Michael on top of Desi in the mirror; angered, he becomes very rough with Desi, to the point that she cries out for him to stop, a plea he ignores as he continues to rape her. Afterward, they lie together staring in opposite directions.  After Odin assaults another student during a game in a drug-fueled rage, Hugo tells him about the scarf, convincing him that Desi is cheating on him. Enraged, Odin vows to kill her; Hugo then promises to kill Michael. Hugo, with Odin and Roger, plans to kill Michael and Desi. Hugo and Roger attempt to kill Michael in a [[carjacking]], but it does not go as planned: Roger and Michael struggle, Hugo hits Michael with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious. Roger shoots Michael in the leg, and then Hugo turns the gun on Roger and kills him after telling him that Desi is dead.  Odin and Desi are in Desi's room talking and Odin is pretending to make up with her. They are making out on the bed when suddenly Odin attacks her; Desi fights back, but he finally strangles her to death. Emily rushes into the room and sees Desi's corpse; she soon finds out what Hugo has done. She begins telling Odin that Hugo told her to steal the scarf and exposes his plot. Not believing Emily, Hugo executes her. Odin finally realizes that Hugo has been manipulating him the entire time, and demands to know why; Hugo refuses to answer. When the police arrive, Odin tells them what happened and commits [[suicide]]. As Hugo is taken into police custody, he says in voice over that he will have his day in the spotlight.  
Nowhere in Africa
 In 1938, the Redlich family flees to [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] from [[Głubczyce|Leobschütz]] in [[Silesia]], [[Nazi Germany]], to escape the increasing persecution of the [[History of the Jews in Europe|Jews]]. Walter, a former lawyer, finds work as a farm manager and sends for his family. His wife Jettel has trouble adjusting to life in Africa, although their daughter Regina quickly adapts to her new environment, easily learning the language of the country and showing interest in local culture. Regina soon forms a close friendship with the farm's cook, Owuor, who helped save Walter's life when he contracted [[malaria]]. The only German contact that Jettel has is through a friend of Walter's named Süsskind, an ex-German who has lived in Africa for years. Jettel asks Süsskind why he was never married, and he states that he had a habit of falling in love with married women.  When [[World War II|war]] breaks out, the British authorities round up all German citizens, and intern them, whether Jew or [[gentile]], separating men from women. The Redlichs' marriage begins to deteriorate and Walter accuses Jettel of not wanting to sleep with him since he is only a farmer. Jettel sleeps with a German-speaking British soldier to secure work and a home on a farm for the family, and Regina and Walter both find out.  Walter decides to join the [[British Army]] and wants Jettel to go to [[Nairobi]] with him, but she refuses and stays to run the farm with Owuor. Regina is sent to an English [[boarding school]], and is kept there for years, only being able to come back every so often during the harvest season. Jettel becomes fluent in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and runs the farm competently, gaining an appreciation for African culture and hard work that she did not have before. During this time, Jettel and Süsskind develop a relationship; she kisses him, but he seems to decline to have a relationship (whether they slept together or not remains unclear).  Walter comes back from the war and an overjoyed Jettel sleeps with him. Later, he tells her that his father was beaten to death and his sister died in a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. He applies for a law position in Germany and receives word that he can immediately be placed as a judge. He states that the British Army's policy is to send all soldiers and their families back home. Jettel refuses to go with him, saying the farm needs her and that she is tired of following him around. She also refuses to believe that a country that killed their relatives could ever really be considered home. An angry Walter replies that she hated Africa at first and couldn't wait to get back to Germany, and that she is being selfish. Walter asks Regina if she wants to go with him, but Regina does not want to leave Owuor.  As Walter is preparing to leave alone, a swarm of locusts appears and threatens the harvest. Jettel sees Walter returning to fight off the locusts, and is touched at his dedication to the family. Eventually the locusts leave without serious damage to the crops and the farmers celebrate. Jettel and Walter make love and reconcile, and she tells him that she is pregnant with his child, leading him to conclude that she didn't sleep with Süsskind. Owuor decides to go on a journey, realising that the Redlichs' life is back in Germany, and he and Regina tearfully say goodbye. Jettel allows Walter to decide whether or not they should leave, and he acquires tickets back to Germany.  The final scene shows Walter, Regina, and Jettel travelling on an African train. As it stops, an African woman offers Jettel a banana, which shows how much Africa meant to her. In a narration, Regina states that her brother was born healthy and was named Max, after Walter's deceased father.  
Novocaine (film)
 Generally, the film is a dark and quirky "tragicomedy". The "everyman" protagonist, Dr. Frank Sangster ([[Steve Martin]]), is a dentist with a fairly pleasant but rather innocuous, ordinary and uneventful life. But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]) comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief...  On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some [[Ibuprofen]] to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is [[allergic]] to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive [[pain-killer]] [[Demerol]]. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist.  Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's [[narcotics]]. The next day, there is a DEA ([[Drug Enforcement Administration]]) agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of [[cocaine]] hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest.  That night Frank goes to Susan's hotel room to demand the empty containers, threatening that he'll call the [[police]] if she doesn't provide them. Once again, she overrides his initial intentions and seduces him - with the result that they have sex and he spends the night with her.  The next day at his office, Frank is confronted by Susan's brother, Duane Ivey ([[Scott Caan]]) having a violent scene, saying: "Stay the hell away from my sister" and "I don't appreciate your threats". Duane ends the conversation with, "I don't ever want to see you again, because if I do, goddamn it, I'm gonna hurt you."  That night, Frank returns to Susan's hotel room and, assuming that Susan is the form he sees the bed, starts talking to her. The person under the blanket turns out to be not Susan but brother Duane, who leaps up and attacks Frank, attempting to [[strangle]] him. Frank takes scissors from a nearby desk and stabs Duane in the [[hand]], impaling him and embedding the scissors. Frank flees, stopping off at a bar to calm down. On arriving at home, just minutes ahead of his girlfriend Jean ([[Laura Dern]]), he finds Duane dead on the floor.  Police arrive on the scene to question Frank. Comically adding to Frank's distress and anxiety is actor Lance Phelps ([[Kevin Bacon]]), a hack actor doing research for a role, and permitted by the police to question Frank at aggressive levels that cause Frank heightened discomfort. After the police arrive and depart, Frank tells Jean about the whole ordeal.  A while later, Frank is arrested for the murder of Duane Ivey based on finding Frank's teeth marks on the body - that someone else put there after killing Duane. After Frank breaks free, all of [[Chicago]] is on the look out for him. He goes to his office in the night, only to find his brother Harlan lying dead.  At this point, it is revealed that Frank's girlfriend Jean is behind all of the killing. She killed Duane with a shotgun and created dentures of Frank's teeth using his dental equipment and bit Duane's corpse with them. She was also in cahoots with Harlan, with whom she was having an affair. Unfortunately for Harlan, her plan was to eventually kill him as well with the shotgun to tie up all loose ends and make it appear that Frank killed him after Duane.  Realizing he'll never be free without starting over, Frank pulls out all of his dead brother's teeth, as well as all of his own. Frank uses his dental skills to place his own teeth into his dead brother's skull, and then sets fire to the dental office with Harlan's corpse, replete with replaced teeth, left inside. Frank and Susan, now lovers, escape to France, where they live happily ever after in a little cottage on the countryside.  Meanwhile, Jean's attempts to frame Frank fall apart. Unbeknownst to her, Harlan was playing with a medical video camera while he was shot and the recovered footage shows Jean firing the shotgun at the camera holder but fails to show it was Harlan who was shot. Therefore, the police wrongly assume that Jean shot Frank and arrest her.  
Ocean's Eleven
 Following release from [[East Jersey State Prison|North Jersey State Prison]] in [[New Jersey]], [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]] visits Frank Catton, an old friend now working under an assumed name as a dealer at the [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Trump Plaza]] casino in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Following this meeting, Ocean violates his parole by traveling to California to meet his partner-in-crime and friend [[Rusty Ryan]] to propose a heist. The two go to [[Las Vegas]] to pitch the plan to wealthy friend and former casino owner Reuben Tishkoff. The plan consists of simultaneously robbing the [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]], [[The Mirage]], and the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] casinos. Reuben's familiarity with casino security makes him very reluctant to get involved, but when he starts to think of it as a good way to get back at his rival, Terry Benedict, who owns all three casinos, Reuben agrees to finance the operation. Because the casinos are required by the [[Nevada Gaming Commission]] to have enough cash on hand to cover all their patrons' bets, the three predict that, on the upcoming night of a highly anticipated boxing match, the Bellagio vault will contain more than $160,000,000.  Danny and Rusty recruit eight former colleagues and criminal specialists: Linus Caldwell, a young and talented pickpocket; Frank Catton, a casino worker and con man; Virgil and Turk Malloy, a pair of gifted mechanics; Livingston Dell, an electronics and surveillance expert; Basher Tarr, an explosives expert; Saul Bloom, an elderly con man; and "The Amazing" Yen, an accomplished acrobat. Several of the team members carry out reconnaissance at the Bellagio to learn as much as possible about the security, the routines and behaviors of the casino staff, and the building itself. Others create a precise replica of the vault with which to practice maneuvering through its formidable security systems. During this planning phase, the team discovers that Danny's ex-wife, Tess, is Benedict's girlfriend. Rusty urges Danny to give up on the plan, believing Danny incapable of sound judgment while Tess is involved, but Danny refuses.  On the night of the fight, the plan is put into motion. Danny shows up at the Bellagio purposely to be seen by Benedict, who as predicted, locks him in a storeroom with Bruiser, a bouncer. However, Bruiser is on Danny's payroll, and allows him to access the vent system and join his team as they seize the vault, coincident with activities of their other team members in and around the casino. Rusty calls Benedict on a cell phone Danny dropped in Tess's coat earlier, tells him that unless he lets them have half of the money in the vault, they will blow it up; Benedict sees video footage confirming Rusty's claim. Benedict complies, having his bodyguards take the loaded duffel bags to a waiting van driven by remote control. Benedict has his men follow the van, while he calls in a [[SWAT]] team to try to secure the vault. The SWAT team's arrival causes a shootout that sets off the explosives and incinerates the remaining cash. After affirming the premises otherwise secure, the SWAT team collects their gear and departs.  As Benedict heads to examine the ruined vault himself, his men stop the van and find the bags were only loaded with flyers for prostitutes. Benedict studies the video footage and recognizes that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the Bellagio logo, which had been added only recently to the vault. It is shown that Danny's team used their practice vault to create fake footage to fool Benedict. Furthermore, they themselves were the SWAT team, and used their gear bags to take all of the money from the vault right under Benedict's nose. Benedict goes to see that Danny has seemingly been locked up in the storeroom throughout the heist, and thus innocent of any crime. As Tess watches via security surveillance, Danny tricks Benedict into saying he would give up Tess in exchange for the money, which Tess witnesses via closed circuit television. Benedict, unsatisfied with Danny's plan to get back the money, orders his men to escort Danny off the premises and inform the police that he is violating his parole by being in Las Vegas. Tess leaves Benedict and exits the hotel just in time to see Danny arrested. The rest of the team bask in the victory in front of the Bellagio fountains, silently going their separate ways one-by-one. When Danny is released after serving time for his parole violation, he is met by Rusty and Tess, and they drive off, closely followed by Benedict's bodyguards.

Oba Koheda Priye
   
Okie Noodling
 As much about the subculture surrounding handfishing, the film documents this practice of wading in murky water and sticking your hand into dark holes hoping a  plus catfish will latch onto your hand and arm. Missing fingers and toes on some noodlers attest to the danger and excitement of the sport, a method hundreds of years old.  The film emphasizes how noodling is believed to have originated with white settlers, with at least one reference known to have dated from 1775. Most evidence suggests that [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] typically only fished using tools such as spears and cages.  
Olive Juice
 Leighanne Littrell stars as the spunky Michelle Malloy who feels life is perfect.  But she is soon caught unprepared when she learns that her mother has grown ill. The young lady promptly returns to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] to visit her sick mother.  While she is visiting, Michelle soon learns that her fiancé is not the perfect man that she believed he was.  Not only does he have a sordid past but he is also involved in some rather unethical activity.  She soon grows depressed as future plans for her living happily ever after now appear doomed.  She soon finds solace with a local [[pet]] [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]] owner who steals her heart with his natural charm and his lovable inventory.  Many comedic [[pratfalls]] ensue as she tries to fight her true feelings simply because her recent split with her fiancé went so badly.  
The Officers' Ward (film)
 The film concentrates more on the period spent in hospital than the original novel, and emphasizes the horror of the friends' injuries. On Adrien's arrival at the ward, all the mirrors are removed and staff are instructed not to give any to him, but we see from the expressions on the faces of others just how bad the damage is. Adrien becomes increasingly desperate to see the damage done to his face, even asking a visitor to draw a picture of him. Dupeyron ensures that we do not see the horrifying extent of Adrien's injuries until the moment that he himself does - by looking at his reflection in a window pane.  There is a strong focus on the fleeting romance between Adrien and Clémence, a woman he meets by chance shortly before departing for the war, and his later attempts to track her down. When he finally does meet her again, she fails to recognise him.  Whereas the novel follows the experiences of the group right up to World War II and beyond, the film ends just after the First World War, the final scene being Adrien's chance meeting with his future wife.

Off Key
 The movie opens with a shot of a poster with three men in tuxedos under the name "Los Tres Tenores". Inside a theater in Mexico, one of the men, the dapper and refined French tenor Armand Dupres sings an operatic aria. Backstage, Spanish tenor Ricardo Palacios' wife tries to shoot him in the groin for cheating on her. Police take her away screaming, as Palacios and superstitious Italian tenor, Fabrizio Bernini, prepare to go onstage. Palacios hands his colleagues large Mexican [[sombreros]] and tells them to their disgust they must sing a [[mariachi]] number together. The concert turns into a disaster. A series of newspaper headlines follow their performance asking "Tenors or Clowns?" and explaining that his singing partners are suing Palacios for fraud. [[Paparazzi]] photographs follow showing Bernini kissing Palacios' wife and Dupres mourning his own wife's death.  The action shifts ten years forward as Dupres is preparing to marry Palacios' daughter. The Frenchman's butler is horrified and tries to sabotage the union. Bernini has also married Palacios' now ex-wife. The Italian tenor does not want to attend Dupres' wedding, but his wife wants to be there for her daughter. She chides him about his insecurity, as he questions her whether Palacios was a better lover. Palacios also plans to attend his daughter's wedding at Dupres' French villa, but he has additional schemes in mind. He hires a call girl to pose as his fiancée to convince his former partners and ex-wife how well he is now doing. While learning facts about his life (e.g. he was born on a boat to Mexico), the call girl tries to seduce him but he refuses, saying that sex has gotten him into trouble in the past. Immediately, an irate chef confronts the tenor about sleeping with his daughter, whom he insists now has twins who sing constantly.  On the way to Dupres' villa, Bernini feels ill because of his phobia of air conditioning and germs. At the villa, his wife and Dupres are briefly alone together. She threatens to tell her daughter and he threatens to tell her husband that they too were once lovers. Dupres and Bernini speculate over why Palacios is really attending the wedding. Dupres suggests that the Spaniard is more concerned with money than anything else. Once he arrives, Palacios tells his former colleagues that he has discovered "the new Three Tenors", in a bid to get them to return to performing together instead. Later, while his wife is painting his greying eyebrows dark, Bernini theatrically exclaims that everyone wants to replace him. She chides him for thinking the world revolves around himself.  The following day, after Palacios sings a [[tango]], the tenors have an argument. Dupres and Bernini express disgust that Palacios got them to record duets with pop singers, dress as mariachis, and promote [[Pizza Hut]] and the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], when what they do is art. Palacios avers that repeating the same compositions over and over for rich people is not art. It is more important to him that 1.5 billion people watched them perform on television.  Later that day, Palacios hears a new composition by Dupres' son performed by three singing waiters. Telling the son that he has conducted modern music like his, he convinces them to perform the composition at a party on the eve of Dupres' wedding, claiming to his former partners that these were his three young discoveries. Once they hear them sing, the older tenors begin to sing together too. After the party, Bernini unsuccessfully tries to kill himself, despairing over his thirty-year rivalry with Palacios, while Dupres' fiancée realizes she is actually in love with his son. The next day at the wedding Palacios, after bragging about his acting abilities in ''[[Otello]]'', pretends to have a heart attack in order to distract the paparazzi while his daughter and Dupres' son run away together. Soon afterwards, Bernini sings "[[Nessun Dorma]]" at a Spanish opera house, while a poster with the title "The 3 Tenors the Return" is seen. Palacios comes out of his dressing room after a tryst with the call girl, and the three tenors go onstage to sing and dance the "[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]".

On the Line (2001 film)
 Kevin ([[Lance Bass]]) is performing with his band at a high school graduation party. When he sees an attractive girl, his bandmates try to get him to sing to her and ask her out. He becomes nervous, and envisions himself nude in front of everyone, and faints. Seven years later, Kevin is working in advertising. He makes a pitch for [[Reebok]] that is rejected, though the pitch is later used in the meeting by his "partner" Jackie ([[Tamala Jones]]), who presents it as hers. As he takes the train home from work, Kevin meets Abbey ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]), with whom he finds he has much in common, such as their mutual interest in the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Al Green]].  Kevin tries to find Abbey by making posters imploring Abbey to contact him, and placing them all over town. He goes out with a few random women who respond, none of whom are Abbey. The local newspaper finds out about his search and sets up an interview. The reporter, Brady Frances (Dan Montgomery, Jr.), is an old classmate who harbors ill will toward Kevin, on account of a girl in high school who rejected Brady for Kevin. When Brady's article is published, Kevin gets hundreds of calls, which leads to his dateless roommates — aspiring musician Rod ([[Joey Fatone]]); slacker Eric ([[GQ (actor)|GQ]]); and art aficionado Randy ([[James Bulliard]]) — suggesting they date all the callers to help. Kevin rejects this idea, but a miscommunication leads Eric to believe that Kevin has approved it. A follow up article is published in which Brady portrays Kevin as a failure, which garners even more calls from women. Brady is further irritated when his girlfriend Julie ([[Amanda Foreman (actress)|Amanda Foreman]]), who is bothered by his grudge against Kevin, takes Kevin's side.  Meanwhile, Abbey is having problems with her boyfriend of three years, whom she was visiting when she met Kevin. Her boyfriend buys tickets to an [[Al Green]] concert, but then cancels at the last minute. Kevin is also at the concert, but they never see each other, despite several close calls. As Kevin's roommates date the women who responded to the articles in order to find Abbey, they encounter Julie. When she tells Brady that Kevin's friends are answering the calls and dating the respondents, Brady reports this as a scam in a follow-up article. As a result, Reebok declines to work with Kevin, and he is taken off the project. When Kevin subsequently sees Abbey waiting for a train, he tries to get her attention but she only sees him after she boards the train, and the doors close before he can get to her. Kevin also learns that Abbey responded to his public search for her, and when he learns that Eric went out on a date with her, he punches Eric.  After Kevin's best friend at the agency, Nathan ([[Jerry Stiller]]), suffers a [[heart attack]], Kevin visits him at a [[rehabilitation medicine|rehab facility]], where Nathan tells him the story of both meeting his wife at a Chicago Cubs game, and catching a home run from Cubs legend [[Ernie Banks]] the same day, and how the two events are tied together. He gives Kevin the baseball and tells him to try to find Abbey again.  Jackie apologizes to Kevin, and places him in charge of the campaign's billboards. He uses the billboards to publicly ask Abbey to meet him at the train station at a specific day and time, which garners the interest of the media, who wait with him at the scheduled time. Kevin and Abbey are reunited at the station, much to the delight of the crowd at the station, to the television viewers at home, and to his roommates watching this unfold in a bar. In addition, Randy meets a woman who enjoys art as he does, Julie dumps Brady for Rod, who is offered a recording contract by a record label after listening to a demo tape of his that Kevin sent them, and Brady is given an advice column in the Living section of the ''[[Chicago Times]]''.  
On the Edge (2001 film)
 Jonathan Breech ([[Cillian Murphy]]) is 19 when his father drinks himself to death. After a night with a gram of cocaine, another man's girlfriend and already stolen convertible, he goes to his older brother Mikey's ([[Paul Hickey]]) house at five in the morning to get his father's ashes. With the urn in the back seat he then goes on a suicidal drive.  After waking up in a hospital he is given a choice: prison for the stolen car or a mental institution. He chooses the latter. His room there is small and very near barren. Wednesdays are visiting days, when his brother can come. The recreation room has a TV, cards and velcro-tipped throwing darts. Since he is an inpatient he is forced to only wear pajamas as per the health board rules.  He has three group therapy sessions a week with Dr. Figure ([[Stephen Rea]]). There, he meets Rachel ([[Tricia Vessey]]), Toby ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]), Nick ([[Tomás Ó Súilleabháin]]) and Leslie (Marcella Plunkett). He voices romantic interest in Rachel but leaves the first session early. Rachel follows him to slap him for treating her patronisingly. They begin play boxing, but stop when she accidentally hits his mouth hard and draws blood. Jonathan goes to the restroom to take care of his bloody lip, and Rachel follows him and shows an attraction to blood, smearing it on to her throat and chest. Jonathan is unsettled, but intrigued. He then befriends Toby, who seems to also have a crush on Rachel. One-on-one therapy sessions with Dr. Figure are sarcastic, but he does ask patients to take a pledge not to kill themselves before New Year's Eve.  Jonathon's friendship with Toby starts to gel when they sneak out to a pub together at night. After returning to his room, Jonathan is surprised to discover Rachel there waiting for him. While he is lying on top of her, Rachel pulls out a razor hidden in a cigarette box and cuts her arm, which seems to intensify her sexual excitement. When the blood drips onto Jonathan's neck, he puts a stop to things.  In the following days, Jonathan has therapy sessions with Dr. Figure, and continues to flirt with Rachel, showing a more sincere interest in her. One night out with Toby, after he hot-wired a car Jonathan learns that Toby caused the death of his brother in a car accident. On bowling night, Jonathan gets into conflict that nearly turns violent, and Dr. Figure helps him see that he was reckless with his well-being but that perhaps he is glad to have made it through alive.  The romantic triangle comes into sharper focus as Toby reads a new poem he wrote to Rachel and flirts timidly. Later Jonathan and Rachel chat in her room and he learns of Rachel's mother's death, and a bond between them deepens.  The friends sneak out of the hospital to host a big New Year's Eve party at Rachel's father's house. Toby watches Jonathan and Rachel's energy as they dance together, and realises that he doesn't have a chance with Rachel. Soon Jonathan and Rachel are seen going upstairs. In another part of the house Toby is opening up the garage. Jonathan tries to kiss Rachel but she won't kiss back. As the count down to the New Year begins Rachel starts to kiss back and Toby gets ready in the car to be done with his pledge. At the stroke of midnight Toby drives off a cliff, killing himself.  The next day, Rachel's father pulls her out of the hospital, and Jonathan is miserable and worried about her. In a therapy session he asks Dr. Figure what will happen to Rachel. Dr. Figure responds that Jonathan needs to decide to value his own life. When Jonathan steals a bike to get out of the hospital, Dr. Figure tells the guard to allow him to leave. Jonathan goes to Rachel's dad's house, then to the cliffs. He finds her there, looking over the edge. Jonathan tells Rachel that he loves her that he thinks they could still be together in a year. They walk away together.  
The One (2001 film)
 Gabriel Yulaw (Jet Li), once an officer of the "Multiverse Authority," an agency that polices [[Dimension|interdimensional]] travel via [[wormhole]]s, seeks to hunt down all variations of himself in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]]. By killing all 124 of his other selves (becoming the last version) and absorbing their life energies, he believes he will become an immortal godlike being called "The One." Yulaw is briefly captured by MVA agents Rodecker ([[Delroy Lindo]]) and Funsch ([[Jason Statham]],) only to escape from captivity during the trial sentencing him to life in the [[Styx|Stygian]] penal colony in the Hades universe.  The last known alternate, Gabriel (Gabe) Law, works in the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. For two years he has been experiencing increases in strength, speed, and mental ability, but neither he nor his wife, T.K. Law ([[Carla Gugino]]), can understand why. While transporting a prisoner for the Sheriff's Department, Gabe "feels" Yulaw's presence just before he attempts to kill Gabe. Yulaw escapes, but is followed by Gabe, who inhumanly leaps a very high wall. Landing on the other side, Gabe is shot and wounded by Yulaw. As Yulaw approaches Gabe to finish him off, they are interrupted by Rodecker and Funsch.  Gabe realizes Yulaw is identical to him in every way. Unfamiliar with the interdimensional travel concept, he finds Yulaw's appearance shocking. After checking into the hospital, Gabe is ambushed by Yulaw, which Rodecker and Funsch again foil. Yulaw deters them from shooting him because if he is killed, then Gabe would then be left as the only "One". Dressed alike and identical in every way, Gabe and Yulaw's battle confuses Gabe's police colleagues. Both Gabe and Yulaw manage to escape the hospital.  Rodecker is faced with a dilemma: they have to capture Yulaw, but they cannot kill him or allow Gabe to be killed because whoever survives will become "The One", which could potentially have catastrophic damage to the multiverse. Funsch insists that Yulaw, as the instigator, must be dealt with in a more aggressive manner. Rodecker makes a fateful decision to "go way off procedure" and split the team. Rodecker pursues and fights Yulaw and is killed when Yulaw breaks his neck. Funsch catches up with Gabe and explains the multiverse and Gabe's abilities to him. Yulaw finds Gabe's residence where TK, believing it is Gabe, attempts to protect him, but she senses he is not her husband. Gabe arrives, only to have Yulaw force him to watch while he kills her. Funsch finds Gabe and they team up to find Yulaw at the next wormhole.  Yulaw, Gabe and Funsch arrive at the industrial plant, where the final battle between Gabe and Yulaw takes place. When Gabe eventually wins, all three are caught in a wormhole and taken back to the MVA headquarters in the Alpha Universe. Yulaw is transported immediately to the prison colony universe after a failed last attempt to switch places with Gabe. The MVA then prepares to send Gabe back to his own universe where he will be arrested and put in prison for the murders Yulaw committed. Recalling an earlier conversation with Gabe, Agent Funsch sends him to a different universe where Gabe can restart a normal life in Los Angeles, beginning with when he first met TK.  Meanwhile, Yulaw, now in the Stygian penal colony, declares he will still become the One. The camera pulls back to show that Yulaw, standing at the top of a [[Ziggurat]] in the Hades universe, battles hundreds of fighters as the credits roll.  
One Night at McCool's
  The majority of the film consists of Randy, Carl, and Dehling reciting their separate lovesick accounts of their experiences with Jewel, each narrating over what they consider to be the real version of the recent events. Scenes are often re-enacted twice, with different accounts contradicting each other for comedic effect. For example, when Dehling is narrating, he acts as if he were a completely fair, by-the-book police officer, and Randy is painted as a slimy, macho, abusive thug. When Randy is telling the story, he is the innocent victim and Dehling is shown as a suspicious, prying, hard-nosed cop; Carl is convinced that every woman is in love with him, and during his version of the tale, everyone acts accordingly.  
Onmyōji (film)
  The [[Heian period]] was a time when human beings and various [[Yōkai|supernatural beings]] still coexisted with each other, the latter occasionally causing trouble to humans. Practitioners of the art of ''[[onmyōdō]]'', the ''[[onmyōji]]'', were held to be able to control and subdue these malevolent entities and other paranormal phenomena, and were thus held in high regard, being employed by the imperial court.  In [[Heian-kyō]], nobleman [[Minamoto no Hiromasa]] meets court ''[[onmyōji]]'' [[Abe no Seimei]], a mysterious man about whom many rumors have been told. On a dare by some courtiers, Seimei demonstrates his exceptional skills in ''[[onmyōdō]]'' by killing a butterfly without touching it (i.e. casting a spell on a leaf which then flies and cuts through it).   Hiromasa later visits Seimei at the latter's home, where he sees Seimei's ''[[shikigami]]'' in human form, one of whom was Mitsumushi, the butterfly he had killed (and subsequently revived) earlier. Seimei joins Hiromasa in inspecting a mysterious [[gourd]] growing from a pine tree in [[Fujiwara no Kaneie|Lord Kaneie]]'s house; Seimei reveals the gourd to have been caused by a curse cast by a former lover of Kaneie who committed suicide.  One night, Hiromasa impresses an unseen lady on an [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] with his flute playing. Unbeknownst to him, this woman is Sukehime, [[Minister of the Right]] [[:ja:藤原元方|Fujiwara no Motokata]]'s daughter and one of the [[Emperor Murakami|current emperor]]'s wives, who is worried that she is losing the emperor's favor as another wife, Lady Tōko, the daughter of [[Minister of the Left]] [[Fujiwara no Morosuke]], had just given birth to a baby boy, who is to be the heir to the throne.  Meanwhile, the head ''onmyōji'' of the imperial Bureau of ''Onmyō'', Dōson, is secretly plotting to overthrow the emperor by trying to awaken the [[Onryō|vengeful spirit]] of [[Prince Sawara]], who had died 150 years ago. Wrongfully accused of treason by his brother, the [[Emperor Kanmu]], Sawara committed suicide, but not before swearing eternal vengeance on the [[Son of Heaven]] (i.e. the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]]). When Dōson curses the emperor's newborn son, [[Emperor Reizei|Prince Atsuhira]], to be possessed by an evil spirit, Seimei combats his spells and drives the demon away with the help of Hiromasa and the immortal Lady Aone, who was ordered by Kanmu to guard the burial mound where Prince Sawara's spirit is sealed away.  Hiromasa once again meets Sukehime (again unseen by Hiromasa) on the oxcart. He confesses his feelings for Sukehime, who he calls 'Lady of the Full Moon' (望月の君 ''Mochizuki no kimi''), but Sukehime, who still loves the emperor, rejects his advances.  Both Seimei and Aone are put under arrest by Motokata and accused of cursing the infant prince. They are saved in the nick of time by Morosuke, who points out it is unlawful to kill a court ''onmyōji'' without imperial permission. Dōson, who is implied to be behind the allegation, enchants one of the imperial police to attack the two; Aone is severely wounded, but proves to be unharmed due to her immortality.  Taking advantage of Sukehime's jealousy against Tōko, Dōson uses his powers to [[Hashihime|turn her into]] a ''namanari'' (a woman halfway to becoming an ''[[oni]]'') that harasses both Tōko and the newborn Atsuhira. Seimei uses ''onmyōdō'' to transform straw effigies into the likenesses of the Emperor and the infant prince. Sukehime arrives and assaults the effigies, thinking them to be the real emperor and Atsuhira. The emperor, moved by a ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poem she recites (the same poem Hiromasa hears the lady on the oxcart recite earlier), speaks out loudly, breaking Seimei's spell. Hiromasa, recognizing Sukehime to be his 'Lady of the Full Moon', steps in to accost her.  Sukehime briefly comes back to her senses when Seimei removes a [[Ofuda|paper talisman]] attached to her back, but Dōson doubles his efforts, and she completely transforms into an ''oni''. When Hiromasa sacrifices himself by allowing her to bite on his arm, Sukehime comes back to her senses once more and kills herself with Hiromasa's ''[[tachi]]''. In her final moments, Sukehime - now a human once more - begs to hear Hiromasa's flute one last time.   Seimei shoots an arrow with the paper talisman towards the sky, ordering the curse to go back to its sender. The arrow, now on fire, lands in Dōson's secret lair, burning it to the ground. Dōson, swearing vengeance on Seimei, finally releases the spirit of Prince Sawara from its confinement in the burial mound. Sawara's ghost enters Dōson's body and summons a horde of [[Onryō|vengeful spirits]] to attack Heian-kyō. Aone reveals to Seimei that he and Hiromasa are foretold by the stars to become the two protectors of the city: one cannot survive without the other. She, Seimei and Mitsumushi then go off in search of Hiromasa.  Dōson makes his way to the [[Heian Palace|imperial palace]]. Hiromasa tries to stop him in his tracks, but he is no match for his superhuman abilities; he is mortally wounded when Dōson throws back an arrow Hiromasa shot towards him. Seimei and Aone find him, but it is too late. Aone suggests that Seimei resurrect Hiromasa by performing the rite of [[Mount Tai|Taizan]]-fukun, the Chinese [[List of death deities|god of the dead]]<ref></ref> (泰山府君祭 ''Taizan-fukun no matsuri''), offering to sacrifice her immortality and life to do so.   Hiromasa, brought back to life by the ritual, and Seimei go to face Dōson. Aone's spirit, speaking through Hiromasa's body, convinces Sawara to give up his hatred. While Sawara at first refuses to do so, he is finally moved by the prospect of being with Aone - who was the prince's lover during his lifetime - forever; he then passes peacefully with Aone into the afterlife. Although now without Sawara's spirit to empower him, Dōson resumes the fight. Seimei, using his wits, traps Dōson within a magical barrier. Finally admitting defeat, Dōson slashes his throat with the sword from Sawara's burial mound.  At the end of the movie, Seimei and Hiromasa drink [[sake]] together in Seimei's house. Hiromasa teases Seimei for crying when he died and reflects on what Seimei said to him earlier: that the human heart can turn one into a demon or a buddha. Seimei tells Hiromasa that he is a 'very good man'; Hiromasa answers, "So are you." The two share a laugh together.  
One Leg Kicking
 As the film begins, Tai Po ([[Gurmit Singh]]) and Vernon (Moe Alkaff) are shown to have a common pastime of playing soccer. Later, Tai Po enters a Youth Soccer Competition in a tryout, but gets hurt with his leg bleeding. Since that event, Tai Po appears to shun matches of soccer on the radio or on television while at work.  Handsome Toh ([[Mark Lee (Singaporean actor)|Mark Lee]]) is then shown into the film, released from prison as an ex-convict, also with Kim ([[Sharon Au]]), who writes to her home back overseas.  Handsome arrives for a job interview, meeting Kim outside Sonny's factory. Sonny's arrogant son Gavin (Robin Leong) is introduced, whom Kim stated that he changed so much after returning from an American school overseas. Turns out later Handsome faces the brunt of getting a job from Gavin. Gavin relents, but eventually gave Handsome a chance, but agreeing that ⅓ of Handsome's salary is donated to the company's soccer team.  Vernon is shown with his band, The Vibrations, and they are as terrible as his singing.  Tai Po, Kim and Baka fail to fix a plumbing issue with a customer, and breaks the customers expensive glass bowl worthing 15 grand. As such, Tai Po and Baka's promotion salary of 10 grand are confiscated, yet owing the customer another five grand. However their boss, Sonny Lee ([[Lim Kay Tong]]) offers them to work overtime to repay what they owe and possibly earn back their promotion pay, by manually installing a swimming pool at Sonny's estate. Gavin arrives at the office and suggests to his father by separating Baka and Tai Po and putting Tai Po's partner as Handsome, which Tai Po gasps to know Handsome is an ex-convict.  Kim tells a horror story to Tai Po, which that somehow sours Handsome and his relation.  While watching television in Tai Po's home with Vernon and Tai Po's kids, they come across an advertisement for a [[Starhub]] soccer challenge which the winning team walks away with tickets to the 2002 World Cup Finals. Vernon suggests that they enter by calling his old soccer mates, but Tai Po reveals about his pairing with Handsome, also gasping Vernon.  Vernon arrives to register, not after a terrible encounter with the clerk Eugene ([[Hossan Leong]]), who becomes their team coach, though also horrid at soccer. The team looks as a failure, and even Tai Po could not get Handsome to join after a test which Handsome thought was an attempt to fight.  Two Brazilian soccer experts, Adriano and Vernato are introduced, which they were robbed of their belongings in Singapore, but join construction workers just for a meal to satisfy themselves.  Vernon asks about Sammy Best (Siva Choy) who was a soccer sports star, but his friend Ah Huat tells that Sammy now works at a construction site guard. Tai Po and Vernon try looking for him, but after told off by the foreman ([[Jack Neo]]) about how a drunkard Sammy was, Tai Po resigns to fate as failure, but then the two notice Adriano and Vernato, who are both hired into the team. Later while they are tried out, Handsome eventually joins, becoming their goalkeeper.  The team fails even to a female soccer team, who are challenged straight by the Kosmos, Sonny's company team and Gavin is a player in it. The team, known as the Durians (suggested by Ah Huat who "sponsored") lost badly, getting laughed at by a drunkard field cleaner, who turns out to be Sammy himself. It was quite a hassle to get Sammy as their coach, but soon the Durians succeed winning a match.  The Durians go to a KTV pub, where Handsome while singing a love song remembers Gwen (Fiona Xie), Gavin's beautiful sister and breaks out in tears while trying to confess his love for her. But he then finds Kim as a KTV girl, getting beaten up after trying to save her. He then realises he has anger management problems, resorting always to fights to settle issues. Kim tries to pacify him, also inspiring herself to be what she wants.  In a party Gavin held, he is revealed to be keeping a [[Barbie]] doll, showing his extreme sadism he tries to hide from others.  Tai Po's daughter Chun Huey is told off by her teacher, and Tai Po goes angry, trying to teach his children a lesson that he is a failure, but his children then tell him that he is in fact a great father, even with their deceased mother who Tai Po thought he had failed to take care of.  Vernon is soon fired by his uncle at the KTV they work in, as Vernon's concerts scared customers away, resulting in the Karaoke machines replacing him. "Vernon and the Vibrations" supposedly ended their career. Vernon is also told off by his father who claims that he should wake up, becoming a singer was impossible for him.  Gavin's sadism and extreme life gets on Gwen's nerves, who then resigns being the Kosmos team manager, telling off Sonny. Sonny himself, like his son becomes a sadist, even going so far to being harsh on Tai Po when Tai Po was previously his best worker.  The finals to the match is soon, but the Durians and Kosmos go for a dinner party held by the organisers. In the party, the Kosmos bully the Durians, and Gwen appears to seduce Handsome while they were outside smoking. That had then broke Kim's heart, and enrages Gavin who threatens to report Handsome for molesting Gwen. Handsome angrily apologises, fortunately controlling his anger at his one enemy. Later, Vernon criticises Handsome for rejecting Kim, but Handsome criticises back about Vernon's horrid singing. The fight ends abruptly when Sammy is admitted into the hospital for liver failure. Tai Po is held down by the bill, also by his cut salary for playing soccer and not working.  Sonny then approaches Tai Po, offering him 10 grand to him and the team, for their own usage. Tai Po is also relieved of building the swimming pool. However, if the money is taken, the Durians must not play in the match the next day, or Handsome, Kim, Baka and himself will be fired.  The Durians meet up, which they discuss their future. Tai Po has his bills to settle, Vernon has his life to handle, and Kim has her family to support. They were thinking of giving up the match, but Eugene then scolds them for being shallow. They now are at crossroads.  While visiting, Sammy tells Tai Po that he really is not a failure, Tai Po was a good player in the Youth Soccer tryouts when younger, and Sammy had seen it.  The match arrives, but many of the Durians are missing. Tai Po, Baka and Handsome approach Sonny and return the money, also stating that they no longer want to work for him, wishing the Kosmos good luck in the meantime. Miraculously, the Durians arrive and play the game. Things do not look hopeful, until Adriano and Vernato escape the clutches of their abusive foreman and quit being construction workers, arriving at the match, bringing their cheering soccer fanatic construction worker mates.  Sammy sneaks out to see the game, Vernon's father watches his son and Kim supports Handsome. Tai Po realises he indeed can succeed, and Vernon does something which he has not done before. Handsome also controls his anger perfectly in front of Gavin, in which Gavin's reaction has the referee offering him a red card but sends back another player.  Tai Po is tackled down hard by Gavin, but he tries his best and scores the final goal to win. The Durians triumph, while Gavin weeps over his lost girlfriend (who ironically was stolen by none other than his father) and is appalled by his doll which he claims that has stopped loving him and in a fit of rage decapitates the doll, exasperating him.  Tai Po, Baka, Handsome and Kim start a mobile phone shop, also having Kim and Handsome married. Tai Po has taken his kids on a holiday, and is now more well off. Vernon now has a singing career, settling in Las Vegas in America while Sammy is now a full-time soccer coach with Eugene. He signs his autograph to a customer who finds out their identity as the film ends.

Original Sin (2001 film)
 ''Original Sin'' is set in the late 19th century [[Cuba]] during the Spanish rule,<ref></ref><ref></ref> and flashes back and forth from the scene of a woman awaiting her execution by [[garrote]] while telling her story to a priest, to the actual events of that story.   Luis Vargas ([[Antonio Banderas]]) sends for American Julia Russell ([[Angelina Jolie]]) from [[Delaware]] to sail to his country Cuba to be his [[mail-order bride]]. Julia alights from the ship, looking nothing like the photos she had sent prior to her voyage. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is only interested in a pretty face and that is why she has been deceptive—substituting a plain-looking woman's photo in place of her own picture. Luis also admits to a deception; he has been misleading her into believing that he is a poor clerk in a coffee export house, instead of being the rich owner of that coffee export house. On hearing this, Julia says that they both have something in common and that is that both are not to be trusted. But they assure each other that they would make efforts in understanding and trusting each other in life.   Luis and Julia wed in the church within hours of her setting foot in Cuba. Luis falls desperately in love with his new wife, and they passionately make love.  Meanwhile, Julia's sister Emily has been trying to contact her, worried about her after such a long trip to a strange land. She sends an emotional letter to Julia asking about her welfare. Luis forces Julia to write back, fearing that if Julia continues to ignore Emily's letters, Emily will assume something terrible has befallen her sister and she might send the authorities to check on her welfare. Holding off as long as possible, Julia finally pens a letter to her sister.  In order to assure that his wife has everything she wants, Luis adds Julia to his business and personal bank accounts, giving her free rein to spend as she pleases. A detective, Walter Downs ([[Thomas Jane]]), arrives from Wilmington and tells Luis that he has been hired by Emily to find her sister Julia and would like to see her on the coming Sunday. Luis informs Julia about this and she gets upset. Emily arrives in Cuba to meet Luis, and shows the letter Julia wrote to her. She informs Luis that she believes Julia to be an impostor and that her sister may be dead. Luis discovers that Julia has taken nearly all of his fortune and disconsolate, teams up with Walter to look for her.  Luis finds Julia and discovers she is actually working with Walter and that she and Luis are staying at the same hotel. Luis believes she loves him and lies to Walter, but when confronted, a fight breaks out and Luis shoots Walter. Julia coldly tells Luis to go and buy them tickets home, but the minute he leaves, Walter gets to his feet; he had loaded the gun with blanks. Julia appears to love Luis, but Walter has too much control over her, so she continues to work for him as she and Luis run off to live in secret, with the supposedly dead Walter in pursuit. Walter turns out to be Julia (Bonny's) old lover and partner Billy.  Luis throws away his promising future and opens himself to living a lie with Julia. One night, Luis follows Julia/Bonny and discovers Walter/Billy is alive and that the two are still working together; she is apparently going to poison her husband that very night. He returns home to wait for her, and when she arrives, he reveals that he knows about the plan, confesses his love for her once more and swallows the poisoned drink though she desperately tries to stop him. Julia flees with the dying Luis, with Walter close behind. They run into him at a train station; Walter is furious that Julia has betrayed him. As Walter holds a knife to her throat, Luis shoots and wounds him, with Julia finishing him off.  Back in the ''[[Mise-en-scène|mise en scene]]'', Julia finishes her story and asks the priest to pray with her. The next morning the guards come to her cell to take her to her execution, only to find the priest kneeling in her clothing.  In [[Morocco]], Julia is watching a card game. She walks around the table occupied by gamblers—including Luis—and thanks them for allowing her to watch. As Julia signals Luis about the other players' cards, he begins telling them the story of how they got there.  
The Other Side of Heaven
 During the 1950s, John Groberg, (Christopher Gorham) who grew up in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], [[Idaho]], graduates from [[Brigham Young University]] and is called on a mission to [[Tonga]]. There, he will spend two and one-half years as an Elder teaching the gospel of the LDS Church. His first adventure is just getting there, as it takes him 83 days, including a short stint in a [[Fiji]] jail.  When Elder Groberg arrives in Tonga, he is sent to a group of remote islands  from the mission's home office. Before he leaves on this last leg he is assigned a companion, Tongan Feki (Joe Falau), who speaks English. However, Elder Groberg finds that his knowledge of the [[Tongan language]] is severely deficient and he studies intensely to become proficient. He also learns the culture.  Throughout the film, the letters between Elder Groberg and his fiancé, Jean ([[Anne Hathaway]]), serve as a narrative. Although they write frequently, Elder Groberg is only able to send and receive mail monthly. Each of them voices the letters so that the audience knows what they are writing. Another man at home proposes to Jean but she maintains her agreement to wait for John.  Elder Grobeeg soon begins to experience success in his mission. But one night he forgets instructions he received to cover his feet and rats bite his soles. It is a painful reminder that he must listen and obey when he receives instructions. Elder Groberg tells his fiancé that she should send her suitor to him for the same lesson.   The local Christian minister tells the people not to listen to the missionaries. Later, he sends four men to beat the missionaries. However, one of them, Tomasi, prevents the attack. Elder Groberg learns from the drunken Tomasi that he had been baptized a Mormon many years ago when a boy. Tomasi later begins attending church meetings and is chosen by Elder Groberg to be one of his counselors to the branch.  Elder Groberg is sought out by parents when their child is injured and left unconscious.  Elder Groberg ministers to him with prayer and basic first aid, and the child recovers.  A local young woman, at the behest of her family, attempts to seduce Elder Groberg. She wants "a half-white baby." He teachers her about marriage and tells her he's saving his seed for Jean, and she relents.   A typhoon strikes the island. Many trees are stripped bare, homes and crops are destroyed, and many people are killed. The remaining leaders instruct the people gather up what food and fresh water is available so that rationing can begin. The supply boat due in two weeks takes much longer to arrive. The inhabitants of the island begin dying of starvation and dehydration.   Elder Groberg is close to death when the local minister gives him the last of his food because the minister is old and Elder Groberg is young. When the supply boat does arrive, the minister is found to have died and is given an honorable funeral.  While traveling at sea, Elder Groberg and his two counselors are caught in a large storm. He is washed overboard and fears for his life. He swims until he finds an island where he also locates his counselors, and they are later rescued and return to Tonga.  Elder Groberg returns one day to his hut to find that his [[mission president]] has come to visit the island. He finds the president and introduces himself. The president is unhappy because he has not heard from Elder Groberg since departing from the mission home office many months prior. Elder Groberg describes some of the success they have experienced, and the president is shocked to learn of  new [[branch (LDS Church)|branches]] and meeting places on outer islands that the President did not authorize. After giving Elder Groberg a strong lecture about the discipline of the church, which is a "House of Order," he leaves to spend the night in the village and prepares to leave the next day.  Elder Groberg and his counselors spend the entire night filling out the baptismal, priesthood ordination, and other church records the president requested the day before. In the morning, Elder Groberg runs to the beach where the president is about to board a boat. He gives him a large sheaf of hand-typed forms documenting all they have  accomplished on Raratonga and the outer islands. The President instructs Elder Groberg to send him the paperwork necessary to build new chapels and then adds, "Since they will be built with concrete, we should probably purchase the land."  The president submits a request to have Elder Groberg's mission extended, but it is denied. Elder Groberg receives a telegram via mail. It instructs him to return to [[New Zealand]] where he will obtain transportation home to [[Idaho]]. When Elder Groberg is ready to depart, many islanders gather in their best clothing to see him off, testifying to the impact he has had during his stay.  His trip home is less eventful than his trip to Tonga. He finally arrives in Idaho. He and Jean are married and spend their honeymoon at a cottage by a beach.  
The Order (2001 film)
 The film opens in 1099 at the end of the [[First Crusade]], depicting Christian Crusaders sacking Jerusalem and slaughtering the local population. A Flemish Christian knight named Charles Le Vaillant ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]) becomes demoralized by the horrors of war and decides to create a new religious order. This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-declared leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order. While traveling to Syria his camp is attacked by the Christian knights, who kill Le Vaillant. The last chapter from their religious text, buried by Le Vaillant in a secret place, becomes lost in the desert after the attack.  In the modern day, Rudy Cafmeyer (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a thief and smuggler of valuable historical artifacts, breaks into a high-security building and steals a precious [[Fabergé egg]]. He triggers an alarm in the process and is forced to fight his way out of the building, finding no car to meet him because the getaway driver, Yuri, was forced to leave by police. His problems are compounded when a potential buyer attempts to steal the egg and falls on it, destroying it.  It is revealed that Rudy's father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar "Ozzie" Cafmeyer ([[Vernon Dobtcheff]]). Ozzie travels to Israel in search of a secret he has discovered and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who travels to Jerusalem to rescue him. Ozzie's associate, Professor Walt Finley ([[Charlton Heston]]), gives Rudy the key to a safe-deposit box in [[East Jerusalem]] before being gunned down by unknown assailants. Rudy opens the safe-deposit box and finds an ancient map showing a series of tunnels and a treasure room beneath Jerusalem.  Meanwhile, a devout contingent of Le Vaillant's followers known as the Order continues to practice his peaceful teachings in [[Israel]]. One of the disciples, Cyrus ([[Brian Thompson]]), enters into conflict with the Order's leader Pierre Gaudet over Cyrus's inflammatory rhetoric regarding an imminent [[holy war]]. Cyrus has Pierre Gaudet killed using a [[car bomb]] and assumes control of the Order.  Israeli Police Chief Ben Ner ([[Ben Cross]]) views Rudy's arrival with hostility and takes steps to have Rudy deported, appointing Lt. Dalia Barr ([[Sofia Milos]]) to ensure that Rudy does not escape. Lt. Barr escorts Rudy to the airplane but Ben Ner calls and demands their return, claiming that Rudy is smuggling an artifact. Lt. Barr knows that Rudy has been searched and is not in possession of any artifacts so she unlocks Rudy's handcuffs and lets him escape in a feigned struggle, meeting up with him again after he escapes from the airport in a stolen ramp-towing vehicle. Lt. Barr reveals that she was once a disciple of the Order but that she left when she was 18. Together they visit Yuri, who translates the map and explains that it leads to treasure, but thieves break in and steal the map, shooting and killing Yuri in the process. Rudy steals a motorcycle and pursues the thief who has the map. He catches up with him and shoots him, causing the thief to drop the map, but is also shot and injured.  Rudy hides from the police and is found by Lt. Barr, who drives him to be helped back to health by her old friend Avram, who is still a member of the Order. Lt. Barr gives Rudy papers left by his father in which Ozzie explains he had discovered the lost manuscripts of the Order, lost since the Crusades, and that the new sect within the Order does not wish for them to be revealed because they show the location of a mythical [[Jewish]] treasure. Rudy shows it to Avram, who insists that the "treasure" is merely a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages and says that its location in the Order's monastery cannot be accessed by outsiders anyway. With Avram's aid Rudy and Lt. Barr pose as foreign members of the Order visiting on a pilgrimage in order to gain access to the monastery during a massive assembly of the members, now led by Cyrus.  In the catacombs Rudy finds the remaining manuscripts as well as his imprisoned father and a large bomb. Ben Ner arrives and explains to Rudy and Lt. Barr that he joined the Order when he found out about the treasure. Cyrus arrives and forces Ozzie to lead him through the tunnels in order to detonate the bomb under the [[Temple Mount]] during [[Ramadan]] to maximize casualties and make martyrs of the Israeli Lt. Barr and American Rudy Cafmeyer in order to trigger [[World War III]]. Rudy saves Avram from falling into a pit trap before they reach a room loaded with treasure next to the chamber underneath the [[Well of Souls]]. Ben Ner attempts to delay the detonation in order to collect more treasure, leading to a standoff with Cyrus's followers. Rudy, and Lt. Barr use the opportunity to escape but Ozzy is injured and Avram is killed. Lt. Barr shoots Ben Ner and helps Ozzie out of the catacombs. Rudy catches Cyrus in the treasure room and kills him with one of the swords found there. Rudy moves the bomb from under the Well of Souls and drops it into the pit trap. Ben Ner jumps at Rudy but only grabs his shirt and tears it off as he falls into the pit. Rudy races away from the pit as the bomb explodes. Worshipers above hear the explosion but continue praying.  Rudy is later shown visiting the office of his father, who has published a new book. In the office Rudy finds an ancient map that Ozzie claims shows the location of the [[Seven Cities of Gold]]. Rudy grabs the map and runs out of the office with Dalia. The film ends with a compilation of quick action cuts as well as a few outtakes.  
Osmosis Jones
 Frank Detorre ([[Bill Murray]]) is an unkempt, slovenly [[zookeeper]] at the Sucat Memorial Zoo in [[Rhode Island]]. Depressed by the loss of his wife Maggie years earlier, he copes by eating unhealthily and ignores basic hygiene, to the annoyance of his young daughter Shane (Elena Franklin). During a lunch break, Frank eats a boiled egg he dropped onto the ground after a chimpanzee had stolen it and put it in its mouth.  Inside Frank's body, [[Osmosis]] "Ozzy" Jones ([[Chris Rock]]), a rebellious and disgraced [[white blood cell]] officer of the Frank PD, recklessly chases germs from the egg, but fails to catch them and instead causes Frank to have a bad leg cramp. Meanwhile, facing a serious challenge to his re-election prospects, Mayor Phlegmming ([[William Shatner]]). doubles down on Frank's consumption of junk-food, despite concerns from his secretary Leah Estrogen ([[Brandy (singer)|Brandy]]). Meanwhile, Thrax ([[Laurence Fishburne]]), a deadly red virus, emerges from the leftover egg and sadistically causes inflammation in the throat.  Unwilling to admit responsibility for the recent symptoms, Phlegmming instructs Frank to take a [[Capsule (pharmacy)|cold pill]] through brain signals. The suppressant, Drixenol "Drix" Koldreliff ([[David Hyde Pierce]]), is partnered with Ozzy to investigate the recent sore throat. While Drix cools off the inflammation, Ozzy gets a short eyewitness testimony from a terrified bacterium who saw Thrax arrive.  Thrax assumes leadership of a gang of sweat germs and launches an attack on the mucus dam in Frank's nose, causing a runny nose, nearly expelling Ozzy and Drix before Frank inhales them back into the sinuses. While continuing the investigation, Drix hears that Phlegmming remembers Ozzy setting the worst record in Frank's body. When he wonders aloud why Ozzy had a record, Ozzy reveals to Drix that two years ago, during a science fair at Shane's school, he caused Frank to publicly vomit on Shane's science and P.E. teacher, Mrs. Boyd ([[Molly Shannon]]), after seeing a deadly virus on an [[oyster]] Frank ate earlier after observing another student's oyster display. The story ran in the newspaper the next day, resulting in Frank, Shane, Mrs. Boyd, and even their whole families becoming the town laughingstocks overnight causing them to be humiliated every year as well as Frank being fired from his job at the pea soup factory by his supervisors after he embarrassed them. His brother and Shane's uncle Bob ([[Chris Elliott]]) later helped him get a job at the zoo, where Frank still gets zero respect. Ozzy, in turn, was then suspended from his job working in the kidneys and then demoted to patrol duty in the mouth for excessive use of force. Ozzy tells Drix how he wonders every day if what he did was right. Drix, in turn, assures Ozzy that he did the right thing as raw oysters are frequently breeding grounds for potentially dangerous bacteria.  Based on information from a vaccine virus, Ozzy and Drix go undercover at a nightclub located within a large zit on Frank's forehead, intending to infiltrate Thrax's gang. Once there, the two discover Thrax's plan to steal chromosomes from the [[hypothalamus]], driving up Frank's body temperature and killing him in 48 hours. However, Ozzy's cover is blown and he is forced to scream for help from Drix, who destroys the club with a grenade. The explosion bursts the zit during Frank's meeting with Mrs. Boyd, causing it to land on her lip, grossing her out, and she angrily screams at him to leave. In response, a furious Phlegmming closes the investigation, fires Ozzy, and orders Drix to leave the city.  Having survived the assault, Thrax kills his last surviving gang members, then discreetly breaks into the hypothalamus gland and steals a [[DNA]] bead from a [[chromosome]]. Frank's body temperature begins to rise. Ozzy, realizing that Thrax was still a threat, stops Drix from leaving and convinces him to come back and help him finish the case. Thrax then kidnaps Leah and flees to the uvula to escape. As Frank is taken to the hospital in a fever induced coma, Ozzy and Drix give chase and save Leah but Thrax escapes out of the mouth by using [[pollen]], causing Frank to sneeze and expelling Thrax from his body. With Drix's help, Ozzy pursues Thrax to the surface of Shane's right eye and her false eyelash. Thrax pins Ozzy down and threatens to kill Shane next, but gets stuck in the eyelash; Ozzy's pliable body allows him to escape and hang onto Shane's real eyelash as the false eyelash slides off and lands in a glass of rubbing alcohol, dissolving a screaming Thrax to death.  As Frank's temperature reaches 108 degrees, his heartbeat flatlines as he suffers [[fever|hyperpyrexia]], leaving Shane devastated. Riding on one of Shane's tears, Ozzy reenters Frank's body with Thrax's necklace of DNA beads, reviving Frank just in time. Having narrowly cheated death, Frank commits himself to living a much healthier lifestyle with the help of Shane, while Ozzy begins a relationship with Leah and is re-instated to the force with Drix as his new partner. Phlegmming loses his position as mayor and is reduced to working as a custodian in the bowels. He later accidentally ejects himself from the body by pushing a button that triggers Frank's flatulence.

The Others (2001 film)
 Grace Stewart occupies a remote country house in the [[Channel Islands]] and one day awakens from a harsh nightmare in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]]. She lives with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, who have an uncommon disease characterized by [[photosensitivity]]. Grace hires three new servants&mdash;the aging Mrs. Bertha Mills, elderly gardener Edmund Tuttle, and a mute girl named Lydia. Mills explains that she had previously worked in the house many years ago. Later, Anne tells Mills that "mummy went mad" after the previous servants left. Nicholas disagrees and argues that "nothing happened". Grace requests Mills not to trust everything that the children say.  When odd events occur at the house, Grace begins to fear there are unknown others present. Anne claims to have seen a group of people in the house several times: a man, woman, an old woman and a child called Victor, who have claimed that "the house is theirs". After Grace hears footsteps and unknown voices, she orders the house to be searched. Grace finds a 19th-century so-called "book of the dead",  which is a photo album of [[mourning portrait]] photos of deceased family members, with some missing pages. Grace asks Mills about when she last worked in the house. Mills says that many were evacuated due to an outbreak of [[tuberculosis]].   At night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house may be haunted. Convinced that something unholy is in the house, Grace runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house. Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to check a small nearby cemetery to see if there was a family buried there who had a little boy named Victor. Tuttle covers the gravestones with autumn leaves, under the orders of Mills, who comments that Grace thinks the house is haunted. Outside, Grace discovers her husband Charles, who she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during the short time he spends at the house.  Later, Grace has a vision of an elderly woman and attacks her. Grace soon learns that she has actually attacked Anne, who retreats to her father. Charles later asks Grace what happened "that day". Grace claims that she does not know but recalls that the servants left without giving notice and without her husband there, she could not leave the house and she did not know what came over her. Following Grace's attack, Anne tells Nicholas that Grace went mad in the same way that she did "that day". Nicholas denies recollection of that day. Charles says he must leave for the [[front (military)|front]] even though Grace claims that the war is over. Charles weeps when Grace thinks that he wanted to leave her, and the two embrace then lie motionless together in bed. The next morning he is gone again.  The children wake up screaming as all the curtains have disappeared. Grace moves the children into a room and blocks out the light. Grace accuses the servants of removing the curtains and banishes them. After leaving, an annoyed Mills asks Tuttle to uncover the gravestones. That night, as Grace searches for the curtains, the children sneak outside and Anne discovers a graveyard and realizes that these are the servants' graves from years past. Simultaneously, Grace finds a torn out photograph from the photo album of portraits of the dead, and is horrified to see it is of her three servants. The servants appear and try to speak to the children, who retreat. Grace locks out the servants and tells the children to hide upstairs in the bedroom. From outside, Mills reveals that the three servants died of tuberculosis more than 50 years ago and that the living and the dead should learn to live together. Hearing the children scream as they face the elderly woman, Mills tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders.  Grace discovers that the old woman, described by Anne as an intruder, is in fact acting as a [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]] in a [[séance]] with Victor's parents. The medium asks what happened to Anne and Nicholas. The children's answers are written down by the medium and read out by a man. It is revealed that Grace smothered the children to death with a pillow on the day she "went mad". The children scream that they are not dead. Grace, in denial, shakes the séance table and rips the medium's papers. Victor's family sees only the table shaking and the papers being ripped; they are convinced to vacate the house.  Grace, now largely realizing herself as being the spirit which the séance tried to contact, regains her memories of the end of the war years: stricken with grief without her husband, and isolated alone with the children, Grace lost her mind and in psychosis killed her children. Realizing what she had done, she then shot herself. Later, when she "awoke" and heard her children's laughter, she assumed God had granted her family a second chance at life. Grace questions whether they are now alive and Mills says that Lydia also wondered this before becoming mute. Similarly, it was only Charles' spirit that came to visit them before departing. Anne asks if they are in [[Limbo]] and Grace cannot answer with certainty.  Mills tells Grace that they will learn to get along with future intruders. The children, no longer photosensitive as they are deceased, can enjoy playing in the sunlight. Although the property is again put up for sale, Grace and the children continue to inhabit the house.

The three of them are discussing the result of their work and the story zooms in to the game again. The game is about a girl named Nami whose mother died during her birth. Nami later receives the will of her deceased father that states that she has inherited a large fortune.  The next day, an illustrator called Nami enter the workroom of the 3 adolescents. Toko thanks Nami for her drawing and Shinichi praises Nami's work. Nami then goes up stairs to meet Kohei who is sleeping on the rooftop. We then learn that Nami and Kohei used to be a couple but they broke up and now Kohei is using Nami as his model in the game they are developing.  The scene shifts to a car containing Nami and Kohei. Nami tells Kohei that she was wondering why she was abandoned. Kohei tells her that her mother died when she was born and her father could not have raised her alone. Then they arrive at a big abandoned house where Nami was born. Nami tells Kohei about her dreams while Kohei records everything using his handicam. The caretaker of the house approaches them and hands Nami the house key. Both of them enter the gate and Kohei notices that the garden is full with [[St. John's Wort]]. Nami tells him that St. John's Wort was the last word of the aunt who raised her and Kohei said that the meaning of St. John Wort is revenge in very old poems.  Inside the house, Kohei records every detail of the house with his handicam and notices a staircase and asks Nami whether it is the same as the staircase that she saw in her dream but Nami said it was not. Kohei then admires paintings made by Kaizawa Soichi hung on the wall and we learn that actually he was Nami's father. Nami later tries to unlock a door but the key did not fit. Then both of them go to explore the rooms that were connected to the main hall.  Later, they find a portrait of Kaizawa Soichi made of oil painting hung on the wall and then they moved to the kitchen. Kohei then tells Nami that she must have gotten her talent from her father. When they return to the main hall, Nami stares at a portrait of a woman that they suspect is a portrait of her mother. Both of them move upstairs and find a room full with porcelain dolls.  They enter another room and see a portrait of a baby girl and a baby crib. Next to the room was another room with a small table with playing cards on top of it and 2 chairs facing each other and a cupboard.

The Parole Officer
 Simon Garden is a well-meaning but ineffectual [[probation officer]]. At the beginning of the film, he is facing a tribunal after all of his colleagues in his department in [[Blackpool]] submit complaints against him, Garden having only had three successes in his career. He is therefore transferred to [[Manchester]]. He has [[hypoglycemia]] and therefore regularly eats crisps.  In Manchester, he starts his new role and meets an attractive WPC, Emma.   While looking into the case of a "client", Kirsty, a juvenile delinquent who had had [[Class A drugs]] planted on her, Simon witnesses the murder of an accountant by corrupt police officer [[Detective Inspector]] Burton. He is discovered, chased from the building by two [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] and after being cornered, ends up falling into a [[canal]]. However, he has inadvertently left his wallet containing identification at the crime scene and is duly framed for the accountant's murder by DI Burton. Simon goes to the police with the story, but ends up being interviewed by Burton, who is leading the investigation. He releases Simon, but threatens him with prison unless he keeps quiet about his drugs scam and the murder.  Simon first decides to leave Manchester for good and, feeling down, rejects the offer of a meal from Emma.   While away from the city he walks past a shop where the TV in the window happens to be showing an interview with Burton, who will be receiving a bravery award, and also triggers his memory of the murder – he realises that a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] camera had filmed the whole event. He realises that this security tape will clear his name and show that Burton was the real murderer.  He returns to the club where the murder took place to try to find the tape, only to discover that it has been taken to a bank and placed in a [[safety deposit box]].  Simon sets out to round up his four successful ex-clients.   He visits George in Blackpool and convinces him to join the plan.   They then recruit Jeff, who has been working as a fishmonger, and Colin, who has been working in a computer shop.   They visit the home of the former master-criminal Viktor, only to find his wife and his grave; his wife takes them to Viktor's secret underground workshop and says they can take whatever equipment they want from his extensive selection of technology and safe-cracking kit.  The team gathers in Simon's house and they set out to devise a cunning plan to retrieve the tape from the bank.  One evening they find that Kirsty, Simon's first client when he started his new job in Manchester, has broken in and is attempting to steal his television.   When she sees what they are doing she asks to join the gang to rob the bank, but Simon says she is too young.   They tell her she has to leave but she convinces them that she will be small enough to slip through a vent that someone needs to access as part of their heist plan.  The team members train together, organise equipment, deploy a computer virus and invent a GOTLER (George-operated time-lock equalising robot).  Over time they bond as a group, have fun together and formulate their plan.  However, one night, DI Burton and several police officers (including Emma) search the house for the head of the murdered accountant.  DI Burton has obviously planted it in Simon's house and, despite Kirsty's attempt to dispose of it, manages to frame Simon and the others: they are arrested, and end up in a police cell.  Kirsty is taken away by the police, but manages to slip away from them at a garage.   Simon tries to explain to Emma about the plan to clear his name but, because she feels that he has hidden things from her, she is reluctant to listen.   Simon, George, Colin and Jeff are in their cell wondering what to do when the back of a van crashes through the wall – it is Kirsty, who has stolen a van and is rescuing them.   They jump in and speed off, with Kirsty at the wheel, determined to try to get to the bank and put the plan into action.  Once there, they sneak on to the roof, activate all of Manchester's alarms and climb into the building. Simon uses the robot to activate the door, and they grab the tape. A man in disguise, who is apparently Victor, turns up, but the group is collecting money as well, before he vanishes. Once the job is done, the group flees from the bank, but not before Simon is briefly delayed by toughened glass windows. They finally arrive at the town hall, where DI Burton is earning a bravery award for saving Kirsty from a burning car earlier in the film. Despite being attacked by Burton's sidekicks, Simon finally proves his innocence by revealing the tape to the public, and Burton is arrested. Amidst the celebrations, Simon and Emma link with each other and kiss.

Neeya suffers from memory loss and cannot recall anything of her past. As she adapts to life on Earth, she discovers she has a variety of telekinetic powers. A friend of Lebedev, Prof. Ivanova, begins studying Neeya's neurophysiology and finds a special neurocenter in her brain which can be used to control the humanoid clones. Neeya is visiting the beach with Lebedev's son Stepan when Ivanova triggers the system. Neeya loses control of her body and falls into the water. The device also triggers a clear memory of her home planet, where she sees a man explain the purpose of the control system. The flashback ends when Stepan pulls her from the water.  Neeya joins an archaeological expedition, where she has another flashback which reveals she is from the planet Dessa. She returns from the expedition to find that a diplomatic mission from Dessa has just arrived at the spaceport to ask for help from Earth.

Aboard was Professor Glan, who was building an army of clones and awaiting a signal from rebel forces on the planet that the time was right to return and take over.   The ''Astra'' reaches Dessa to find a planet that has been stripped of all minerals, leaving the air and water poisoned.

The Department has thrown him a retirement party, and the police captain gives Jerry a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The party is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny.

During the interview, the man eventually confesses but steals a gun from one of the deputies and commits suicide. To the other detectives, the case is over, but Jerry does not think that Wadenah was the killer. Jerry is adamant about his pledge to find the killer, and does not go on the fishing trip. Instead, he visits the victim's grandmother, who tells him of the many stories that Ginny told. A later visit to one of her friends reveals that Ginny had a friend she called "The Giant".

Chrissy is shown meeting a man driving a black car with a toy [[hedgehog]] hanging on the rear mirror, hedgehogs being another aspect of Ginny's drawing that Jerry believes to be a clue. Chrissy explains to Jerry that she met a wizard who gave her hedgehog candies and told her not to tell her parents they met. She figured it was OK to tell Jerry, since he is not her father. Jerry realizes this is the killer and, using Chrissy as bait, stages an operation, with Stan's help, to catch him.  A car is shown driving with a toy hedgehog hanging from the rear-view mirror. The woman who owned the chocolate shop is shown searching for "Oliver", implying that he is the killer. After hours of waiting, Stan and the other police leave. They tell Lori what happened, and she confronts Jerry angrily about putting her daughter in danger. The car that was shown approaching is seen destroyed in a fiery collision with a freight truck.  In the final scene, reprising the first, Jerry sits on a bench in front of the ruined gas station, apparently drunk, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there.

Planet of the Apes (2001 film)
  In 2029, aboard the [[United States Air Force]] space station ''Oberon'', Leo Davidson works closely with primates who are trained for space missions. His favorite [[simian]] co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the ''Oberon'' and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers that the world is ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use [[Domestication of the horse|domesticated horses]] for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.  Leo comes across a female chimpanzee named Ari, who protests the awful treatment humans receive. Ari decides to buy Leo and a female slave named Daena to have them work as servants in the house of her father, Senator Sandar. Leo escapes his cage and frees other humans. Limbo, a slave trader in captured humans, sees them but is taken prisoner to ensure his silence. General Thade and Colonel Attar march ape warriors in pursuit of the humans. Leo discovers Calima, the forbidden, but holy temple of "Semos", the first ape whom the apes revere as a god.  Calima turns out to be the remains of the ''Oberon'' which has crashed on the planet's surface and looks ancient (the name Calima coming from the sign "'''CA'''ution '''LI'''ve ani'''MA'''ls", the relevant letters being the only ones not covered in dust). According to the computer logs, the station has been there for thousands of years. Leo deduces that when he entered the vortex he was pushed forward in time, while the ''Oberon'', searching after him, was not, crashing on the planet long before he did.  The Oberon's log reveals that the apes on board, led by Semos, organized a mutiny and took control of the vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the ''Oberon''s last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, the apes interpret his arrival as the return of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.  Pericles runs into the wreck of the Oberon and Leo runs after him, followed by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at what appears to be the Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.

Pootie Tang
 Pootie Tang, born in "a [[Chicago|small town outside]] [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Indiana]],” is portrayed as a ladies' man who is "too cool for words", even as a young child. His life is marked by the deaths of his mother "Momma Dee,” and shortly thereafter his father "Daddy Tang," who dies after being mauled by a gorilla during his shift at the steel mill (the third time someone had suffered that particular fate). Just before Daddy Tang's death, Pootie inherits his father's belt and is told that (as long as he has right on his side) he can "whoop anyone's ass with just that belt."  As a young adult, Pootie Tang rises to fame and becomes well known for a variety of reasons. He sings in nightclubs, stars in [[public service announcement]]s for children, produces top-of-the-charts music hits, and generally defeats wrongdoers with the power of his belt. Dick Lecter, the [[chief operating officer]] of multi-industrial conglomerate LecterCorp, learns of Pootie Tang's positive influence on society — and his negative influence on LecterCorp's bottom line. After his henchmen and a villain named Dirty Dee are sent away by Pootie's friends, Lecter encourages his right-hand lady, Ireenie, to seduce Pootie Tang into signing an agreement with LecterCorp that would stop Pootie Tang's influence on America's children.  Pootie Tang falls for Ireenie's tricks and subsequently falls apart. His status as pop culture icon is destroyed, and he engages on a quest to "find [him]self." This journey is encouraged by Biggie Shortie, who promises to wait for Pootie to return to her and to the rest of society. Pootie moves to a farm where the local sheriff decides Pootie and his daughter should start dating. After his single corn stalk dies, he has a vision of Daddy Tang and Momma Dee. Daddy Tang reveals that there is nothing special about Pootie's belt; instead, Pootie must fight evil with the goodness that is inside him. After dealing with Dirty Dee and his henchman Froggy (as well as getting his belt back), Pootie realizes he must move back to the city and fight crime once again.  Pootie Tang returns to the city just as Dick Lecter is unveiling the first of his new [[restaurant chain]], Pootie's Bad Time Burgers. At a small news conference, Pootie confronts Lecter only to discover that Lecter has amassed dozens of "Pootie-alikes" who will spread the message of LecterCorp around the nation. Pootie Tang, with the help of Biggie Shortie, defeats all of these henchmen and Lecter himself. Good triumphs over evil once again, and Biggie Shortie finally gets her man: she and Pootie Tang plan to get married now that Pootie is back. Elsewhere, Dick Lecter leaves corporate life and becomes an actor, Ireenie leaves him and becomes a counselor helping at-risk teenage prostitutes, and Dirty Dee is still dirty.

The Princess Diaries (film)
  Teenager [[Mia Thermopolis]] lives with her artist mother, Helen, and her cat, Fat Louie, in a remodeled [[San Francisco]] [[Fire station|firehouse]]. A somewhat awkward and unpopular girl, Mia has a [[fear of public speaking]], and often wishes to be "invisible". She has a crush on Josh Bryant, but is frequently teased by both him and his cheerleader girlfriend, Lana Thomas. Mia’s only friendships are in the form of the equally unpopular Lilly Moscovitz and Lilly's brother, Michael, who secretly has a crush on Mia.  Just before her sixteenth birthday, Mia learns that her paternal grandmother, Clarisse, is visiting from [[Genovia]], a small European kingdom. When Mia goes to meet her grandmother at a large house (later revealed to be the Genovian consulate), Clarisse reveals she is actually Queen Clarisse Renaldi, and that her son, Mia’s late father, was Crown Prince of Genovia. Mia is stunned to learn she is a princess and [[Order of succession|heir]] to the Genovian throne. In shock, Mia runs home and angrily confronts her mother, who explains she had planned to tell Mia on her eighteenth birthday, but that her father’s death has forced the matter. Queen Clarisse visits and explains that if Mia refuses the throne, Genovia will be [[Interregnum|without a ruler]] (a subplot involves a scheming baron and his unsightly baroness quietly rooting for Mia's downfall). Helen persuades a hesitant Mia to attend "princess lessons" with the Queen, telling her she does not have to make her decision until the upcoming Genovian Independence Day ball.  Mia is given a glamorous makeover, the use of a limousine, and a bodyguard (the Queen’s head of security, Joe). This and Mia's frequent absences from the lessons make Lilly suspicious and jealous, and she accuses Mia of trying to be like the popular girls. Mia breaks down and tells Lilly everything and swears her to secrecy. However, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' learns that Mia is the Genovian Crown Princess after royal hairdresser Paolo breaks his confidentiality agreement (so his work would be known), causing a press frenzy, and a sudden surge in popularity at school for Mia. In a craven urge for fame, many of her classmates bluff that they are friends of the princess to reporters.  At a state dinner, Mia embarrasses herself with her clumsiness, delighting her rivals for the crown. However, all is not lost, as the situation amuses a stuffy diplomat, and the Queen tells Mia the next day that she found it fun. Deciding it is time the two bonded as grandmother and granddaughter, the Queen allows Mia to take her out for the day to the [[Musée Mécanique]], an [[amusement arcade]]. The day almost ends terribly when Mia's car stalls on a hill and rams backward into a [[San Francisco cable car system|cable car]], but Queen Clarisse saves the day by "[[Accolade|appointing]]" the attending police officer and the tram driver to the Genovian "[[chivalric order|Order]] of the Rose" (something she clearly made up on the spot), flattering them into dropping any charges. Mia sees this and is impressed with her grandmother.  Later, Mia is delighted when Josh Bryant invites her to a beach party, but her acceptance hurts Lilly and Michael, with whom she had plans. Things go awry when the press arrive, tipped off by Lana. Josh uses Mia to get his fifteen minutes of fame by publicly kissing her, while Lana tricks Mia into changing in a tent, pulling it away as the paparazzi arrive, giving them a scandalous shot of Mia in a towel. The photos appear on tabloid covers the next day, leaving Queen Clarisse furious at Mia. A humiliated Mia tells Clarisse that she is renouncing the throne, feeling she is nowhere near ready to be a true princess. Joe later reminds the Queen that although Mia is a princess, she is still a teenager, and her granddaughter.  Back at school, Mia rescues her friendships with Lilly and Michael by inviting them to the Genovian Independence Day Ball, and gets back at Josh by hitting a baseball into his [[groin]] during gym class. She finally stands up to Lana in defense of Jeremiah, whom Lana was mocking, by smearing ice cream on Lana's cheerleader outfit and declaring that, while Mia has a chance to grow out of her awkward ways, Lana will always be a jerk. The teachers do not interfere, knowing full well that Lana deserved it. While Lilly is excited at the prospect of attending a royal ball, Michael, heartbroken over Mia's initial feelings for Josh, turns her down. Clarisse apologizes to Mia for being furious at her over the beach incident, and states that she must publicly announce her decision to renounce becoming princess of Genovia. Mia, terrified at this large responsibility placed upon her, plans to run away. However, when she finds a letter from her late father, his touching words make her change her mind, and she makes her way to the ball. Mia’s car breaks down in the rain, but she is rescued by Joe, who had suspected she was going to run.  When they arrive, a drenched and untidy Mia voices her acceptance of her role as Princess of Genovia. After changing into an opulent ballgown, Mia accompanies Clarisse to the ballroom, where she is formally introduced and invited to dance. Michael, accepting an apologetic gift from Mia (a pizza with M & M candies cleverly topped to say "sorry"), arrives at the ball, and after a quick dance, they adjourn to the courtyard. Mia confesses her feelings to him, stating that even when she was constantly teased and embarrassed at school, Michael liked her for whom she truly was. Mia shares her first kiss with Michael, while Clarisse and Joe are seen holding hands. In the final scene, Mia is shown on a private plane with Fat Louie, writing in her diary, explaining that she is moving with her mother to Genovia, just as the beautiful royal palace and landscape come into view below.

Her co-workers include Sasano Junko, Toshio Yabe and Taguchi, who has been missing for some days working on a [[computer disk]]. Michi goes to visit Taguchi's apartment and finds him distracted and aloof; in the middle of their conversation, he casually makes a noose, leaves, and hangs himself. Michi and her friends inspect the disk he left behind and discover it contains an image of Taguchi staring at his own computer monitor, creating an endless series of images. In the other monitor on his desk, they discover a [[Ghost|ghostly]] face staring out into Taguchi's room.   Yabe receives a mysterious phone call of a distorted voice repeatedly saying, "Help me." Upon checking his phone, Yabe sees the same image found on Taguchi's disk. He goes to Taguchi's apartment and sees a ghostly black stain on the wall where he hung himself, before finding a crumpled piece of printer paper bearing the words, "The forbidden room." Upon leaving, he notices a door sealed up with red tape and enters, encountering a ghost. Yabe becomes depressed and uncommunicative, and eventually begins hiding in a storage room. He tells Michi that he had seen something horrible in "the forbidden room." On her way home, Michi sees a woman hurriedly sealing a door with red tape. Michi later witnesses the woman jump to her death from a silo at a cement factory.   Michi receives a call like the one Yabe had received, prompting her to check on him in the storage room. Upon entering, she sees a black stain on the wall similar to the one in Taguchi's apartment. Michi leaves to find Junko and panics when she realizes Junko has unsealed and entered a red-taped door. Inside, Michi witnesses Junko being cornered by a ghost. Michi rescues Junko, who becomes [[catatonic]] as a result of the encounter. Later, Michi is asked by Junko if she "will die this way," to which Michi assures her she would not prompt her to reply that she would just "keep living all alone." Upon saying this, Junko steps towards the wall and becomes a black stain. Michi calls her mother for solace, but gets no reply. Becoming worried, Michi goes to check on her mother and meets Ryosuke Kawashima.  ===Second Story===  Ryosuke (Haruhiko Katô), an [[economics]] student, has recently signed up to a new [[Internet Service Provider]]. His computer accesses a website by itself, showing him disturbing images of people alone in dark rooms, exhibiting bizarre behavior. That night, Ryosuke wakes up to find his computer on again; the site now shows a man with his face obscured by shadows, then a man with a plastic bag over his head. Before he pulls it off, Ryosuke unplugs his computer in a panic. The next day, Harue Karasawa ([[Koyuki]]), a post-graduate computer science student, suggests he either bookmark the page or print the images for her to examine. Ryosuke attempts to do so, but finds that his computer will not follow his commands. Instead, a video plays of the man in the plastic bag standing in a room with the words "HELP ME" written all over the walls.   A classmate mentions the appearance of ghostly-looking people around campus and explains his theory that [[soul]]s have begun to invade the physical world. Karasawa begins exhibiting strange behavior and suggests that ghosts would want to save humans from the loneliness of the afterlife by bestowing [[immortality]] on them. Later that night, Ryosuke visits Harue to find her acting even stranger; the two try to escape to a faraway place using the subway. However, the train stops and Harue is seized by a desire to return home and flees. Upon returning to her apartment, she claims that she is "not alone". When Ryosuke bursts into her apartment later, she is gone.  As more and more people begin to vanish, evacuations of Tokyo begin. There are ghosts appearing everywhere. Ryosuke meets Michi and they find Harue in an abandoned factory, where she shoots herself. Ryosuke later wanders through a door sealed up with red tape and encounters a ghost who explains that "death was eternal loneliness." Ryosuke loses the will to live, and Michi has to drag him to safety. They drive through a burning Tokyo, encountering numerous [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] scenes: the sky turns black, a [[US Army]] cargo plane crashes out of the sky, and people leap to their deaths from tall buildings. The pair find a ship about to depart Tokyo, crewed by a small group of survivors who tell them that similar events are happening all over the world.

Rat Race (film)
 Donald Sinclair, the eccentric owner of [[The Venetian Las Vegas|The Venetian Resort]] in [[Las Vegas]], devises a new game to entertain the [[high roller]]s who visit his hotel. Six special tokens are placed in the casino's slot machines, and the winners are told that $2&nbsp;million in cash is hidden in a duffel bag in a train station locker in [[Silver City, New Mexico]], 563 miles southeast of Las Vegas. Each team is given a key to the locker and told to race to the train station to claim the money. Unbeknownst to the competitors, Sinclair's wealthy patrons are placing bets on who will win. The patrons continue making smaller bets throughout the film, facilitated by Sinclair's assistant Grisham, who at one point hires an escort as part of a dare.  Among the racers are scheming siblings Duane and Blaine Cody, businesswoman Merrill Jennings and her estranged mother Vera, disgraced American football referee Owen Templeton, the Pear family led by opportunistic father Randy, eccentric Italian tourist Enrico Pollini, and no-nonsense Nick Schaffer.  Unable to get on the earliest flight, Duane and Blaine manage to destroy the airport radar with their [[Ford Bronco]], grounding everybody else. However their vehicle is wrecked in the sabotage, so they steal another. The brothers decide to split up and create a replica key to double their chances of winning. The [[locksmith]] overhears their plan and makes off with the key in a [[hot air balloon]]. Duane and Blaine catch up to him, leaving the locksmith and a stray dairy cow hanging from the balloon's anchor rope. The brothers later steal a [[monster truck]] and continue towards Silver City.  Merrill and Vera crash their car after being given malicious road directions. They steal a [[rocket car]], which races across the desert until it runs out of fuel. The women dizzily stumble onto a bus full of mental patients which eventually drives toward Silver City.  Owen masquerades as the driver of a bus filled with [[Lucille Ball]] impersonators going to an ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' convention. Outside Silver City, the bus hits the cow dangling from the hot air balloon and swerves off the road. Owen has an emotional breakdown, reveals he is not the bus driver, and is forced to flee from the women on foot. Owen eventually rides a stolen horse to Silver City.  Randy Pear deceives his family into accompanying him in the race, stating that it is a business trip. The family mistakenly visits a museum dedicated to the Nazi [[Klaus Barbie]]. After the Cody brothers vandalize their vehicle, the Pears steal Adolf Hitler's [[staff car]] to continue. Randy declines to end the trip when his family becomes tired of traveling. He eventually tells them about the $2&nbsp;million, and they are initially excited. However, when his family insists on ending the trip again, he drugs them with sleeping pills and bundles them into a semi-truck to reach Silver City.  Nick chooses not to participate in the race until he meets pilot Tracy Faucet, who gives him an advantage as she is one of the few still able to fly, using her non-[[fixed-wing]] helicopter. The helicopter stalls after Tracy uses it to attack her cheating boyfriend. The two then steal his truck to continue the race.  Narcoleptic Enrico falls asleep at the start of the race and only awakens hours later. He receives a ride from an ambulance driver, Zack, who is delivering a transplant heart to [[El Paso]]. Enrico eventually boards a train heading to Silver City.  The racers reunite in Silver City and tackle each other to open the locker, only to find it is empty. Outside, they find Sinclair's assistant Grisham and the call girl he hired making off with the money bag. They lose it when the locksmith ties it to the balloon, only for the three to crash their car.  The racers follow the balloon until it lands at an outdoor charity concert hosted by [[Smash Mouth]]. The band and crowd mistake the money as a donation, and once they see the charitable good spirit they have made, the group are persuaded to accept. Nick surprises a horrified Sinclair and his patrons by declaring to the audience that the gamblers will match the amount of money already raised. The racers dance to "[[All Star (song)|All Star]]" while Sinclair cries.  
Recess: School's Out
 The movie begins with a prologue set in a U.S Army base somewhere in the Nevada Desert. An unknown group breaks into the facility, knocking out the guards and absconding with a top-secret project. The unseen leader of the group instructs his men to move the equipment to "where it all began": Third Street Elementary School.   After pulling off one last big prank at Third Street Elementary School, which involves stealing the ice cream that Miss Finster had been hoarding and distributing it to the kids, T.J. Detweiler and his friends are excited about being done with the rest of the school year and starting [[Summer vacation#United States|summer vacation]], but T.J. is unhappy, because his friends are all at summer camps in order to prepare for their future careers. Later, T.J. suspects that there's something going on inside the school after seeing a green light pour from the cafeteria and getting chased off by a guard. He sneaks around and sees a [[tractor beam]] levitating a safe. Panicking, he tries to tell his parents and the police, but no one believes him. When he gets Principal Peter Prickly to come to see what's going on, he is [[Teleportation|dematerialized]]. Out of options, T.J. uses his sister Becky's diary to blackmail her into driving to all the camps to pick his friends up.  T.J. and his friends steal a box of documents, but when they find it filled with boring information, they accuse him of inventing a plot to drag them out of summer camp. However, their accusations are undercut by a tractor beam appearing and firing off from the school's roof, and agree to help T.J investigate at night. The next day, T.J. finds Pricky's golf pants in a dumpster with a note requesting help in a pocket, so T.J. and his friends infiltrate the school that night to find Prickly. They witness the adults in the auditorium firing the tractor beam at the moon but are caught spying and flee. T.J. is captured and put in a storage room where Prickly is tied up. The leader of the adult, Dr. Phillium Benedict comes in to talk to them, revealing himself to be an old friend of Prickly's from their early teaching years.  After Benedict leaves, Prickly tells the story of how, back in the spring of 1968, Benedict became principal of Third Street School and moved to abolish [[recess (break)|recess]] in order to improve test grades. The plan didn't go over well, as it was met with angry teachers and parents protesting to reinstate recess, which Benedict refused to do. Prickly went to the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] as a means of recourse. While the superintendent assured the parents that the plan Benedict made would never be carried out, Benedict still refused to back down. The superintendent then demoted Benedict and promoted Prickly to principal. Benedict accused Prickly of stealing his job, which, along with his anti-recess views, caused his then-girlfriend, Muriel P. Finster to break up with him. Infuriated, Benedict ended his friendship with Prickly, quit teaching, and swore revenge on his now-former friend. Later, Prickly says, Benedict entered politics and went on to become [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]], until he was fired by the [[President of the United States|president]] for trying to abolish recess again, only this time nationwide.  T.J. and Prickly escape and enter Prickly's office where T.J. uses his confiscated walkie-talkie in Prickly's drawer to tells his friends about Benedict's plans to destroy summer vacation. T.J.'s friends go through the box of documents again. Spinelli finds a date book that mentions [[Apsis|lunar perigee]], and Gretchen deduces that Benedict is trying to move the moon's orbit via tractor beam when it is closest to the Earth. By drastically altering the moon's orbit, Benedict, having cornered T.J. and Prickly, reveals to them that he can create a permanent ice age so kids will spend their summers studying inside instead of playing.  T.J.'s friends get his sister, Becky, to drive to the camps again, where they pick up all the children. Gus draws up the plans to attack the school while T.J. and Prickly escape the cage that Benedict has imprisoned them in. Gus' plan works, and most of Benedict's mercenary guards and [[ninjas]] are incapacitated. All the kids pour into the auditorium. Another set of guards protects Benedict as he prepares to pull the lever. However, Muriel P. Finster arrives, and after rejecting Benedict again, she brings the teachers and staff in to help and a fight breaks out. Prickly punches Benedict, but as Benedict slumps, he triggers the beam and Prickly cannot reverse it. T.J. tosses his baseball to Vince, whose accurate pitch destroys the beam's core, foiling Benedict's plans for good. The police then arrest Benedict, Fenwick, and their cronies for theft of government property, conspiracy, breaking and entering, and attempted terrorism.   In the aftermath, T.J., the other kids, and the teachers and staff are commemorated as heroes and T.J. makes amends with Becky by returning her diary. T.J.'s friends decide to spend the rest of the summer with him, stating that they still have plenty of time to prepare for their futures, but only a little time left to just be kids. Before they head to the pond, T.J. thanks Prickly in person for protecting him from Benedict during their imprisonment, and for helping him and his friends to stop him. Prickly states that he should be the one doing the thanking, as T.J.'s act of dragging Prickly into the whole ordeal reminded him of his true motivation to pursue teaching: to help kids. They gratefully acknowledge each other in mutual respect by using their respective nicknames. As T.J. heads to the pond with his friends, Prickly calls out at him that when September comes, T.J. will be under Prickly's discipline again, but T.J. replies that September is a long way off. The film ends with T.J. and his friends racing to the pond, with Prickly looking on, donning his old [[Peace symbols#The_peace_symbol|peace sign necklace]] from his first days of teaching in the 1960's, and smiling.

Just days before Jake's retirement Garrotte strikes again, but Jake is off the case. During his retirement party, Jake receives a call from Garrotte, who threatens to go after his friends and family. Realizing Garrotte needs to be stopped no matter what, Riley sets out to stop him.  A secret government agency hires Jake as a consultant on a special project. They have [[cloned]] Garrotte from [[DNA]] evidence found at a crime scene. They need Jake's help to train this replicant, who has genetic memories from Garrotte and a telepathic link to him. The replicant has the body of a 40-year-old but the mind of a child. Jake's job is to help the Replicant track Garrotte down by using the memories stored in Garrotte's DNA.  The Replicant and Jake begin to hunt Garrotte. Jake believes the Replicant could turn on him at any time, as Garrotte's killer instinct may take over. The Replicant tries to understand the world, and his connection with Garrotte. The replicant does not understand why Jake treats him so roughly, since the Replicant views Jake as family. Though Jake is abusive, the Replicant looks to him for protection and guidance as they close on Garrotte. Garrotte and the Replicant confront each other in a bar after Garrotte fails to kill Jake with a bomb. Garrotte kills a bartender, but lets the Replicant live.

Jake and the killer fight, leading to an [[ambulance]] chase in the parking garage. The van crashes into a [[Toll road|toll booth]], but the killer escapes. He hits Jake with a [[shovel]] and plans to burn him alive.  The Replicant and killer fight again in the hospital's [[furnace room]]. The Replicant wants to kill Garrotte, but realizes that he is not the killer Garrotte is. The killer hits the Replicant with a shovel, which causes Jake to shoot him. The Replicant suddenly understands that Jake is his real family. An air conditioner, damaged in the fight, explodes, supposedly killing the Replicant after he gets Jake to safety. Upset by the death of his new "partner", Jake decides to retire from his new job as a consultant.  Weeks later, Jake is with his wife Anne (Catherine Dent) and stepson Danny (Brandon James Olson). Jake spots a man in a raincoat put a package in their mailbox. However, Jake realizes the Replicant is alive when he finds the package contains a music box as a gift for Jake's help.

Revelation (2001 film)
 In two flashbacks a relic is created in 50 AD and then hidden by Jews from a Crusader mob in medieval [[Rennes-le-Château]]. In present-day Rennes-le-Château an academic under instructions from Magnus Martel is seen with the relic—the Loculus—researching on the ground to find the right place to hide it. Magnus's son Jake, an ace cryptographer, is released from [[Wormwood Scrubs]] and recruited by his father for research on the Loculus. Magnus reveals that the Loculus relates to the [[Knights Templar]] and its sinister successor organisation known as "the order", and in secret receives calls from this organisation threatening him if he does not accelerate his research—in spite of this, Magnus realises the Loculus' massive power for good or evil and has hidden it to ensure it does not fall into the order's hands. After breaking a code on the Loculus to reveal the word "palingenesis", Jake hides whilst members of the organisation kill and [[flaying|flay]] his father. Jake then flees with another researcher on the project (the occultist Mira) and seeks help from the Roman Catholic priest Father Ray Connolly.   The trail takes the three characters to (among others) a Cambridge library to research Isaac Newton's involvement in attempting to unlock the Loculus and to Rennes-le-Château and its Tour Magdala. They discover that the Loculus is related to Christian [[eschatology]] and has been hidden on [[Patmos]], writing-place of the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''. Father Connolly stays behind in London as back-up while Mira and Jake go to Patmos and find the Loculus hidden in a crypt beneath a [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and former temple to [[Mary Magdalene]] as [[Aphrodite]]. Using the reflective properties of a [[hermaphrodite]] symbol on the Loculus they reveal a [[hexagram]] built into the floor, an occult symbol. Jake and Mira disrobe and [[sexual intercourse|make love]] within the symbol in an attempt to unlock it, experiencing a vision of themselves as Christ and Mary Magdalene before fleeing into the crypt when they hear a pursuer approaching.   The pursuer turns out to in fact be Father Connolly and together they finally work out the Loculus's meaning—its significance in fact lies in the four nails holding it together, which are those used to [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucify]] [[historical Jesus|Christ]] and retain organic matter with his DNA, preserved in a ceremony on [[Mount Hebron]]. The Templars and the order have continually attempted to use the DNA on it to resurrect Christ (including one failed attempt by Newton), but have failed until the genetic advances of the present day. The three argue as to what to do with the discovery—Jake concurs with his dead father and wishes to destroy it to keep it out of the order's hands, whilst Ray wishes to take it to a trustworthy African cardinal at the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]. Ray prevails and traps the other two, but on arrival in Rome the order's Grand Master seizes the Loculus, puts Ray under torture and sends troops to kill Mira and Jake. The couple manage to flood the chambers with sand to kill the troops and the church's monks are alerted to the couple's plight by an emergency postcard sent by Connolly before his departure, but only Mira manages to escape—Jake is fatally buried. In the meantime the Grand Master has cloned Christ and had him not only proclaimed the Messiah by the Vatican but put under his own tutelage and control, so that he can brutalize him and rule the world through him. The film closes with Mira realising that she (Magdalene's descendant) has given birth to a child by a Martel (Christ's descendant via the [[Merovingian dynasty]]) and that she must keep him secret from the order (as predicted by [[s:Bible (King James)/Revelation#Chapter 12|''Revelation'' 12.4]]) so as to oppose the Grand Master's puppet Christ.

When he is arrested soon after as part of an undercover ongoing narcotics sting, he comes face-to-face with a mandatory 25 to [[life sentence]].  
Return to Cabin by the Lake
 Two years after being presumed dead, Stanley Caldwell (under the alias of "Alan") meets with an agent named Lauren on a boat to discuss a new screenplay.  They soon learn that despite public protest, director Mike Helton has begun principal photography on ''Cabin by the Lake'', a film based on Stanley's old screenplay detailing his exploits as a serial killer.  Amongst the protesters is Paul Parsons, the brother of Kimberly Parsons who was one of Stanley's last victims.  Stanley confronts Lauren about the news, who claims that his original script was a nightmare and had thus hired Alison Gaddis to rewrite it.  Insulted, Stanley binds her with a long strand of ivy rooted in a cement flower pot while telling her about his "dream project" called ''Cabin by the Lake''.  A horrified Lauren realizes Alan's true identity and desperately suggests that he become a director.  Stanley is intrigued by the idea, but nevertheless pushes her overboard to drown.  On the set of the film, Paul Parsons confronts Mike Helton and demands that he cease the production, but is dragged away by security.  Stanley then arrives on the scene with a new disguise, claiming that he owns the cabin where the film is being shot, in fact the actual cabin where he had lived two years prior.  While wandering the set, he bumps into writer Alison Gaddis, who praises Stanley's work and is curious about all aspects of his background.  Helton receives a call from JC Reddick, the producer's nephew and second unit director whom no one has ever met.  Helton tells him he will send a plane for him at the airport.  Sensing an opportunity, Stanley leaves the set and races to the airport while donning a new disguise.  At the airport, Stanley fools the driver sent to wait for JC and retrieves JC himself.  He then drugs JC and attempts to drown him in the lake, but JC unties himself and tries to escape, leading Stanley to run him down with his boat motor instead.  Posing as JC, Stanley returns to the set and once again runs into Alison.  He claims to be an acquaintance of Stanley and gives her several details about his modus operandi and preference for strong women as victims.  She explains her fascination with Stanley as a film student and invites him out for coffee at a later date, which Stanley accepts.  Helton unveils the indoor set for ''Cabin by the Lake'': An enormous water tank eerily similar to Stanley's original "garden", complete with mannequins in various stages of decay.  Tasked with shooting the underwater scenes, Stanley dons scuba gear and dives into the tank to tend his garden, infuriating Helton by ignoring his stage directions.  Later, Stanley and Alison finally meet to discuss Stanley more in depth.  When she mentions Kimberly Parsons, Stanley goes into a trance as he describes how she had fought the hardest of all his victims, remembering vividly how she had scratched and clawed him.  When Alison returns to the tank alone to continue writing, she is ambushed by an unknown person.  Helton believes that Paul Parsons is responsible, in an effort to sabotage the production.  Helton then discovers that Stanley has made changes to the script without his knowledge, further angering him.  In turn, Stanley drugs Helton and takes him back to the cabin where he buries him alive, using fireworks to cover his panicked screams.  Stanley takes over as director, micromanaging every aspect of the film according to his personal vision.  At the lake, Paul confronts Alison about her part in the production.  He apologizes for scaring her at the tank and invites her to meet with him at the bar to discuss his sister.  Paul gives details of Kimberly's death that eerily correspond with those from Stanley himself, rousing her suspicions.  When she confronts Stanley, he gives her a drugged glass of wine that renders her unconscious.  She awakens in Stanley's cabin basement, chained to the floor by her ankle just like all his previous victims.  As he greets her with food, the scars on his forearm confirm his identity.    Paul repeatedly calls the set looking for Alison, but is told that she finished rewriting the script and went home.  Stanley then falsely informs Paul that he is planning to scrap the production and invites Paul to meet him at the stage that night.  Stanley directs the final shot of the movie, but secretly rigs a light fixture to fall into the tank and electrocute the actress inside.  When Paul arrives on set just afterwards, Stanley frames him for the incident and sends him fleeing.  Stanley coerces the actors playing Mallory and Boone to come back to the set for one final shot, then returns to the cabin where a defiant Alison manipulates him into bringing her to the stage.  Alison tries to warn the two actors that Stanley is planning to kill them, but they dismiss her words as a joke.  While looking for Alison, Paul visits the cabin and discovers she was abducted by Stanley.    Holding them at gunpoint, Stanley carries out his plan to drown Mallory's actress.  As the actor playing Boone struggles to free her, Alison pushes Stanley off the platform before shooting the tank with Stanley's gun, flooding the stage.  Paul arrives to help, but Alison is recaptured by Stanley and forced into his car.  While driving, Alison deliberately crashes the car and escapes, but Stanley recovers and pursues her back to the cabin.  Stanley finds her hiding in the bathroom, but Alison strikes him with a towel rack and knocks him into a bathtub full of water.  After a brief standoff, she throws a hair dryer into the tub and electrocutes him.  The police arrive with Paul but a search of the cabin yields no sign of Stanley.  They find his boat on the lake, and Alison finds a watch he had stolen from JC on the dock.  The police decide they will drag the lake tomorrow and try to reassure Alison that Stanley is dead.  The film closes with a report stating that ''Cabin by the Lake'' was a surprise hit in its opening weekend, earning $36 million at the box office with a sequel already in the works.  Alison and Paul have since started a relationship, but Alison still has nightmares about Stanley, who is shown reading the newspaper article about the film's success.  
Riding in Cars with Boys
 In 1961, eleven-year-old Beverly "Bev" Donofrio rides with her father, [[Connecticut]] police officer Leonard, to the [[Christmas]] tree lot. When she reveals that she wants a [[bra]] for Christmas in order to get the attention of a boy she likes, Leonard tells her she is too young to be thinking about boys, and to focus on books.  Now 1965, Bev is now an intelligent, but naïve teenager. Her dream is to go to [[college]] in [[New York City|New York]] and become a writer. She joins her friends, Fay and Tina, at a party. Fay finds her older boyfriend Bobby, who is about to be deployed to [[Vietnam]], while Bev gives a love letter to a popular boy named Sky. When Sky reads the letter aloud, Bev flees to the bathroom. She is consoled by Ray, a stranger, who then defends Bev's honor and fights with Sky. Bev and Ray, with Fay and Bobby, flee the party. The four go to a lookout, where Bobby and Fay [[sexual intercourse|have sex]]. Bev is overcome by Ray's kindness and they also [[sexual intercourse|have se]]x. Leonard, who is on duty, drives up and brings them to the police station, where Bev claims that they only kissed.  Bev discovers she is [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. She tells Ray, initially turns down his offer to get [[marriage|married]], then placates her shocked parents by agreeing to a hasty [[wedding]]. At the reception, everyone is avoiding Bev, so Fay publicly announce that she is also [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. Fay confides to Bev that her father wanted her to put the baby up for [[adoption]], but she and Bobby will be getting married instead. The two girls eventually celebrate the fact they will be mothers together.  Over the next few months, the girls bemoan missing out on three things: their childhood, [[prom]], and an education. Bev gives birth to son Jason, while Fay has daughter Amelia. Bev continues to pursue her education. When Jason is three, she wins the chance for a college scholarship. Unfortunately, Bev's interview goes badly when she is forced to take Jason along. Although the interviewer praises Bev's writings, he states that she has too many distractions. Later, Fay reveals that she and Bobby are [[divorce|getting divorced]], because he met someone while stationed in [[Hawaii]]. Bev tells Fay that she's not sure if she loves Jason, because his birth has cost her so much. When Jason almost drowns in Fay's [[swimming pool|pool]], Bev vows to be more attentive.  On Jason's seventh birthday, several people from Bev's high school show up to his party: old friend Tina is now engaged and going to [[New York University|NYU]]; and Tommy, who had a crush on Bev, just graduated from [[University of California Berkeley|Berkeley]]. He suggests that Bev move her family to [[California]] and pursue her education there, since the state offers financial aid. Ray agrees to the plan, but on the day they are supposed to leave, he confesses that he is a [[addiction|heroin addict]] and spent their savings on drugs. Bev helps him detox, but Ray sneaks out to get more drugs. When he tells Bev that it's impossible for him to quit, she tells him he should leave instead. Ray agrees, but young Jason chases after him in tears, then tells Bev that he hates her for making Ray leave.   Two years later, Bev still yearns for [[California]]. She and Fay help Lizard (one of Ray's old friends) dry [[marijuana|weed]] in Bev's oven. Jason, still bitter, tells Grandpa Leonard, who arrests the mothers (Lizard had left). Fay's brother bails them out, using up their savings, on the condition that Fay and Amelia move away with him and cut off contact with Bev. Bev harshly tells the smug Jason that he ruined their lives. She claims that it's his fault Amelia moved away.  Now 1985, Bev and Jason are driving to see Ray. She managed to get her college degree and has written her [[memoir]], but needs Ray to sign a waiver or else her book will not be published. While driving, Jason tells Bev that he wants to transfer from NYU to [[Indiana University]], but Bev refuses, saying that he is getting the education that she never could. Jason calls his now-girlfriend Amelia with the bad news. Amelia is dejected but assures him that she is not angry. Arrive at Ray's trailer, Bev explains why they are there. When Ray's wife, Shirley, demands $100,000, Bev screams at Ray and storms out. Jason follows her and calls her selfish for only caring about her book when he finally got to see his father again. He accuses her of being a bad mother and she storms off.   Ray comes outside and talks with Jason, stating that leaving was the best thing he could have done for Jason and he believes it's the only reason Jason turned out so well. He sneaks the signed papers to Jason. Jason finds Bev, who insists that she was a great mother who sacrificed everything for him. Jason reveals that he will transfer in order to be with Amelia and apologizes to Bev for ruining her life. Bev softens and tells Jason that she is proud of him and thinks of him as the best thing in her life. She also tells him that she holds herself responsible for her various mistakes and poor choices and she never meant to blame Jason for them. She gives him her car to drive to [[Indiana]].    Beverly is forced to call Leonard for a ride. She complains to him how Jason blames her for everything wrong in his life. She then realizes that she herself has done the same to her father. Together, they sing a song from her childhood as they drive away.  
Ripper (film)
 Molly Keller ([[A. J. Cook (actress)|A. J. Cook]]) narrowly avoids being murdered by a serial killer, after managing to escape an island. Five years later, she takes a [[forensic psychology]] class taught by Marshall Kane ([[Bruce Payne]]), a world-renowned expert on deviant violent offenders. Also taking the class are Jason Korda ([[Ryan Northcott]]), Chantal Etienne ([[Claire Keim]]), Marisa Tavares ([[Kelly Brook]]), Eddie Sackman ([[Derek Hamilton]]), Mary-Anne Nordstrom ([[Daniella Evangelista]]), Andrea Carter ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]) and Aaron Kroeker ([[Courtney J. Stevens]]). During one lesson, Marshall pranks his class by pretending to murder one of the students, his intention being to demonstrate the potential of anyone to be a killer. The unorthodox lesson prompts Aaron to reveal to Molly that he is aware of her past, which angers her as she does not want to discuss the trauma she endured. Her mood is further upset by Eddie when he attempts to hit on her, only to be firmly rejected.  Later that night, the group, excluding Aaron, meet up for a study session, which soon degenerates into an argument over Molly's overtly hostile attitude. To ease the mounting tension, they decide to go to a party taking place in a nearby abandoned building. Here, Jason makes a genuine attempt to get to know Molly better, but she remains distant. Marisa, meanwhile, has sex with a masked man, after which she overhears Chantal and Andrea talking about her. Feeling hurt, Marisa decides to leave, but the elevator instead takes her up to an isolated floor of the building. Upon stepping out of the elevator, Marisa is attacked and viciously stabbed by a masked assailant. In her panic, she stumbles and falls out of a window, but a chain wrapped around her ankle catches her, enabling the killer to hoist her back up, where he brutally and graphically stabs her to death, before sending her body crashing through a window into the party below.  The next day, the group mourn Marisa's death, while deciding they will try and identify who the killer is. Molly meets Detective Kelso ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), who was part of the investigation of the previous murders. The pair go to the murder scene where Detective Kelso warns Molly that he believes the killer is back. Mary-Anne is driving home to see her family when a black truck begins to ram into the back of her car. She attempts to drive away, but the truck pushes her to the side of a cliff. As she attempts to get out, the truck hits her car again, causing her to crash through the windshield and plummet to her death. Detective Kelso finds her body in a nearby shed, where the killer has stabbed her repeatedly.  Molly challenges Marshall, and shows the killer is following the pattern of the famous serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]]. Jason manages to persuade the group to continue investigating despite their doubt. Molly and Jason discover a murderer previously held Marshall hostage. Chantal kisses Jason, but soon apologises to Molly for doing so, and the pair make friends. While Andrea is at the morgue identifying Mary-Anne's wounds, she is pursued by the killer, who drugs her before gutting her.  Jason, Chantal, and Eddie find out about Molly's past, which causes an argument resulting in Molly removing herself from the group. An upset Molly is comforted by Marshall. The following night, Molly, Jason, Eddie, Chantal, and Marshall are taken to a cabin where they realize the victims share the same initials of the victims of Jack the Ripper. Suspicion falls on Aaron, who was the one that assembled the study group. They attempt to phone Detective Kelso, but the phone is not working. After Molly and Chantal fall out, Eddie, Jason, and Chantal leave to try and fix the phone satellite on top of the mountain. Their car soon breaks down, forcing Jason to proceed on foot. Eddie attempts to fix the car, while Chantal remains inside. The killer soon appears and knocks out Chantal before Eddie's hand is trapped inside the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] of the car. Chantal wakes up and panics, driving the car forward into a tree which crushes Eddie's back, killing him. The killer chases Chantal to a factory, where she accidentally activates a log splitting machine. She bumps into Aaron, who warns her he knows who the killer is. She tries to escape, but they fall into the machine, where they are both mutilated by the circular saws.  Back at the cabin, Molly becomes suspicious of both Jason and Marshall. As Jason arrives back, Molly knocks him out before running into the forest. She encounters Jason again and flees while the killer hacks him to death with an axe. Molly discovers Marshall standing over a murdered Jason, before Detective Kelso arrives and knocks out Marshall. Molly then hallucinates and sees her younger self in the forest, gesturing to the two men and suggesting that Molly is the one who killed them all. Later, Marshall is executed for the murders, and due to visible mental problems, Molly is put in an insane asylum.  It has been said that the killer was never definitively named in the film, and there is suggestion that Detective Kelso is actually the killer. During the opening murder scene, as the young Molly escapes on a boat, she stabs the killer in the hand while he attempts to climb onto the boat after her. Detective Kelso is seen in every scene in the movie to be wearing only one glove on the same hand that the killer was stabbed in. However, in the [[Ripper 2: Letter from Within | film's sequel]] it was revealed that Molly was indeed the killer.  
Rishi (2001 film)
 Rishi ([[Sarath Kumar]]) is a tough, suave, professional thief who is the right-hand of Satyan ([[Arun Pandian]]), the kingpin of the underworld.. On one of his missions, he happens to watch Minister Devaraj ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]) kill Hema, a TV reporter who is about to expose him. Before dying, Hema hands a floppy to Rishi. Rishi neither bothers about the floppy nor the murder, but Devaraj wants the floppy back. Things get confusing because of Velu (Sarath Kumar), who looks like Rishi and gets into trouble.   Velu is the opposite of Rishi: he is simple-minded, takes life easy, and works for a moneylender. The 'Seth' lends money for buying cars, and Velu, with his friend Cheenu ([[Ramesh Khanna]]) persuades errant customers to either repay dues or part with their cars. Complications arise when the paths of the duo cross, for Rishi and Velu are lookalikes. Only Indu ([[Meena Durairaj|Meena]]), a salesgirl seems to have some family to speak of. The narration moves smoothly forward, Rishi and Velu leading their own lives.  Then their paths cross. One is mistaken for the other, and complications arise. The underworld guns for Velu. Indu, who becomes Velu's girlfriend, sees Rishi with Nandini and berates Velu for his duplicity.  Meanwhile, Rishi turns over a new leaf when one of his tasks ends up in a singer Nandhini ([[Sanghavi]]) being blinded. He saves her life, finances for her eye operation, and turns her protector, knowing fully well that she could identify him and the rest of the gang. He even parts ways with Satyan on the issue, but the latter is unwilling to let him go.  Velu is puzzled when he is attacked by a gang who demands the floppy from him. When Indu accuses him of having an affair with a girl she sees him in the hospital with, Velu visits the hospital and encounters Rishi. The duo strikes a good rapport. The puzzle pieces fall in place. Devaraj, realizing that his ministerial position is shaky, kidnaps Nandini and blackmails Rishi to kill the Chief Minister ([[S. S. Rajendran]]). But it is Velu who goes in his place. The scene where he tries to warn the security personnel about the assassination attempt, only to find that they too are part of the conspiracy, is taken straight from a Hollywood film.  The movie ends rather abruptly, with Velu being shot and the Chief Minister's life being saved.

 Royal Tenenbaum explains to his three adolescent children, Chas, Margot, and Richie, that he and his wife, Etheline, are separating. Each of the Tenenbaum children achieved great success at a young age. Chas is a math and business genius, from whom Royal steals money. Margot, who was adopted by the Tenenbaums, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade. Richie is a [[tennis]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and artist. He expresses his love for his adopted sister Margot through many paintings. Royal takes him on regular outings, to which neither of the other children is invited. Eli Cash is the Tenenbaums' neighbor, and Richie's best friend.  Twenty-two years later, Royal is kicked out of the hotel where he has been living. All the Tenenbaum children are in a post-success slump, with Richie traveling the world on a [[cruise ship]] following a breakdown. He writes a letter to Eli revealing his love for Margot. Chas has become overprotective of his sons, Ari and Uzi, following his wife Rachael's death in a plane crash. Margot is married to [[neurologist]] Raleigh St. Clair, from whom she hides her smoking and her checkered past. Raleigh is conducting research on a subject named Dudley Heinsbergen.  Etheline's longtime accountant, Henry Sherman, proposes to her. Learning of Henry's proposal, Royal claims that he has [[stomach cancer]] to win back the affections of Etheline and his children. Etheline calls each of her children home, and Royal moves into the family home and sets up medical equipment in Richie's room. Royal learns of Chas' overprotective nature and takes his grandsons on an adventure involving [[shoplifting]] and [[dog fighting]]. On their return, Chas berates him for endangering his boys, and Royal accuses Chas of having a [[nervous breakdown]].  Eli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie loves her. Royal discovers the affair and objects to Margot's treatment of Raleigh, who confides to Richie his suspicions of Margot. He and Richie hire a [[private investigator]] to spy on her. Meanwhile, Henry investigates Royal's cancer claim and discovers his hospital had closed years before, his doctor does not exist, and that his cancer medication is only candy. He confronts Pagoda, the family servant, and gathers the whole family to tell them what he has discovered. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda move out of the house.  Richie and Raleigh get the private eye's report on Margot, which reveals her history of smoking and sexual promiscuity, including a previous marriage to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] recording artist. Both men take the news hard, with Richie going into a bathroom, shaving off his hair and beard, and slashing his wrists. Dudley finds him in a pool of blood, and Raleigh rushes him to the hospital. As the Tenenbaums sit in the waiting room, Raleigh confronts Margot and then leaves. Richie escapes the hospital and meets with Margot. They share their secret love and they kiss.  Royal decides that he wants Etheline to be happy, and finally arranges for a divorce. Before Henry and Etheline's wedding, Eli, high on [[mescaline]], crashes his car into the side of the house. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi, but the boys' dog, Buckley, is killed. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and wrestles him to the ground. Eli and Chas agree that they both need psychiatric help. Chas thanks Royal for saving his sons and for buying them a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] from the responding firemen as a replacement for Buckley. Forty-eight hours later, Etheline and Henry are married in a judge's [[Chambers (law)|chambers]].  Some time later, Margot releases a new play inspired by her family, Raleigh publishes a book about Dudley's condition, Eli checks himself into a drug rehabilitation facility in North Dakota, and Richie begins teaching a junior tennis program. Chas becomes less overprotective of his children. Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and seems to be on better terms with Etheline. He has a [[heart attack]] and dies at the age of 68. Chas accompanies him in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, and is the only witness to his death. The family attends his funeral, where the [[epitaph]] dubiously reads that he "Died tragically rescuing his family from the wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship."  
Rock Star (2001 film)
 In the mid-1980s, Chris Cole ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) is a [[Pittsburgh]] fanatical admirer of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a [[photocopier]] technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon [[tribute band]] called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song).  Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers ([[Jason Flemyng]]), and the beginning of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm ([[Timothy Olyphant]]). During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings, and Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song – a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris meets Blood Pollution at a rehearsal session, but he finds out that he has been replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band.  One day, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy ([[Dominic West]]), and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being pranked by Rob, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band, as well as learning that Bobby Beers was fired because he was a closeted homosexual, and gives an outstanding performance of "[[We All Die Young]]" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is actually a song by [[Steelheart]], whose lead vocalist [[Miljenko Matijevic]] provides Cole's singing voice for the film). Chris joins the band as their new singer, adopting the stage name "Izzy". Following a successful debut concert with Steel Dragon, Izzy must come to grips with the pressures of his new-found fame and success. The band embarks on a lengthy tour and Izzy experiences the excesses of the lifestyle, with the group's manager, Mats ([[Timothy Spall]]), serving as a sympathetic mentor to Izzy.  His new lifestyle impacts his life both for better and worse, particularly with his relationship with his supportive girlfriend, Emily Poule ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), when she decides not to continue with him throughout the remainder of the tour as a rock star girlfriend, though Emily and Izzy agree to get back together when the tour reaches [[Seattle]]. Eventually, Steel Dragon stops in Seattle for a show, and Emily arrives at his hotel room as they had previously arranged, although Izzy had become so inebriated while on tour he forgot about the arrangement and did not even know what city he was in. Although taken aback by all the groupies, Emily still tries to reconnect with him, reminding him of their plans to meet up once he got to Seattle, however he is too intoxicated to really understand what she is saying, eventually suggesting they go to [[Seattle]] together. Heartbroken with his inconsiderate behavior, intoxication and the fact that he is sleeping with so many groupies, Emily leaves him.  After the end of the tour, Izzy reports to the next series of Steel Dragon recording sessions with song concepts and artwork for the band's next album. The rest of the band rejects Izzy's ideas, with Kirk explaining that the band has to stay true to the "Steel Dragon thing" to fulfill fan expectations. Izzy is angered upon realizing that he was only recruited for his vocal abilities. After a heartfelt conversation with Mats about how he feared he had no control over the direction life has taken him, Izzy begins to reconsider his rock star lifestyle. On the next tour, in a scene directly paralleling one near the beginning of the film with their roles reversed, Izzy hears a fan ([[Myles Kennedy]]) singing along with him toward the end of a live concert. Impressed, Izzy pulls the fan, who introduces himself as Thor, onstage and hands him the microphone to finish the concert.  Backstage, Izzy realizes that what he wanted for so long was not what he thought, and he says goodbye to Mats, departing from the band while doing so.  Upon ditching his stage name, Izzy, Chris makes his way to Seattle and starts a new band with his old friend and former bandmate Rob. At the same time Steel Dragon, failing to evolve to the changing tastes and styles of the 1990s (As glam metal was pushed aside for [[grunge]].), has its fame fizzle out. Chris finds Emily working in the coffee shop she and her roommate purchased a few years earlier, but is initially too ashamed to speak to her. While walking one evening, Emily sees a flyer for his band posted on the wall and takes it down. In the final scene, Chris is singing with his band in a bar and Emily walks in. Chris leaves the stage and speaks to her. They reconcile, ending the film with a kiss and the final note of Chris' first original song "Colorful" (which is actually a song by [[The Verve Pipe]]).  During the credits, Cuddy talks about the future of the band and Beers is shown to have taken up Irish Dancing after his sacking from Steel Dragon.  
Route 666 (film)
   Sitting alone at a roadside bar in Arizona, Fred "Rabbit" Smith (Williams) drinks nervously. Two people named Jack La Roca (Phillips) and Stephanie (Petty) enter the bar. Rabbit uses the restroom followed by Jack who handcuffs him. He reveals that he and Steph are Federal Marshals assigned to capture Rabbit and bring him to court in Los Angeles to testify against a mob boss named Benny ([[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]) who Rabbit used to work for. He was originally going to testify in exchange for full immunity but ran after learning the mob joined forces with the Russians. They are hunting him, too. Jack calls for a Suburban driven by four other marshals to pick them up before Benny and his mob arrive with heavy firepower. They leave out the back and battle the assassins until marshals; Nick, Mary, PT and Joe arrive between them. They manage to kill all assassins but Benny. Jack and Rabbit use Rabbit's car to escape in the same path as the other marshals (including Steph in the truck). Jack manages to shoot Benny's tires out before leaving.  PT complains to Steph about Jack, believing he isn't trustworthy. She tells him to focus on finding out where they are. Jack tries to find the roads they are using on the map but Rabbit tells him that the back roads are too old and don't have a place on the map except for his old guide. He reads him that a second highway exists next to Route 66 which leads faster to the California border. The road is Route 666 that was condemned after a prison road crew accident. Hearing the story, Jack has strange quick flashbacks of four prisoners digging a hole surrounded by law-enforcement. Meanwhile, Benny shoots a tourist and takes his Jeep. The marshals arrive at a deserted tourist attraction bordering Route 666 and see a restricted access sign. As Jack debates about using the road, he experiences more flashbacks and tells Steph that he was born around the area and his mother died when he was six and he hardly knew his father. Much to Rabbit's dismay, Jack kicks open the gates and the group drive onto it, Steph rides with Jack and Rabbit.  Unknown to them, a county sheriff's deputy named Gill has been following them. He sees they went down Route 666 and requests for backup on the radio. His father, Sheriff Conaway, denies and tells him to leave the road. Gill ignores and pulls the two vehicles over. Jack and PT confront him and Gill abusively tells them the road is restricted. Jack shows him his badge and he leaves irritated. They drive along until they spot a cemetery along the road and stop there. Jack and Steph explore the graveyard, finding Jack's father, John La Roca's grave. PT sees the grave along with three others next to it are the graves of Miles Hackman, Frank Slater and Steven Pikowski. PT explains that all but John La Roca were infamous murderers from the 1960s. La Roca was a bank robber who quit robbing after marrying a woman in a small town and having a baby, Jack. After six years there was no more money for his family so he tried to rob a bank but was caught and thrown in the same prison as Hackman, Slater and Pikowski.  PT suddenly realizes La Roca is Jack's father. They soon start to fight each other. Mary and Nick leave Joe to watch Rabbit while they go back into the Suburban and have sex. Behind Joe, Benny appears and fires at the two with a silenced gun. Before he can reach Rabbit Joe stabs Benny and takes his gun. Blood rushes out of Benny's back which suddenly attracts the decomposed walking corpses of Slater, La Roca, Pikowski and Hackman. They capture Joe and drag him to the road where they pound his back into the asphalt with a jackhammer. While screaming at Nick and Mary to get out of the Suburban, Rabbit takes the silencer off the gun and fires at the zombies, alerting everyone else. The team battles the undead with no effect and they escape the area. Jack stays behind to slow the zombies and uses the stolen Jeep to escape but crashes.  Jack wakes up in a cave next to a native, explaining that he found him and brought him here. He tells him that he must  restore peace to the cursed road because haunted spirits still walk it. A confused Jack thanks the man and leaves. Nick leaves to smoke in the Suburban. He slowly falls asleep until Slater slams his fingers off with the car door and slams his head with a sledge hammer. He travels along the road until he sees the two vehicles with their tires melted at a ruined drive-in theatre and is reunited with the rest of the group.  The group goes to check in on Nick while Rabbit stays handcuffed to a pole and stomps a Scorpion, exposing much blood. Rabbit turns around to see Pikowski's zombie swinging a pick axe at him and missing. Rabbit manages to pull the pole out and escape with Pikowski not following. He catches up with the group and sees that Nick is missing. Rabbit thinks and establishes that the zombies can only travel on the road and concrete/cement and they appear from underground. Jack spots an old telephone booth and successfully dials 911, connecting with Sheriff Conaway. Jack gives him the number of the Los Angeles Marshal’s office and tells him to call the office and request backup. He agrees and hangs up.  After four hours of waiting, Jack has another flashback and sees his father, Slater, Hackman and Pikowski working on a road when Hackman pulls out a knife and attempts to escape while John hides under a machine and tries to stay away from the trouble. The escape fails and the unseen police office in charge makes them start digging a large hole. Hearing sirens, they spot Sheriff Conaway along with his deputies, Tim and Gill. Jack and Rabbit go to the bathroom stall while Conaway and his officers hold everyone else at gunpoint. Conaway demands to know where Jack is; only hearing that Jack is dead. Conaway shoots Mary in order to make PT tell them that Jack and Rabbit are in the stall. Tim and Gil grab Rabbit who is wearing Jack's badge to confuse them and brings him outside. Jack draws Gil out and points a gun at his head when he enters his truck.  They drive further away and Jack handcuffs Gil to the truck and breaks his nose. He begs for him to not stay on the road, stating the zombies kill anything on the road. Jack asks why when the four zombies rise again and start approaching. Gil uncuffs himself but is too late as they knock him down and kill him with the jackhammer. Jack drives back and Conaway goes to the truck thinking Gil is in it and PT fights Tim who drops his shotgun but is able to shoot PT in the stomach with his pistol. Rabbit picks up the shotgun and shoots Tim, saying "There's a new [[Marshal]] in town". Jack punches Conaway multiple times and restrains him to the SUV. Conaway starts bleeding and asks where his son is. Jack doesn't reply and Conaway slowly realizes that the zombies put him in the road.  He explains that they travel under the road and feed on blood to stay strong or they are unable to rise from underground and that blood awakens them. Jack wonders how Conaway knows so much about the zombies and has a final flashback. It is night and the unseen boss is Sheriff Conaway whom the prison warden put in charge of the gang. Though La Roca didn't assist in the attempted escape, he is knocked unconscious and thrown into the hole dug by the three others. Conaway and his men open fire at the convicts in their legs, keeping them alive and preventing them to move out of the hole. Conaway plans to tell the warden that there was an accident and the convicts were caught under the roller. He starts the steam roller and buries the four men alive. Conaway and his thugs learn about the zombies return and they were killing anyone whoever set foot on the road to cover up the crime and the zombies.  Jack finally realizes this and continuously yells and brutally punches at Conaway. Conaway begs him not to be in the road. Suddenly, the zombies arrive. They pin Jack down and Conaway tries to enter the SUV but Rabbit knocks him out. He and Steph are unable to kill the zombies by gunfire as the jackhammer is brought up. Jack looks at John and yells with sympathy that he is his son. After seconds, John suddenly snaps and pushes the jackhammer into Slater's stomach, destroying his spirit and body. He then kills Hackman with the jackhammer which stops working. Pikowski hits John multiple times with the hammer until he loses too much blood energy. Jack cuts his hand with a knife and embraces it into his father's hand. With enough energy, John thanks his son and chokes Pikowski, killing him.  John tears off his dog tag and gives it to Jack. John is then able to walk onto the dirt and crosses the afterlife into Heaven, finally lifting the curse on Route 666. Conaway emerges from the SUV and he was going to shoot them until Jack, Steph and Rabbit shoot him everywhere. He falls barely stable to the ground and has an unseen vision of an even larger steam roller (as the Grim Reaper) coming towards him. He shoots at it with no effect and it crushes him. Jack, Steph and Rabbit walk alone along Route 666 to head to the Arizona/California border as Jack finally pieces together what the native said to him. With Sheriff Conaway and his thugs dead Route 666 is now peaceful once more. Jack, Steph and Rabbit walk along the sunset and they know that the curse has been finally lifted.

Rush Hour 2
 Four days after the events of ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'', [[LAPD]] Detective James Carter is on vacation in Hong Kong visiting his friend, [[Hong Kong Police Force]] Chief Inspector Lee, whom he met and befriended after working together to save the Chinese Consul's Han daughter, Soo Yung, in Los Angeles. Their leisure is temporarily put on hold as soon as a bomb explodes at the [[American Embassy in Hong Kong|United States Consulate General]], murdering two undercover [[U.S. Customs]] agents inside of it. Inspector Lee is assigned to the case, which becomes personal when it is discovered that it somehow involves Ricky Tan, his late police officer father's former partner. Ricky, who was suspected of having a role in elder Lee's death (although never proven), is now a leader of the Triads. This, however, causes Lee and Carter to get into a brawl between them and Ricky's bodyguards, with Carter becoming shocked with Lee as they were busy with their vacation.  The U.S. Secret Service, led by Agent Sterling, and the Hong Kong Police Force soon get into a fight over the jurisdiction of the case. Suddenly, Lee's office that Carter was in is bombed, causing Lee to believe he's dead and grieve for him. Carter is revealed to be alive, leaving the room before it exploded. He and a relieved Lee cross paths at Ricky's yacht where he is holding a dinner party. Ricky scolds his underling, Hu Li, who then leaves as Lee and Carter confront her boss. Just as Ricky asks for protection, Hu Li shoots him and makes her escape in the chaos. An angry Sterling holds Lee responsible for Ricky's death, and orders him off the case. Carter is ordered back to Los Angeles for involving himself and Lee volunteers to take him to the airport. However, at the airport, Carter gets Lee to return to LA with him.  On the plane, Carter tells Lee that in every large criminal operation, there is a rich white man behind it and that man is Steven Reign, a billionaire Los Angeles hotelier whom Carter saw acting suspiciously on Ricky's boat. They set up camp outside the Reign Towers, spotting a U.S. Secret Service agent named Isabella Molina, whom Carter met earlier in Hong Kong. After a few misunderstandings, Molina tells the two men that she is undercover, looking into Reign's money laundering of $100 million in [[superdollars]].  Lee and Carter pay a visit to Kenny, an ex-con known to Carter who runs a gambling den in the back of his Chinese restaurant. He tells them that a usually broke customer recently came into his establishment with a suspicious amount of hundred-dollar bills. Carter confirms that they are Reign's counterfeits and they trace the money back to a bank. The mobsters are waiting for them and knock the two cops unconscious, with Molina looking on. After arriving in Las Vegas, Lee and Carter wake up inside one of the mob's trucks and escape. After finding out where they are, they realize that Reign is laundering the $100 million through the new Red Dragon Casino.  At the Red Dragon, Lee and Carter split up. Lee attempts to find the engraving plates which were used to make the counterfeit money, while Carter makes a distraction to help Lee sneak past the security. However, Hu Li captures Lee and takes him to a room where it is revealed that Ricky Tan faked his death. When Ricky departs, Molina tries to arrest Hu Li but Hu Li easily over-powers her and Molina is shot. After an explosion inside the casino sends all the guests fleeing to safety, Carter engages in a fight with Hu Li in a comical manner and knocks her out, while Lee heads to the penthouse to prevent Ricky from escaping with the plates. In the penthouse, Reign opens the safe and takes the plates, running into Ricky as he leaves. Reign tries to back out of the deal but Ricky stabs him to death. Lee and Carter arrive and a scuffle between them and Ricky ensues after he confesses that he killed Lee's father and mocks him for only asking Ricky to spare Lee's life before he died.  Ricky falls to his death when Lee kicks him out of the window. Hu Li enters with a time bomb forcing Lee and Carter to grab onto the decoration wires. The two escape on the makeshift zipline as Hu Li kills herself in the explosion. Later, at the airport, Molina thanks Lee for his work on the case, and she kisses him, while Carter watches from afar. Having originally planned to go their separate ways, Lee and Carter change their mind when Carter reveals he won a large amount of money at the casino and the pair decide to head to [[New York City]] to indulge themselves.  
The Safety of Objects
 In a suburban neighborhood, Paul Gold lies in his bedroom in a coma, caused by a traumatic car accident. He is cared for by his mother, Esther who in tending him closely has distanced herself from her husband Howard and teenage daughter Julie. Trying to elicit her mother's attention, Julie enters Esther in a local radio contest, in hopes of winning a brand new car.   Meanwhile, after years of putting his job first, Jim Train feels his family, especially his efficient wife Susan, no longer needs him. He tries to reconnect with his son Jake (Alex House), on the edge of puberty, but the youth is preoccupied with romantic fantasies about his younger sister's twelve-inch plastic doll. After Jim is skipped over for a promotion, he stops going to work, claiming that a [[bomb threat]] was called into his office. Feeling unappreciated by his family, he convinces Esther and Julie to let him help them win the car.  The Trains' neighbor, Helen Christianson, feeling older and less desirable, tries new products to keep her feeling young. She succeeds only in alienating her husband, who loves her as she is.   Helen's good friend, Annette Jennings, in the midst of a messy divorce, struggles to provide financially for her two daughters. Sam, the older [[tomboy]]ish daughter, is desperate to go off to camp that summer. Sam's younger sister suffers from mental disabilities and requires special schooling, which her father, Annette's ex-husband, refuses to pay for. Annette is also mourning the loss of Paul, with whom she was having a relationship. Randy, the neighborhood's landscaper, is coping (poorly) with his own younger brother's death in the same car accident that grievously injured Paul Gold.  Annette's ex-husband comes to visit his daughters. He says that he wants to take Sam on a holiday. Annette refuses because Sam is not interested in spending time with her father, and her ex-husband does not want to care for the younger daughter. Sam overhears their argument and runs away from her father when he tries to talk to her at the park. Soon she bumps into Randy, who tells her that her mom instructed him to pick her up.   Randy takes Sam to a remote cabin in the woods and keeps her there, not allowing her to call home. He calls her 'Johnny', after his late brother. After what appears to be three days, Randy starts driving back to the suburb, to recreate the night when the characters' lives intersected. When the beer he asks Sam to hand him does not explode, he appears to realize that the person in the back seat is Sam, not his brother.  Esther eventually gets to the final two slots in the radio contest, only to pull out at the last moment after nearly three days of physical and emotional taxation. Julie becomes angry and runs off. Jim, angry at what he feels is an inadequate second-place prize, becomes violent and wrecks the area. He gets chased off by Bobby, Helen's son, who works as the mall security guard. Esther, who finally realizes how much she has neglected her daughter, goes home and tearfully suffocates her son. Jim returns to his home, and Randy lets Sam go home. Helen almost cheats on her husband, but eventually returns home without having taken that step.   A flashback reveals the cause of the car crash: Randy, Paul, and Randy's younger brother Johnny were traveling in a car after a gig that Paul's band played. Johnny gave Randy and Paul beers which he had shaken, and they exploded when opened, on Paul who was driving. Another car, carrying Julie and Bobby, came from the opposite direction, speeding to rush Julie home after an impromptu tryst so she would not get in trouble for violating her curfew. Both drivers became distracted, both cars had to swerve, and Paul's car crashed and flipped over. The guilt that has consumed both Randy and Julie throughout the film, is shown to have originated from each taking blame for the crash.   Each acknowledges their heightened understandings of the effects of these events in their lives and their choices, and lastly, the interconnectedness of these families.

Investigating Douglas-Stewart, Maria learns that the Japhkiels are disguised demons being used by Furlong and Hamilton to overwhelm Tokyo, with Hamilton being a near-immortal nemesis from Maria's early life. Maria is discovered and barely escapes Hamilton.

Furlong escapes on a Japhkiel, then merges with the surviving Japhkiels to destroy the Flower Division, crippling Ratchet's Koubu in the process. Ogami, having just returned from Paris, arrives in his Koubu and turns the fight around, allowing the Flower Division to destroy Furlong. Tanuma is arrested, and Hamilton is cornered by Maria and killed with a bullet infused with spirit energy. The film ends with the Flower Division and Ratchet performing a musical play based on [[Kyōka Izumi]]'s ''The Sea God's Villa''. Through the play, Ratchet admits her anxieties following the collapse of the Star Division to Sakura and receives support and forgiveness from the Flower Division.

Saving Silverman
 Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and [[Neil Diamond]] fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond [[tribute band]] called "Diamonds in the Rough". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering [[Psychology|psychologist]] who is showing signs of being [[emotional abuse|emotionally abusive]], Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw.  Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail.  The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his "one and only", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go. When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back.  Chained to an engine block in Wayne's garage, Judith convinces J.D. he is gay. She knocks him unconscious to steal his keys and escape, only to be [[Tranquilizer gun|tranquilized with a dart gun]] by Wayne. Returned to the garage, Judith seduces Wayne into releasing one of her hands, so she escapes again. She runs to Darren's house in time to see him kiss Sandy, but shames him into confessing his engagement to Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent again.  Darren has Wayne and J.D. arrested. After escaping from jail with the help of Coach Norton, J.D. and Wayne rush to the convent on the brink of Sandy's final vows as a nun. They convince her that Darren still loves her. They then kidnap Neil Diamond to help Darren and Sandy reunite. At the wedding, Neil stalls the proceedings with the song [[Hello Again (Neil Diamond song)|"Hello Again"]] while Darren and Sandy reunite, Wayne and Judith (the latter being furious that her wedding is ruined) beat each other up (as love play) and J.D. arrives holding Coach in his arms, who coincidentally reveals to J.D. that he too is gay. The couples then wed on stage at Neil Diamond's concert; Darren to Sandy, Wayne to Judith, and J.D. to Coach.  
Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase
 In a college computer lab run by Professor Kaufman, two of his students; Eric Staufer and Bill McLemore are working when a virtual creature – the Phantom Virus – comes out of a new game based on the Mystery Gang's past adventures and tries to attack. The next day, Mystery, Inc. themselves come to the college and learn from their friend Eric that the virus had assumed a lifelike form thanks to an experimental laser which is able to transmit objects into cyberspace, and is now rampant across the campus. The gang goes on the hunt for the Phantom Virus, where the virus chases Scooby and Shaggy through the college. Unfortunately, the whole gang, including the virus, somehow gets pulled into the game after 'someone' activates the laser. Left with no other choice, the gang fight their way through the ten levels of mystery and adventures to complete the game in order to escape it, with the goal of finding a box of [[Scooby Snacks]] to complete each level. Their efforts are impeded on each level by the Phantom Virus. The first level is on [[the Moon]], second is in the [[Colosseum]], third is in the dinosaur age, fourth is under the sea, fifth finds the gang shrunken in a backyard, sixth is in ancient [[Japan]], seventh is in [[ancient Egypt]], eighth is in a medieval fantasy setting, and the ninth is in the [[North Pole]].  After a while, they finally reach the game's tenth and final level, where they meet their virtual counterparts who resemble themselves from previous series, with the exception of Scooby. They team up to confront the Phantom Virus, who wreaks havoc across the final level and summons his henchmen—five villains from the gang's past: the Creeper, Jaguaro, Gator Ghoul, the Tar Monster, and Old Iron Face. To make matters worse, all the monsters are real. The climax takes the two gangs to an [[amusement park]], where they fight off the creatures and attempt to retrieve the last box of Scooby Snax. During the fight, they use magnets to fight the virus, whom they discover is severely weakened by [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces. Cyber-Scooby distracts the virus long enough for the real Scooby Doo to retrieve the Scooby Snax, thus winning the game and deleting the monsters and the Phantom Virus once and for all.  The real gang bids farewell to their virtual selves and head home. Back in the lab, the gang reveals that they now know the culprit, who turns out to be Bill. Bill is arrested by Officer Wembley and confesses that he created the virus to scare Eric away and take all the credit for inventing the laser. He was outraged when Kaufman chose Eric's video game design over his own [[baseball]]-themed video game, despite Bill being at the college two years longer, and he felt more deserving to win the prize money at the university's science fair. Kaufman then protests that students alike are all equal. Bill was the one who beamed the gang into the game, as he feared they would find out that he created the virus. The gang and Eric play the new Scooby-Doo game, during which Scooby interacts with the gang's virtual counterparts once again by feeding Cyber-Scooby some Scooby Snax.  The [[post-credits scene]] includes the gang telling what their favorite parts of the movie are.  
Der Schuh des Manitu
 Abahachi ([[Michael Herbig]]), chief of the [[Apache]], and his [[blood brother]] Ranger ([[Christian Tramitz]]) are an inseparable pair since Ranger saved Abahachi from a speeding train at an unguarded railroad crossing. When they aim to buy a pub with the monetary help of [[Shoshone]] chief Stinking Lizard ("Listiger Lurch" in the German original - "Cunning Amphibian") through supposed Wyoming [[real estate]] agent Santa Maria ([[Sky du Mont]]), the deal as well as the pub, which turns out to be just a prop-up [[facade]], collapse. Santa Maria kills Stinking Lizard's son, who was supposed to deliver the loan. Stinking Lizard believes Santa Maria when he claims it was Abahachi and Ranger who killed the chief's son and upon their return to the Shoshone tribe, the two find themselves unjustly charged with murder.  Bound to two stakes and awaiting their execution, Abahachi remembers, during a squabble with Ranger, a secret treasure kept inside a large, shoe-shaped rock called Manitou's Shoe (a reference to ''[[Treasure of the Silver Lake]]''), which Abahachi intends to recover in order to reimburse Stinking Lizard. The map leading to the treasure was left to Abahachi by his deceased grandfather (also Herbig, in the extended "Extra Large" version), and in a drunken rout following his demise it was divided into four parts, which were distributed among Abahachi himself; his effeminate gay twin brother Winnetouch (also Herbig), the propietor of a beauty ranch; Abahachi's Greek friend Dimitri ([[Rick Kavanian]]); and his former "hough school" honey - and Ranger's fledging love interest - Ursula (Uschi). Unfortunately, Santa's right hand man Hombre overheard the blood brothers' plans and Santa wants to get the treasure for himself. They enable the two captives' escape, in which they inadvertently kill Stinking Lizard's pet rabbit, prompting the Shoshone chief to declare war on them and unbury a folding chair [[Burying the hatchet|in lieu of a hatchet]].  To gather the other parts of the map, Abahachi and Ranger travel across the land to meet with Abahachi's twin brother Winnetouch on his ranch-turned-beauty-plaza, the Powder Rose Ranch. Winnetouch remembers who Abahachi gave the other map pieces to, setting Winnetouch on Uschi's and Dimitri's trail. The trio notices Santa Maria's gang surrounding them, so Winnetouch dresses up as Abahachi to distract them while Abahachi and Ranger ride off to gather the other pieces of the map. Knowing they are short on time, they decide to split up; Abahachi goes to find Dimitri while Ranger seeks out Uschi. Meanwhile, Winnetouch is captured and held at the Powder Rose Ranch under Hombre's watch, but the two grow closer the longer they spend time together.  Just as Uschi, whom Ranger finds as a singer in a bar, gets ready to give Ranger her piece of the map, Santa Maria finds and captures them. When the two of them don't show up at the meeting point, Abahachi and Dimitri, whom Abahachi found as the propietor of a dingy bar, decide to go rescue them. During the rescue attempt Abahachi gets captured as well, bringing Santa Maria in possession of all the map pieces. He takes off with his gang to head for the treasure, taking Uschi with him since she tattooed the map on her back (and because he has taken an interest in her), leaving the others tied up in the ranch house which he sets on fire. However, before they burn to death, Dimitri comes to their rescue.  Santa Maria finds the mountain in which the treasure is hidden and goes inside, leaving his gang to guard the entrance. Abahachi, Winnetouch and Ranger manage to save Uschi and convince Hombre to join them. While Dimitri distracts the rest of the gang, the others go after Santa Maria. They get the treasure, a [[diamond]] necklace, from Santa Maria, who triggers and falls into a mud trap. In the ensuing shenanigans, they lose the necklace, and upon their exit of the mountain they find themselves surrounded by the Shoshone and Santa Maria's gang. In the subsequent fight, Santa Maria's gang is defeated and Hombre returns the embezzled gold to Stinking Lizard, ending the hostilities.  In the end, each character realizes their dream and Uschi, while pregnant with her and Ranger's child, urges him to set off with Abahachi, and both heroes ride into the sunset for new adventures.

Gilly gets his hair cut by a beautiful young aspiring hairdresser named Jo Wingfield ([[Heather Graham (actress)|Heather Graham]]). As Jo cuts Gilly's hair, she mentions that she recently lost a tail-less cat named Ringo, leading Gilly to tell her that Ringo is at the pound. The excitement causes Jo to accidentally cut off a part of Gilly's ear, and he is rushed to the hospital where the ear is reattached. To make up for the incident, Jo invites Gilly to her house for lunch the next day, where Gilly meets Jo's self-centered mother, Valdine ([[Sally Field]]), and stroke-suffering father, Walter ([[Richard Jenkins]]).  Gilly and Jo date for six months before getting engaged, but suddenly a private detective, Vic Vetter ([[Brent Briscoe]]), contacts Gilly to tell him that he's Valdine and Walter's son. After Gilly and Jo end their incestuous relationship, Gilly moves in with his new family, and Jo moves to [[Beaver, Oregon]] to start a new life. After being branded a "sister-fucker", Gilly loses his job at the animal shelter and is forced to take a job removing roadkill for the highway department.  Sixteen months later, a surprise comes to the Wingfield doorstep in the form of a young man named Leon Pitofsky ([[Jack Plotnick]]), who claims to be Valdine and Walter's son and presents his birth certificate as proof. Valdine and Walter feel better for a few moments before angrily lashing out at Gilly and forcing him to leave. Valdine notifies the Beaver police that Gilly is a sex offender. Gilly runs for his life and decides to go to Oregon to inform Jo. On the way to Oregon, he befriends a pilot [[Prosthesis|with two prosthetic legs]] named Dig ([[Orlando Jones]]).  Meanwhile, Jo becomes engaged to her ex-boyfriend Jack Mitchelson ([[Eddie Cibrian]]), a rich and powerful young man who secretly deals in [[marijuana]], controls over half the town by paying off numerous politicians, and cheats on Jo with his ex-girlfriend, a local cop named Gina ([[Sarah Silverman]]). Valdine keeps pushing Jo to marry Jack in order to become involved with Jack's wealth, although Jo still loves Gilly. Valdine keeps Leon secluded and tells Jo that Leon is a figment of Gilly's imagination. Gilly tries to hide from the authorities, and Dig frequently aids him in his escape from Jack's henchmen.  Ultimately, Gilly is not able to stop Jo from marrying Jack, who still believes that Gilly is her brother. Police arrive at the marriage scene to inform the family that Gilly died in a car accident, which was actually an act of sabotage by Leon who has been arrested. Jo learns the truth and ends her marriage which causes Valdine to attack Leon and have a stroke. It's also revealed that Jack was behind Valdine and Walter being misidentified as Gilly's parents. But unknown to everyone, Gilly was not driving the car at the time of the accident when it was actually one of Jack's henchmen Steak (Brent Hinkley). Gilly, who has just returned to working at the animal shelter, sees Jo and mistakenly believes that she wants to commit suicide. They are finally reunited on the roof of the same animal shelter that was a catalyst for their coming together.  A few months later, Gilly and Jo are married, and Walter, Valdine, Leon, Dig, and many other people attend, with Walter on his feet and Valdine in a wheelchair after her stroke. Also, as a surprise wedding present, Vetter arrives and tells him that he has truly found his mother. In an ironic twist, Gilly's mother turns out to be [[Suzanne Somers]], whom Gilly used to fantasize about while masturbating.

Joe “Mac” McBeth is passed over for a promotion to manager by Douglas McKenna, who has been embezzling the restaurant’s money. Three stoned hippies, one a fortune teller, inform Mac that they see a bank drive-thru style restaurant in his future as management. Mac and Pat McBeth then play informants on McKenna, and Duncan recognizes the value of Mac's efforts on behalf of the restaurant. Duncan shares with the McBeths his plans to turn his failing burger joint into a drive-through, and Mac realizes how profitable the drive-through could be, after which he is hit in the head with a refrigerator door and passes out briefly. Pat then decides to murder Duncan in a staged robbery.

Investigator McDuff arrests a local homeless man, to whom Pat has given Duncan's jewelry, and the restaurant is willed to Duncan's eldest son, Malcolm. Malcolm sells the restaurant to the McBeths who immediately realize Mac’s ideas, and the restaurant's business takes off.   Investigator McDuff returns to Scotland, where the homeless man is cleared, and the McBeths focus their attention on Malcolm. Banko, Mac’s friend, questions why Mac had never mentioned the drive-in concept. Mac grows withdrawn and paranoid and on a hunting trip contemplates killing off Banko, but a vision of the three hippies dressed as deer distracts him. Pat becomes obsessed with her burn injury and accuses people of staring at her repulsive-looking hand, though no scar is visible. Mac then kills Banko with the homeless man’s gun, and the body is discovered while new celebrity Mac gives a press conference. Mac calls on an hallucination of Banko to ask a question at the press conference and loses his sanity as the town watches on TV. He then returns to the woods to look for the hippies while Pat becomes deluded into thinking her hand is falling off. Mac then completely loses his sanity, answering and talking on the phone when no one is on the other end. In one conversation, the hippies suggest he kill McDuff’s family. Mac grabs the sheriff’s gun and orders the officer to call McDuff to the restaurant, where he then shoots McDuff, but the gun proves to be empty. They then wrestle for the inspector’s gun on the roof of the restaurant and both fall off. Mac is impaled on the horns of his car. Pat self-medicates with alcohol, but then cuts her hand off and bleeds to death. McDuff takes over the restaurant, fulfilling his dream of working with food.  
Secret Ballot (film)
 [[Image:SecretBallot2.jpg|thumb|left|160px]] The story begins at a small, two-man army post on a remote island. It is voting day, and an election agent is due to arrive by boat. A young woman arrives, collects the official voting box, and demands that the soldier on duty escort her around the island. They climb into a military jeep and begin driving around, looking for voters. The nameless woman is totally dedicated to her duty, a true believer in the importance of voting, a tireless worker, rather voluble and certainly not submissive. This confuses and angers the dim-witted soldier, who feels that a man should be the voting agent. Chador and all, she's clearly a liberated woman, a "city gal" as described by the soldier.  The couple-by-necessity do eventually (jeep trouble aside) scour the land to find eligible voters among the sparse locals. The trek starts in a desert and gradually moves to somewhat greener places. It is educational for both parties. They encounter a variety of people (mostly illiterate peasants) and situations, which simultaneously instructs the two roamers and the audience.  By the end of the film, only a few people have voted, and the young woman is largely disillusioned about the entire process.  Several people refused to vote for the "approved" candidates, and one voted for ''her''. There is an undercurrent of an unspoken affection having developed between her and the soldier.

The Seagull's Laughter
 The story is set around the 1950s, not very long after [[Icelandic independence movement|Iceland's independence]] from Denmark. The arrival of modernity in Iceland, including democracy, feminism, and new technologies and fashions, is an implicit theme throughout the text.  The narrative is presented from the perspective of Agga (played by [[Ugla Egilsdóttir]]), who during the three or so years covered by the story goes from being a pre-teen girl to being a young woman. The main agent in the story, however, is Agga's older step-cousin Freyja (played by [[Margrét Vilhjálmsdóttir]]). Freyja returns to Iceland from America after her American army officer husband died of heart attack two months before. Freyja, who is dressed in American clothing, brought back 7 luggages of clothes with her from America, and amazes her Icelandic family - Agga's grandmother and her aunts Ninna and Dódó - with her clothes, perfumes, and her having a fridge in America. Agga becomes suspicious, suspecting that Freyja is an evil woman or indeed a witch, and should be sent back to America. However, no one believes her.  Regardless of her suspicion, Agga told Dísa (played by [[Bára Lyngdal Magnúsdóttir]]) about Freyja's return. Dísa was excited about the news, so she ran to where Freyja is staying to meet her. The family of girls then tried on Freyja's clothes from America, and held a mini fashion show inside their house.  Agga then decided to report her suspicion to the local policeman Magnús (played by [[Hilmir Snær Guðnason]]), telling him that Freyja is heartless and evil, and that she is a liar. Magnús did not take Agga seriously, laughed her accusations off, and sent her out of the police station. With no one on her side, Agga began to follow Freyja, hoping to find out more about her. Freyja was found frequently visiting the rocks near the sea, disappearing behind the rocks and only reappearing many hours later. As Agga found the rocks intimidating, she dared not follow Freyja behind the rocks, and therefore no one knows what Freyja does behind the rocks.  Agga realizes that Magnús doesn't take her seriously because she is dressed as a child, after some difficulties with the other women in the house she obtains a trench coat; dressed like an adult she returns to the station where Magnús finally hears her out.

They encounter each other again when they both have to return to the restaurant to retrieve things that they had left behind. Considering this to be fate, they spend more time together and just after they exchange phone numbers Sara's gets blown into the wind.

She suggests that one put their name and phone number on a $5 bill and the other on the front [[Endpapers|endpaper]] of a [[Love in the Time of Cholera|book]] that will be sold the next day.

Jonathan sees a woman at Sara's house who he thinks is Sara but is Sara's sister, Caroline, fooling around with her boyfriend.

His neighbors tell her about his wedding at the Waldorf Astoria where she discovers that his wedding has been called off.

They introduce themselves to each other formally for the first time. In the final scene, Sara and Jonathan are at Bloomingdale's, enjoying champagne on their anniversary at the same spot where they first met.  
Series 7: The Contenders
 The film is shot in the style of a reality TV series. Five new contestants are selected in a random lottery and, along with the winner of the previous series, comprise the six Contenders. The film purposely leaves many key details unexplained, as the viewer is supposed to be watching only what the creators actually aired in the fictional TV show. How the show became so powerful as to randomly select people to be killed is unexplained, but the Contenders treat it as something they cannot control. Contenders are given a pistol, though they may acquire other weapons, and the last one left alive is the winner. Contestants are forced to play the game, regardless of their wishes. A contender who wins three tours of the game is freed from it.  Each series of ''The Contenders'' is played in the limits of a city or town. ''Series 7'' is set in Newbury, Connecticut, the hometown of Dawn Lagarto ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), the current and longest reigning champion. She has won two tours and just needs to win one more to be set free. Dawn is eight months pregnant and hopes to win the game for her baby. The show hosts a lottery, with Contenders chosen by whichever social security number appears. The five contenders selected are:  *Connie Trabucco ([[Marylouise Burke]]) – 57 years old, single, emergency room nurse. *Jeffrey Norman ([[Glenn Fitzgerald]]) – 33 years old, married, artist. He is dying of testicular cancer and is Dawn's former love. *Anthony Reilly ([[Michael Kaycheck]]) – 39 years old, married, unemployed asbestos remover. *Franklin James ([[Richard Venture]]) – 72 years old, retired. *Lindsay Berns ([[Merritt Wever]]) – 18 years old, student.  ''Series 7'' begins with a recap of the end of ''Series 6'': the opening scene shows the heavily pregnant Dawn enter a convenience store and fatally shoot a man in a seemingly random act. The show credits then roll, its rules are explained in voice-over narration, and the contenders are introduced. Interview segments interspersed with several of the contenders' early attempts to attack each other offer insight and background on the contenders. Most unusually, Dawn and Jeffrey already know each other. They were high school sweethearts, breaking up after Dawn had an abortion and Jeffrey came to believe he was gay. Jeffrey, now married to Doria ([[Angelina Phillips]]), and Dawn meet, and the terminally ill Jeffrey asks Dawn to kill him. Dawn agrees and leaves to procure drugs, so Jeffrey can painlessly overdose.  Lindsay travels to Franklin's trailer home and, after a pep talk by her parents, attacks him. They exchange fire, but neither is killed, with Lindsay suffering a wound to her arm. Meanwhile, Anthony tries to flee with his young daughter but is badly injured (supposedly from a "self-inflicted" knife wound to the back). Connie and Dawn separately track him to the hospital, where Connie kills him by lethal injection. Following Anthony's death, the remaining contenders receive notes to meet someone from "The Underground" at a local mall, promising help escaping the game. At the mall, security confiscates Franklin's pistol, but Lindsay is passed, after stating she is part of the show. Dawn, waiting near a store, spots Lindsay, as does Franklin. Franklin creeps up behind Lindsay and beats her to death, in front of her horrified parents. Franklin announces that the show is fixed, but, before he can explain, he is killed by Connie, the mastermind behind the notes. The only contenders left are Dawn, Jeffrey, and Connie.  Dawn tracks Connie to her home but goes into labor. Connie reluctantly assists her delivery, and Dawn is transported to a local hospital to deliver. She names the baby, a girl, "Jeffrey", but she is taken from her shortly after birth because of game rules. Contender Jeffrey, despondent when Dawn does not return to kill him as promised, is also in the hospital, following a suicide attempt. Connie attempts another lethal injection, but Jeffrey, who now wants to live, shoots and kills her. Dawn races to Jeffrey's room, where they realize they are the final two Contenders. They agree to meet at a neutral location for a final showdown. There, they profess their love for each other and turn against the camera crews following them.  The series finale traces Dawn and Jeffrey through surveillance footage and viewer tips to a movie theater. There, using confiscated cameras from the TV crew, they record themselves taking the theater patrons hostage and demanding the return of Dawn's baby. At this point, the narrator advises the show's audience that all remaining footage was lost due to a technical error and that the events have been reconstructed as a "dramatic re-enactment."

Session 9
  Gordon Fleming is the owner of a small [[asbestos]] removal company. The stresses of work and being a new father are causing problems between him and his wife, Wendy. He is in a desperate financial bind and makes a bid to remove asbestos from the [[Danvers State Hospital]], closed fifteen years ago, within one week. His team consists of Mike, a [[law school]] dropout who is knowledgeable about the asylum's history; Phil, who is filled with bitterness after losing his girlfriend and finds solace in smoking [[marijuana]]; Hank, who lost his girlfriend as well; and Jeff, Gordon's nephew, who suffers from severe [[nyctophobia]].  During the survey of the job site, Gordon hears a disembodied voice in a hallway that greets him by name, and later states "You can hear me". As work begins inside the asylum, Mike finds a box containing nine taped sessions with a patient named Mary Hobbes, who suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder]]. The purpose of the sessions, which Mike becomes increasingly engrossed in, is to unveil what happened on Christmas night in Lowell, her hometown, twenty-two years before. One of her personalities, "the Princess", is childlike and innocent, knowing only the Christmas presents - a china doll for Mary and a knife for her brother, Peter - and that they played [[hide-and-seek]] after their parents went to bed. Another personality, "Billy", is both childlike and protective. He lives "in the eyes" and saw what happened, but refuses to let Mary find out. The doctor repeatedly asks about Simon, who he thinks is a third personality. "The Princess" knows nothing about Simon, while "Billy" fears him.  In the tunnels beneath the property, Hank finds a cache of antique [[Morgan dollar]] coins and other silver items, scattered from the [[crematory]] nearby. He returns that night to steal the artifacts and finds an [[orbitoclast]]. He hears odd sounds in the tunnels and discovers an empty peanut butter jar. He hears someone behind him and tries to escape the tunnels, but he is attacked by an unseen assailant. The next morning, the other four learn that Hank abruptly broke up with his girlfriend and left town; the four speculate about the possibility that Hank finally won some money in a lottery. Gordon, who frequently calls his wife and saw Phil speaking to two unknown men during one telephone call, suspects that Phil had something to do with Hank's disappearance, causing tension between the group.  At one point Gordon goes outside the building into the old garden, where several tombstones from patients who died during their stay at the asylum are located. As Gordon sits on a part of a tree trunk, he tries to call his wife again but is cut short by Jeff, who expresses gratitude for the job opportunity. Gordon later opens up to Phil and admits that he hit Wendy after she accidentally spilled a pot of boiling water on his leg; he has been trying to apologize over the phone ever since. His leg is badly blistering and hurting, but he continues the work.  Phil calls in another worker, Craig McManus, to assist with the job that is now behind schedule after Hank's disappearance.  Phil tells Mike that he thinks Gordon has become a liability and reveals to Mike that Gordon admitted to slapping his wife.  Jeff finds Hank alive, but strangely unresponsive to Jeff's questions about where he has been. Jeff runs to tell the others, but Hank disappears again when the group returns. They split up to find Hank, but instead of looking, Mike quickly returns to the session tapes which he now feels compelled to finish listening to. In the taped recordings "Billy" refuses to awaken Simon, admitting to the doctor only that Simon was behind whatever happened that night. During the search, Phil finds Hank in one of the tunnels, half-naked, wearing sunglasses and muttering to himself. The power goes out at that point, trapping Jeff in a pitch-black tunnel and also stopping the ninth session tape short. Mike restores the power and the ninth session continues with Simon, the same voice Gordon has been hearing since the job began, taking over.  Simon reveals that Peter scared Mary while they were playing and she fell on her doll, breaking it and badly cutting up her chest. Simon explains that at that moment he sensed Mary was weak and helpless so he "introduced" himself to her. Simon then told Mary to cut up Peter and her parents with the new knife, and she willingly complied with his instruction. The doctor asks Simon why, and Simon tells him "Because Mary let me, Doc." Simon then repeats "They always do," implying that he is not a mere personality, but rather an external entity that has influenced many people through time.  As the recording continues, Phil finds Gordon in Mary's former hospital room, staring at photos of his new daughters baptism stuck to the wall. A shaken Jeff flees to the van, where he also is attacked by an unseen assailant.  The next day, Craig arrives at the asylum. Gordon finds Hank, with the orbitoclast protruding from his eye, wrapped in plastic in one of the larger rooms. Phil also appears and tells Gordon to "wake up" when Gordon accuses Phil of being the one who attacked the others. As Craig finds them, it is shown that Phil's presence was in actually only Gordon's mind. Possessed by Simon's influence, Gordon enters a dissociative state and kills Craig with the orbitoclast after removing it from Hank's eye socket. It is revealed that Gordon, in the disassociated state, attacked Hank that night in the tunnels. Gordon is also shown killing Phil after being found in Mary's room before finding and killing Mike and Jeff. It is also revealed that Gordon did not just slap his wife, but killed her, the family dog, and their baby after the pot of boiling water was spilled on him. Gordon was encouraged by the laughing voice of Simon saying "Do it, Gordon," the same as the way he had done with Mary decades earlier.  Gordon finally breaks down and realizes he has killed his family and all his friends. He uses his cell phone, which is broken, to apologize to an already dead Wendy.  The film ends with a doctor asking, "And where do you live, Simon?" with Simon answering, "I live in the weak and the wounded, Doc," implying that those who are vulnerable can be compelled by his influence to commit acts of evil.

Shallow Hal
 Hal Larson ([[Jack Black]]) is a nice guy, but he has one flaw: he is a superficial man whose fixation on the physical beauty of women gets in the way of seeing their inner beauty. Hal and his equally shallow friend, Mauricio ([[Jason Alexander]]), spend their nights obnoxiously hitting on beautiful women at nightclubs and mostly they end up getting rejected. Hal's work life is steady, but he is dismayed after being passed over for a long-sought promotion. His love life is non-existent, as seen when he tries to ask Jill, his attractive neighbor, out for a date. Jill is not interested as she finds Hal too shallow and is not attracted to him.  Hal becomes trapped in an elevator with famous American life coach [[Tony Robbins]]. While waiting for the elevator to be fixed, Robbins sympathizes with Hal's disappointment but tries to figure out his ideas about women. He [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Hal into only seeing a person's inner beauty. Hal does not realize he's been hypnotized and later meets Rosemary ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), daughter of the president of the company where he is employed. Rosemary is [[morbidly obese]], but Hal sees a slender and beautiful [[trophy wife|trophy blonde]].  He is immediately smitten by her. His boss is not certain about Hal dating his daughter, thinking that Hal may be trying to climb to the top of the corporate ladder. Used to being overlooked due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal's interest as mocking, but begins to realize his feelings for her are sincere. After apologizing to him, they begin to date, which includes a bike ride with Walt ([[Rene Kirby]]).   Mauricio, worried about Hal's new taste in women, convinces Robbins to give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis, which is "Shallow Hal wants a gal". While on a date in a restaurant, Rosemary tells Hal she's been asked by the Peace Corps to go on a 14-month mission in [[Kiribati]]. Mauricio phones Hal and says the trigger phrase, breaking Hal's hypnosis. Mauricio confesses to Hal the truth about Robbins' [[hypnotherapy]], but Hal does not believe it until he runs into a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him but whom Hal now sees in her true, physically unattractive state.  Hal begins to avoid Rosemary, who becomes melancholic without him around. Distraught that he was not seeing the "real" Rosemary, Hal accepts a dinner invitation from his neighbor, Jill. The two dine together and Jill tells Hal that she has observed him overcoming his shallow nature and is interested in dating him now.  Hal realizes his true feelings for Rosemary who has, coincidentally, arrived at the same restaurant with her family and sees Hal and Jill sitting together. Assuming the worst, Rosemary leaves in tears. Not recognizing Rosemary, Hal walks right by her on his way to a payphone to reassure her of his feelings. Confused and distraught, Rosemary calls Hal a "psycho" over the phone and effectively breaks up with him.  Five days later, Steve informs Hal that Rosemary’s [[Peace Corps]] partner, Ralph, wants to be in a relationship with her again. Hal attempts to find Rosemary, but instead encounters a young patient named Cadence at the hospital where Rosemary volunteers. Previously, due to Robbins' hypnosis, Hal saw Cadence as a perfect little girl; he now sees that there are severe burns all over Cadence's face. Inspired by Cadence, Hal changes his views on the physical appearances of people in general.  Hal, during his search for Rosemary, finds that Mauricio had his own reason for stopping Hal's hypnosis: He has an inoperable [[vestigial tail]], which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman. Mauricio confesses he was jealous of Hal's happiness and is afraid to start a relationship with a woman. Hal convinces Mauricio to accept his abnormality, with confidence.  Hal makes up with Mauricio and decides to reconcile with Rosemary. He heads to the Peace Corps recruiting office and confronts Ralph, believing he and Rosemary got back together. Ralph informs Hal that he and Rosemary are not together and that Rosemary's parents are throwing her a farewell party (and Ralph wasn't invited). Hal, Mauricio, Ralph and Ralph's friend Li’iBoy arrive at the home of Rosemary's parents. Rosemary initially rebuffs Hal's presence, but then accepts his apology when Hal professes his love for her. Rosemary informs Hal she is still leaving on her Peace Corps mission. Hal says he is coming, too, having just been sworn into the Peace Corps by Li’iBoy.  Hal and Rosemary reconcile, cheered by the crowd as they kiss. He tries to carry her bridal-style to the car, but finds he cannot lift her, so she triumphantly carries him instead. As they drive off, Mauricio meets a woman who loves dogs and the two walk off together as he wags his "tail".  
Sex and Lucia
 Lucía ([[Paz Vega]]), a waitress, is talking on the phone with her depressed writer boyfriend Lorenzo ([[Tristán Ulloa]]) after they had a nasty argument, where, afterward, she walked out. Since he has been in a 'funk' for a while, she's worried and goes home to console him. Finding an empty apartment, Lucía is frantic. She receives a phone call from the police while finding a suicide note, and is so afraid of bad news that she hangs up, assuming the worst. They call back, but she ignores the ringing phone, packs a bag, and flees. Looking for a new beginning, Lucía travels to the mysterious [[Balearic Islands]] that Lorenzo had always talked of, but had recently been very negative about.  Six years earlier: Lorenzo is having casual sex in the ocean, on a bright moon-lit night, with a beautiful married woman he just met named Elena. They part ways, expecting to never see each other again. She discovers she is pregnant with his child, and attempts to find him, but, not knowing much about him, is unable to.  Later, as Lorenzo talks with his literary agent at a restaurant, discussing his [[writer's block]], Lucía catches his attention as he gets up from his table to get cigarettes. She asks to speak to him and he joins her. She brazenly tells him that ever since she read his latest book, she has been following him and has fallen passionately in love with him. A smitten Lorenzo immediately engages the sexy, passionate Lucía and she moves into Lorenzo's apartment.  The film then interweaves the past and present, of the characters in the film, and the characters in Lorenzo's novel.  Lorenzo repeatedly stalls for time on his new book with his editor, while his relationship with Lucía deepens. About six years pass. Lorenzo learns he has a daughter as a result of his encounter with Elena and begins to visit the child at her school, meeting her babysitter Belén. Belén tells Lorenzo her mother is a recently retired [[pornography|porn]] actress with a new hot boyfriend, and virtually seduces Lorenzo with chatter of sexual context and banter about her fantasies. Lorenzo uses these encounters and his fantasies about Belén and her mother as content for his book, and Lucía reads about it, thinking it fiction. Meanwhile, he does not disclose his fatherhood to Lucía or the child, nor even attempt to contact Elena.  Belén flirts with Lorenzo and eventually invites him over to Elena's house while she babysits his daughter, Luna. Lorenzo tells Luna a bedtime story, and after she falls asleep, he and Belén begin to have sex. They are interrupted as Luna knocks at the bedroom door, and they watch in horror as the family dog, a large [[Rotweiler]] in 'protect mode' kills Luna. Belén is stunned. Lorenzo runs away and falls into a deep depression.  Lorenzo's writing turns dark, towards depraved sex and death. He anonymously contacts Elena, who has moved to the island to find solace and recall better days, and provides her a nice story about a beautiful child that loves to swim in the sea, to cheer her spirits. But his now guilt-ridden and uncommunicative relationship with Lucía begins to collapse.  Back in the present, Lucía meets a [[Scuba diving|scuba diver]] on the island, Carlos, and through him, Elena, who runs an inn on the island. Lucía rents a room, and the women bond as friends, not knowing their intimate connection. But when Lucía mentions Lorenzo by name, and his past visit to the island long ago, Elena deduces the connection. Lucía sees a picture of Luna (looking remarkably like her father and remembering the name from Lorenzo's novel) and she makes the connection too.  Lorenzo's editor visits Lorenzo in the hospital, where he was taken after being in an 'accident', spending several weeks in recovery. When Lorenzo asks about Lucía, the editor tells Lorenzo he thinks Lucía thinks he is dead. Lorenzo guesses Lucía is on the island and has the editor take him there. After both women discover that Lorenzo isn't dead, the three characters cope with and finally understand the entanglements of their interwoven relationships.

They end up meeting Team Evil in the final, owned by none other than Hung. Team Evil had been injected with an American [[doping (sports)|drug]], granting them [[superhuman strength]] and speed, making them practically invincible, and they bring Team Shaolin back to reality when Team Evil's amazing capabilities prove more than a match for them. After Team Evil takes out Team Shaolin's goalkeepers, Mui, who has shaved her hair and improved her face, reappears to keep goal for Team Shaolin.  In their final attack, Team Evil's [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] leaps into the sky and kick the ball with enormous force towards Mui; she uses her martial art to divert and stop it, thus preventing a goal. Mui and Sing combine their martial skills and rocket the ball downfield. The ball plows through Team Evil's goal post, thereby scoring the winning goal. Sing is then thrown into the air in celebration as the trophy is presented to him and his team.  A newspaper article then shows Hung being stripped of his title of soccer chairman and sent to jail for five years, while Team Evil players are permanently banned from playing soccer professionally. Sing goes out for a morning walk and feels happy to see people practicing Kung Fu. The camera pans to the poster of Sing and Mui who have married and become famous.

Shaapa
 ''Shaapa'' is a poignant story of a man (Ramesh as Shekhar) emotionally abused during this childhood by his father and how he struggles to fight his inner demons through his adult life. The story is juxtaposed on the backdrop of the Cauvery river water dispute between [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] states.  Ramesh plays Shekhar, a man afflicted by his childhood memories of being emotionally abused by his father (played by Jai Jagdish). Often during his childhood, Shekhar was pointed out to be the reason for anything that went wrong with their family. Years after his father's death, he continues to hear his father's voice in his head that keeps telling him that he's useless and that he'd never achieve anything in his life and that he'd be a failure. To add to it, the memories of his step-mother (whom he is shown to love a lot but who dies) keep telling him that whatever he tries to beget in life, will be lost.  Shekhar is shown to free sheep from the butcher's each day by paying for the sheep, so it can remain alive, much to the amusement of the butcher.  Enter Kaveri (Anu Prabhakar), a doctor who believes in working for social causes like widow remarriage. They get on very well. She also teaches him to play the flute (which he was keen to learn in his childhood but was discouraged by his father). He also takes her to his widowed sister so Kaveri can convince her to remarry someone. Over the entire period of their acquaintance, Shekhar can never bring himself to let Kaveri know that he's in love with her for the fear that he might lose her just as he lost his beloved step-mother.  At one point, Kaveri has to leave for Bengaluru and she shares her feelings in a letter that she gives him. The packet also contains a flute which Ramesh notices, but he doesn't notice the letter.  The "father's voice in the head" begins to haunt him even more and he decides to consult a psychiatrist (played by Avinash), who offers him advice on how to overcome his situation. 4 years later, he meets Kaveri again and much to his pleasant surprise he gets to know that she's still unmarried. He invites her to his place for dinner on a Diwali night. Kaveri is welcomed by Shekhar and the cook (played by K S Ashwath). After dinner, Shekhar proposes marriage to her in a creative way, only to realize that she's engaged to Ravi, a mechanical engineer from Chennai (played by B C Patil). Shekhar gets to know that Kaveri loved him too and gets to know about the letter that he missed. As Kaveri prepares to leave, Ravi comes to pick her up. The intended metaphor of 2 people (Ravi from Chennai and Shekhar from Karnataka) fighting for Kaveri and the Cauvery water dispute between the 2 states becomes more and more apparent from this point.  Shekhar is also in a bit of financial trouble because of dropping coffee prices (he owns a coffee export firm) and his bankers are keen to be repaid by him for the loan he obtained.  Kaveri gets married to Ravi, only to realize that he's only interested in money and doesn't really love her. He also tries to wean her away from her social services and persuades her to move to London with him so she can have a lucrative medical career there which she doesn't agree to initially. But subsequently she bows to his pressure and leaves for Chennai to get her Visa. On the way she meets Shekhar and tells him of her and Ravi's plans. Shekhar's determined not to lose her (he loves her and has to convince himself that he's not a loser). He abandons his errand midway and rushes back to his place with a plan to kill Ravi, buys a revolver and hides in a cupboard at  Ravi's home trying to shoot him. Caught between conflicting ideologies ("it's ok to kill if the reason is your survival" and "one should never harm anyone"), he manages to flee Ravi's place in the nick of time managing to evade Ravi's rifle.  He loses his company and all his property to the bank when his coffee godown is flooded by the river.  Shekhar is still determined not to let go of Kaveri (which is shown through a group of people protesting against the release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu). He takes the butcher's help (who is shown to have been an aide of an underworld don a few years ago) to kill Ravi and asks him not to leave behind any clue. The butcher is amused to see the change in ideology in Shekhar (he asks him "Why should I kill him?" to which Shekhar says "I have to live").  The butcher plants nails beneath the jeep at Ravi's house and enters to kill him. Meanwhile, Kaveri has got the visa, but she decides that going to London is something that she'd rather not do, goes to Shekhar's place and tells him of her plan. She says that she'll head back to her home and tell Ravi all about it. Shekhar tells her not to go to her home that night (knowing that the butcher is out to kill Ravi that night). She doesn't heed him.  At Ravi's place, there is a scuffle between the butcher and Ravi. Ravi is killed and as he's making his getaway, he's caught at the doorstep by Kaveri, whom the butcher promptly shoots down. At that moment Shekhar enters, aghast that Kaveri is dying, shoots the butcher down and tries to rush her to a hospital. With the punctured wheels on the vehicle, he's not able to and she dies en route.  The last scene shows him spending 14 years in the jail for murder. Upon release he is shown jumping into the Cauvery river to commit suicide, and a symbolic uniting with Kaveri is shown.

She Creature
 Circa 1900, in [[Ireland]], two [[Carny|carnies]], Angus Shaw ([[Rufus Sewell]]) and his wife Lillian "Lily" ([[Carla Gugino]]), encounter a Mr. Woolrich ([[Aubrey Morris]]) during one of their shows. Having heard that a [[mermaid]] will be on show, he is relieved to find that it is just Lily impersonating one. They offer him a ride home, where he shows them documented sightings of mer-people throughout history including a map of their home, the Forbidden Islands, and that they can take human form during the full moon. He then reveals to them an actual mermaid ([[Rya Kihlstedt]]), whom he captured back in his admiral days, and explains how she killed his wife. Naturally Angus and Lily are astonished. Sensing Angus's desire to use her as a [[Freak show|freak show attraction]], Woolrich warns him against it.  Unbeknownst to Lily, Angus and his colleagues Bailey ([[Reno Wilson]]) and Gifford ([[Mark Aiken]]) break into Woolrich's home during the night but are caught. During the scuffle, Woolrich suddenly dies of a heart attack, allowing Angus and the crew to abduct the mermaid and smuggle her aboard their ship.  Lily is less than thrilled about this idea, despite her husband's attempts to persuade her it's for the best. However, during the voyage to America, the mermaid seems to take a liking to her.  One night, Lily is cornered by a drunken Miles, one of the crew members, who reveals that they have bad history together. When she returns to her cabin, he goes missing and the mermaid is found somehow tangled in the crew's nets. As she is returned to her tank, she spits out Miles' ring, prompting Lily to realise that she ate him as a favour to her. She attempts to explain this to Angus but he dismisses it, but he admits that they did abduct her rather than buy her from Woolrich and that [[Accidental death|they didn't mean to kill him]].  Lily later seemingly becomes possessed by the mermaid, who tries to kill Angus while they are making love; luckily, Lily is able to come to her senses. Worried that the mermaid will do further harm, Lily attempts to free her, but she is caught by Bailey, who then is devoured by the mermaid. Lily tries to explain herself but Angus accuses her of being unstable and locks her in their room. After he leaves, Lily realises she is pregnant, much to her horror, as she is supposed to be barren. She then reads the late Mrs. Woolrich's diary, which confirms her worry that the mermaid grants fertility by possessing women during sex. She manages to escape and encounters the terrified mermaid, now in her human form due to the full moon. Lily comforts her, but they are caught by the crew. Lily tries to tell them to leave her alone but she passes out. When she comes to, she tries to explain to a concerned Angus that she is pregnant, but he dismisses this as a symptom of her sickness.  Meanwhile, the crew angrily harass the mermaid before Angus intervenes. He and Gifford discuss the situation with the captain, who fearfully confesses that the mermaid made him do things against his will. Then he commits suicide. A storm begins to close in on them, and they gradually approach the mermaid's home, The Forbidden Islands, prompting the crew to realise that their captive had taken control of the ship and led them off course. While sharing a moment with Lily, the mermaid then reveals her true monstrous form as the Queen of the Lair and her intention to feed the crew to her people. The crew try to fight her off but are killed one by one, save for Lily, who is spared.   Lily is rescued by the crew of a passing ship a fortnight later. They question her about what happened but she refuses to say anything, honouring the Queen with silence. The film ends by showing Lily and her daughter, whose eyes resemble those of the mermaid.  
The Shipping News (film)
  The film opens with Quoyle's father tossing him into water, expecting him to naturally swim. The image of Quoyle struggling to swim is reprised several times in later crises.  Flash forward to an adult Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), who lives a lonely life and works as an inksetter in a small newspaper in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]. He becomes infatuated with a vivacious local woman named Petal (Cate Blanchett), marrying her and having a daughter they name Bunny. Six years later, the emotionally distant and promiscuous Petal runs off with a lover and Bunny, only to die soon after in a car accident. Bunny is returned by the police to Quoyle, who tell him that Petal had sold their daughter off for US$6,000 to an illegal adoption agency. Only days before Quoyle had received the news that his ailing parents killed one another in a [[suicide pact]]. After collecting their ashes, Quoyle's aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) arrives wishing to pay her respects to her brother. Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in [[Newfoundland]], which has been abandoned for 44 years. Realizing that Quoyle is at a total loss through grief, she first offers to stay a few more days and help him through the crisis, and then persuades him to move with her.  While struggling to rebuild his life, fix up the derelict house, and care for his daughter, Quoyle meets local resident Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a widow who has a pre-teen boy with a [[learning disability]]. Wavey's son and Quoyle's daughter become friends, while the two adults become friends, and then more. Wavey has dark secrets in her past, but so does the Quoyle family.  To support himself and his daughter, Quoyle takes a job at the local newspaper ''Gammy Bird'' as the "Shipping News" correspondent, covering shipping traffic in town, as well as local car crashes. With no experience in journalism, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles and incurs the dislike of the newspaper's second in command, Tert Card (Pete Postlethwaite). An article Quoyle writes about a millionaire's yacht docked in town, however, becomes a great success with readers, and the ''Gammy Bird'' editor Jack Buggit is so impressed that he commissions him to write a series of articles profiling boats and the personal history of their owners.  The story climaxes with a storm that destroys the Quoyle home, and Jack, caught in the rope of a lobster pot while fishing, is believed drowned. His body is recovered, appears to be dead, but is actually in a deep state of shock resulting from [[hypothermia]]. During his wake, at his home in front of mourners, he regains consciousness.

A proud mother gloats at her son's brilliant and swift bloody justice as he is led off to the notorious Macch Jail bellowing loudly that her son is to be known hence not as Ali Sher but as 'The Sher-e-Lahore' to which her son growls his approval while swaggering off.

Sidewalks of New York (2001 film)

At a video store Tommy meets grammar school teacher Maria Tedesko. The two flirt, meet for coffee, and begin to date. Maria, recently divorced, finds it difficult to commit to a new relationship and stops taking Tommy's calls. When she discovers she's pregnant, she attempts to reconnect with him, but at the last moment opts to lie and tell him she's leaving town and chooses to raise the child on her own.

Ashley is involved in an affair with considerably older married dentist Griffin Ritso. Although he professes to love his mistress, the once divorced Griffin shies away from leaving his wife Annie Matthews for fear of being a two-time loser at matrimony. Eventually Griffin's inability to commit to their relationship causes Ashley to dump him and reject his advances to get her back as she becomes involved in a relationship with Benjamin.

Shrek
  [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], a green [[ogre]] who loves the solitude in his swamp, finds his life interrupted when countless fairytale characters are exiled there by the fairytale-hating and vertically challenged [[Lord Farquaad]] of Duloc. Angry, Shrek decides to ask Farquaad to exile them elsewhere. He brings along a talking [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], who is the only fairytale creature willing to guide him to Duloc.  Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures the [[List of Shrek characters#The Gingerbread Man|Gingerbread Man]] for the location of the remaining fairytale creatures. His guards rush in with something he has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. He asks The Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king. To be a king he must marry a princess, so Farquaad resolves to marry [[Princess Fiona]], who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. He organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the "privilege" of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.  Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and split up to find Fiona. They are noticed by the [[Dragon (Shrek)|dragon]], who corners Donkey. In desperation he sweet-talks the beast, learning that it is female. Dragon falls in love with Donkey and carries him to her chambers. Meanwhile, Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and surprised he hadn't slain Dragon. As they leave, Shrek saves Donkey from Dragon, who is heartbroken as a result. At first, Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. She demands that Farquaad come to get her himself, but Shrek forcibly carries her with him and Donkey. The three then have several adventures on their way to Duloc, such as an encounter with [[List of Shrek characters#"Monsieur" Robin Hood|Robin Hood]] wherein Fiona reveals that she is an expert martial artist. Shrek and Fiona find they have a lot in common and fall in love. However, Fiona persistently insists on sleeping alone at night.  One night, when the trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona shelters in a windmill. Donkey hears strange noises from within and investigates, finding Fiona transformed into an ogre. She explains that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, which is why she was locked away, and that only her true love's kiss will return her to her "love's true form". Meanwhile, Shrek, about to confess his feelings for Fiona, partly overhears them, and is heartbroken as he mistakes her disgust with her transformation to an "ugly beast" as disgust with him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her curse, but dawn breaks before she can, and she turns back into a human. She finds that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill during the night. Fiona accepts Farquaad's proposal, requesting that they be married before night falls. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt and angry Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.  Furious at Shrek, Donkey goes to the swamp where Shrek says he overheard Donkey and Fiona's conversation. Donkey tells Shrek that she was talking about someone else, and urges Shrek to talk to Fiona before she is married. They travel to Duloc quickly, thanks to Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.  Shrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona. He tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogre in front of everyone in the church, causing a surprised Shrek to fully understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon bursts in alongside Donkey and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss; Fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised that she is still an ogre, as she thought she would become beautiful, to which Shrek replies that she is still beautiful on the inside. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon while Donkey and the fairytale creatures celebrate by singing "[[I'm a Believer]]".

Slayers Premium
 Lina and Gourry travel to the town of Acassi, known for its tasty octopus. However, the octopus meat is cursed, causing the person who eats it to only be able to speak takogo (タコ語, octopus language). Sorcerers and sorceresses cursed by this also cannot cast spells, since the spells have to be spoken in a common language in order for them to work.  Gourry just happens to eat one of the cursed octopuses (after fighting for it with Lina), which causes him to speak in takogo. This often creates awkward situations during the film (the phrase "how horrible" being spoken as "flat chested", which offends Lina greatly). But soon, everyone in town starts to speak takogo (including Amelia and Zelgadis, who had just arrived in town), despite the fact that they have not eaten any octopus. Xellos is also there, seeming to know some details about what is going on but is not divulging anything.  It soon becomes evident that the octopuses plan to use the accumulated anger from the villagers of Acassi to release a demon that was sealed many years before. Lina and her friends have to stop these plans before they come to fruition. However, it becomes complicated when Lina is infected with the takogo affliction, which negates much of her magic, including the Dragon Slave, her signature move.

Slashers (film)
  The latest craze is ''$la$her$'', a Japanese [[blood sport]] [[game show]] where contestants can win millions of dollars if they survive being hunted through various arenas by costumed killers. All crimes are legal on the sets of the show, and what few rules there are (like having to remain motionless during commercials) are enforced by [[shock collar]]s that the players and murderers must wear. The latest episode of ''$la$her$'' is an all-American special in which the six contestants (Megan, Devon, Michael, Rick, Rebecca, and Brenda) will be pursued by "[[newbie]]" slasher Preacherman, and returning fan favorites Chainsaw Charlie, and Doctor Ripper.  A few minutes into the game, the contestants are scattered, with the single cameraman, Hideo, following Megan and Rebecca. The women are attacked by Preacherman, but Rebecca stabs him in the eye with a makeshift wooden stake. The victory is short-lived, as Charlie and Ripper appear, cut Rebecca in half at the waist, and terrorize Megan, who only volunteered to be on the show to protest it.  Megan rejoins the others (with the exception of Devon) and together they reach the Bridge of Death, which is situated above a pit of spikes. The group is confronted by Charlie, just as a commercial occurs. During the break, Rick reveals he plans to save the others by throwing himself and Charlie off the bridge, which causes Charlie to panic, and agree to let Rick pass. When the show returns to the air, Rick reneges on the deal, jumping off the bridge, and dragging Charlie down with him, leaving only Doctor Ripper.  In the next zone, Brenda is beheaded by Ripper, and Megan and Michael are chased to the Love Room, an area where players will be left alone if they have sex. When Megan rebuffs his advances, Michael tries to rape her, but is scared off by Devon, his screams subsequently emanating from the room he enters. Devon (who is separated from Megan) finds Michael's body, and is attacked by Ripper, who he stabs in the ear with a stake. Michael (who had faked his death) then kills Devon, takes Ripper's gear, and goes after Megan.  As he pursues Megan, Michael reveals that he is in fact a [[serial killer]], and that he only wanted to be on ''$la$her$'' so he could die a spectacular death, though now that he has a chance of winning the game, he is going to take it. Michaels catches up to Megan just as another commercial airs, and during the down time he brags about his history as the Bible Doll Killer, content that the rules of ''$la$her$'' make his declarations inadmissible in court. Megan turns the tables on Michael, stating that while what he says during the live broadcast cannot be used against him, the footage recorded by the always rolling camera while they are off the air can be used as evidence.  The break ends, and Michael lunges at Megan, but is shoved away by Hideo. Distraught, Michael goes ahead with his original plan of dying on live television, and commits suicide by decapitating himself. Hideo mocks the dead Michael, asserting that Megan was bluffing, and catches up with Megan. When asked why he stopped Michael, Hideo says that while he is fine with whoever is stupid enough to volunteer to be on the show dying on it, he could not stand the thought of "that sick maniac" being back out on the streets, several million dollars richer.  Megan rants at the staff of ''$la$her$'', threatens to use all her winnings to try and bring them down, and tells Hideo (who has asked for money, since he will probably be fired for helping her) that she will pay him if he turns the camera off. As the credits roll, the sponsors of ''$la$her$'' are shown to be the cigarette companies Black Lung, Coffin Nails, and Cancer Man.

He prefers a new cow. Jane says that until recently, she believed that men are all like the bull, but to understand what happened we have to go back in time. Jane is a production assistant with a talk show that has recently been syndicated, which means that the host Diane Roberts (Ellen Barkin) who wants to be the best, is always looking for the ungettable guests, like Fidel Castro. Eddie Alden (Hugh Jackman) is the producer of the talk show and is a womanizer, much to the dismay of Jane who comments on his actions with amicable critique.  Eddie is looking for a roommate, but his messages on the bulletin board are sabotaged by disgruntled exes. He wonders whether Jane would like to move in, but she turns him down with a vengeance. Then they meet the new producer of the show, Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear), and Jane is immediately smitten. She tells her friend Liz (Marisa Tomei) and discusses her bad luck with men. Meanwhile, her sister is trying to get pregnant with a fertility program. Ray calls Jane and they spend an evening together and end up kissing. The next morning she calls Liz and is ecstatic. Liz gives her some advice as to how to deal with Ray and his girlfriend Dee (with whom he has trouble). Ray and Jane seem to be very much in love.  The relationship evolves, and they decide to move in together. Jane puts in her notice; Ray goes to tell his girlfriend that it is over, but doesn't tell her about the new woman in his life. Ray starts to get distant while Jane is packing to move over, and over dinner he breaks it off, leaving Jane in tears. The next morning in the office Jane takes her revenge by announcing to move in with Eddie. She learns to deal with the many women in Eddie's life. The two bond over scotch and leftover Asian food. She reads an article about the old cow syndrome and starts researching for her theory of men. Liz works at a magazine for men and needs a columnist and persuades Jane to write a column about her theory, under the pen name Dr. Marie Charles.  The column that deals with the insecurity and dishonesty of men is a big hit. Everybody wants to meet Dr. Charles, so does Diane. At a Christmas party, Ray tells her he misses her and asks her out for New Year's Eve, but he stands her up. When Jane shows up at a party looking for Eddie at midnight, she can't find him and leaves in tears. Eddie tries to go after her but can't find her. Back at the office, Ray tries to apologize, but Diane interrupts wearing a shirt Jane bought for Ray. Jane realizes she is "Dee," and Ray is back with her. A board meeting is going to start and Eddie makes sure Jane isn't crying going in, but Jane is distracted so he covers for her. When Ray shows emotion over a Gérard Depardieu movie, Jane spills her guts over his inability to show empathy for her broken heart. Diane, unaware of Jane's relationship with Ray, gives her advice on how to win her boyfriend back, telling her how she got hers back.  At a bar, Liz follows Dr. Charles's advice and is not going to fall for the same kind of guy anymore. Jane and Eddie get into an argument over the advice of Dr. Charles, back home she tells him she has to believe the theory because otherwise she is afraid that men don't leave women - they leave her. Eddie comforts her by saying Ray is not the last man she'll ever love, and they fall asleep together. The next morning Eddie wakes up happy and comfortable while Jane freaks out. Eddie tells her not to analyze this too. He is happy that he slept the whole night with her without it leading to sex. She tells Eddie he will show his true colours and will hurt her some time soon. Eddie tells her it is not about him, but it is her attitude that is the problem. Jane gets a call and it is her brother-in-law telling her that her sister suffered a miscarriage. At the hospital she sees the true love between them and decides to tell Diane that Dr. Charles is going to be on her show.  The interview is meant to be over the telephone, but Jane changes her mind and goes on the stage. She tells the audience that there is no Dr. Charles (we see Eddie leave at this point) and that the theory is ridiculous because she was hurt and needed to blame men for her pain. By this time Eddie is long gone. Jane goes after Eddie and tells him she found new love. He doesn't answer but kisses her with passion, with the dulcet tones of Van Morrison's "Someone like You" playing in the background.

Giovanni and Andrea make plans to go [[jogging]] together, but Giovanni is called to the distant home of a patient, distressed about a possible cancer diagnosis. Instead, Andrea goes [[scuba diving]] with a friend, and swims into an underwater cave where he accidentally drowns. Giovanni, Paola and their daughter Irene are left to mourn.

Snow White: The Fairest of Them All
 John and Josephine deeply wish to have a child and when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a creature known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John 3 wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter; a kingdom to raise his family; and a queen for a new wife as the creature cannot raise the dead.  John's wishes come true, though he is unaware that the Green-Eyed One owes Elspeth (his hideous spellcasting sister) a wish of her own. In order to fulfill her ambitions, the Green-Eyed One transforms Elspeth into a beautiful young woman who can now marry John and become his queen, second and new wife and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband and stepdaughter (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest of them all whenever she asks.  When Prince Alfred arrives in the kingdom and falls in love with Snow White, Elspeth is furious to discover that images of Snow White are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is the fairest of them all. Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders Hector (a hunter) to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill Snow White, Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors and stifles Snow White with an enchanted ribbon.  Snow White is saved by 7 dwarfs, each named after the days of the week and possessing the power to transform into a rainbow to move from one place to another (but are only capable if all 7 dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Snow White's deceased mother, Josephine, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth (disguised as Josephine) finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.  With her task finished, Elspeth tries to resume her beautiful guise with the mirror. But instead, the magic mirror returns her to her true form, even more loathsome than before as punishment from the Green-Eyed One for killing her stepdaughter. Meanwhile, the dwarfs (unable to save Snow White) place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue. When she receives a kiss of true love from Prince Alfred (in his bear form) she is revived. The spells on Alfred, Sunday and Monday break and Elspeth's mirrors shatter, freeing John. Elspeth gets cornered, tackled and killed by the gnomes, who have been freed from their enchantments. Freed from Elspeth, the Green-Eyed One is able to go his way. Snow White and Alfred live happily ever after while the dwarfs decide to move on to find Sleeping Beauty.

Soul Survivors
 Cassie and Sean, as well as ex-boyfriend Matt and good friend Annabel, go to a club situated in an old church. There Cassie sees a man with a clear, plastic mask ([[Carl Paoli]]) and an imposing man with a scarred face ([[Ken Moreno]]). Deathmask tries to grab her on the dance floor, but she pushes him away and steps outside the club with Sean.  In the parking lot, Matt eavesdrops on their conversation. Sean confesses his love for Cassie, who claims she feels the same way. When Sean returns to the club, Matt convinces Cassie to give him a last 'goodbye' kiss. Sean sees this, and reacts badly to it, giving Cassie the silent treatment as they drive off. Cassie, who is behind the wheel, continually looks away from the road until the car crashes. Cassie's next memory is of being rushed to the hospital; Matt and Annabel are unharmed, but Sean has been killed on impact.  During the school term that follows, Cassie has several visions of Sean. She also has visions of Deathmask and Hideous Dancer in the company of Matt and Annabel. On several occasions, she believes she is being chased by the two men, although Annabel and Matt assure her that the incidents are all in her mind. After one chase, Cassie faints and is rescued by Father Jude, a young priest who is sympathetic to her fears and offers to listen if she ever needs someone to talk to.  A few nights later, after being chased again, Cassie knocks at the church door, and Father Jude gives her sanctuary. He gives her an amulet depicting [[St Jude]] and allows her to sleep in his small room in the church. Upon awakening that morning, Cassie sees that the calendar in the room reads 1981. She enters the office of the attending priest ([[rick snyder ty|Rick Snyder]]) and asks to speak to Father Jude but is told that Father Jude died in 1981.  After a swim competition in which she has been made to participate, Cassie is chased by Deathmask. Defending herself with the tube of a fluorescent lamp, she ends up stabbing him in the stomach but when Cassie returns with Matt, they find there is no body in the pool. Even though she believes that Matt and Annabel are conspiring against her with Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, Cassie requests that Matt take her home to her mother. Instead he drives Cassie to the club, saying that he wishes to pick up Annabel. Cassie follows him but gets lost, eventually finding Annabel with a new lover called Raven ([[Angela Featherstone]]). When Raven tells Cassie to "leave or die" Cassie exits the club and makes her way back to the parking lot. There Matt drunkenly insists on another 'goodbye forever' kiss, but Cassie smashes a bottle on his head knocking him unconscious before pushing him from the car and driving away.  In a scene resembling the original accident, Cassie wrecks the car. She again comes to in the hospital. On a gurney next to her is Raven, who speaks a few words of comfort before dying. Father Jude arrives and asks if she would be willing to die in order to save Sean's life. She agrees and he then asks her if she would be willing to live for him. Cassie says that she doesn't want to die.  An episode follows in which Deathmask and Hideous Dancer strangle her with her protective medallion, from which Cassie wakes to find that everything she has experienced has been a sort of coma-dream: in the original accident, Cassie and Sean had survived, while Matt and Annabel were killed. The occupants of the other car — Raven, Deathmask, and Hideous Dancer — were also fatally injured. Cassie has spent the course of the film in an astral state, wherein those who were killed in the accident attempt to keep her with them. Father Jude, and Cassie's visions of Sean were what brought her back to life.

Spirited Away
  Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father takes a wrong turn. They unknowingly enter a magical world that Chihiro's father insists on exploring. While Chihiro's parents begin to devour the food at an empty restaurant stall, Chihiro finds an exquisite [[Sentō|bathhouse]] and meets a young boy named Haku who warns her to return across the river before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have turned into pigs and she is unable to cross the flooded river, becoming trapped in the spirit world.  Haku finds Chihiro and has her ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a [[yōkai]] commanding the [[susuwatari]]. Kamaji refuses work for her and asks the worker Lin to send Chihiro to the witch, Yubaba, who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, so Yubaba gives Chihiro a contract to work for her. Yubaba takes her name and renames her . While visiting her parents' pigpen, Sen finds a goodbye card addressed to Chihiro and realizes that she has already forgotten her name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will not be able to leave the spirit world.  Sen faces discrimination from the other workers, and while working, she invites a silent masked creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. A 'stink spirit' arrives as Sen's first customer. She discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic [[vomiting#emetics|emetic]] [[dumpling]]. Meanwhile, No-Face tempts a worker with gold, then swallows him. He demands food and begins [[gratuity|tip]]ping extensively. As the workers swarm him, hoping to be tipped, he swallows two other greedy workers.  Sen discovers paper [[shikigami]] attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously-injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back transforms into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son, Boh, into a mouse, creates a decoy baby and turns Yubaba's bird creature into a tiny bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku falls into the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, where Sen feeds him part of the dumpling which she intended to save her parents with, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.  With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize for Haku. Sen confronts No-Face, who is now massive, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face chases Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba. Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing, and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.  Sen, No-Face and Boh meet with the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba’s home in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face decides to stay behind and becomes Zeniba's [[Spinning (textiles)|spinner]]. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus revealing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly walk back to their car, which is now covered in dust and leaves. Before getting in, Chihiro takes a last look back.  
Spy Game
 In 1991, the governments of the U.S. and China are on the verge of a major trade agreement, with the President due to visit China to seal the deal. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] learns that its asset Tom Bishop has been captured trying to free a Briton, Elizabeth Hadley, from a [[People's Liberation Army]] prison in [[Suzhou]]. Bishop is being questioned under torture and will be executed in 24 hours unless the U.S. government claims him. If the CIA claims Bishop as an agent, they risk jeopardizing the trade agreement. Exacerbating Bishop's situation is the fact that he was operating without permission from the Agency.  Attempting to deal quickly with the situation, CIA executives call in Nathan Muir, an aging mid-level case officer on his last day before retirement and the man who recruited Bishop. Although they tell Muir they simply need him to act as a "stop gap" to fill in some holes in their background files, the officials are hoping he will give them the pretext they need to justify letting Bishop die. The CIA executives are unaware that Muir had been tipped off about Bishop's capture prior to arriving at CIA headquarters by fellow CIA veteran Harry Duncan, for whom Bishop had been working an operation in [[Hong Kong]]. Muir first attempts to save Bishop by leaking the story to [[CNN]] through a contact in Hong Kong, believing that public pressure would force the CIA to rescue Bishop. The tactic only stalls them, however, and is stymied when a phone call to the FCC from CIA Deputy Director Charles Harker results in CNN retracting the story.  During the debriefing, Muir describes how he recruited Bishop for an operation when Bishop was a [[Scout Sniper]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Muir also discusses their 1976 tour of duty in Berlin, where Bishop was tasked with procuring assets in [[East Germany]], as well as Bishop's spy work in Beirut in 1985 during the [[War of the Camps]], the latter being the last time the two saw each other. During the mission in Lebanon, Bishop met Hadley, and the two began developing romantic feelings. However, it is revealed that Hadley was involved in a bombing of the Chinese embassy in Britain, causing her to flee the country. Fearing that Bishop's feelings for Hadley might compromise his cover and the mission, Muir tips off the Chinese to Hadley's location in return for freeing an arrested U.S. diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and Bishop cuts all ties to Muir when he discovers his involvement. After learning Hadley was the target of Bishop's rescue attempt, Muir finally realizes that he has greatly underestimated Bishop's feelings for her.  Running out of time, Muir secretly creates a forged urgent operational directive from the CIA director to commence Operation Dinner Out, a rescue mission to be spearheaded by Commander Wiley's [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] team, for which Bishop had laid the groundwork as a "Plan B" for his own rescue attempt. Using $282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists Duncan's help in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which time the SEAL rescue team retrieves Bishop and Hadley.  Bishop, who is rescued 15 minutes before his scheduled execution, realizes Muir was behind his rescue when he recognizes the name of the plan to rescue him, Operation Dinner Out: a reference to a birthday gift that Bishop gave Muir while they were in Lebanon. When the CIA officials are belatedly informed of the rescue, Muir has already left the building and is seen driving off into the countryside.

Later that year, Eads makes his last appearance at the [[Southern Comfort Conference]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], a prominent<ref>{{Cite book   | last = Erhardt   | first = Virginia   | authorlink =    | title = Head over heels: wives who stay with cross-dressers and transsexuals   | publisher = Haworth Press   | date = 2007   | location =    | page = 11   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8ycEAQAAIAAJ&q=%22southern+comfort+conference%22&dq=%22southern+comfort+conference%22&lr=&client=firefox-a   | doi =    | id =    | isbn = 978-0-7890-3094-8}}</ref> [[transgender]] gathering. Already feeling ill, he addresses a crowd of 500 and takes Lola to what is for them a [[prom]] that never was. Shortly after the conference, Eads dies in a nursing home with his chosen family.  After Eads' death, his [[cremation|ashes]] were spread across the family farm around a lone Christmas tree which was to symbolize Robert's many changes and blossomings in life.  Eads' friends, Tom and Debbie King, also appear in the film. They saved Eads' life when he collapsed in a pool of his own blood while staying with them. They initially sought treatment for Eads but were unable to locate a doctor willing to treat a transgender man.  Robert's lifelong struggle to have his outer appearance match his inner self is a salient theme in the movie. All persons portrayed in the movie wrestle with themes of rejection from others, rejection of self, feeling ostracized from humanity and ultimately crafting their own lives and personal support systems.  
Stacy: Attack of the Schoolgirl Zombies
  In the near future, the entire world is struck with a bizarre malady which affects every girl between the ages of 14 and 16 years old.  Victims first experience a period of giddiness called "Near Death Happiness" ("NDH" or 臨死遊戯状態) before expiring.  Within minutes of death the victim rises again as a flesh-eating zombie—a "Stacy". These Stacies run amok until they are cut into pieces in an act called a "Repeat-Kill" (再殺).  The government has organized the poorly trained "Romero Repeat-Kill Troops," who ride around on garbage trucks, ordered to act out the disposal of the Stacies.  By law, a Stacy may only be Repeat-Killed by her loved ones or the Romero Repeat Kill Troops.  Through research, it is discovered that a key to the Stacy phenomenon is the "Butterfly Twinkle Powder" (BTP or 蝶羽状輝徽粉) that accumulates on the Stacies' skin.  
Star (2001 film)
 Murthy ([[Prashanth (actor)|Prashanth]]) earns his living taking the blame for the mistakes of other people, and so the jail is his second home. Dhanushkodi ([[Raghuvaran]]) has sworn to kill ex-collector Ramanathan's ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]) son Santhosh ([[Praveen Gandhi]]), and so, Ramanathan has transferred Santhosh to Mauritius while telling the world that he has run away. Wishing to save his son, he hires Murthy to act as his long lost son, hoping that Dhanushkodi would kill him instead of his actual son. Murthy too accepts the gig since his lover Preeti ([[Jyotika]]) is Ramanathan's niece. In the climax, Santhosh supports Dhanushkodi for killing his father, but Dhanushkodi kills Santhosh. The film ends with Murthy taking the blame for killing Santhosh and surrenders himself to police.  
Sri Manjunatha (film)
 Manjunatha ([[Arjun Sarja]]) is an atheist, but a good person helping others in need and fighting evil and so even though Manjunatha hates his namesake Lord Manjunatha ([[Chiranjeevi]]), the latter loves his would be devotee. Being an atheist, Manjunatha always scolds Lord Shiva which is watched by his Maha Vahanam [[Nandi (bull)|Shri Nandi]] ([[Dwarakish]]) and [[Bhringi|Bhrungi]] ([[Mimicry Dayanand]]). Manjunatha meets Katyayini ([[Soundarya]]) a to-become ''devadasi'' and marries her. Soon they beget a son, Siddhartha ("Siddhu"), who like his mother is a staunch devotee of Lord Manjunatha.

In the meantime Manjunatha starts a [[Crore|Koti]] [[Lingam]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]. Manjunatha is also troubled by his enemies and is aided by Lord Manjunatha who comes in various disguises to save his devotee and help him and his wife attain salvation.  
Stealing Time
  The movie starts off with a voice over by Alec of events later in the movie, asking "Why do we make the decisions we make?" It then cuts to a year before, when the main characters are still at college in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Alec's in the Administration and Records Office at his college where he argues with a clerk about a credit that is apparently missing from his transcript. Despite the fact that he is clearly one credit short of graduating, after four hours Alec convinces the college that he indeed has the credit and is set to graduate. The four of them have to move out of their apartment and proceed to work book buy back day, an event at college that lets students buy and sell used textbooks. The movie shows them repeatedly stealing some of the books and then selling them back to the book buyer in a smooth and elegant manner, as though they have done this many times. They also visit their favorite bar, Rennie's Landing, one last time. Casey asks Sam at one point why nothing has ever happened between the two of them, but she brushes him off and just tells him "don't."  The movie then picks up a year after they have graduated from college. Alec, the main character, is working as the secretary for a producer who he hates. Sam is in a dead end relationship and working at a Mexican restaurant in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Casey is working as a coach for a girls' soccer team. Trevor is trying to become an actor, and working as stage crew for movies.  Sam tells her boyfriend that she got the social service job she always wanted, but her boyfriend isn't quite as thrilled. He has also spent most of their money without her knowing. Consequently, Casey was coming to visit as this happens and he and Sam leave to visit Alec and Trevor, who are now roommates. During the visit, Alec is diagnosed with a brain tumor, a fact that he conceals from his friends. Casey reconnects with a woman he used to date and who had had his baby without his support. Upon learning that the child died before his fifth birthday, Casey visits the child's grave and says that he's more responsible than he used to be, and he's ready to be a father now.  The four friends visit a convenience store, which Alec attempts to rob on a whim. This alarms his friends, who demand some kind of explanation, which he fails to provide. He then takes a long walk and decides that they all must take control of their lives. His solution to their problems is obvious in his mind; he wants them to rob a bank. At first his friends are skeptical, but they're all gradually shown how meticulous Alec has been about details; he had the whole thing planned down to the minute, but stresses that any slip up will cost them time and potentially cause them to fail the mission. Slowly they all join the plan and go to rob the bank to help cope with the new problems in their lives. Sam wants to run away with Casey, who wants to help an immigrant woman and her daughter stay in the country, Trevor wants to go to Fiji, and Alec's plans aren't really clear.   The gang then don their disguises and proceed to rob the bank.  The robbery is successful in that they find a larger amount than expected, $5 million. They steal the cash and successfully get out of the bank, splitting up according to their plan, except Alec inadvertently knocks over a jar of pennies that he brought into the bank with him as a distraction for the bank manager and security guard. The jar shatters and its contents spill out all over the floor. Realizing he does not have time to recover the jar's contents, Alec leaves it behind. Casey and Sam meet up at a restaurant called The Outlaws, the agreed-upon meeting point.  They are joined by Trevor, and the three wait nervously for Alec, who is late.  A television news broadcast in the bar states that the police have recovered a very good lead.  Stuffed among the jar of pennies that Alec unintentionally left behind at the bank was a Rennie's Landing badge that Trevor was playing with innocently earlier in the film. The badge has Trevor's full name on it.  Using this lead, the police issue a broadcast alert for Trevor, who had just used his credit card at the restaurant to pay for their drinks. The bartender calls the police, who surround the bar. Casey is stopped leaving the bar. Sam goes to the ladies' room.  Trevor comes outside to join Casey and sees that he is surrounded. He reaches into his back pocket for his keys, but the police (thinking he is reaching for a gun) fire on Trevor and Casey, instantly killing Trevor and mortally wounding Casey.  Sam, hearing the commotion, exits the ladies' room using a back window. As she inches around the bar, she sees Trevor dead and Casey laying on the ground. He looks up at her and realizes she can still escape. When the police ask a dying Casey if anyone else is still inside, he says no, then dies.  Watching all of this from a distance is Alec, who was running late but had showed up at the meeting point to join his friends. As he watches Trevor and Casey lying dead or dying, all of a sudden Alec falls to the ground. From that point, the viewers see a montage of the events in the movie, some of which were previously shown out of order. The viewers ultimately realize that everything that transpired after the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film (including the liquor store robbery and the bank robbery) were just hallucinations in Alec's head. In fact, he collapsed from his brain tumor at the bank that he robbed in his fantasies. We see Alec die and then hear his voiceover narration wishing his friends well and saying he hopes they live rich lives and can see each other again someday.  
Spy Kids
  Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez are rival spies who fall in love. They retire and have two children, twelve-year-old Carmen and nine-year-old Juni. They work for the Organization of Super Spies (OSS) doing desk work. The children have no idea of their parents' previous career. Ingrid and Gregorio are called back into the field when agents go missing. The children are left in the care of Uncle Felix Gumm. Gregorio suspects that children's television host Fegan Floop has kidnapped the agents and mutated them into his "Fooglies," creatures on his show.  They are captured by Floop's "Thumb-Thumb" robots whose arms, legs, and head resemble oversized thumbs, and taken to Floop's castle. Felix is alerted to the parents' capture, activates the fail-safe, tells the children the truth, and that he is not their uncle but an agent. The house is assaulted by Thumb-Thumbs, and the children escape alone on a submarine set to auto-pilot to a safe house. At the safe house, Carmen unlocks the door using her full name, and the children learn of their parents' past as they decide to rescue them.  Inside of Floop's castle, he introduces his latest creation to Mr. Lisp, small robots in the shape of children. He wishes to replace the world leaders' children with these super-strong robots to control the world. The androids are "dumb", and cannot function outside of their inherent programming. Lisp is furious, demanding usable androids. Floop, along with his second-in-command Alexander Minion, interrogate Gregorio and Ingrid about 'The Third Brain'. Ingrid knows nothing of the subject, while Gregorio claims that he destroyed the brain years ago. After Floop leaves, Gregorio reveals to Ingrid that the Third Brain was a secret OSS project he once worked on: an AI brain with all the skills of the entire OSS. The project was scrapped as being too dangerous, but Gregorio couldn't bring himself to destroy the final prototype.  Back at the safe house, the kids are visited by Ms. Gradenko, who claims she works for the OSS and gives Carmen a bracelet as a sign of trust. Gradenko says she wants the Third Brain, but Carmen does not know anything about it. Gradenko orders the house to be dismantled, and Juni sees Thumb-Thumbs outside destroying the submarine. Gradenko's intentions revealed, Juni accidentally exposes the Third Brain, and a chase ensues with Carmen and some henchmen with jet packs. Carmen eventually gets the brain, and she and Juni escape.  Carmen realizes too late that the bracelet Gradenko gave her was a tracking device, and she and Juni are attacked by their robot counterparts. Though Juni tries to destroy it he is unable and the androids fly off with the Third Brain. With it Floop can achieve his goal, but he wishes to continue his children's show. Minion has different plans and takes over, locking Floop into his "virtual room," the chamber where he films his television series. The kids receive reluctant help from Gregorio's brother Isador "Machete" Cortez when they come to his spy shop. When Machete refuses to accompany them, they steal some of his gear, and take his spy plane to fly to Floop's castle.  While their children storm the castle, Minion takes Ingrid and Gregorio to the "Fooglilizer," the machine which has mutated the other OSS agents into Fooglies. Gregorio reveals that Minion used to work for the OSS but was fired after Gregorio reported him tampering with the Third Brain project. Juni rescues Floop and then their parents. Together they trap Minion on the Fooglilizer and, confronting Lisp and Gradenko, the family is beset by all 500 robot children. Machete busts through the window, and joins the family to fight. However, at the last moment, Floop is able to reprogram the robots to change sides. The 500 super-strong robots quickly overpower Lisp and Gradenko.  With advice from Juni, Floop introduces the robot versions of Carmen and Juni on his show. The family's breakfast is interrupted by Devlin who has a mission for Carmen and Juni. Carmen accepts on one condition: that the Cortezes work as a family.  
Storytelling (film)
 The film consists of two stories that are unrelated and have different actors, titled "Fiction" and "Non-Fiction". College and high school serve as the backdrop for these two stories about dysfunction and personal turmoil.  ;Fiction "Fiction", starring [[Selma Blair]], "Vi", is about a group of college students in a creative writing class taught by a professor ([[Robert Wisdom]].)  ;Non-Fiction "Non-Fiction", starring [[Paul Giamatti]] and [[John Goodman]], is about the filming of a dysfunctional suburban New Jersey family as their teenage son ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]) goes through the college application process, and faces the trials and tribulations of late teenage years.  ;Autobiography The original version of the film featured a third story entitled "Autobiography", concerning, among other things, a [[The closet|closeted]] football player ([[James van der Beek]]).

Stranger Inside
 Treasure Lee (Yolonda Ross) learns that her biological mother Brownie ([[Davenia McFadden]]) is incarcerated in an adult prison, so she purposely gets into trouble in order to be transferred from a juvenile facility to an adult women's facility in order to meet her. In the new prison, she reunites with an old friend Shadow (LaTanya Hagans).  She meets new inmates, such as Leisha (Medusa), an aspiring [[rapper]], and Doodle ([[Ella Joyce]]), a religious, [[Homophobia|homophobic]] woman who is involved with a male [[correctional officer]].  When Treasure asks about Brownie, Leisha responds, "I'm about getting up out of here.  I ain't about no Brownie."  Later, Shadow points Brownie out to her on the [[basketball]] court.  Brownie knocks a player down, injuring her, and demands that another person take her place.  Treasure volunteers for the position. Back in the cells, Treasure approaches Brownie around her "prison family."  She pulls out a photo of a woman and says to Brownie that she is her mother and her reason for being in prison.  Brownie's "daughters" protest that the photograph is not of Brownie.  Brownie asks the daughters to leave and yells at Treasure, stating it is her own fault she is in jail.  Treasure is playing cards with Leisha and Shadow when she begins flirting with an inmate named Sugar (Patrice Fisher).  Kit ([[Rain Phoenix]]), Brownie's main daughter, chides the woman for not meeting her in the chapel for their usual sexual relations.  A fight breaks out between Treasure and Kit that results in both being placed in [[solitary confinement]].  While confined, Brownie speaks through a wall telling Treasure that they should meet once she is released.  Once back in the general population, Brownie meets with Treasure alone and states that she did not know about her because she was taken away at birth.  She admits, "I failed you."  Treasure cries on her shoulder.  As Treasure becomes a part of Brownie's prison family, Kit informs her that Brownie taught her how to survive in prison and demands that she sells drugs.  Later, Brownie shoves a fork into Kit's thigh when Kit fails to bring in a certain amount of money from selling drugs.  Meanwhile, Leisha is released from prison and Shadow admits that she wished she had never told Treasure about Brownie.  Brownie tattoos the same [[ankh]] she has on Treasure's arm.  Treasure suggested that she should be reassigned cells to be closer to the family and Brownie does nothing to make that happen.  However, when Brownie eats food made by Treasure's new [[Asian people|Asian]] cellmate (Emily Kuroda), she proposes that the new inmate should live near her.  Brownie mocks Kit when she sees Kit reading [[Nazi]] literature.  Kit responds, "I am not jealous of you and Treasure because I know Brownie just cares about Brownie."  Brownie then kicks her out of the prison family.  In a later scene, a ranting Brownie grabs Treasure and comes close to maiming her with broken glass. Brownie approaches Treasure in the kitchen area where Treasure shows her obvious irritation with Brownie.  Brownie tries to persuade Treasure that she needs to kill Kit, who now associates with a female [[neo-Nazi]] gang.  On the basketball court, Brownie slides a shank to Treasure.  Treasure demands to play one-on-one basketball with Kit.  Instead of playing, they immediately begin fighting.  Treasure beats Kit badly but does not use the shank on her.  Brownie pulls her to the side and demands that she kill Kit.  As the two women leave their huddle, Kit approaches Brownie and puts a shank deep in her neck.  All the inmates fall to the ground as correctional officers run out onto the court.  In a medical waiting area, Treasure sees Leisha, who is now in a [[wheelchair]].  Leisha, in a drowsy voice, states that the police caught her with [[drug paraphernalia]] again.  When a medical worker calls Treasure's name, she dismisses her for not having matching blood.  Treasure grabs the woman by the arm and demands to donate blood.  A female correctional officer approaches the two and demands to read the file.  The file reveals that Brownie is not Treasure's mother, but instead the woman who killed Treasure's mother.  The [[wiktionary:Warden|warden]] ([[Lee Garlington]]) has a meeting with Treasure in her office, and says that she sympathizes with her.  She offers to transfer Treasure if she will admit that Brownie and a male correctional officer have been working together to bring drugs to inmates.  
Stickmen (film)
  The film begins with Thomas and Wayne playing a game of pool against two English men. They almost win but Wayne loses the game on the last shot due to overconfidence. Their friend Jack then arrives. His pool playing skills come to the attention of Holden ([[Kirk Torrance]]), who remarks to the bartender Dave (John Leigh) that the three friends might be good enough to play in "Daddy's game". "Daddy's game" turns out to be an underground pool tournament run by local Greek crime lord Daddy. Each team pays $500 to enter and the winner takes away $20,000 tax free. The three of them agree to enter under the name "Stickmen".  The boys leave the bar and go to a cafe, where they meet Sara ([[Anne Nordhaus]]), a waitress who takes a liking to Thomas. The next morning the three meet up for breakfast where Jack tells them that their first match in the pool tournament will be against two men called Jimmy and Eric, at the Princess Bar. Jack then leaves for work, where he ends up having sex with Karen ([[Simone Kessell]]) in his office. Thomas attends a course on "Coping with Redundancy" but is asked to leave. He runs into Sara, who is doing a management course. The two go for a cup of coffee, which Thomas reluctantly accepts because he has a girlfriend. Later that evening, Thomas accompanies Wayne to a job interview, which turns out to be an escort driver. He will be responsible for driving prostitutes Tess (Emma Nooyen) and Lulu (Luanne Gordon) to their jobs. The madam, Janelle, reveals that Daddy owns the brothel. Wayne gets the job.  Meanwhile, Dave is having trouble coming up with the rent for his bar, which he rents from Daddy. Holden turns up and after some friendly chitchat, tells Dave that the cheque bounced. He breaks Dave's thumb and promises him that if he doesn't get the money, the next one will be a beating.  The Stickmen turn up to their match at the Princess Bar, which appears to be a gay bar. They easily win the match and go back to celebrate at Dave's bar. Sara turns up and she and Thomas hit it off. Karen arrives and chats with Jack. Thomas and Sara, drunk, leave the bar. Holden tells Jack and Wayne that Daddy wants to meet them, and they agree to meet the next morning.  The next morning, Jack and Wayne turn up to Daddy's barber shop, which is in a small alley. Thomas doesn't show and it is revealed that he slept with Sara. Holden arrives and tells Jack and Wayne that their next match will be against the Men in Black, who are rumoured to be very good. They go inside and meet Daddy, who has two metal hooks instead of hands. He has a number of Greek thugs as bodyguards. He tells them that life is nothing without passion, and his passion is getting players together in his pool tournament.  Thomas returns home and finds his girlfriend Marie has packed up his stuff and wants him to leave, having suspected his infidelity. He arrives at the bar and is congratulated by Jack and Wayne for sleeping with Sara. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Sara and Karen know each other and are planning something.  The Men in Black, the Stickmen's next opponents, turn out to be two priests. They are humorous and good-natured even when the Stickmen beat them. Thomas goes to visit Sara and the two of them bond. Holden tells Jack that Daddy wants another meeting. Jack accompanies Holden and sees Daddy intimidating Dave while shaving him. Dave, who had previously been beaten up by Daddy's thugs, is given two days to get Daddy's money. Daddy then gives Jack a haircut while offering him a bet of $15,000 on the tournament. Jack protests that they don't have that kind of money but Daddy says that they can work out a payment plan. Feeling intimidated, Jack agrees to the bet.  The next morning at breakfast Jack breaks the news to the other two that their next match will be against "Caller" (Neville Stevenson), and he remarks that the only way they have a hope is if they win the toss. Sara tells Karen that she's not sure if she can go through with their plan. Karen's ex-boyfriend Hugh and his friend turn up and Sara leaves. She meets Thomas at the [[The Bucket Fountain|Bucket Fountain]] on [[Cuba Street, Wellington|Cuba Street]], where they agree to take their relationship to the next level (being boyfriend and girlfriend).  The next evening, Wayne rescues Lulu from a fat, drunken customer, who has passed out on top of her. He invites her to come and watch him play pool to cheer her up, and takes her home to get his cue. However, he finds that Tess, who had been living with him temporarily, has stolen most of his stuff. He explodes in a fit of anger, starts drinking and tells Lulu that Caller is too good and they can't beat him. After some encouragement from Lulu, he agrees to play.  Caller, it turns out, is a pierced, bare-chested pool player with dreadlocks who gets his nickname from [[Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#call shot|calling his shots]]. Wayne turns up drunk and announces to Thomas and Jack that he will play Caller. Jack objects, knowing that he is the only one who has a chance at winning, but Holden states that since Wayne has stepped up, he has to play. In a "drunken master" style, Wayne runs the table and beats Caller, who never gets a single shot. As Holden mentioned earlier in the film, New Zealand pub rules require a player who loses a game without sinking any of his balls to [[Debagging#New_Zealand_pool|drop his trousers]]. Caller appears to comply with the rule, but then punches Wayne in the face. In the resulting fight, Jack's hand is cut. Holden, backed up by two of Daddy's thugs wielding machetes, forces Caller to drop his trousers.  Due to Jack's injury, he is barely able to play pool, meaning that Thomas and Wayne will have to play in the semi-finals. Knowing that they have lost their star player, they decide to quit. Dave convinces them to keep playing by telling them that he gets to keep the bar if they win. He buys them matching jackets to wear to the finals.  At the semi-finals, Holden announces that their opponent is "Bastinados", who turn out to be Sara and Karen. The other match is the "Farmers" versus the "Bankers" (Hugh and his friend). Karen and Sara are exceptionally good, but Sara throws the game by sinking the cue ball on the same shot as the 8-ball. In the break between the game, Sara and Thomas go to the roof to talk, where she tells him that she threw the game and really cares about him. Jack takes Wayne and gets him drunk in the hopes that he will repeat his performance against Caller. Daddy, not wanting the Stickmen to win, locks Thomas and Sara on the roof.   Wayne steps up to the break of the final match against the Bankers but passes out on the table. Jack has to play, being the only one left. However, Holden rescues Thomas and Sara, and Thomas proceeds to win the game for the Stickmen. Hugh snaps his cue over his knee in anger and storms out. Daddy tells them to stop by his barber shop next week to collect the money.   A few weeks later, we see that Dave has done up his bar, which is now a successful establishment, and the film ends with the Stickmen playing a friendly game of pool in the bar.  
Stranded (2001 film)
 The film is set in 2020 and begins as the Ares spacecraft enters orbit around Mars. Andre Vishniac commands an international crew of seven astronauts. They try to land, but the small landing craft crashes as a result of an altimeter error. Vishniac is immediately killed, and five other crew members are stranded inside the toppled landing craft, unable to return to the waiting Ares mothercraft. With no spare landing craft, Lowell, the pilot of the Ares, returns to Earth with it.  It will take 26 months for Lowell to send a rescue ship from Earth, but the stranded landing crew have supplies for less than a year and need to find ways to extend the life support system. The main problem is the thermoelectric power generator, since air and water recycling require electrical power. Since the lander is damaged beyond repair, it no longer requires fuel, and Sagan (the mission geologist) proposes to use what is left to power an improvised silicate reactor to produce methane and water vapor from the martian soil. They try to build it, but the landing engines and propellant tanks prove to be too damaged to salvage.  The landing crew tries to find ways to save electrical power, but even draconian measures will only extend the life of the generator to fourteen months. The required lifetime can be attained only if the crew is reduced to two astronauts. Sanchez, the new commander, decides that she, Sagan and Rodrigo should abandon the craft, since their specialist skills are less important to the survival of the mission. They don their spacesuits and walk to the edge of the [[Valles Marineris]] valley, not far from the crash site. Recent radar scans from the orbiter reveal a maze-like structure hidden below a thick cloud of water vapor in the Valles Marineris. The structure appears artificial and is virtually identical to another one near the martian south pole. The three astronauts try to reach the bottom of the valley before they run out of oxygen.  Sagan dies of asphyxiation, but Sanchez and Rodrigo stumble upon an artificial tunnel near the bottom of the valley, containing the mummified bodies of [[humanoid]] alien beings. They find that the air pressure and oxygen content in some of the tunnels is just like that on Earth. Rodrigo dies when accidentally entering a tunnel with no atmosphere, but Sanchez manages to contact the two astronauts still at the lander, who have meanwhile discovered that they are gradually losing air pressure and have realised that there must be an air leak somewhere. Sanchez urges them to join her, as there is enough oxygen and water in the valley for them to survive until the rescue ship arrives.  
Strumpet (film)
  The film features a poet named Strayman (played by Christopher Eccleston) who lives with a pack of stray dogs in a rough estate in a town of [[Northern England]]. He meets a young woman he calls Strumpet (played by singer [[Jenna Gibbons|Jenna G.]]), whom he rescues from a predatory man. Out of kindness, he takes her into his flat. He asks her to play guitar and he sings along from his poetry.  Strayman's neighbour, Knockoff (played by [[Stephen Walters]]), overhears them and wants to represent their talent.<ref></ref> The pair land a record contract, face problems with the recording process and eventually are featured on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref></ref>

When Violet is found, having hanged herself in her house, many secrets are disclosed.  
Sticks (film)
 ''Sticks'' is an off-beat noir action comedy about a smuggler of Cuban cigars who gets involved, and ultimately falls in love, with a Cuban revolutionary Maria who's in the U.S. trading cigars for guns. The two join forces to sell a large (stolen) shipment of Castro's private label cigar, the famed "El Mariposa", and suddenly they find themselves enmeshed in the seedy underbelly of a mob-run cigar smuggling ring that's being monitored by the feds.  
Sugar & Spice
 The story is narrated by Lisa Janusch ([[Marla Sokoloff]]), the bitter and jealous head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's B-squad.  Diane Weston ([[Marley Shelton]]), the popular head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's A-squad, becomes pregnant by the star football quarterback Jack Bartlett ([[James Marsden]]). The two move out of their parents' homes to find an apartment of their own. Jack initially has problems staying in a job, due to his tactless personality, but finally gets hired at a video rental store. In spite of their problems coming up with the rent money, Jack and Diane try as hard as they can to survive while going to school at the same time. Lisa, Diane's bitter rival, occasionally runs into Jack at the rental store. She is interested in winning Jack's heart, but fails to get his attention.   After struggling with the rent and anticipating the financial hardship of supporting a family, Diane and her four cheerleader squadmates, Kansas Hill ([[Mena Suvari]]), Cleo Miller ([[Melissa George]]), Lucy Whitmore ([[Sara Marsh]]), and Hannah Wald ([[Rachel Blanchard]]), plan the perfect bank robbery. They promise each other not to tell Jack about their plan, because of his inability to lie to others.  The squad watches [[heist films]] to learn how to rob banks, and Kansas visits her mother at the women's penitentiary for tips on where to find weaponry. Following the women's advice, Diane and her friends visit a bug exterminator, "The Terminator" ([[W. Earl Brown]]), who sells illegal arms and ammo. He refuses to sell them the guns unless they accept his daughter, Fern Rogers ([[Alexandra Holden]]), on the squad.   The squad agrees to do so and they begin rehearsing the robbery, as well as their choreography for the winter ball. During winter break, they order masks to hide their identities. Lucy backs out of the heist because she receives a scholarship to Harvard. At Christmas, Diane receives an engagement ring from Jack. She then finds out he sold his GTO in order to buy her the ring. The squad is forced to obtain a new get-away vehicle, prompting Fern to volunteer her father’s work van with bad brakes.   At their first robbery at a supermarket, Lucy returns to the group having decided to help them after all. Lisa happens to be in the store at the time of the robbery, and notices that they perform cheerleader stunts in order to cover up the security cameras.

In [[Tokyo]] on May 27, 54 teenage schoolgirls commit [[mass suicide]] by throwing themselves in front of an oncoming train. Shortly after, at a hospital, two nurses commit suicide by jumping out of a window. At both locations rolls of flesh are found, with the missing skin matching removed flesh on corpses. Three detectives&mdash;Kuroda ([[Ryo Ishibashi|Ryô Ishibashi]]), Shibusawa ([[Masatoshi Nagase]]), and Murata ([[Akaji Maro]])&mdash;are notified by a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] named Kiyoko (Yoko Kamon) of a link between the suicides and a website that shows the number of suicides as red and white circles.  On May 28, at a high school, a group of students jump off the roof during lunch, sending the city in search of a "Suicide Club".  On May 29, the suicide boom has spread all over Japan. Mitsuko (Saya Hagiwara) is on her way home when she gets hit by her boyfriend, Masa, who has thrown himself off a roof. Mitsuko is taken to the police station for questioning, where the police strip-search Mitsuko and discover that she has a butterfly tattoo.  On May 30, the police receive a call from a boy who warns that on that evening at 7:30, another mass suicide will take place at the same platform. The detectives organize a stake-out in order to prevent the event, but there is no suicide. Meanwhile, individual and smaller-scale group suicides continue all over Japan, claiming many lives, including Kuroda's entire family. Kuroda receives a call from the boy who warned them about the second suicide wave, and upon the conversation's conclusion Kuroda shoots himself.  Meanwhile, Kiyoko is caught by a group led by a costumed man named Genesis whose hideout is a small subterranean bowling alley, where he resides with four glam-rock cohorts. During her capture, Genesis performs a song while a girl in a white sack is brutally raped and killed by one of the henchmen right in front of them. At Genesis' lair, Kiyoko e-mails the authorities information about her whereabouts. The police arrest him, and it is assumed the "Suicide Club" is caught.  On June 1, Mitsuko goes to her boyfriend's home to return his helmet, where she notices the Dessart posters on the wall and recognizes a pattern which corresponds to the letters on a [[telephone keypad]] and spells the word "suicide". Soon, the boy from earlier calls her to tell her there is no "Suicide Club" and to invite her to a secret concert.  On June 2, Mitsuko sneaks into the backstage area, where she wanders onto a stage. She sees a group of children in the audience, who ask her a series of questions. Mitsuko impresses the children, so they take her to a room where a strip from her skin is shaved off, where the butterfly tattoo is.  A new roll of skin ends up with the police, and detective Shibusawa recognizes the strip from Mitsuko's tattoo. That evening he sees Mitsuko as she is standing at the train station and grabs her hand but she pulls away. She stares at Shibusawa as the train pulls into the station and  once she boards the train. As the train pulls out of the station the ending credits segment begins, in which Dessart announce their group's disbandment and offer appreciation toward their fans' loyal support, before performing their final song.

Unbeknownst to Bruno, Kalle’s plan was to volunteer his strong, heavyset buddy into a [[Sumo|sumo wrestling]] contest, to show Bruno that he’s good at it, and the winner gets a prize for two hundred marks. As expected, Bruno mops-up the inferior competition and wins the prize, but unexpectedly, he’s challenged by Lucky to a boxing match.

Kalle introduces the very German, but Japanese-loving [[sushi]] chef Akashi (Martin Seifert) to Bruno and Timo. At first, Akashi is dismissive of Bruno who doesn’t appear to have the heart, skill or dedication to be a good sumo wrestler, but after pleads from Kalle and Bruno, Akashi changes his mind and instructs the trio gather there to begin constructing a [[dohyō]], so Bruno can begin his training.

Swordfish (film)
 Stanley Jobson ([[Hugh Jackman]]) is a highly skilled computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]. Having served time for infecting the [[FBI]]'s [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] program with a [[computer virus]], he is now on parole but forbidden from using computers. His alcoholic ex-wife Melissa ([[Drea de Matteo]]), who married a rich porn producer and is currently a part-time porn actress, has sole custody over their daughter Holly and a [[restraining order]] preventing him from visiting their daughter. One day, he is solicited by Ginger Knowles ([[Halle Berry]]), speaking for her boss Gabriel Shear ([[John Travolta]]), for his hacking skills. He goes to meet Gabriel in Los Angeles, where he is put on the spot to crack a secure government server within a minute while simultaneously held at gunpoint and receiving [[fellatio]]. When he succeeds, Gabriel offers Stanley $10&nbsp;million to program a multi-headed [[Computer worm|worm]], a "hydra", to siphon $9.5&nbsp;billion from several government [[slush fund]]s.  Stanley begins work, learning that Gabriel leads Black Cell, a secret group created by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to launch retaliatory attacks against [[terrorist]]s that threaten the United States. He also privately discovers Ginger is a [[DEA]] agent working undercover, and further is surprised to discover a corpse that looks like Gabriel. He goes to see Holly home from school but finds he is being followed by FBI agent J.T. Roberts ([[Don Cheadle]]), who had previously caught Stanley. Roberts, though monitoring Stanley closely, is more interested in Gabriel as he does not appear on any government database, and after learning that another hacker, Axl Torvalds ([[Rudolf Martin]]), had been killed by Gabriel's men, warns Stanley to be cautious. Stanley opts to secretly code a back door in his hydra that reverses the money transfer after a short period. Meanwhile, [[United States Senator|Senator]] Reisman ([[Sam Shepard]]), who oversees Black Cell, learns the FBI has started tracking Gabriel and orders him to stand down. Gabriel refuses, and narrowly avoids an assassination attempt ordered by Reisman. Gabriel personally kills Reisman in revenge and continues his plan.  Stanley delivers the hydra to Gabriel and leaves to see Holly, only to find that Gabriel has killed Melissa and her husband and kidnapped Holly, framing Stanley. Stanley has no choice but to participate in the bank heist to get Holly back. Gabriel and his men storm a Worldbanc branch, and secure its employees and customers as hostages, fitting each with ball-bearing-based explosives similar to [[Claymore mine]]s. When police and FBI surround the branch, Gabriel takes Stanley to the coffee shop across the street to meet with Roberts, but Gabriel spends the time to discuss the film ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'' and the nature of misdirection. Once back in the bank, Gabriel has one of his men escort a hostage to demonstrate the situation. A sniper kills the man, and other agents pull the hostage away from the bank, causing the bomb to detonate, ravaging the buildings and vehicles on the street and killing several people, a scene shown ''[[in medias res]]'' at the start of the film.  Gabriel instructs Stanley to launch the hydra, and turns Holly over to him once completed. However, Stanley's back door triggers before they can leave the bank, and Stanley is recaptured while Holly is rescued. Gabriel threatens to kill Ginger, who he knows is a DEA agent, unless Stanley re-siphons the money back to a [[Monte Carlo]] bank. Despite doing so, Gabriel shoots Ginger. Gabriel and his men load the hostages on a bus and demand a plane wait for them at the local airport, but while en route, the bus is lifted off by a [[S-64 Aircrane]] and deposited on the roof of a local skyscraper. Gabriel deactivates the bombs and departs with his surviving men on a waiting helicopter, which Stanley shoots down using a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] from the bus.  Roberts takes Stanley to verify the corpse they found, believing Gabriel was a [[Mossad]] agent while there was no record of a DEA agent named Ginger. Stanley recognizes the corpse as the one he discovered earlier and personally realizes that the whole scenario was misdirection. The Police still cannot find Ginger's corpse. Gabriel had escaped a different route, and Ginger had been wearing a bulletproof vest and was working with Gabriel all along. Stanley does not tell Police that Gabriel & Ginger are still alive. Roberts arranges for Stanley to have full custody of Holly, and the two tour the US together. In Monte Carlo, Gabriel and Ginger withdraw the money, and later watch as a yacht at sea explodes. Over the film's credits, a news report describes the destruction of the yacht, carrying a known terrorist, as the third such incident in as many weeks.

While troopers Arcot Ramathorn ([[Jay Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar]]) and the rookie, Robert "Rabbit" Roto ([[Erik Stolhanske|Stolhanske]]) are tormenting a group of men for smoking marijuana, they encounter a crazed attacker, who is revealed to be their co-worker MacIntyre Womack ([[Steve Lemme|Lemme]]) playing a prank on them. Back at the station, they are chastised for a lack of arrests by their boss, Captain John O'Hagen ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Cox]]), who warns them that they risk being shut down.  They also torment the radio dispatcher, Rodney Farva, who has been suspended. While investigating a Winnebago, they encounter a woman who died from a drug overdose with a tattoo of a monkey.  Once outside the trailer, the state troopers encounter their rivals, the local Spurbury police, who they compete with for arrests.

After Ramathorn and Rabbit rescue them, they find packages with stickers depicting the same monkey seen on the dead woman's tattoo. Foster begins a relationship with Spurbury PD officer Ursula Hanson ([[Marisa Coughlan|Coughlan]]), and discovers marijuana hidden in the impounded Winnebago, bearing the same monkey sticker.

The Vermont governor ([[Lynda Carter|Carter]]) travels to Spurbury for a press conference about the drug bust.  Knowing that the Spurbury police will be involved with the governor's visit, Ramathorn and Foster break into the Spurbury police office to steal the Winnebago to present the marijuana as evidence.  At the press conference, Chief Grady claims repsonsibilty for the drug bust, despite it being the work of the State troopers. Foster thinks that Ursula revealed the location of the marijuana to her boss in exchange for a promotion.  Having failed to increase arrests, the state troopers expect their unit to be shut down.  Back at the station, the state troopers find Farva dressed in a Spurbury PD uniform; Foster realizes that it was him, not Ursula, who betrayed the location of the marijuana.  The troopers, including Captain O'Hagen, tie Farva to a toilet and drunkenly vandalize Chief Grady's house.  Ursula offers to help them, and directs them to one of the drug-running trucks.  As they attempt to pursue it, they encounter Farva, who holds them at gunpoint.  The state troopers convince Farva to help them in pursuing the drug runners, and follow the truck to a nearby airfield.  The state troopers see Chief Grady arrive, only to realize that the Spurbury police are working alongside the drug dealers. Using a sex doll on top of Farva's car, the state troopers distract the Spurbury police officers long enough to attack and arrest them.  The governor sends Captain O'Hagen a letter thanking him for his efforts, but tells him that their station will still be shut down. Three months later, Ramathorn and Rabbit are delivering beer to a party hosted by teenagers. As the teenagers torment them, they reveal that they are undercover Spurbury police, having replaced all of the officers after the drug bust.

The group are unable to locate Greg, Frank, or Diego, and Martin finds that the lock picks and spare keys to the building have been removed; the phones have also been disconnected. Martin recalls an [[Duct (flow)|air duct]] leading out of the building, and proposes the group exit that way. He goes ahead to dismantle a vent grate, after which Sarah, Mike, and Carmen follow; Chris stays behind, as they are unable to turn around and lift him from inside the duct. While they crawl along, the killer begins driving his machete through the bottom of the duct, killing Mike and Martin.   Sarah and Carmen escape through a different duct and find themselves in the basement, where they are confronted by the killer, who chases them through the building. They momentarily hide in a security monitor room and ponder who the killer is; Carmen believes it is Greg. Meanwhile, Diego and Greg come across Chris, terrified. Greg decides to enter the air duct to find a way out, and Diego waits with Chris. Greg finds Sarah and Carmen in a room overlooking the pool. Convinced he is the killer, Carmen knocks him unconscious, and she and Sarah lock him inside. A trained swimmer, Carmen attempts to swim into a filter chamber to exit the building. She injures her leg, but is able to access the exterior of the building. Outside, she finds a security guard's corpse with a gun lying next to it, but before she can retrieve it, she is stabbed by the killer and thrown back into the filter chamber.  Inside, Sarah is confronted by Frank, who reveals himself to be the killer, motivated out of spite and jealousy over his failed romantic advances on each of the women. Sarah manages to light him on fire, but he leaps into the pool. Greg breaks free of the room overlooking the pool, and also jumps into the water, and the men begin to fight. Sarah enters the water and manages to stab Frank with a broken bottle. He rises from the water and Greg and Sarah attempt to flee, but is shot to death by Carmen, who survived the earlier attack.

The Tailor of Panama (film)
 Andy Osnard is an [[MI6]] spy reassigned to [[Panama]] after having an affair in Madrid with the foreign minister’s mistress. His superior warns him of the corruption present in Panama, but Osnard views that as an opportunity. Consulting a list of British citizens residing in Panama, he meets Harry Pendel, the tailor to many of Panama's elite, including the President. Pendel, a gifted storyteller, passes himself off as being formerly of [[Savile Row]], but is in fact an ex-con who used to run scams with his late uncle Benny. Pendel's wife Louisa, the assistant to the administrator of the [[Panama Canal Authority]], is unaware of his criminal record. While Harry is a superb tailor, he is a bad businessman; his tailor shop is constantly in debt, and he owes $50,000 of Louisa's money to the bank for a farming business that failed.  Knowing that Pendel needs money, Osnard offers to help him, if Pendel feeds him information about the elite of Panama City. Pendel agrees, and uses the money to pay off his debts and help his friend Mickie, a down-on-his-luck [[alcoholic]], and his assistant Marta, who was raped and disfigured by [[Manuel Noriega]]'s soldiers. However, Osnard soon requires better information, threatening to cut off the money and reveal that Pendel has been spying for a foreign government if he does not get what he wants.   Pendel starts "tailoring" his stories, escalating the roles of friends to make them appear more significant than they are. He casts Mickie as a revolutionary who still holds sway over the youth of Panama, and his shop manager as the leader of an opposition movement. After fixing the suit of the President of Panama (whose conversation consisted of his suit being too tight), he comes up with a tale that the president intends to sell the canal to China. When an incredulous Osnard asks which, Beijing or Taiwan, Pendel replies "both". Osnard knows that Pendel is making up these stories, but does not care as long as his superiors believe them.  As he passes along this misinformation (bypassing the embassy staff, apart from Francesca, a staffer he is sleeping with), it makes its way to Washington, where officials are alarmed and plan an invasion to prevent the canal from falling into Chinese hands. Pendel, meanwhile, seeks to end his spying, saying the opposition won't listen to him because it needs $10 million. He thinks the figure will put Osnard off, but Osnard relays a request to fund the opposition as a means to control Panama after this supposed revolution; he asks for $''15'' million, which is granted by the Pentagon. Osnard's superior arrives with a briefcase containing the money, ready to meet with the opposition, while attack helicopters are preparing for an assault on the city.  The British Ambassador uncovers what Osnard has been up to, and threatens to reveal everything. Osnard pays for his silence and cooperation with $1.25 million. Osnard manages to ditch his superior and make off with the briefcase. Meanwhile, Pendel gets a call from Marta, who tells him that Mickie has committed suicide out of fear that he would go to prison for his supposed revolutionary ties. Pendel blames himself for Mickie's death, and resolves to thwart Osnard's plans. He waylays Osnard as he flees to the airport, but Osnard gives him the slip.   Louisa finds out what Pendel has been doing and races to the Administrator's office. The Administrator contacts the president of Panama, who is able to contact the US government and have the invasion called off shortly after it began. During the confusion, Osnard makes it to the airport, where he meets the Ambassador and hands him his bribe. The Ambassador allows Osnard to make it to an airplane.  Pendel returns home to Louisa and tells her about his criminal past, and she forgives him. Osnard, meanwhile, escapes the country with the money.

Tail Sting
 In [[Australia]] a hijack attempt is made on a van leaving a genetic engineering institute in [[New South Wales]].  The hijackers are thwarted by Security Guard Fred ([[Joe Boony]]) who gets the cargo to an airport in [[Melbourne]].  A cancelled flight at the airport forces an unlikely mix of characters to board a chartered flight to Los Angeles rather than wait for a plane the following day.  This includes a girls [[karate]] team, a businessman desperate not to miss a meeting in the US (Dave McCracken), and a mix of others including a group of scientists accompanied by Fred.  Shortly into the flight it is revealed that one of the scientists, Scott Milhouse (Ray Davis), planned the hijacking attempt. The van contained genetically modified scorpions intended to be used to develop new drugs to fight [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. The scorpions excessive size is blamed on the fact they were cloned and engineered using [[DNA]] from "loads of things", including prehistoric scorpions. Milhouse intends to sell specimens to an unknown third party.  As Fred foiled the hijack attempt, Milhouse decides to steal some of the specimens himself.  He attempts to move some of the specimens into a coffin in the plane's cargo hold when Fred interrupts.  A fight ensues and Milhouse accidentally kills Fred.  Milhouse moves the specimens before balancing the coffin on the edge of a container and leaving the hold.  Soon thereafter the coffin tumbles from its perch and the scorpions are released.  The scorpions grow to immense proportions and kill several members of the crew and passengers.  The pilot, Captain Jack Russel, realises something is amiss when he finds his navigator dead in the cargo hold. His fears are confirmed when a scorpion drops into the cockpit and attempts to sting him.  Milhouse's mental state deteriorates and he accidentally shoots the head scientist with Fred's gun, which also causes one of the plane's doors to open.  Several people and all but one of the scorpions are sucked out of the plane.  Milhouse is stung by the queen scorpion and the others lose track of him. Captain Jack loses his eyes to the scorpion, prompting his love interest Dr. Ryan to set out on a mission to kill the queen while Courtney, a member of the karate team, acts as Captain Jack's eyes in the cockpit.  Ryan corners the queen at the plane's minibar, but Milhouse reappears and points out that he has been stung so many times that he is immune to the scorpion's venom.  Ryan pushes Milhouse into the grip of the queen, then zaps the scorpion moments before the plane lands.  Captain Jack and Ryan leave the plane together, having fallen in love.  As everyone departs the plane, a normal-sized scorpion runs across the runway.  
Tagged: The Jonathan Wamback Story
 Jonathan Wamback starts his daily jog through the streets of his suburban neighbourhood. During his run, he catches the eye of Courtney Henderson. Shortly after, Jonathan and his best friend Toby start their first day of high school, where Jonathan notices Courtney again. As the boys are waiting to register for class, four members of a high school gang, Kyle Simpson, Donald Glover, Trevor Smith, and Ben Luekens make a noisy entrance. They waste no time ganging up on a small grade nine student, mocking and bullying him. Jonathan tries to intervene and quickly makes an enemy of gang leader Kyle.  Intrigued by Jonathan's moxie, tough girl Courtney leads him away, both intriguing Jon and angering Kyle. Unbeknownst to Jonathan, Courtney is actually Kyle's girlfriend. Returning home from a workout, Lozanne Wamback, Jonathan's mom, encounters the gang members lighting cherry bombs in the park and harassing some small children. Angered, she follows Kyle home and attempts to speak to his mother about his behaviour. However, Nora Simpson refuses to believe what Lozanne said about her son and brushes her off. Lozanne tells Jon and her husband Joe about the incident, but Joe is too busy to listen and dismisses her concerns, saying that she's taking it too seriously.  Jonathan is approached by Gord Nelson and Jeff Walters, two cool guys who claim to be forming a group to stand up to Kyle's gang. Together,they come across a Skulls tag (graffiti) spray-painted on a warehouse wall. Jon impresses them when he climbs up and spray-paints over it, turning it into an image of the iconic Arthurian "sword in the stone". They notify him that by doing so he's effectively declaring war on the Skulls gang. To make things worse, Gord has painted racist remarks over a Skulls tag in the park washroom and the gang jumps to the conclusion that it was written by Jon. In response, the gang lures Jon to a park using a phone call from Courtney. Jon tries to escape by scaling a fence, only to have the boys attack him and beat him so severely that he winds up heavily disabled and on life support.  Lozanne and Joe establish a routine of daily care - participating in his physical therapy, washing and tending his broken body, talking to him even though he doesn't appear to hear. Their love for Jonathan and complete dedication to helping him recuperate slowly starts to heal their fragile relationship. As Jon slowly starts to emerge from his coma, Joe lobbies to have the Young Offenders Act rewritten to impose harsher penalties for violent crime.  Gord visits Jon for the first time since the attack and the truth emerges that he wrote the slur that incited the near-fatal beating. Finally, Jon decides to return to school to prove that despite everything, he's no longer a victim. Upon his arrival Kyle and other students are shocked at the reality of the physical damage inflicted upon Jon.  
Taking Sides (film)
 In [[Berlin]] at the end of World War II, Wilhelm Furtwängler ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]) is conducting [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]] when yet another Allied air raid stops the performance. A minister in the [[Government of Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] comes to Furtwängler's dressing room to advise him that he should go abroad, and escape the war. The film then jumps to some time after the Allied victory. [[U.S. Army]] General Wallace ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) tasks Major Steve Arnold ([[Harvey Keitel]]) with "getting" Furtwängler at his [[denazification]] hearing: "Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany".<ref>From film audio, 6 minutes into the film.</ref>  Arnold gets an office with Lt. David Wills ([[Moritz Bleibtreu]]), a [[German Americans|German-American]] [[American Jews|Jew]], and Emmaline Straube ([[Birgit Minichmayr]]), daughter of an executed member of the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance]]. Arnold questions several musicians, many of whom know Emmaline's father and say that Furtwängler refused to give Hitler the Nazi salute.  Arnold begins interrogating Furtwängler, asking why he didn't leave Germany in 1933 like so many other musicians. Why he had played for Hitler's birthday? Why he had played at a Nazi rally? And why his recording of [[Anton Bruckner]]'s 7th Symphony was used on the radio after Hitler's death? Arnold gets a second violinist to tell him about Furtwängler's womanizing and the conductor's professional jealousy of [[Herbert von Karajan]].  In a subplot, Arnold is assisted by a young Jewish U.S. Army lieutenant. The young officer begins to have sympathy for the conductor, as does the young German woman who works as a clerk in their office. This causes friction between Arnold and his subordinates.  In a voice-over, Arnold explains that Furtwängler was exonerated at the later hearings but boasts that his questioning "winged" him. Actual footage of the real Furtwängler shows him shaking hands with [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] after a concert. The conductor surreptitiously wipes his hands with a cloth after touching the Nazi. [[File:Taking Furtwanglers Side.png|thumb|right|250px|Skarsgård performance as the haggard Furtwängler.]]

The two fight and accidentally knock Jenny over the balcony. Convinced that Jenny is dead, Alan rushes down the stairs past David who follows closely. While Alan kneels over an unconscious Jenny, David pulls out his gun and trains it on Alan. It is then that he reveals that he, not Jenny, was the one who called the police. He tells Alan that he resented the fact that Jenny always rejected him in favor of inappropriate men and that he felt that Jenny would finally see that he was the best partner for her if Alan was out of the picture. He then shoots Alan several times. After the shooting, David leaves the mansion in search of help for Jenny. He is hit by a car and taken to the hospital.  As he finishes his story, a comatose Alan is wheeled into the hospital, followed by Jenny who has recovered well enough from her injuries to walk unassisted. Jenny corroborates much of David's story. The detectives opt not to charge David with a crime. After David is released from the hospital, he and Jenny look in on Alan who is still unconscious.  Jenny tells David that she had been wrong about both Alan and David and that she is glad that she is with David. She asks him to take her home. The two leave the hospital.  As they leave the hospital, another flashback begins. It is then revealed that David manipulated Elise into going to Alan's apartment during Jenny's dinner with her father and that he, not Alan, had thrown the rock through Jenny's window.

Thirteen Ghosts
 [[Ghost hunting|Ghost hunter]] Cyrus Kriticos ([[F. Murray Abraham]]) and his [[psychic]] assistant Dennis Rafkin ([[Matthew Lillard]]) lead a team on a mission to capture a spirit called the Juggernaut ([[John DeSantis]]). Several men, including an apparent Cyrus, are killed while the team is able to catch the ghost. Cyrus's nephew Arthur ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), a widower, is informed by Cyrus's estate lawyer, Ben Moss ([[J. R. Bourne]]), that he has inherited Cyrus' mansion. Financially insecure, Arthur decides to move there with his two children, Kathy ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) and Bobby (Alec Roberts) and their nanny Maggie ([[Rah Digga]]).  Posing as a power company inspector, Dennis meets the family and Moss as they tour the mansion. The residence is made entirely of glass sheets inscribed with [[Latin]] phrases, which Dennis recognizes as barrier spells. While searching the basement, Dennis is hit by psychic flashes and discovers the twelve angry ghosts he and Cyrus captured are imprisoned in the house, held captive by the spells. As Dennis warns Arthur, Moss slips downstairs and picks up a valise of cash, unwittingly triggering a mechanism that seals the house and releases the ghosts one by one. He dies when a set of sliding doors snaps shut, cutting him in half. Bobby slips away from Kathy and Maggie and enters the basement, where he sees several of the ghosts, particularly that of the Withered Lover - his mother Jean, who had died of injuries sustained in a house fire. He is knocked unconscious and dragged away.  Using a pair of spectral glasses that allow the wearer to see into the supernatural realm, Dennis convinces Maggie that the ghosts are real. Dennis discovers that the Jackal, one of the most dangerous of the twelve ghosts, has been released and that the family is now in grave danger. The Jackal attacks Kathy when she and Arthur enter the basement in search of Bobby, but they are saved by Kalina Oretzia ([[Embeth Davidtz]]), a spirit liberator who is attempting to free the ghosts. Kathy disappears soon afterward, and the four adults gather in the library, where Arthur learns that Jean's ghost is trapped in the house. Kalina explains that the house is a machine, powered by the captive ghosts, that can allow its user to see the past, present, and future. The only way to shut it down, she says, is through the creation of a thirteenth ghost from a sacrifice of pure love. Arthur realizes that he must become that ghost by dying to save his children.  Armed with a pane of the special glass, Arthur and Dennis enter the basement to find the children. Dennis barricades Arthur into a corner behind the glass, protecting Arthur but allowing two ghosts, the Hammer and the Juggernaut, to beat Dennis to death. It is then revealed that Cyrus faked his death to lure Arthur to the house; Kalina is his secret partner. Cyrus has orchestrated the abduction of Kathy and Bobby so that Arthur will become the thirteenth ghost, which will not stop the machine as Kalina had claimed, but trigger its activation. Cyrus kills Kalina and summons the ghosts to activate the machine.  Arthur arrives at the main hall and witnesses all twelve ghosts orbiting a clockwork device of rotating metal rings, with his children at the center. Discovering Cyrus' true fate, Arthur fights Cyrus while Maggie disrupts the machine's controls, releasing the ghosts from its power. The ghosts hurl Cyrus into the rings, slicing him to pieces. With the encouragement of Dennis' ghost, Arthur jumps into the machine, avoiding the rings and saving his children. The walls of the house shatter as the malfunctioning machine rips itself apart, freeing the ghosts. Dennis smiles at Arthur and departs, and Jean's ghost appears before the family and tells them that she loves them before she and all the other ghosts disappear.  As the family leaves the house, Maggie exclaims that she is quitting.

Aware that the [[Russian mafia|Russian Mafia]] are looking for Alonzo, they suggest that he skip town. Alonzo insists he has control of the situation, and trades Sandman's drug money for an [[arrest warrant]].  Using the warrant, Alonzo, Jake, and four other corrupt narcotics officers return to Roger's house and seize $4 million from the premises. Alonzo shoots and kills Roger when Jake refuses to do so. Jake wholeheartedly refuses to be a part of it, and when Alonzo threatens Jake for a second time, Jake seizes Alonzo's [[shotgun]], prompting a [[Mexican standoff]] with the other officers. Alonzo tells Jake that the LAPD will run a [[blood test]] on him which will identify the PCP-laced cannabis he smoked earlier, and mimics what the local news will say about Jake should he die in the standoff.

Later that evening, Alonzo drives Jake to the home of Smiley, a [[Sureños|Sureño]], to run an errand. Jake reluctantly plays [[poker]] with Smiley and his fellow gang members as he waits for Alonzo and Smiley reevaluates Alonzo's situation. By midnight, Alonzo must pay $1 million to the Russians for killing one of their men in [[Las Vegas]], or be killed himself. Realizing that Alonzo abandoned him and has paid Smiley to kill him, Jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. A gang member searches Jake for money before he is killed, and finds the teenage girl's wallet who happens to be Smiley's cousin. After hearing Jake's story of how he had saved her from being raped earlier that day, Smiley shows gratitude and lets him go.  Jake returns to Sara's apartment to arrest Alonzo, but a gunfight and chase ensue. Alonzo beats Jake and as he leaves to pay the Russians, Jake jumps on top of Alonzo's car, causing an accident. Alonzo is subdued, while the entire neighborhood congregates to watch. In an attempt to get the crowd on his side, Alonzo offers money to whoever kills Jake; but nobody interferes. As Alonzo reaches for a gun, Jake shoots him in the rear and takes the money, along with Alonzo's badge. The neighborhood gang allows Jake to walk away with the money as an infuriated Alonzo watches, and Jake plans to submit it as evidence against Alonzo. Alonzo flees for his life to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]], but he is ambushed and executed by the Russians. Jake returns home as the press reports on Alonzo's death, which eerily mirrors how Alonzo pictured the news would portray Jake.

Jack lures the Graboid to Burt's home, having it fatally collide with the underground concrete barriers surrounding the building. He then uses a chainsaw to free Burt from its belly.  Burt, Jack, Jodi, and Miguel later find the badly wounded Merliss; he explains that he and the government agents were ambushed by Shriekers from the Graboid they were chasing, before dying. While tracking the Shriekers, an [[albino]] Graboid—later named El Blanco, meaning "The White One" in Spanish—traps them on rocks for the night. After drawing El Blanco away, they find that the Shriekers have molted their skin, becoming winged creatures capable of jet-propelled flight. Miguel is killed by the creature, which then crashes on a metal fence, killing itself. Burt realizes that chemicals in their stomachs react explosively, enabling their flight. Finding them able to carry Graboid eggs, they surmise that they evolved to spread them through flight. Jodi dubs the new species [[Graboid#Ass-blaster|Ass-Blasters]]. Meanwhile, Nancy and Mindy are attacked by an Ass-Blaster in town and hide in a freezer.  Using a mattress as cover from the Ass-Blasters' infrared vision, the group gets to Burt's house, but are forced to flee when an Ass-Blaster attempts to break in. To keep it from multiplying like its predecessors, Burt rigs his house and his stash of [[MRE]]s to explode, killing it, however it is only after that they learn Ass-Blasters do not multiply but fall asleep after eating. The group flees to a junkyard, where they build a [[potato gun]] from everyday objects to ignite the combustible materials in the Ass-Blasters' stomachs. After they kill four, Burt is attacked by El Blanco and pinned down. Realizing that Burt's ultrasonic watch is repeatedly drawing El Blanco to them, Jack takes it and sticks it to the final Ass-Blaster. El Blanco devours it, saving Burt and Jodi's lives in the process.  In the aftermath, Nancy manages to sell a captive Ass-Blaster, while Jack pursues a romantic relationship with Jodi, depressing Mindy who had a crush on him. Meanwhile, Melvin tries again to approach Burt about selling his land, but Burt informs him that since El Blanco is an [[endangered species]] and illegal to hunt—and formed a mutual unspoken friendship with Burt—the residents have decided to take precautions in order to live safely alongside it, thus turning Perfection into a federally protected Graboid reserve and barring Melvin from developing a town. Burt then leaves Melvin standing on a rock with El Blanco circling below.

The Tunnel (2001 film)
 The central character of the film is Harry Melchior, played by [[Heino Ferch]] and based on the real tunneler, [[Hasso Herschel]].  Despite being imprisoned for several years for his role in the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|June 1953 uprising in East Germany]], Melchior competes for and wins the national swimming championship in 1961. With the aid of a false passport and disguise, Harry succeeds in fleeing to West Berlin. His best friend, Matthis (played by [[Sebastian Koch]]) manages to escape through the underground sewer, but Matthis's pregnant wife Carola (played by [[Claudia Michelsen]]) is not so lucky and remains in East Berlin.  Harry's beloved sister, Lotte (played by [[Alexandra Maria Lara]]) and her husband and daughter are ambivalent about leaving the confines of the [[East Germany|GDR]].  Committed to getting their loved ones out of the GDR but knowing that ground routes are heavily guarded, Harry and Matthis have the idea of going underground. Matthis is an engineer by training. They link up with a small circle of others, initially Vittorio 'Vic' Constanza (played by [[Mehmet Kurtuluş]]) and Fred von Klausnitz (played by [[Felix Eitner]]). They find an unused factory building close to the Wall that has ample underground space. They are eventually joined by Fritzi Scholz (played by [[Nicolette Krebitz]]), whose fiancé Heiner ([[Florian Panzner]]) is also trapped in the east.  The work is slow, hard and sometimes dangerous, and the group reluctantly agrees to take in several more helpers. Over a span of months, the tunnel takes shape following Matthis' design with the necessary shoring, lights and even a railbed. Discovering a film crew from [[NBC]] in the city one day, the leaders convince the network to fund their efforts in exchange for exclusive footage of the digging and eventual escape.  In the meantime, communication with the would-be rescuees in the east is necessary but hazardous. Vic, an American citizen, can pass through the border freely. He is in contact with Lotte and with Carola. The latter, however, has been blackmailed by the [[Stasi]] to inform; if she does not cooperate, the state will take her soon-to-be-born baby. Carola informs on Vic and he is detained when trying to cross back to West Berlin. He is released after a while but cannot go back to the east. Fritzi's love, Heiner, makes a futile attempt to cross the barbed wire and walls, but he is shot 5 times by the [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|East German border guards]] and left to die in a scene mirroring the true case of [[Peter Fechter]]. The American soldiers prevented Fritzi's friend from climbing to the wall to look for Heiner, who is being shot dead. Fritzi's friend was warned by the border troops to get out of the wall.  Overseeing the efforts to thwart tunnelers and other efforts at "illegal emigration" is Colonel Kröger (played by [[Uwe Kockisch]]).  Finally the pieces are all in place for the planned escape of about 30 people. Word is spread by surreptitious means, though the Stasi are watching closely. They go to the home of Fred's widowed mother to take her into custody, but she takes her own life first.  Carola has admitted to Lotte that she has been an informant but swears she can now be trusted. In a ruse that means leaving her baby with Lotte's family, she leads her Stasi tail to a remote location far from the actual escape site. Fritzi has crossed the border with a fake passport and Harry has entered through the tunnel. Surprising a border guard, Harry takes his uniform, steel helmet and gun, and blends into the troops swarming through the area. The would-be escapees gather in a café across from the building where the tunnel begins, and Fritzi gradually escorts them over. Tense moments ensue as Colonel Kröger closes in, and pursues the escapees through the tunnel. A sign has been erected marking the boundary of the French sector of West Berlin, and they have the political sense to know they can go no further.

Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal
 The film opens in [[Los Angeles International Airport]] where fans and haters of heavy metal singer Slade Craven ([[John Mann (musician)|John Mann]]) gather. Craven will perform his farewell concert on a [[Boeing 747]] operated TransCon Airlines flight 619, which will be flying from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Toronto]], and the concert is scheduled to be broadcast over the internet. The FAA has received threats that they had better allow this concert to take place. Erica Black ([[Monika Schnarre]]) is a news anchor who is on the airplane with her cameraman Ethan ([[Ben Derrick]]), covering the concert. The fans board the plane and later Craven and his band get on while the crew checks everything. During the safety demonstration, the fans do not pay attention and they cheer saying Craven many times. There are several shots of people cheering, and also some close-ups as well. The faces of the stewardesses are shown and it is clear that they are frustrated. The fans are shown as well, and some have makeup on, and rock and roll hair styles.   For the past two years, FBI agent Kate Hayden ([[Gabrielle Anwar]]) has been after hacker Nick Watts ([[Craig Sheffer]]), who has gained access to the live broadcast of the concert. After having snacks, Craven and his band start the concert and perform "Gun Love" and do tricks. Later when Craven is backstage at the first class toilet, an unknown person corners him and assumes his personality. The anonymous person then kills Craven's manager. When Kate arrives at Nick's home, they both see something that they never thought was supposed to be part of the broadcast. Craven kills captain Collins and takes the airplane hostage. Kate places a call and tells fellow agent Frank Garner ([[Joe Mantegna]]) and his partner Dave Barrett ([[Mike Dopud]]) to check it out. Garner and Barrett head to the offices of Z-Web-TV, the company that's broadcasting the concert and it is the same company that Erica works for, and the company is run by Benny Mitchell. When Barrett calls the FAA tower in San Diego and talks to Mr. Stopnow ([[Brad Loree]]), the head of the tower and his staff, an explosion splinters the tower, killing everyone in there. Garner and Barrett think that Craven has accomplices on the ground.    Kate and Nick use Nick's equipment to figure out who the hostage taker is and later find out that he is not the real Slade Craven, but an impostor named Simon Flanders (also played by Mann; voice by ([[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]), and it is revealed that he was the anonymous person who cornered Craven and abducted him by tying up and locked him in a room in the cargo hold, and the room has a computer in it. They then find more information that Simon is a member of a Satanic Cult called Guardians of the Gateway, who see themselves as the vanguard of the Antichrist who will rule the next millennium. He learns that Simon was previously suspected of murder and charged with 5 counts of Arson with all of the charges dropped due to insufficient evidence.   The plane strays off its normal flight path, and is heading toward [[Stull, Kansas]], because there is a small church there that Simon and his accomplices from the cult plan to crash the airplane in, because they believe that Satan will be released by the crash. Nick checks the internet and finds research that when the Pope visited Colorado in 1996, he refused to fly over Eastern Kansas, because this part of Kansas is said to be one of the most unholiest places in the world. It turns out that Erica, who is a high-ranking member of Guardians of the Gateway is the mastermind. Erica organized the whole plan to take the airplane hostage, and the co-pilot, MacIntosh’s ([[Rutger Hauer]]) assignment is to crash the airplane into the church. After using the computer to talk to Kate and Nick, Craven manages to free himself and as he is about to leave, Simon enters and the two converse. A fight follows and Craven knocks Simon unconscious. He gets out of the hold, and heads to the auditorium wherein backstage, he finds Erica whom he engages in a hand-to-hand combat where he disarms her of a gun and knocks her to the electric chair prop which he wires, killing her. He then sees his guitarist, Damen, dead. He goes to the cockpit and finds MacIntosh, who tells him his plan to crash the plane and commits suicide. Realizing that no pilot is left to fly the plane, Craven takes the controls.   The fans and the two remaining band members are in despair in the [[economy class]] cabin as Craven is guided by the [[Kansas City International Airport]] control tower along with Nick and Kate to land the plane. Simon enters the cockpit again and intervenes. Craven engages him in a hand-to-hand combat while the plane goes into a dive. The two land in the main cabin where Simon is about to stab Craven but Craven manages to disarm him by using a fire extinguisher and subdue him by locking him in the first class toilet and blocks the door with a service trolley.   The flight reaches Kansas in a stormy weather and Craven lands the plane safely at [[Kansas City International Airport]]. Everyone in the plane applauds. Nick and Kate, the Z-Web-TV, FBI, and Kansas Airport controllers also celebrate. Nick is apprehended and the FBI agents are congratulated. As the plane is surrounded by emergency vehicles, the fans, crew, and the band disembark. One of the fans, Jen Shore ([[Michelle Harrison]]) is given the chance to share on camera what has happened. After that, Craven disembarks and is congratulated and cheered by everyone as the film ends.

The Unsaid
 "A seemingly-untroubled adolescent carries disturbing secrets that compel a psychiatrist to unearth the patient's gruesome past."  Psychiatrist Michael Hunter (Andy García) and his wife are watching their daughter Shelly's school play. Their son Kyle, who is suffering from depression, stays at home, because he can not stand being among people as he says. While the parents are applauding Shelly, Kyle commits suicide in family's garage.  Several years later the family has fallen apart because of their loss. Michael retreats, writes books, holds speeches for University students, but he no longer treats patients. When his former student Barbara Wagner approaches him asking for help with a case he initially refuses, but then gives in to taking over the case of 17-year-old Thomas "Tommy" Caffey ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]), who had had to watch his father murder his mother. It is Michael's job to decide if the teenager can leave the psychiatric facility when he turns 18. But while working with Tommy, Michael realizes how much the boy reminds him of his own son Kyle and feelings of guilt arise in the psychologist.  In flashbacks and conversations, the viewer receives background information of Kyle's suicide. Michael had his son see a therapist—an old university friend named Harry Quinlan—instead of taking medication. In his son's suicide letter, Michael finds out that Kyle was sexually abused by Quinlan. When Michael tries to confront Quinlan, the therapist won't unlock the front door. Michael goes to the glass back door, through which he sees Quinlan pull a gun out of a drawer. As Quinlan places the barrel in his mouth, Michael angrily yells at him to shoot himself, which the therapist does.  Tommy kills a girl at a party because she wanted to have sex with him. At the same party, Tommy befriends Shelly and they become closer. Shelly tells Tommy about Kyle. From then on, Tommy uses the information in therapy sessions and manipulates Michael, who more and more sees his own son in him.  When Michael visits Tommy's father in prison he finds out that Tommy's mother misused the boy as a lover and slept with him regularly. This is  the reason why the father, who came home early one day, bludgeoned the mother to death.  In the last part of the movie, Tommy tries to make Barbara release him to an independent life. When she refuses, he pushes her through a glass window. After she crawls to a telephone and attempts to call police, Tommy beats her with the handset. He flees in a stolen car and, armed with a weapon, picks up Shelly from her mother's house and speeds away. Michael finds the severely wounded Barbara in her apartment. As she is being treated, Barbara warns Michael about Tommy's plan. Michael races to his ex-wife's house, narrowly missing the boy, whom he chases. The boy's flight comes to an end near train tracks, where he holds Shelly at gunpoint. Michael confronts Tommy with what his mother did and Tommy surrenders the girl and the gun. When a train approaches, Tommy tears loose from Michael's embrace and runs onto the tracks. At the last second, Tommy stops on the tracks, throws up his arms, and awaits impact. Michael grabs Tommy and they fall away from the locomotive.  In the closing scene, Michael and Tommy light-heartedly play handball at the institution.  
Unfair Competition (film)

Unruled Paper (film)
 The film starts with a scene of a sitting room, empty of people, at some two minutes ''to'' 7 o'clock in the morning, and ends with a scene of the same empty room at some two minutes ''past'' 7 o'clock in the morning of some weeks later; this passage of time is accurately depicted by the brightness of the natural light that is reflected on the wall of a corridor, that leads to this sitting room, in the initial and final scenes.<ref>Since the date of the opening scene coincides with the first day of schools following the summer school-holiday, this date must coincide with the [[autumnal equinox]] (explicitly, the first day of the month [[Iranian calendar|Mehr]] in the [[Iranian calendar]]), or a day very soon thereafter, should the autumnal equinox fall on a holiday, such as a Friday. With the time of the sunrise advancing in the course of the autumn, the light reflected on the wall at 7 O'clock in the morning must be less bright in the closing scene than in the opening scene. And this is indeed the case.</ref> The meticulous attention that Taghvā'i has given to the accurate representation of even the most mundane aspects of the film would at first sight seem to be at odds with the fact that with the exception of the opening and closing scenes, in ''all'' other scenes where the clock on the wall of the sitting room is in sight, its pendulum is conspicuously motionless. The opening scene depicts some moments before the family starts a very active day (the day at which the two children of the family, ''Shangul'' and ''Mangul'', have their first school-day after the summer school-holiday) and the closing scene, the end of a protracted Friday night,<ref>Since Friday is the [[Iranian calendar#Days of the week|equivalent]] in Iran of Sunday in nominally Christian countries, the night on Friday should be compared with that on Sunday.</ref> during which ''Jahāngir'' and ''Royā'' have spent an intellectually and emotionally exhausting night. The motionless pendulum suggests that the events in the intervening period have taken place out of time, or only in imagination. Although the work presented by Taghvā'i certainly qualifies as a [[surrealist]] art-form, this motionless pendulum serves as a more profound tool than a means that solely hints at [[surrealism]]. Taghvā'i conveys a number of unobtrusive verbal and visual messages to his viewers. Briefly, Taghvā'i and Ms Minoo Farsh'chi, the co-author of the film script, variously refer to the theory of [[eternal recurrence]], as revived by e.g. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], with a strong emphasis on the importance of having a creative mind thereby to forge room for [[free will]] in at least an imaginative world.<ref name="mahnameh"/>  ''Jahāngir'' is a [[technical drawing|draughtsman]], or perhaps an [[architect]]. ''Royā'' is normally a housewife, but has recently started to attend a course on writing film scripts,<ref>The course is taught at a school for film making in [[Bagh-e Ferdows|Bāgh-e Ferdows]].</ref> an undertaking that has been actively encouraged by ''Jahāngir''. Taghvā'i introduces his viewers  to ''Royā'''s penchant for story telling through a scene in which she tells a bedtime story for ''Shangul'' and ''Magul'', the story being in reality a popular Persian children's story which is very reminiscent of ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]''. This scene also reveals the two children as being both imaginative and highly theatrical. The names ''Shangul'' and ''Magul'' are the names of two baby goats in the same story; there is no hint in the film however that ''Shangul'' and ''Magul'' might be the pet names of the children, as opposed to their real names.    ''Jahāngir'' is working on a project that he apparently has initially introduced to ''Royā'' as being a [[villa]] on an island, but that ''Royā'' has later discovered that it is a [[prison]] compound on the island.<ref>In an earlier part of the film, Taghvā'i lets the viewer know about this fact through a scene (of a house party) in which ''Jahāngir'' and ''Ali'' discuss the details of a map prepared by ''Jahāngir'' and talk about the wall of the compound being four metres high and this height not having been considered as sufficient.</ref> Following an intense argument between ''Jahāngir'' and ''Royā'', ''Jahāngir'' reveals that he himself is deeply unhappy about his project, as his colleagues have nicknamed the prison compound as ''Jahāngir's Villa''. An apparently innocuous argument between ''Jahāngir'' and ''Royā'', married already for twelve years, thus leads to an intense and emotional flow of exchanges revolving around the subject matter of how well even closest individuals know each other and the reason why ''Jahāngir'' reacts nervously to ''Royā'''s curiosity regarding his  past. The deliberately ambiguous circumstance in which the intense discussion between ''Royā'' and ''Jahāngir'' takes place, greatly enhances the power of the words exchanged between the two characters. On the one hand, one is given the impression that ''Royā'' is curious because she is preparing her first film script for her class and that she must be using her husband's character in her story. On the other hand, while ''Jahāngir'' appears to be disconcerted, one cannot escape the suspicion that he may in fact be a willing participant in the creation of the script that ''Royā'' is in the process of creating.<ref name="baharlou"></ref> ''Jahāngir'' never fails to ease the tension by using his dark humour when the going gets tough. It has been speculated that what one is witnessing is the film, or at least a rehearsal of it, is actually based on the script written by ''Royā'', with all the members of the family playing their allotted roles.<ref name="baharlou"/><ref>One finds ''a posteriori'' justification for one's suspicions when in the later parts of the film one hears ''Jahāngir'' talking about his previous agreements with ''Royā'' in regard to the script to be written by her. Furthermore, attending carefully to the conversations taking place between ''Jahāngir'' and ''Royā'' throughout the film, one will not fail to recognise parts of these conversations in the draft texts of the final script written by ''Royā''.</ref>  The philosophical messages of the film are mostly conveyed by the professor of literature ([[Jamshid Mashayekhi]]) who teaches the course that ''Royā'' attends. His reflective manners and insightful statements convincingly portray him as a wise academic who has lived a profound life. In a pivotal scene, while being driven by ''Royā'' to his home, in the vicinity of "the end of the world", he says: <blockquote> "''This world in which we live is not fit for working. Before I and you everything in it has already been invented. The world of your story is a kind of a world that you have to create yourself; if you want it to revolve on its axis, it must revolve by your will; when you want the sun to shine, it must shine, and when you do not want it to shine, it must disappear behind the clouds; when you want that it rains, the rain must descend from the sky; if you don't wish that it rains, wish it, and the rain will stop.''"<ref>Translated from Persian. It has been striven to preserve the colloquial nature of the conversation.</ref> </blockquote>   In the one but the penultimate scene of the film, Nāser Taghvā'i introduces a visual metaphor, indicative of the intimacy between a husband and wife. This metaphor, which consists of a knife falling from the table to the ground and subsequently being simultaneously retrieved by ''Jahāngir'' and ''Royā'', with the former grasping the handle of the knife firmly in his fist, and the latter fixing her fingers on the sides of the blade. Of note is the fact that in the motion pictures made in Iran men and women are not permitted to have physical contact.<ref>It should be realised that knife is a [[phallic]] symbol.</ref>

Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
 Charlotte, a young woman, is abducted by Baron Meier Link, a [[vampire]] nobleman who is known not to harm humans needlessly. Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a [[dhampir]], to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D $500,000 as a down payment, and offers him $10,000,000 if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte.  At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled [[Psychic power|psychic]] named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a [[shape shifter]]; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a [[werewolf]].   Throughout the course of the film, two of the Marcus brothers, Nolt and Kyle, end up being killed by the mutant Barbarois, while Leila and Borgoff continue their search for Charlotte.  As the story progresses, Meier Link's abduction of Charlotte turns out to not be as it seemed, as it's revealed that Charlotte willingly ran away with Meier Link as his lover. Charlotte rightfully feared that no one would understand their relationship, with her a human and Link a vampire.   Throughout their search, and after both characters save each other from seeming death at separate points, D has a conversation with Leila, where she reveals that she hunts vampires because a vampire killed her mother. D tells her that he hunts vampires as he has no other choice as a dhampir, and she can have a life that someone like him could never have; the life of a normal human. Leila, having not exactly taken the life of a normal human, instead being a monster hunter, fears that no one will mourn her death when that time comes. She make a pact with D, that if either one of them survives, the survivor will bring flowers to the other's grave. D admits that he does not expect himself to survive the bounty hunt, after coming so close to death.  In the final act of the film, Meier Link transports Charlotte in his carriage to the Castle of Chaythe, where Countess [[Carmilla]], Meier Link's matron, waits for them. Carmilla, a ghost of a vampire who died long ago, reigned supreme within the Castle of Chaythe when vampires were all-powerful and unchallenged. However, her bloodlust was so strong that D's father, an ancient, noble vampire king, killed her in disgust. Carmilla promises Meier Link and Charlotte travel to a far away city known as the City of The Night, where they can be free to love each other, which they will travel to in a large and ancient spaceship-like structure hidden beneath the Castle of Chaythe. Carmilla explains that most ancient castles had similar ships hidden within them, and that back when vampires reigned supreme, these ships weren't an uncommon means for vampires to travel to far regions. Carmilla notes that the ship is old and hasn't flown in a long time, and that she doesn't know if the ship will fly safely, but that Meier Link and Charlotte are allowed to take that risk, if they so wish.  D and the remaining Marcus brothers separately trail Meier Link to the Castle of Chaythe, and as they enter the castle in their search for Charlotte, Carmilla plays psychological tricks on them. Borgoff, for example, is shown Nolt and Kyle, the dead members of the Marcus brothers, returning to life. Borgoff is seemingly killed in his surprised and ecstatic state by Carmilla's ghost, and it turns out Nolt and Kyle never returned to life at all. Later, however, Borgoff appears, having been turned into a vampire. Grove appears in his psychic form, killing Borgoff, but this exerts Grove's physical body to the point that he dies as well. This leaves Leila as the only surviving member of the Marcus brothers as she continues her search for Charlotte inside the castle.   Carmilla manipulates D's mind, and shows him a vision of his mother, in which she apologizes to D for birthing him as a dhampir, and states that she couldn't help it as she was a human in love with D's vampire father, and attempts to explain that humans are capable of loving vampires. D strikes this vision of his mother down with his sword and returns to a normal state.   In a [[plot twist]], Carmilla turns on Meier Link and Charlotte, as Carmilla had actually plotted to kill Charlotte all along, with the reasoning being that Carmilla needed the blood of a virgin to leave her ghostly, ethereal form and return to life. D destroys Carmilla's ghost just as Carmilla is performing the ritual and draining Charlotte of her blood. D, still with a job to do in bringing Charlotte safely back home, engages Meier Link in battle, as Meier Link doesn't want D to take his lover away from him. D stabs Meier Link through the chest with his sword, but not through his heart, injuring Meier Link but allowing him to live. During their encounter, Charlotte has died due to the ritual that Carmilla had been performing previously, and D takes the ring off of her finger as proof of her death to bring back to Elbourne, as he ceases battle with Meier Link.   D, along with Leila, make their leave of the Castle of Chaythe, and allow Meier Link to leave for the City of the Night in the Castle of Chaythe's ship with Charlotte's corpse on board. D and Leila agree to ride back into town together on D's horse, as Leila jokingly tells D that the reward is rightfully hers, but this time, she'll allow him to have it. Before riding off, they watch in the distance as the ship hidden underneath the castle takes off to the skies with Charlotte's corpse and Meier Link inside.  In the final scene of the movie, D arrives at Leila's funeral, watching her loved ones mourn from a distance. Many decades have passed since all of the previous events, as a little girl revealed to be Leila's granddaughter approaches and greets D, and invites him to stay with her family for a while. D politely declines, saying that he simply came to "repay a favor to an old friend, who feared no one would mourn her death." D admits that he was glad she was wrong. The girl thanks him, and D replies by smiling gently at her, and leaves.  
Valentine (film)
 At a [[junior high]] school [[St. Valentine's Day]] [[dance]] in 1988, Jeremy Melton, an outcast student, asks four popular girls to dance. The first three girls, Shelley, Lily, and Paige reject him coldly, while the fourth girl, Kate, politely responds "maybe later". Their overweight friend Dorothy accepts Jeremy's invitation and they proceed to secretly make out underneath the bleachers. When bully Joe Tulga and his friends discover them, Dorothy claims that Jeremy sexually assaulted her. Joe and his friends publicly strip and severely beat Jeremy, and his nose starts bleeding under the distress. Later, Jeremy is expelled and eventually transferred to a reform school.  Thirteen years later, in 2001, Shelley, now a medical student at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], is at the morgue one evening studying on for her medical exam. After receiving a vulgar Valentine's card in her locker, she is attacked by a man in a trench coat and [[Cupid]] mask. She is cornered in a cooler used to store cadavers, where she attempts to hide in a [[body bag]], but the killer finds her before slitting her throat. The killer's nose is seen to bleed as he performs the act.  At Shelley's funeral, Kate, Lily, Paige, and Dorothy are questioned. They admit to not having seen her in some time after she moved from [[San Francisco]] to [[Los Angeles]]. Kate and Paige receive cards in the same fashion as Shelley. Dorothy, who is now much thinner, receives a card which reads "Roses are red, Violets are blue, They'll need dental records to identify you". Her boyfriend, Campbell, loses his apartment and stays with her. Lily receives a box of chocolates and a card which says "You are what you eat". She then takes a bite of one of the chocolates, and vomits upon realizing that there are [[maggots]] inside of it.  As the girls attend the exhibit of Lily's artist boyfriend Max, they meet Campbell's bitter ex-girlfriend Ruthie, who accuses him of being a [[con artist]]. Lily is isolated at the art exhibit and confronted by the killer, who proceeds to shoot her repeatedly with arrows until she falls several floors into a dumpster. When they have not heard from Lily, the others assume she is in [[Los Angeles]] on a work trip. Upon contacting the police, they agree that the culprit could be Jeremy Melton. Dorothy admits to her friends that she lied, and that Jeremy never attacked her and she ruined his life by getting him beat up and sent to reform school. Meanwhile, Kate's neighbor breaks into Kate's apartment to steal her underwear and is murdered by the killer.  As Valentine's Day approaches, Dorothy is planning a [[party]] at her family's large estate. On the morning of the party, the killer murders Campbell with an axe in the basement. The others assume he has simply left Dorothy after dumping her, angering Dorothy, who believes that they are jealous and still look at her as the "fat girl" of the group. After coming to the party to confront Dorothy with the truth about Campbell, Ruthie is thrown through a shower window by the killer who then impales her neck on the glass. At the party, Paige is attacked and trapped in a hot tub by the killer, who proceeds to try and kill her with a drill. After cutting her, he opens the lid of the hot tub and throws the electric drill into the water, electrocuting her to death.  The party disintegrates when the power cuts out, and Dorothy and Kate argue over who the killer is. Kate claims that Campbell could be a suspect because they do not know anything about him, while Dorothy counters by accusing Adam, Kate's recovering alcoholic on-off boyfriend, who is now a journalist. After being told by Lily's boyfriend that she did not arrive in Los Angeles as planned, Kate realizes she is also probably dead, and calls the detective assigned to the case. After dialing the number, she follows the sound of a ring tone outside the house and discovers the detective's severed head in the pond.  Kate becomes convinced that Adam is actually Jeremy, disguised by reconstructive surgery, and goes back into the house, only to find Adam waiting for her. To her surprise, he asks her to dance, and they dance together for a while until she becomes frightened, kneeing him in the groin and escaping. She runs through the house, discovering the corpses of Paige and Ruthie. She locates a gun, but someone in the Cupid's mask jumps out and runs into Kate, resulting in knocking the gun from her hand and sending them both tumbling down a staircase. The supposed killer arises and is shot by Adam who appears at the top of the stairs using Kate's gun. As a shocked and confused Kate apologizes profusely, Adam pulls off the Cupid's mask to reveal the killer as Dorothy. Adam forgives Kate, explaining that childhood trauma can lead to lifelong anger and some people are eventually forced to act on that anger. As Kate and Adam wait for the police to arrive, they hug as Adam says he has always loved her. Moments later, as Kate closes her eyes as they wait for the police to arrive, his nose begins to bleed, indicating that he is Jeremy Melton after all.

Pierre asks Camille and Ugo to dinner at his flat with his lover Sonia, which proves a disaster as the nervous Camille drinks too much and the jealous Ugo mocks Pierre. When Camille goes round next day to apologise to Sonia, the two women begin to form a rapport. Now able to be friends with Sonia, Camille is still worried that she has not closed things with Pierre. When she goes to see him, he locks her in a room. Camille escapes by a skylight and barely makes the theater curtain call of the performance, which Sonia attends. Afterwards in a bar Arthur pretends to pursue Sonia while taking an impression of her very valuable diamond ring, which he later replaces with a worthless duplicate.  In despair at this deceit, Sonia asks Camille for help. She goes round to Arthur's flat and offers him a simple deal: he can choose to either spend the night with her and never see her afterwards, or to have her walk out on the spot. He opts for the night and, once he is asleep, she searches until she finds the ring in the kitchen. Ugo then calls on Pierre and challenges him to a duel, place and weapons to be his choice. When Pierre accepts, he finds that the place is over the flies in the theatre and the weapons are a bottle of vodka each. As Pierre is the first to fall over, Ugo wins.  In the meantime Dominique has found the Goldoni play, not in the library but in the kitchen among her mother's cookbooks. When she brings it to Ugo, roaring drunk after his duel, he says it is so valuable that she must keep it and just give him a photocopy. Camille turns up with the ring and offers it back to Sonia, who says Camille has earned it and must keep it. Reunited and now rich, Camille and Ugo look forward to the next stop on their tour.

Vanilla Sky
 From a prison cell where he has been charged with murder, David Aames ([[Tom Cruise]]), in a prosthetic mask, tells his life story to court psychologist, Dr. Curtis McCabe ([[Kurt Russell]]).  In flashback, David is shown to be the wealthy owner of a large publishing firm in New York City which he inherited from his father, leaving its regular duties to his father's trusted associates. As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle, he is introduced to Sofia Serrano ([[Penélope Cruz]]) by his best friend, author Brian Shelby ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) at a party. David and Sofia spend a night together talking and fall in love. When David's former lover, Julianna "Julie" Gianni ([[Cameron Diaz]]), hears of Sofia, she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash. Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely disfigured,<ref></ref> leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries. With no hope of repairing the damage through plastic surgery, David cannot come to grips with the idea of wearing the mask for the rest of his life. On a night out with Sofia and Brian, David gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian leave him to wallow in the street outside.  David is awakened the next day in the street by Sofia, who apologises for deserting him the night before, and takes him home. The two continue to see each other, and David has his face surgically repaired despite being told it was impossible before. Though his life seems perfectly content, David finds oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man at a bar ([[Noah Taylor]]) that tells him David could control the world and everyone in it, if he wanted to. One day, when he goes to Sofia's apartment, he finds Julie there instead; all of the previous mementos of Sofia now show Julie's face. Angry and confused by alternating visions of Julie and Sophia, David suffocates Julie (who is revealed by the image of dark hair to be Sofia).  He is subsequently arrested and placed in a mental institution, finding his face has reverted to its previously disfigured state.  David completes telling his story to Curtis, who proceeds to then visit David further for more sessions to try to help him recuperate. During one interview Curtis tells David the staff reported him calling out "Ellie" in a bad dream and asks who she is. David later sees a nearby TV advertisement for "Life Extension", a company that specializes in [[cryonic]] suspension, and realises he'd actually called out the letters "L" and "E". Under Curtis' and a police officer's guard, David is taken to the Life Extension offices, where salesclerk Rebecca ([[Tilda Swinton]]) explains they freeze people just after the point of death until a cure for their ailment is available in the future, keeping their brain active by placing them in a [[lucid dream]] state. David becomes anxious and breaks free of Curtis, realizing he is in his own lucid dream that has gone wrong, and calls for tech support.  David finds himself in the empty lobby of the offices, and the man he saw earlier at the bar appears, claiming to be David's tech support from Life Extension, which is now known as the Oasis Project. They ride up in an elevator to the top of an impossibly tall building, the height triggering David's severe [[acrophobia]]. The man explains that David has been in cryonic sleep for 150 years. David had opted for Life Extension's services after struggling with his breakup with Sofia and his disfigurement, and after securing the publishing company to its associates, proceeded to kill himself with a drug overdose; Life Extension preserved his body and, as David directed, put him into his lucid dream starting from the drunken night when Sofia left him, under the "vanilla sky" from a [[Claude Monet|Monet]] painting. However, during his sleep, the dream went horribly wrong and attempted to incorporate elements from his subconscious, such as substituting Julie for Sofia and creating a father-figure in Curtis. As they arrive at the top of the building, the man offers David a choice: either to be reinserted into the corrected lucid dream, or return to the real world by taking a literal [[leap of faith]] off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David decides to wake up, ignoring the vision of Curtis that his subconscious has brought to life to talk him out of it. David envisions Sofia and Brian to say his goodbyes. Conquering his final fear, David jumps off the building, his life flashing before his eyes, and whites out immediately before hitting the ground. A female voice commands him to "open your eyes" (a recurring theme in the movie), and the film ends with David opening his eyes.  ===Alternate ending version===  The 2015 Blu-ray release offers the option to watch the film with an alternate ending.   This alternate ending expands greatly upon the details at the end of the film.  While it all leads to the same conclusion, there are additional scenes, alternate takes, and alternate dialogue.  After Rebecca describes the lucid dream, David rushes out of the room but does not immediately dash towards the elevator.  He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial.  David tells him that he's only in his imagination.  Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile McCabe tries to convince him there is no music.  At this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded – David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura and tells him what happened at the end of his real life.

Varian's War
 While in Berlin during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938, journalist Varian Fry (William Hurt) witnessed the [[Nazism|Nazi]]'s brutal treatment of Jews. He was physically sick and felt helpless to help the victims that the brown-shirted thugs had clubbed to the ground. The experience left him with a resolve to do something to help the Jews.  Back in the United States, Fry begins to canvass his influential friends and acquaintances, only to find indifference and even, anti-semitism. Learning that the Nazis have targeted artists and [[intelligentsia]], he approaches the State Department with a plan and a few names including artist [[Marc Chagall]] (Joel Miller), scrawled on a list. When the State Department tries to block his plans to head back to Europe, Fry finds an ally in First lady Eleanor Roosevelt (Sheena Larkin) who intervenes on his behalf.  In 1940, heading for [[Marseille]] in Nazi-occupied [[Vichy France]], where he knows that Jewish artists have taken refuge, Fry arrives with money to bribe officials. Chagall is safely housed by [[Vice Consul]] Harry Bingham (Ted Whittall), a U.S. consulate official, but like many other expatriates, Chagall believes he is safe in France. Word spreads quickly in Marseille that an American will help Jews to escape Vichy France. In setting up an office out of his hotel room, Fry encounters Miriam Davenport (Julia Ormond) who helps him screen the numerous refugees that begin lining up at his hotel.  Two other accomplices approach Fry, Albert Hirschman (Matt Craven), a Jewish con-man that he names "Beamish", and Bill Freier (Alan Arkin), a counterfeit expert. With picture-perfect forged passes and identification cards, Fry begins to send Jewish artists out of France to Spain where they can arrange transport to the United States. Both French and German officials suspect that Fry is deceitful and assign agents such as Captain Marius Franken (Christopher Heyerdahl) to follow him.  With French [[quisling|collaborator]]s turning in Jews, an urgency to leave begins to take hold. Even Chagall now joins with author Heinrich Mann (John Dunn-Hill) and others in seeking transport out of Marseille. Fry and Davenport decide to shepherd the large group of frightened refugees, first on a train, then taking the group on a long hike through a mountain forest to a checkpoint where, if their documents will be accepted, means they will be free to enter neutral Spain.  Despite some near misses, the Jewish artists, musicians, authors, painters, sculptors and other "elites" make their way to freedom. Fry's clandestine underground escape route over the [[Pyrenees]] eventually brings more than 2,000 Jewish exiles including Marc Chagall and Bella Chagall, [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Franz Werfel]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]], among others, out of Vichy France.

Vidocq (2001 film)
 In 1830, in Paris, a private investigator Eugene Francois Vidocq is pursuing a man, who is masked with a mirror, throughout the city. The chase eventually leads them to a glass factory. The masked man lures Vidocq into a furnace room and, after a brief struggle, manages to push him into the furnace. Hanging onto the ledge, Vidocq asks him to reveal his face. The masked man obliges, and Vidocq lets go of the ledge, falling into the fire.  The news of Vidocq's death spread through the city, greatly upsetting his co-worker, Nimier. A young journalist named Etienne Boisset comes to Nimier, stating that he is writing Vidocq's biography, and asks Nimier to recount the events leading to Vidocq's death. Although Nimier is reluctant and hostile at first, Boisset states that he plans to find  Vidocq's murderer and reveal his name, thus avenging Vidocq. Nimier starts to tell his story.  His story begins with Lautrennes, chief of Paris police, asking Vidocq and Nimier to investigate the deaths of two rich men - Belmont and Veraldi, who both died after being struck by lightning. Lautrennes believes that this is an attempt to undermine the French military, since without Belmont and Veraldi, the cannon factory has halted its production, and the country is on the edge of a riot due to resource shortages. Reluctantly, Vidocq obliges. He and Nimier head on to the cannon factory where Belmont and Veraldi were working, and interrogate the crew. They see one of the workers catch fire from his clothes being drenched with powder and realize that the victims didn't die due to the lighting strike, but instead due to catching on fire from the lightning strike. They interrogate the servant who cleaned their suits, and he confesses that he received a letter written in blood, ordering him not to clean Belmont's and Veraldi's jackets, along with some money. The investigators realize that the lighting was directed to hit them and ignite the powder, but in order to do that, a metallic object would have to have been inserted into the hats of the victims. They search the hats and discover metallic pins decorated with monkey heads. At this point in the story, Nimier passes out from his drinking, and Boisset leaves.  Meanwhile, Lautrennes orders another one of his investigators, Tauzet, to investigate Vidocq's death. Tauzet interrogates the workers at the glass factory who recall seeing Vidocq, but fail to recall anything else, leading Lautrennes to suspect that they are hiding something.  Boisset waits until Nimier leaves his office, and then sneaks in to obtain the pins that were used to direct the lightning. He later visits Preah, a dancer in the brothel, and tells her he tracked the pins to her due to their unusual design. Preah tells him that Vidocq also tracked her down via those same pins, and that she told Vidocq that she received a letter, seemingly written by a woman, asking her to put the pins in the hats of Belmont and Veraldi, along with some money. She also told him that the letter included the third target - Ernest Lafitte, a manager of an orphan home. According to Preah, Vidocq hurried into the city to rescue Lafitte, but was unable to save him from the masked murderer. Vidocq pursued the murderer who seemed to possess unnatural magical powers. The murderer was able to escape using his mask, which appeared to be made from a strange reflective surface. After this incident, Vidocq continued the investigation alone - he did not want to attract the attention of the police to Preah, since they were involved romantically. Preah thus blames herself for Vidocq's death.  Boisset continues his investigation, leading him to Sylvia, the brothel manager, a journalist named Froissard who was also investigating the murderer with the mirror mask, and Marine Lafitte, the wife of Ernest Lafitte. Boisset interrogates them and they tell him that Lafitte, Belmont and Veraldi were self-obsessed naricissists, who only had one concern on their minds - to prevent death by aging. A man with a mirror mask, who called himself the Alchemist, offered them an elixir of eternal youth in return for their cooperation in capturing young maidens from all around France to be used in his experiments. The three rich men went along at first, but later refused to cooperate due to an immense sense of guilt. The Alchemist, therefore, turned on them and killed them. After Boisset finishes his interrogation and leaves, the Alchemist arrives, killing both Froissard and Marine Lafitte. Boisset's investigation attracts the attention of Tauzet, who notices that the Alchemist keeps disposing of the witnesses, and suspects that Boisset will be next. He also informs Lautrennes that it is unlikely that the murders were motivated politically, because Lafitte had nothing to do with cannon production. Still, the city falls into chaos, with royal armies unable to hold the rebels back without Belmont and Veraldi.   Boisset comes back to Vidocq's office for his final notes, where he encounters Lautrennes, Tauzet and several policemen. Lautrennes attempts to arrest Boisset, implying Boisset's and Vidocq's connection to murders, but Boisset manages to escape. As he reads Vidocq's notes, it is revealed that Vidocq managed to find the Alchemist's lab. He discovered that the Alchemist was using the maidens' blood to create substance for his mask, which is used to suck the souls out of his victims, granting the wearer of the mask eternal youth. The Alchemist showed up and attacked Vidocq and they fought. During the fight, the Alchemist showed off some more magical powers while sometimes grunting like a man, and sometimes moaning like a woman. The fight ended with Vidocq breaking a piece off of the Alchemist's mask and the Alchemist disappearing. Vidocq's final note states that the Alchemist would need an ally, who would shape the mask from the raw substance, leading him to the glass factory. Boisset meets up with Nimier and Preah, and they head to the place of Vidocq's death. Tauzet and Lautrennes also arrive, having followed Boisset's trail. Nimier reveals that the workers are ready to confess collaborating with the Alchemist in exchange for protection, and they all decide to join forces to figure everything out. When they reach the factory, Vidocq himself comes out of hiding - he reveals that he jumped into a secret hole in the furnace, having seen its reflection in the Alchemist's mask as he was taking it off. Vidocq states that he faked his own death to confuse his enemy. He also identifies Boisset as the Alchemist, stating that he figured the Alchemist's plan to poise as a journalist to destroy clues that might implicate him, and to find out who knows what about the case. Boisset puts on a mirror mask, transforming into the Alchemist. Nimier attempts to shoot him, but the Alchemist kills him using his magical powers. Vidocq then pursues the Alchemist into the hall of mirrors, which he has specially arranged in advance. Upon entering, the Alchemist is stunned by his own reflection. Vidocq forces him to look into a mirror, thus freeing all the souls trapped inside the mask, before impaling the Alchemist with a shard of mirror and throwing him into a river. Although the other characters insist that the Alchemist is dead, Vidocq is not satisfied, wanting to see the body.  Later, a funeral is held for Nimier, attended by all the surviving major characters. It is revealed that the revolution turned out successful, and that Lautrennes is going to be either jailed or executed, though he is not too worried about his own fate. As the characters walk away, the Alchemist's laugh can be heard in the distance.  
Visitor Q
 The film's plot is often compared to [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pier Paolo Pasolini's]] ''[[Teorema (film)|Teorema]]'', in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.<ref></ref>  The film starts off with a question: "Have you ever done it with your Dad?"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her.  Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths.  Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen).  They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along.  In the next scene, called "Have you ever been hit on the head?", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason.  The film then moves on to a scene titled "Have you ever hit your mom?" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten.  Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him.  He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick.  Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot [[fireworks]] through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user.  On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner. The father announces that the man will be staying with the family for a while. The son comes down while they are eating and starts beating the mother again. This does not surprise or bother the father, or the visitor. Later, the father is seen watching one of his old tapes, and it turns out that he was raped by a group of teenagers.  The next day, the father is on his way to work when he sees his son being beaten and robbed by some children from school. He films it from a distance and appears very pleased with the footage.  The mother, meanwhile, is getting ready for work. The viewer discovers her body is covered in marks from where the son has hurt her. She also has a limp.  The father meets with a female co-worker (Asako Murata), who believes he is going too far in his work. The mother, working as a prostitute, is whipping a customer with a belt (at his request). She then goes to buy some drugs.  When she gets home, she discovers the pieces from her jigsaw have been arranged so as to form a trail through the house and ending at a photograph of her daughter. The visitor is at home and he introduces her to lactation sex (squeezing her nipples to make her [[lactation|lactate]], a recurring theme in this film). The son sees this while hiding behind the door.  At dinner, the mother is much happier than usual, and has prepared a nice meal. The son, however, is sullen and throws a bowl of hot soup at her face. The wife—instead of being downtrodden, as usual—comes back with a carving knife and throws it at the head of her son, who dodges just in time. Everyone is very pleased, except the son. However, the father becomes exhilarated when the schoolchildren start attacking his house with fireworks again, which he videotapes. Meanwhile, the mother and the visitor continue to eat peacefully.  Next day, the son is bullied again. The father is taping his son from his car with the visitor and his female co-worker. The co-worker gets fed up with the father and tries to leave. The father follows her on foot and sexually assaults her while the visitor, emotionally neutral, tapes the scene. The father unintentionally chokes his victim to death.  He takes her body back home and puts her in the greenhouse. The visitor is still taping, at the father's instruction. The father sends the visitor to get garbage bags from the mother. But when the visitor asks her for them she takes her clothes off and reveals she is dressed in a garbage bag. She then makes herself lactate and produces a rain of human milk that covers the floor while the visitor watches from underneath an umbrella.  During this time, the husband is drawing on the woman’s body to mark the best places to cut it up so the smaller pieces will fit in the bags. He tapes this for his documentary. Becoming aroused, the father has sex with the dead body. He then notices she is getting wet and is amazed that this is possible for a dead woman. When he brings his hand up, however, it is covered in feces. He then discovers that his penis is stuck inside the corpse due to [[Rigor mortis]]. The mother comes out to help and rushes to the shop to buy lots of oils and vinegar. She empties the bottles into the bath with her husband and the corpse. This does not help, though, so she gives him a shot of heroin, which frees him. They are both exhilarated.  The visitor has filmed the whole scene.  Later on, the couple is having fun dismembering the female co-worker's corpse when the son turns up in the front yard with the same children beating him. The parents rush out and with great pleasure they finally kill all the bullies using the axes and knives they were using to cut the co-worker's body to pieces. Later, their son is shown lying on the floor in the puddle of maternal milk. He thanks the visitor for bringing together the family through the chaos he brought.  The visitor leaves the family. Afterwards, encountering and being propositioned by the prostitute daughter on the street, he hits her on the head with a rock. The daughter has returned home due to the visitor, and she and her father share a nursing session on the mother.  
Viktor Vogel – Commercial Man
 During a meeting between [[Opel]] and the advertising agency ''Brainstorm'', Viktor Vogel sneaks in and offers his views on how the agency's new campaign is boring and lacking in irony. This helps the already dissatisfied Opel people tell Brainstorm they need to come up with a new idea as they leave. After some discussion at Brainstorm the agency decides that they need to find Viktor, whom they threw out after the meeting, and hire him to work on the campaign. Eventually Viktor becomes the partner of Edward Kaminsky, a veteran ad man who is hoping to retire soon and they begin work on an idea that will keep Brainstorm alive through Opel's money.  Meanwhile, Viktor meets the artist Rosa and begins a relationship, albeit rocky at first. While at a party that Rosa has thrown, Viktor and Rosa work out an idea for a gallery exhibit where Rosa is in a shopping mart hunting (literally) for her groceries. Sometime later at a meeting with Opel, Viktor accidentally happens to blurt out the idea, which Opel loves, and they are told to begin work on the idea.  Now Viktor, torn between his work and his girlfriend, must decide what is most important to him. Edward tells him that all he has to do is pay her for the idea, but Viktor knows that for this artist the idea is more important than money. However, Rosa's parents feel that they can butt into her life all the time because they give her an allowance and Viktor, seeing this as his opportunity to save himself from his mistake, tries to convince her that this is her opportunity to liberate herself from this cycle. With no exhibit Rosa is now forced to create something for the gallery that already has her booked and she ends up being turned into a dove as a magic act.  In an attempt to help out his new friend, Viktor, Kaminsky tries to get the agency to change from the hunting idea to something else, which inadvertently gets him let go from the firm. After this, Eddie hatches a plan which culminates with Viktor defecting from Brainstorm and stealing a client in the process. Viktor tries to patch things up with his girlfriend, but as she is still a dove we are left to our own imagination about how it will work out.

Waking Life
 ''Waking Life'' is about an unnamed young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an [[existential crisis]]. For most of the film, he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters—ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends—about such issues as [[metaphysics]], [[free will]], [[social philosophy]], and the [[meaning of life]]. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, [[Situationist International|situationist]] politics, [[posthumanity]], the film theory of [[André Bazin]], and [[lucid dreaming]], and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.  Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional [[false awakening]]s. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.  The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to accept God's invitation.  The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the car's handle, but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.

He tries to remind him of their original deal, but Mr. Ma sends him away. Kyung-soo finally fights Mr. Ma during the climax of the film and after a lengthy battle is able to defeat him. Opening the box, Kyung-soo reveals there is no manuscript to the shock of Hak-sa and the remaining four teachers. However, the students don't care and they realized the meaning Hak-rim's words about the manuscript being a metaphor because he knew Kyung-soo was the one who was able to restore order in the school.

California has the largest [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population in the United States with 278 tribal nations, more than any other state in the country. The history of [[California Indians]] is brutal and devastating, but few Americans, including Californians, know anything about these tribes.

Wasabi (film)
 A woman (later revealed to be a transvestite), dancing provocatively to the enjoyment of other nightclub patrons, is abruptly hit in the face by Hubert Florentini (Reno), a commisaire of the French Police. Florentini drags her out of the club in handcuffs, assaulting other patrons who come too close to free the captive woman or attempt to hinder his exit. Unfortunately, one of these patrons includes the chief's son.  Hubert Florentini is chastised for the violent and unorthodox methods that he uses to accomplish his goals and is put on paid leave from the force. Despite his success and his seemingly enjoyable lifestyle of fighting crime, playing golf, and being the object of a beautiful woman's (Bouquet's) attentions, he has been unable to forget his one true love, Miko, a Japanese spy he met 19 years prior. Upon receiving news of her death, he is summoned to Japan by her lawyer, Ishibashi (Haruhiko Hirata) for the reading of her will.  Ishibashi informs Florentini that he has inherited the guardianship of Yumi (Hirosue), a fiery, adorable and eccentric Japanese/French teenage girl over whom he has custody until she reaches adulthood in two days (the age of adulthood in Japan being 20). Yumi, who was led to believe she was the result of her mother's rape and subsequent abandonment, hates her unknown father. Hubert realizes Yumi is his daughter, but doesn't tell her as she would probably flee from him.  Florentini uncovers evidence that Miko was the victim of foul play.  He discovers that Miko had stolen a small fortune from the [[Yakuza]], a fortune now destined for Yumi upon reaching adulthood. Florentini summons the help of Momo (Michel Muller), a former intelligence colleague living in Tokyo. He helps Florentini with further investigations into Miko's death and in guarding Yumi from the Yakuza by supplying him with two metal suitcases of weapons. The Yakuza try to attack Yumi in an arcade, but Florentini, who has been observing their positions, kills all of them.  Later, Yumi discovers that Florentini is her father as she is captured by the Yakuza. As they take her away and prepare to execute Florentini, he uses golf balls to knock out his would-be executioners and knock out the rest in mêlée combat. With the help of former intelligence colleagues, Florentini and Momo free Yumi from her kidnappers when they attempt to withdraw money from Yumi's bank account by replacing the bank's staff and customers with their own men. During the rescue attempt a gunfight breaks out and all of the Yakuza are killed by Florentini single-handedly without any casualties to the good guys.  Following the ordeal, Florentini takes a flight back to France, having promised Yumi he would be back in a month. But just before the plane takes off, a group of customs officers enter the cabin with two familiar metal suitcases in hand, asking for their owner.

Mary, however, is not impressed and instead remains focused on her ambition to become a partner at the wedding company she works for. As a way to persuade her boss, Geri ([[Kathy Najimy]]), to accept her as a partner, Mary pursues and is hired by catering heiress, Fran Donolly ([[Bridgette Wilson|Bridgette Wilson-Sampras]]) to plan her society wedding to long term boyfriend 'Eddie.' While on the phone reporting her success Mary's shoe heel gets stuck in a manhole cover. While she attempts to free herself a taxi collides with a dumpster and it comes hurtling towards her. A man standing nearby rushes in and pulls her away just before the dumpster crashes. Mary manages to thank the man before fainting.  She later wakes up in hospital and the man who saved her is revealed to be the local [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]], Steve Edison ([[Matthew McConaughey]]).

A few days later Mary and Fran are at another of Mary’s weddings and Fran teases her for her dreamy look before Mary tells her about her movie date. Later on Mary is attending a dance lesson with another of her clients. Fran is also attending and introduces Mary to her fiancé 'Eddie' who turns out to be Steve. When Fran leaves the pair to dance together Mary angrily rebukes him for leading her on and going behind Fran’s back.  Mary is left wondering whether she should continue to plan Fran and Steve's wedding, while Steve is left wondering whether his chemistry with Mary is a sign that he shouldn’t be marrying Fran. Penny persuades Mary that her career is more important than whatever attraction she might have felt for Steve and Steve's colleague persuades him that the connection he had with Mary was just the result of pre-wedding nerves.  When they arrive at a potential wedding venue in [[Napa Valley]], Massimo appears and, to Mary's confusion and horror, introduces himself as her fiancé. Later when the four of them, along with Fran’s parents, are riding on horseback through the estate, Mrs Donolly’s singing frightens Mary's horse and it rushes off with a terrified Mary clinging on. Steve instantly gallops after Mary and rescues her from the out of control horse. When the pair are alone he bitterly rebukes her for condemning his actions when she was also engaged.  At home, Mary’s father excitedly talks about her upcoming wedding, only for her to reveal that she and Massimo are not engaged before scolding her father for trying to arrange her marriage. Her father then reveals that his wedding with her mother, which Mary had always seen as the perfect marriage, was actually arranged and only became a loving relationship months later, leaving Mary feeling very confused.  Mary, Fran and Steve visit another potential wedding venue. Differences in opinion between the couple begin to emerge but Steve agrees with whatever makes Fran happy. Fran reveals she is going on a week-long business trip, and leaves Mary and Steve to continue with the wedding preparations. The two apologize to each other for their angry words, and soon start becoming friends. While looking for flowers, however, they run into a couple, Keith and Wendy, both whom Mary knows from her past. When Steve asks how they all know each other, Mary reveals that Keith used to be her fiancé. But Wendy was his secret high-school girlfriend, and she caught him cheating after seeing them making out in her car on the night of their rehearsal dinner.  That night, Mary ends up getting so drunk that she winds up going in the middle of the road, and then struggles to get back in her apartment building. She then breaks down and laments over Keith being married and expecting a baby while she is still alone and miserable. Steve finally manages to get them in Mary's apartment when another tenant opens the door for them. Mary sobers and Steve decides to stay with her for a while. During that time, he comforts her and insists that Keith was a fool to pick Wendy over her. He then leaves but quickly returns and confesses that he has feelings for Mary. She sadly replies that she respects Fran too much to let anything happen between them and sends Steve away.  Fran returns early from her trip and comes to speak with Mary. Mary fears that Steve has revealed his feelings for her but instead Fran reveals she doesn't know if she is in love with Steve anymore. Ignoring her heart, Mary persuades Fran to go ahead with the wedding. At a birthday party they are both attending, Massimo offers Mary a heartfelt proposal and after a little hesitation she finally agreed to marry him. The two couples prepare for their weddings. When the day arrives Mary leaves Penny to coordinate the Donolly wedding before she goes to the town hall to marry Massimo. Before the wedding starts, Steve takes Fran for a walk and asks her if they’re doing the right thing. Fran eventually admits that she doesn't want to get married. The pair part as friends and Fran leaves to go on their honeymoon alone. Penny, surprised at seeing this, comes over to Steve. When asking her where Mary is, Penny then reveals her marriage plans to Steve and he rushes off to stop her.  At the town hall, Massimo and Mary prepare to marry but her father stops the ceremony, realizing that the wedding is what he wants for her and not what she wants. Mary, who has given up on true love, insists that life isn’t a fairytale and marrying Massimo is the right thing to do. But later, she realizes that he is not the one and ends up leaving the ceremony after all.  Steve arrives to find Mary's father and Massimo outside. Massimo reveals that he couldn't go ahead with the wedding knowing that Mary was not in love with him and actually in love with Steve. Steve reveals his feelings to Mary’s father, who tells him to go and get her. Steve and Massimo ride off on Massimo's scooter to the park where another outdoor movie is starting.

What's the Worst That Could Happen?
 Kevin Caffrey, a thief and connoisseur is at a local auction looking for things worth stealing. He meets Amber Belhaven who is auctioning off her father's painting to pay a hotel bill. When Kevin asks Amber about her hotel room which leads to Amber asking if he was trying to sleep with her, Kevin blinks rapidly and lies while also telling her that when he blinks he lies. When Kevin asks Amber if he could see her sometime Amber pretends to have the same thing Kevin has and says yes. While knowing what hotel she was staying in, he shows up to her room with the painting she auctioned off, having stolen it. Kevin tells Amber about his stealing business which shocks Amber at first but she accepts it in order to be with Kevin, and she later gives Kevin her father's lucky ring.   Elsewhere, Max Fairbanks, a snarky businessman whose company, TUI, is going into [[bankruptcy]], is going over with his lawyer Walter Greenbaum on how to save his company. Walter is exhausted as Max does not take the proceeding seriously and still spends freely even asking to declare bankruptcy immediately without trying to budget so his assets are protected. He tells his wife Lutetia Fairbanks that his company is in a technical procedure to disguise what his company is really going into. Kevin goes to a local bar which his Uncle Jack owns to see Amber. Whilst inside he also runs into his friend Berger, who is also a thief and happens to know what places to hit. While having Kevin going outside to tell him about Max Fairbanks, he shows him an article about Max's current situation with his company, as well as what he couldn't access due to the critical condition of the [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]] code which includes going into his beachfront mansion.  Kevin and Berger go to the house to rob it, but Max captures Kevin. Before the police take Kevin away, Max spots Amber's ring and tells the police that the ring was also stolen. Kevin is forced to hand over the ring. After escaping from the police, Kevin returns to the beach house to get his ring back from Max, but fails to find him. Angry at Max, Kevin finishes off what he started by robbing Max of the valuables inside the house and one of Max's three cars outside. Kevin tells Amber that the ring was stolen from him.   The next day an exasperated Walter informs Max he was banned from his summer house, and his being there breached the terms of his bankruptcy. Max flippantly says he'll be fine as the ring is his lucky charm. Meanwhile, Kevin and Berger hire Shelly Nix, a computer hacker, to track Max's whereabouts by hacking into his e-mail. During an airplane flight, Max talks to his associate Gloria, a psychic, about the ring. Gloria consults her cards, and draws a king with five daggers on his head. Shocked at the result, Gloria doesn't tell Max what she drew and pretends that her phone connection is breaking up. Max meets a judge that he thought he paid off to keep his house, but his insults lead to the judge ordering him to sell his house and his contents at a public auction.  Upon knowing Max's plan to go to a cocktail party and then head to his beach house for one final visit, Kevin and Berger, with the help of their partners Windham and Edwina, rob another one of Max's houses. The next morning Max finds out that his house has been robbed and meets with Detective Alex Tardio of the Robbery Division. Having enough of Kevin stealing from him, he calls his head of security, Earl Redburn.   Kevin finds out from Shelly that Max is going to [[Washington, D.C.]], for a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing and has an apartment there. Kevin and Berger go to Washington to try and rob Max's apartment. There, Kevin learns that Max intends to secretly [[Bribery|bribe]] the senators, and replaces the bribe money with insulting notes in Max's name. Max and Earl later storm into the apartment, having deduced Kevin's presence there. In the ensuing scuffle, Kevin tries to steal back the ring, but instead steals Max's wedding ring. Afterwards, Amber decides that Kevin's feud with Max has gone too far and that she no longer cares about the ring. While Max later addresses the Senate Committee he gets a call from Kevin who tells him that if Max will give him his ring back he will give him back his. Max refuses and proceeds to repeatedly curse at Kevin. To the senators, and other viewers, it appears he is speaking to them, with the result being that the hearing ends very badly for Max. While going back to his apartment in Philadelphia, Walter quits as his lawyer and Earl tells him that he was hacked; Max tells Earl his plan to get Kevin once and for all.   Kevin goes to Jack to find out where Amber is; Jack tells Kevin to stop robbing Max out of personal conflict and to forget about the ring. But when Berger tells Kevin about Max's bankruptcy auction and for how much his auction full of valuables is worth, Jack wants in on it too. Max gets a call from Lutetia about Max's behavior on TV, and tells him not to come home, while Amber breaks up with Kevin due to his obsession with Max and the ring. Lutetia finds Amber at Jack's bar wearing a jacket of hers that Kevin stole from their house and confronts her, Amber tells her that Max stole the ring she gave to Kevin. Knowing that they are both in the same situation, they come up with a plan.   Gloria, thinking about Max, still draws the same card and decides to come clean. Noticing how bad it is, she tells him to put an end to it, but Max still refuses to give up Kevin's ring. Realizing Max's arrogant determination to keep the ring, she quits being his associate, and goes to Tardio to give him Max's company records.   At the bankruptcy auction, Lutetia tells Max that she wishes him well and sends him a [[Massage|masseuse]]. While Earl keeps looking out for Kevin through his monitors, Berger, Jack, Windham, and Edwina set their scheme in motion. Edwina and Windham are disguised as waiters, with the real waiters bound and gagged in their truck. Berger is disguised as the auctioneer, while Jack is his associate, having tied up and gagged the original auctioneer.  Shelly hacks into Max's security system. The crooks steal as much as they can, and later flee. Windham plants smoke bombs to obscure their escape and calls the fire brigade. At 2:00 Shelly plants a video of Kevin delivering a message to Max that he was being robbed without him being there on Earl's monitors.   Angry and enraged, Max goes out into the smoke to find Kevin, but a firefighter, actually Kevin in disguise, drags him out of the smoke, stealing the ring in the process. Kevin steals Max's boat to escape, but Max jumps onto the boat and struggles with Kevin to get back the ring. While hitting a buoy, causing the boat to sink, Kevin and Max find out that the ring is a fake, the ring having an inscription inside it that said: "Grow up." a message that they both got from their lovers. Max realises that Lutetia had induced the masseuse to steal the ring during his massage.  When Tardio finds Max and Kevin, Kevin tells Tardio that he was saving Max, while Max corroborates his story, telling Tardio that he had never met Kevin. Kevin thanks Max and tells him that he owes him one. While going back to the hotel where Amber used to be before she moved in with Kevin, she shows him the ring, revealing that she was the masseuse. She tells Kevin that the ring had bad luck and that he should throw it away. Kevin agrees and flings the ring out of sight and gets back together with Amber. Kevin, pretending to be Max's lawyer, fixes the Senate hearing and goes into the press conference victorious. When it is over Max and Kevin part ways, but as they do so, Kevin steals one of Max's watches.  
What Time Is It There?

Lee's character, who sells watches on the streets of [[Taipei]], sells his own watch to Chen and then finds himself overcome by a desire to set every clock he sees to Paris time.

Werckmeister Harmonies
 It is set in an anonymous, desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during [[Hungarian People's Republic|Communist]] times.  The film starts with János Valuska conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs, then silences the animals. It finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight.  János' older friend György is a composer, and one of the [[intelligentsia]]. György observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). György proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious.  György's estranged wife tries to leverage her political and social status by giving György a list of names to recruit for the "clean up the town movement" (with the blessing of the police chief).  However, a stuffed smelly [[circus]] [[whale]] and its star performer, "The Prince", come to town in the silence and darkness of night. János philosophizes about God and the whale.  János goes to the [[post office]] to pick up newspapers for delivery. The workers are unsettled by the ominous signs of the circus' arrival and are disturbed by the cloud that settles over each town it visits.  György's struggling cobbler brother gets the list and passes it on to the agitated throbbing masses in the town square who are unhappy at public services failing. György's former wife sleeps with the drunk gun toting police chief.  The presence of the whale and the Prince stir up the masses. János overhears the circus master losing control of his faceless Prince, who is becoming drunk with his own voice of revolutionary dogma. The circus master disowns him. The Prince, now free, inflames the masses, and the people [[riot]]. The rioters are brutal. Their inhumanity almost seems normal and natural. When the rioters finally come to beat a helpless old naked patient, they see their impotent, sad and powerless selves.  After the riot, János comes across the diary of a rioter. It explains that the rioters did not know what they were angry with; so they were angry at everything. Then it recounts the mobs horrendous rape of two working class post office girls.  János comes across his killed cobbler neighbor who got naively involved in the riot. János is told, by this cobbler's wife, to leave town for his own safety.  He is intercepted by a [[helicopter]]. He finds himself committed to a mental institution with caged beds (a tool of the time for dealing with political dissidents). János appears drugged and broken.  György, his composer friend, is evicted from their society house but gets to live in a shed in the garden whilst György's former wife, with her new status as a collaborator, now occupies the big house with the police chief. The intelligentsia is displaced by political opportunism.  György tells a vacant János, in the ward, that if he is released from the [[mental institution]] they can live contentedly together in the shed with his piano. György also mentions that he has re-tuned the piano so that is now like any other, a personal capitulation apparently abandoning any present hopes of reform. János just stares.  It finishes with György looking directly into the eye of the whale, then, walking away and looking back at the now sad and disheveled whale, destroyed by the rioters the night before, its rotting carcass slowly enveloped by the fog which gets whiter and brighter. Warm bright sunlight returns.  
What to Do in Case of Fire?
 Set in Berlin, the film opens in 1987 to show a group of radicals battling police, but soon moves to the modern day to present the same radical characters brought together once more by an act they carried out in their anti-establishment heyday.  In 1987, the main characters of the film are [[Anarchism|anarchists]] [[squatting]] in an abandoned building in [[Kreuzberg]] and making propaganda films. In one of these films, they demonstrate how to make a homemade bomb out of a [[pressure cooker]] and chemicals available over the counter, and they plant the bomb in a vacant villa in [[Grunewald]]. However, the timer sticks, and the bomb does not go off until 12 years later, when it is jostled by a [[real estate broker]] and a potential buyer. They are injured in the blast, and the police are pressured to hunt down the "terrorists" responsible.  Two of the original anarchists, Tim (Schweiger) and Hotte (Martin Feifel), still live in the original building and engage in anti-police graffiti, anti-[[gentrification]] protests and petty theft. The current owner of the building, a [[nouveau riche]] [[Turks in Germany|Turk]] named Bülent, cannot evict them, because Hotte is disabled, having lost his legs. (It is later revealed that they were crushed by a [[water cannon]] during a [[riot]].) While Tim is out, the police raid the building in a sweep for clues to the bombing and confiscate their cache of old films, including the incriminating bomb-making film. They cart the films off to the fortresslike police headquarters, a former [[Prussia]]n military [[barracks]]. One by one, Tim and Hotte visit the former members of their group to warn them of the bust. They are distressed by the news, having gone on with their lives: Nele ([[Nadja Uhl]]) is a single mother of two young children; "Terror" (Matthias Matschke) is an [[Lawyer|attorney]]; Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) runs an advertising agency that exploits [[Extremism|radical]] imagery; and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer), Tim's former lover, has evidently gone [[bourgeois]], although her circumstances are never fully explained, and is about to get married. They balk when Tim and Hotte propose breaking into the police headquarters and destroying the evidence, but Terror's counter-suggestion that they should turn themselves in is met with even stronger disagreement, and finally the former radicals devise the plan of infiltrating the headquarters by pretending to be a [[news broadcasting|television news]] crew.  A rift within the police department makes their plan possible: Manowsky ([[Klaus Löwitsch]]), an old-school Berlin cop, wants to use aggressive tactics and avoid press coverage, while Henkel (Devid Striesow), a [[technocrat (derogatory)|technocrat]] from [[Bonn]], prefers more modern, less intrusive methods and is eager to earn good [[public relations]] for the department. Henkel gives the "TV crew" a tour of the police headquarters, including the [[property room|evidence room]] where the films are stashed. Manowsky interrupts the tour, and the former radicals barely manage to slip away.  To destroy the films, the radicals decide to smuggle a second homemade bomb into the evidence room as a [[Trojan horse]]: all the evidence is stored alphabetically according to the street where it was found, so they need only plant the bomb in a suspicious-looking crate in their old building and entice the police into picking it up. What the other radicals do not know is that Hotte intends to smuggle himself into the evidence room inside the crate along with the bomb, to make sure it's placed correctly. Hotte, without his wheelchair (he uses a [[pallet|dolly]]), is trapped in the evidence room when the emergency exit door is jammed. Frantically, he uses the phone in the room to call his compatriots, but they are all away from their phones. In desperation he calls Bülent, who at that moment is trying to talk Tim into abandoning their apartment and accepting a payoff for their few remaining goods. Tim rushes to Hotte's aid. The others eventually get Hotte's message and come to rescue him as well, but meanwhile, Manowsky intercepts Hotte and Tim in the evidence room. After a taunting lecture on their inability to let go of past ideals, Manowsky prepares to arrest the two, but the others arrive just in time to distract him. Tim seizes Manowsky's [[handcuffs]] and shackles him to the evidence cage. He threatens to leave the bomb in Manowsky's lap, but the others persuade him not to commit outright murder. Tim tosses Manowsky the handcuff keys, and the radicals flee as an alarm sounds.  Pursued by police through the headquarters, the former radicals stumble upon a water cannon and use it to drive back the police and escape. As Manowsky and Henkel observe their flight, Henkel confidently predicts that the evidence will lead to their capture. However, Manowskymoved by the radicals' compassion, by his annoyance with Henkel and by reflection on his own long-held idealshas left the bomb in the evidence room, and it destroys the evidence.  The group of friends walk through the streets of Berlin and end up on the floor of a [[S-Bahn]] car. Tim then pulls the incriminating film out of his bag, holds a lighter to it, and asks aloud: "What do you do if there's a fire?", and the friends answer, "Let it burn!"  The film contains mild nudity, mild drug use, and mature language.  
When Good Ghouls Go Bad
  Danny Walker ([[Joe Pichler]]), and his father James ([[Tom Amandes]]), who has gotten a divorce from his wife, have just moved to the town from Chicago so his father can fulfill his dream of re-opening the family [[chocolate]] factory. Danny and James are staying with James' father, known by all as "Uncle Fred" ([[Christopher Lloyd]]). Uncle Fred is considered crazy and is a bit childish, but Danny loves him very much. Danny dislikes his new life in Walker Falls, and it seems no one likes him, especially the [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] Mike Kankel ([[Joe Clements]]) and his son Ryan (Craig Marriott), the school's biggest bully. The only person who seems to be nice to Danny is Taylor Morgan (Imelda Corcoran), the [[School nursing|school nurse]] and James' childhood friend.  Danny is surprised by how few decorations are up with Halloween only a week away. The people of Walker Falls do not seem to be making any effort at all to celebrate the holiday. [[Sheriff]] Ed Frady (Alan Flower) even takes down the decorations that Danny puts up. When walking home from school, Ryan and his pal, Leo (Daniel Karr) push him into the cemetery, lock the gate, and tell him that Walker Falls does not celebrate Halloween because of the legend of a curse.  Years ago, Curtis Danko ([[Brendan McCarthy]]) was an artistic boy, who was ostracized by "normal" people. When competition was held for all the eighth graders to design a sculpture of their personal hero, Curtis kept his project covered during the day, then came to school at night to work by the light of captured [[Firefly|fireflies]]. On Halloween night, he went to work on his sculpture, and Mike Kankel and his friends were walking by when they saw Curtis from the window. When Kankel returned the next day, he noticed the [[kiln]] had been on all night. He opened the door and found Curtis's charred skeleton and a message in the ashes, saying that if the town ever celebrated another Halloween, he would come back and destroy them. Kankel was [[Blindness|blind]] for three days after seeing Curtis' finished statue. He said it was like being face to face with the devil himself. Everyone in the town believed the legend and, since then, Halloween has never been celebrated.  Danny thinks it is a silly story, and runs home. James is rarely around, so Uncle Fred has served as a stand-in father for Danny. That night, James is planning to announce his "Halloween Spooktacular" idea to raise funds to re-open Walker Chocolates at the town meeting. Uncle Fred and Danny try to tell him that the townspeople will be too afraid to support the spooktacular because of the curse, but James doesn't listen.  At the meeting, [[Mayor]] Churney ([[Roy Billing]]) announces his campaign for re-election. Running against him is Kankel. After the announcements, it is James' turn. He is surprised to find the people of Walker Falls shudder at just the mention of Halloween. To bring the conversation back on track, his secretary passes out samples of chocolate, but the audience isn't very enthusiastic. The meeting ends after all but a few leave the town hall. Danny's father is very upset when he learns about the legend, which has completely ruined his plans. He decides to cancel the spooktacular and get funds elsewhere.  Uncle Fred then reveals why no one likes Danny. Uncle Fred was responsible for building the kiln that killed Curtis. That night, Danny dreams he is at Curtis's crypt and sees the cloth being ripped off the statue. That morning, there is a commotion outside the house. A large pile of [[pumpkin]]s has been discovered in the town center. It finally looks like Walker Falls might celebrate another Halloween. But when Uncle Fred lifts a pumpkin as he says "Happy Halloween", the entire pile rolls on top of him, killing him. Everyone in town is at Uncle Fred's funeral and Danny is very sad. As a memento, he lets his grandfather's favorite car shoot down the track and rest with his coffin.  However, because of Uncle Fred's love of Halloween, the magic in the cemetery allows him to return as a [[zombie]]. Unfortunately, that same magic awoke others from their slumber, including Curtis. The zombies begin capturing all the townsfolk and gathering them to the creepy old Victorian style house chanting the phrase "Statue." Meanwhile, Danny and his crush, Dayna Stenson ([[Brittany Byrnes]]) try to explain to James and Nurse Taylor the situation. Uncle Fred reveals his zombie self to his son and Nurse Taylor, both fainting in the process. Zombies break into the house and Uncle Fred explains that Curtis might be behind the zombies awakening and tells them to escape while he holds the other zombies off. Unfortunately, he, his son, and Nurse Taylor are all captured, one of the zombies stating that Uncle Fred was the main part of the plan.  When everyone is gathered, Curtis reveals himself to the people. As he is about to reveal his statue, he is attacked and literally torn apart by Kankel. However, because Curtis is a zombie, he manages himself to pull himself together, and scare the wits out of Kankel. As Curtis pulls off the shroud off his statue, everyone covers their eyes in fear. Surprisingly, nothing happens. Everyone uncovers their eyes and Curtis' statue is revealed to be of Uncle Fred. Curtis then shows Uncle Fred a picture of the two of them, Uncle Fred shaking Curtis' hand, as it implied that Curtis looked up to him. Uncle Fred, still guilty about Curtis' death, wonders why he was a hero to Curtis as it was his kiln that killed him. Curtis then turns to Kankel and points to him, naming him as his killer.  Kankel confesses that the night Curtis died, he was working on the statue of Uncle Fred and as a prank to scare him, Kankel, Frady, and his group pushed Curtis into the kiln and locked him in it then taunting him. Suddenly, the janitor appeared and Kankel's group ran off. While cleaning the class, the janitor accidentally turned on the kiln not realizing Curtis was in it. The next day, Kankel went inside the kiln and saw Curtis' corpse as well as the completed statue of Uncle Fred. To hide his crime, he made up the curse as pretending his eyes were burned when he saw the statue to make it seem like it was Curtis' doing. Kankel also reveals that the statue of Uncle Fred would have been voted to be put in town square, instead of Kankel's statue of his father. It's revealed that Uncle Fred donated much time and money to the town's children, promoting creativity and imagination; thus, he was loved by many children; explaining why he was called "Uncle Fred" and why much of his actions were seen as childish to some. Kankel wouldn't stand for someone to promote things that were "girly" and wanted things "manly." However, Kankel's action earns him the wrath of his father Pops Kankel (Gordon Boyd), who is among the group of zombies and is upset at what he has done. He then grabs his son's ear and drags him out to "give him a whooping he won't forget for years."  By the end, the zombies and the townspeople applaud Curtis' statue. With that, Curtis has accomplished what he's done and bids farewell to the town, disappearing into the night, returning to his crypt to finally rest. Meanwhile, the other zombies bid farewell. Uncle Fred reconciles with his son, James, saying this will be the last time he will see him on Earth, but he'll always be watching him on the other side. He then leaves with his wife (Jenny Dibley) and the two join the other zombies, sharing one final dance with the fireflies, as all the entities slowly disappear dancing into the night. Danny and Dayna share a kiss, while James and Taylor hold hands as they watch the dancing zombies fade into the night.  By the end, German investors that spoke to James earlier loved the concept of Halloween and decide to support him into reopening the family chocolate factory within two weeks. On Halloween day, children are seen dressing up in costumes and going trick-or-treating as a girl from one of the Halloween groups goes to Uncle Fred's statue in town square, where they're passing by, and says "Happy Halloween." Then, after the girl leaves, Uncle Fred's voice is heard one last time replying back "Happy Halloween."

Who Is Cletis Tout?
 The film is told primarily in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], as the film first follows a hitman, Critical Jim ([[Tim Allen]]), who follows and holds at gunpoint a man he believes is Cletis Tout - but who actually is Finch ([[Christian Slater]]). Because Critical Jim is so fond of [[film noir]] and other classic films (such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''), he's willing to listen to Finch as he tells his story, imagining it as a film in progress. Finch obliges, explaining how he got to be mistaken for Cletis Tout.  Finch happened to be in the same jail with Micah ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), who stole diamonds more than 20 years before, then hid the diamonds and soon landed in prison. With Finch's help, Micah manages to break out, and the two get new identities for themselves, courtesy of a coroner ([[Billy Connolly]]) who owes Finch a favor.  The problem is that Finch's new identity is that of Cletis Tout, a photojournalist who managed to get a mafia figure's son strangling a woman on film. The head of the mafia gets his men to kill Tout (which is how the coroner got the identity for Finch), but when Finch goes to Cletis' apartment to look for his passport, a neighbor calls the police, who inform the mafia head that Cletis Tout is still alive.  After Micah meets up with his now grown-up daughter, Tess ([[Portia de Rossi]]), he's accidentally shot by the men sent to kill Cletis. Just before dying, Micah gets Finch to promise to watch after his daughter, and thus Tess and Finch begin an uneasy relationship as they look for the diamonds.  Meanwhile, the mafia head decides to bring in a professional, and subsequently calls in Critical Jim to finish the job. However, Critical Jim is more interested in where Finch's story will end - specifically, if he'll be able to reconcile with Tess in the end, giving the story a perfect Hollywood ending.

Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell
 For the third time, the evil Wishmaster returns with more evil to wreck the lives of more innocents. This time, his victim is a beautiful, innocent and studious teenage girl named Diana Collins who accidentally opened up the Djinn's tomb (a strange box with a jewel inside) and released him. After gaining his freedom, the Djinn is asked by Professor Barash to let him be the one who makes the wishes. The professor wishes for two of the world's loveliest ladies to be with him, in love.  However, as soon as the Djinn grants this wish, the women (who were dressed in very revealing belly-dancer outfits and being seductive) kill the professor; the Djinn takes the face off of the dead professor and is able to steal his identity. He then kills a secretary by her wishing for "files to burn up" but instead of the files, she burns, along with his needing the student file of Diana as an effort to find her and force her to fulfill her three wishes. While Diana is on the run, she must endeavor to prevent the Djinn from subjecting the entire world to Hell's wrath. While in a Church thinking it was safe, the Djinn is there instead of the priest where apparently her friend Ann is now the "professor's Teaching Assistant" and made the wish of "wanting to lose a little weight" to which she pukes up her guts in pain. Diana uses her first wish for her to stop having pain, but of course that to the Djinn means to kill Ann.  Diana noting that she is in a St. Michael church, uses another wish to summon [[Michael (archangel)|the archangel Michael]] who possesses the body of her boyfriend, Greg (it was about to be her body, but Greg pushed her away as the spirit went into him). A slight fight ensues with the Djinn actually somewhat winning, but Michael and Diana escape into a stage theater. Meanwhile as the Djinn tries to follow them, he goes a different way and encounters a female student named Elinor who puts the moves on him, and then wishes for him to "break her heart", in which he literally does resulting in her death. Next, the Djinn goes into the room of Diana where her friend Billy is, with some sort of strangling him Billy tells the Djinn to "blow him" in which he does blow his body into a wooded head of a [[bull]] in which the horns pierce into the body of Billy in which the bleeding kills him. The Djinn then picks up a photo of Diana and her friends, and threatens to hurt Katie unless Diana makes her 3rd wish. Michael has revealed to her that only her using his sword can she kill the Djinn, but she isn't ready and when he does try to give her the sword, it severely burns her arm, but Michael heals it.  Katie happens to find the dead body of Billy and finds herself being pursued by the Djinn in a chase, it ends in a science room as the Djinn tricks her into thinking she could successfully hide from him, and then she wishes "for a place to hide" with him sticking her head into a cage of lab rats that presumably nibble at her head, resulting in her death. A 2nd battle ensues between Michael and the Djinn, actually resulting in the Djinn's hand being cut off by the sword, but it grows back. Michael is now in a car with Diana but then the Djinn runs to the car, jumps on top of it, and tries to hurt them but then Diana drives his side unto another car, thus making him fall off. In a twist, she then drives into an information post and the car in flipped into a similar position in which her parents died in a car crash explosion, luckily this time no fatalities as it blows up. In the end, Diana's attempt to commit suicide by jumping off a building which if killed her would have the Djinn defeated (but then the Djinn saved her) actually gives her the ability to wield Michael's sword and she kills the Djinn with it, but is fatally injured when they both fall in the process. Michael heals her wounds before returning to Heaven, and Diana is finally able to admit she loves her boyfriend, who has returned to normal, though injured.  
Women Talking Dirty
  The story begins with Cora ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]) and Ellen ([[Gina McKee]]), two women in their thirties who are living in [[Edinburgh]]. While they are getting ready at a mirror they begin to discuss life and romance. The story then catapults itself into the past before the two women met and where their story really begins.  Quirky Cora is an aspiring biochemist with intention to go to university but ends up taking a jump towards late teenage rebellion in which she tries drugs and drinks excessively.  After moving in with her boyfriend, Cora discovers she's pregnant and immediately all her dreams are shattered as she becomes a pregnant housewife who is eventually dumped by her passionate but slovenly boyfriend.  Ellen on the other hand is strait-laced and level-headed; a budding cartoonist with prospects to run her own business alongside her colleague Stanley ([[James Nesbitt]]). While out for a drink at her local pub, womanizing Daniel ([[James Purefoy]]), makes a pass at her and she is instantly smitten. Ellen invites Daniel to meet her very prim and proper mother who is instantly reviled by Daniel's revelation that he is writing a dissertation on the post-coital discussions women have with men after sleeping with them. Despite her mother's attempt to talk Ellen into dumping Daniel, Ellen decides to accept Daniel's marriage proposal and soon weds him, delighted with his wedding gift of a purple velvet Victorian style couch.  Not long into their marriage Ellen's hopes of having a family are forced out of the picture when Daniel reveals he doesn't want children. Despite being married, Daniel is still womanizing and gambling excessively (even stealing money from Ellen's purse). After a confrontation with Daniel after she discovers he has been cheating on her, Ellen walks out and goes to the pub to think things over. There she meets a heavily pregnant Cora. Despite their obvious differences, they immediately become friends and Ellen even becomes Cora's coach as she goes into hospital to give birth to her son Sam.  A year and a half later, Cora is given a night of freedom from her children when her parents offer to babysit. She goes to the pub and calls Ellen, hoping to convince her friend to join her. Daniel, however, picks up the phone, as Ellen is out. Daniel shows up at the pub where he deliberately and successfully seduces Cora, fully aware that she doesn't know what he looks like. After the one-night stand, Cora is horrified when Daniel turns up at the café where she works and kisses Ellen in front of her. Even more horrifying is the realization she has become pregnant once again, this time with her best-friend's husband. Although Cora decides to keep the child, Daniel decides he wants nothing to do with her, and refuses to even pay maintenance, leaving Cora once again a single mother with no additional income.  Years pass, and Ellen and Daniel are going through a rather messy divorce which is left slightly easier by the fact he has taken off to Barbados. Regardless of the hurt he has caused her, Ellen is still undeniably in love with him and still fully unaware that her best friend's youngest son Col is the son of her husband. Cora, on the other hand, is struggling with life still, and is still depressed over the horrible guilt she feels. She has never been able to reveal to her friend the truth of her son's paternity. After Daniel's return, Cora realises that she is running out of time to tell Ellen the truth, and all of her friends and neighbours who know her secret urge her to be honest.  While throwing a dinner party at her loft home, Ellen, Cora and some close neighbours become blindingly drunk, and Cora finally confesses the truth at the dinner table. Humiliated, Ellen throws everyone out including Cora, and locks herself in her flat for days, becoming horribly depressed over the fact Cora had the son with Daniel that Ellen had always wanted. Daniel returns to Ellen following the dinner party and finds immediately that he is unwelcome and Ellen doesn't want anything to do with him anymore. In the meantime, Cora develops a relationship with Ellen's co-worker, Stanley, and, after a near-death experience, begins to feel more confident within herself and about what she wants from life. Finally she works up the courage to go to Ellen and apologise.  Regardless of their row, the two women manage to come to a mutual understanding just as Daniel bursts into the flat with a friend to remove the velvet couch he had given Ellen as a wedding present. An argument between the women and Daniel ensues, resulting in Ellen forfeiting the couch and throwing Daniel and his friend out. Immediately afterwards, Ellen retrieves a bag from a cupboard that contains £25,000 that Daniel had won from gambling and stashed in the flat. Ellen splits the money, giving £13,000 of it to Cora to pay the maintenance Daniel had never paid for Col, and taking the remaining money to the book-keepers where she bets the lot on a no-chance horse. Seconds after leaving the book-keepers, Daniel confronts her, having realised his mistake and demanding his money back. Ellen hands him the betting slip and walks away with Cora, having finally gotten her revenge on him.

Y Tu Mamá También
  The film uses an [[omniscient narrator]] to provide information on the characters and their personal lives, historical Mexican events, and the settings depicted in the film. These "footnotes" also address economic and political issues in Mexico, particularly the impoverished lifestyle of people living in rural areas of the country.  The story itself begins at the threshold of two friends' adulthood. Julio ([[Gael García Bernal]]) comes from a leftist, middle-class family, and Tenoch's ([[Diego Luna]]) father is a high-ranking political official. The film opens with a scene of each boy having sex with his girlfriend one last time before the girls leave on a trip to Italy. Without their girlfriends around, the boys take the opportunity to live as bachelors.  At a wedding, they meet Luisa ([[Maribel Verdú]]), an older woman and the wife of Tenoch's cousin, Jano. The boys attempt to impress her with talk of an invented, secluded beach called Boca del Cielo ("Heaven's Mouth"), but she initially declines their invitation to accompany them there. Later, Luisa visits a doctor; after her appointment, she receives a phone call from Jano in which he tearfully confesses that he has been cheating on her. The next day, Luisa calls Tenoch and asks if their offer to accompany them to the beach is still open.  Although Julio and Tenoch have no idea where they will go, the three set off for it, driving through rural Mexico. They talk about their relationships and sexual experiences to pass the time: the boys boast about the number of women with whom they have slept, while Luisa speaks of Jano and wistfully recalls her first love, who died in a motorcycle accident.  During an overnight stop, Luisa leaves a tearful message on Jano's answering machine explaining that she has left him. Tenoch enters her motel room in search of shampoo, but finds her crying. Luisa seduces him, and he awkwardly but enthusiastically has sex with her. Julio sees this from the open doorway, and he walks away and sits down outside by the pool, upset at what he's seen. Tenoch comes down to the pool, and Julio informs him he's had sex with Tenoch's girlfriend. The next day, Luisa notices the tension between the boys, so she has sex with Julio to equalize their perceived status. Tenoch then reveals he had sex with Julio's girlfriend. The boys begin to fight until Luisa threatens to leave them.  Driving along the coastal road that evening, they chance upon an isolated beach that's actually called Boca del Cielo. Making camp there, they begin to relax and enjoy the ocean, along with the company of a local family. In the nearby village, Luisa makes a final phone call to Jano, bidding him an affectionate but final farewell.  That evening, the three drink excessively and joke recklessly about their sexual transgressions, revealing that each boy has ''frequently'' had sex with the other's girlfriend. Julio also says he had sex with Tenoch's mother, but it's unclear if he's joking or not. The three dance together sensually and then retire to their room. They begin to undress and grope each other. As Luisa kneels between them and stimulates them both, the boys embrace and kiss each other passionately.  The next morning, the boys wake up together, naked. Luisa has risen early. Tenoch and Julio immediately turn away from each other and are eager to return home. The narrator explains that their journey back was quiet and uneventful, and that Luisa stayed behind to explore the nearby coves. The narrator further discloses that Tenoch and Julio began relationships with other girls and stopped spending time with each other.  In a chance encounter in Mexico City a year later, Tenoch and Julio have a cup of coffee, awkwardly catching up on each other's lives and news of their mutual friends. Tenoch informs Julio that Luisa died of cancer a month after their trip, and that she had been aware of her prognosis during the time they had spent together. Tenoch excuses himself because his current girlfriend is waiting for him. Before leaving, Tenoch tells Julio he will see him again. The narrator however, reveals they will never see each other again.

Yamakasi (film)
 The [[Yamakasi]] are a group of young thrill seekers of different [[ethnic]] backgrounds who are all dedicated to [[parkour]]. They live in France in a [[banlieue]], a [[ghetto]] especially designed for [[pauper]]s and traditionally inhabited by immigrants from former French colonies. The motley group uses their sport to enjoy themselves without [[drugs]] and to gain recognition in a peaceful way. One morning, they are reported [[buildering]] the east side of the Bleuets building and evading the police after that. While they consider themselves good examples for youths in the banlieue, the local [[chief of police]] feels otherwise. From his point of view, they are reckless and dangerous individuals prone to become criminals while one of his men, Inspector Vincent Asmine believes they are dangerous only because children could hurt themselves by trying to emulate them. On this occasion each single member is introduced through his birth name and alias to the spectators of the film too: Zicmu (Ousmane Dadjacan), Tango (Jean-Michel Lucas), Rocket (Abdou N'Goto), the Spider (Bruno Duris), the Weasel (Malik N'Diaye), Baseball (Oliver Chen), and Sitting Bull (Ousmane Bana).  Following this meeting, two pupils enjoy themselves by climbing in a tree. A third little boy named Djamel who is with them suffers with an inborn [[cardiovascular disease]]. When he tries to join them, he has a cardiac arrest after falling from the tree. In the hospital, his mother and eldest sister, Aila learn an immediate [[heart transplantation]] is imperative. The [[chief physician]] suggests to save the child by buying a [[heart]] from a shady broker. He stresses that this is the only solution but not supported by their [[health insurance]]. He demands from the boy's family to pay 400,000 [[Francs]] within 24 hours.  The head physician advises the family to ask their friends, neighbors, and family for support. This includes the Yamakasi who go and visit Djamel in the hospital and promise to train him to be a Yamakasi member once they have found a way to help him survive his upcoming operation. Then, they go and talk to the head physician himself and ask why a child is supposed to die only because his parents are poor. They insist he would contact the hospital's board of directors. When he refuses to phone either of them, they steal the list of names and decide to walk in the footsteps of [[Robin Hood]].  They split up into 3 groups which each robs one or two houses of the board of directors. The first two robberies are successful, however one of the groups gets chased out of a house by [[Doberman]]s and is captured on camera. The police realize that the board of directors is being targeted and attempt to catch the Yamakasi in their next robberies, but are unsuccessful. The Yamakasi finally converge on the mansion of the head of the directors. The police arrive quickly and surround the house. With no chance of escaping, they instead gather all of the loot from the robberies into a bag and toss to Baseball's friend and working partner, Michelin who pawns it off for the needed amount of money.

Yamashita: The Tiger's Treasure
 The Rosales family are a wealthy [[Filipino American]] family engaged in business and investment living in an upscale neighborhood in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Jobert Rosales is the grandson of Carmelo "Melo" Rosales, an elderly Filipino [[World War II]] [[veteran]] living in the [[United States]] who tells his war stories to his grandson Jobert. In one flashback, he tells the story of his participation during World War II, when his troop was ordered to bury the [[Yamashita's gold|Yamashita Treasure]].   One day, Jobert returns home to find his parents murdered and his grandfather missing. Jobert decides to go back to the Philippines and on the flight, he finds the clues to a hidden treasure in his grandfather's coded, wartime journal, which will later serve as a crucial key to the location of the treasure and becomes engrossed with it. During his trip to the Philippines, news of his parents' murder and grandfather's appearance spread around the globe. However, upon arrival in [[Manila]], Jobert is unaware that he has become the center of attention, especially when a news reporter gives him a business card at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]. His nervousness increases after an uncomfortable interrogation with police general Rivas.   Jobert happily reunites with his old friends and former classmates but the reunion turns sour when they are ambushed and abducted by mercenaries, who take them to Edmundo "Emong" Mariano ([[Albert Martinez]]). As Emong reveals his innocence and his concern for Melo's safety, a man named Nolasco arrives and reveals that they sent the mercenaries, adding that the said "abduction" was a preventive operation to protect Jobert and his friends from being captured by Paok TF, a criminal syndicate interested in the treasure with the intention to abduct and kill Jobert and his friends after they find the said loot. Nolasco reveals himself and Emong to be top Philippine government officials with the latter serving as the country's Yamashita treasure expert, and adds that Melo was kidnapped by the same syndicate, headed by Naguchi ([[Vic Diaz]]), a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] World War II veteran and Jarco ([[BB Gandanghari|Rustom Padilla]]). When Nolasco states that they know how to find Melo and save him, an ambush occurs, wherein Emong leads the team's escape. After a highway chase with the syndicate's henchmen, the team boards a speedboat that will take them to an inter-island ship, which will serve as their safehouse.  While on the ship, Jobert reads the journal. Flashbacks of Lolo Melo's life show his happy life with his younger brother, Peping, whom he gave an expensive [[harmonica]] as a gift before he enlists in the Army. Upon the outbreak of World War II, Melo and Peping were captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. While they were tortured by Japanese troops, he and Peping consoles themselves to relieve their sorrow by listening to the latter's harmonica music. That goes on until General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] orders them and some POWs to be herded in a Japanese transport ship bound to Mindoro. They suffered severe maltreatment, from rotational torture, feeding them with meager rations, from spoiled rice to boiled camote roots and among others. The journal, revealed as the treasure map in pieces, confirms Mindoro province as the site.  Meanwhile, one of Jobert's friends suspects something about Emong's identity and intentions. Another flashback reveals of Melo's war life. In Mindoro, the POW's are forced to dig several large tunnels to bury something. The ship, carrying Yamashita's loot, arrives in Mindoro and the POW's were ordered to place the treasures in the tunnels and place some traps, including [[land mines]]. Melo and several others are forced to seal the area after the duty and an American air raid attacks them, burying also his younger brother and some of their fellow prisoners alive. Peping plays the harmonica one last time, as his co-prisoners die due to suffocation while he dies of his wounds.  Upon arrival at Mindoro, the team are met by Jarco and his henchmen. Jobert reunites with Melo, captured by the syndicate's team as asset, bargaining chip and guide, along with multiple trucks to transport the loot. Melo and Jobert leads Jarco and the henchmen into the tunnels, seemingly full of gold, loot and the legendary Golden Buddha. Melo tells Jobert to leave the tunnel as he confronts the henchman. As Jobert's group leaves, Jarco's henchmen try to kill them but a distraction in the form of a military backup following Naguchi's moves, arrives and disposes the henchmen. The group are eventually rescued by Emong, who is revealed to have called the military for help.   Back at the tunnels, Melo discovers his younger brother's skeletal remains, along with the rusting harmonica he gave many decades ago. Jarco, seemingly mesmerized by countless loot in his front, opens the Golden Buddha only to step on a land mine, causing a chain of explosions that destroys the tunnel, killing everyone including himself. Before Melo dies, he plays the harmonica one last time, while Peping's spirit smiles in front of him and embraces him.   Emong and Jobert's group leads the military to the location of the tunnels only to arrive too late after the explosion. Realizing that some of Naguchi's surviving henchmen are leaving with the loot and treasure loaded in trucks, Jobert tells Emong to call local and national media about the incident. The media frenzy about the treasure causes the local populace, along with several law enforcement agencies to erect several blockades and create human chains to halt the convoy. The people power succeeds and the henchmen are arrested. Naguchi and Rivas, now revealed to be his accomplice and the mastermind behind the incidents, are also taken to custody. After a flashback shows Yamashita's execution by hanging, Melo and Peping's remains, as well as those of other POWs are exhumed and buried with full honors in [[Libingan ng mga Bayani]].   The epilogue reveals that Philippines had paid all its debts and indemnity for veterans and other war victims. Melo and Peping are posthumously awarded the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines Medal of Valor|Philippine Medal of Valor]], and [[Epifanio delos Santos Avenue|EDSA]] was renamed Carmelo Rosales Avenue due to his honor, heroism and resilience.

Yellow Hair 2
 The first half of the film is told in a non-consecutive narrative format, introducing the three principal characters in turn and taking them up to the events in the convenience store. There are four chapters: "Pornography in Blue", "A Space Man", "Documentary" and "Last Scene".  === Pornography in Blue === Y breaks up with her boyfriend (also her agent), who she believes has done little to promote her acting career, but he tries to blackmail her with a video of the two of them having sex. She turns to her boss at the store for help, but he only agrees if she will sleep with him. Later that evening, Y makes up with her boyfriend, but then discovers that her boss has also been videotaping her as she changes in the store's back room. Working behind the counter in the convenience store, she takes a cheque from J to pay for some beer.  === A Space Man === J meets M while singing in a club in [[Thailand]]. They fall in love and continue seeing each other back in Korea, until one day M announces that he has to go on a trip without her. On the day of his return, J prepares a meal for the two of them at her apartment. She is overjoyed when he finally shows up, until she realizes that his parents are with him. M's father has found out that J is a transsexual, and demands to see her [[Identity document|ID card]] as proof. When she refuses he starts to fling food at her, and J asks them all to leave.  A short while later, she goes into Y's convenience store and uses a cheque to buy some beer. When the store's boss demands to see her ID, she turns in anger and smashes a bottle of beer over his head.  === Documentary === R carries his camcorder with him wherever he goes, videotaping everyday life. Eventually he walks into Y's convenience store. As he gets something to drink, the boss walks out of the back room and demands to see J's ID card. R begins taping the incident. J smashes the beer bottle over the boss's head. Y tries to comfort him, but he slips on the spilt beer and falls, banging his head against R's camera case. Blood flows out onto the floor, and the boss is apparently dead.  J, Y and R decide to accept joint responsibility for the boss's death. They drag the body into the back room, clean up the blood, then leave. After getting into a fight in a bar, the trio retreat to a hotel room. Y and R have sex, while J lies curled up on the floor, remembering the time she spent with M in Thailand. Meanwhile, M gets drunk at J's apartment, distraught over his feelings for her.   After a few days, the trio go to another bar. As they are drinking and trying to decide what to do next, several police officers come in to check IDs. The three leave without paying their bill, and are chased down a back alley by one of the officers. As they run, Y trips and falls, forcing J to wait and trip the officer, who drops his gun. She picks up the gun and points it at him as he lies on the ground, but he quickly gets the better of her. When the other two come back to help her, he begins berating them one by one, only ending when J clubs the officer over the head with the camera case. Having had enough, R decides to leave.   Y and J find a hotel room, where they console each other and begin goofing around. The following day they leave on J's motorcycle, going to Y's family home. It turns out that Y has a young daughter who is being looked after by her parents, and it's her birthday. Y leaves a birthday cake but refuses to stay, and returns the motorcycle. J, however, is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly someone grabs the clerk's hair.  The convenience store boss is not dead, as they had believed. He and a friend of his have taken Y and J to a private [[karaoke]] room. The friend forces Y to undress and dance while he sings karaoke. The boss again demands that J show him her ID card, but instead she pulls the police officer's gun out of her bag and shoots both men dead. Again the two women find a room to stay. They lie tenderly together, naked, and J tells the clerk that one day, they'll go away somewhere warm together.  Later, the two of them are getting their hair styled in a salon when Y sees her ex-boyfriend on TV. He has now become a big star, and she throws the TV to the ground in a fit of rage.  === Last scene === Y meets her ex-boyfriend in a café, and she uses their sex video to blackmail him for money. She then goes with J on a spending spree, in preparation for their trip to Thailand. They return to J's apartment, where M has been waiting. J takes him inside to talk, leaving Y outside. Still feeling distraught, M threatens to kill himself with a bottle of pills. J pours the pills out and sweeps them into the trash, telling him that they won't be enough. She gives him the gun, then leaves, going into the bathroom to cry. M goes out into the street, where he sees Y in a phone booth. Mistaking her for J, he shoots her in the head and then kills himself. J comes outside to find them both dead, and she is now left alone.

Yellow Asphalt
 ===Black spot=== A Bedouin boy is run over by an Israeli [[tank truck|tanker]] while crossing the highway with his donkey. The truck driver and his help decide to move the body to the side of the road, and flee. The truck's [[self ignition]] fails, and by the time they repair it, they are surrounded by Bedouins. The tense, almost wordless stand-off is broken when the truck help, under orders from the truck driver, removes an extra wheel from the truck and gives it to the Bedouins to pass judgment on.  ===Here is not there=== A council of village elders meet to discuss the marital problems of a Bedouin man and his German wife. The wife, who wants to leave with her two children back to [[Germany]], is instructed to go back to her tent and her family. She decides to escape in the middle of the night with her two children. She runs most of the night - carrying her younger child, and leading her older one - before falling asleep exhausted. She is discovered in the morning by her husband who pursues her with a [[4WD]] across the desert [[wadi]]s. She intercepts an Israeli truck, and is helped by the truck driver, but her husband realizes she is hiding in the truck when he overhears his children crying inside it. The wife takes flight with the children, but is ultimately pursued down by the husband and [[stoning|stoned]].  This entire episode turns out to be a cautionary daydream of the German wife in question, who ultimately decides to leave in the middle of the night with her two children anyway.  ===Red roofs=== A Palestinian housekeeper, wife of a Bedouin leader, is a concubine of an Israeli Jewish farmer with wife and children of his own. When news of her infidelity reaches her husband via Bedouin children who spotted her making love in the desert, he beats her up. The housekeeper decides to seek shelter at the farmer's place based on his assurances that he would look after her. However, the farmer decides to avoid trouble with the Bedouin tribe and asks his Bedouin farmyard help to kill the woman and dispose of the body and gun. The help is unable to kill her, and takes the housekeeper to an unspecified Israeli city - letting her go and telling her not to come back. She does come back, and is shot dead by the farmer. The help deposes of the body and gun inefficiently, leading to the discovery of both. A [[blood feud]] is thus inadvertently started between the family of the housekeeper and that of the farmyard help. The help ultimately undergoes the primeval "[[Bisha'a|fire test]]" to prove his innocence, but tells the Bedouin elders about the guilt of the Israeli farmer. The Bedouin help is [[takfir|excommunicated]] from his clan, but given a chance to redeem himself by killing the Israeli farmer. He fails to do so, and the Israeli farmer is shown being pursued by the brother of the housekeeper. The final scene shows the farmyard help, an outcast from his society, hitching a ride into the same Israeli city, with words he had used to chide the housekeeper about living in two disparate worlds playing in the background.

Zoolander
 In New York City, the self-absorbed and dim-witted but good-natured Derek Zoolander is ousted as the top male fashion model by the rising star Hansel, and his reputation is further tarnished by a critical article from journalist Matilda Jeffries. After his three roommates and colleagues are killed in a "freak gasoline-fight accident", Derek announces his retirement from modeling. He goes to his native New Jersey to attempt to reconnect with his working class father Larry and brothers Luke and Scrappy by helping them in the coal mines. Derek's delicate methods make him an impractical miner, and his family rejects him.  Meanwhile, fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu and Derek's agent Maury Ballstein are charged by the fashion industry with finding a model who can be [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] into assassinating the new progressive-leaning [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], allowing them to retain cheap [[Child labour|child labor]] in the country. Though Mugatu has previously refused to work with Derek for any show, Derek returns to New York City and accepts Mugatu's offer to star in the next [[Fashion show|runway show]].  Mugatu takes Derek to his headquarters, masked as a day spa, where Derek is [[Ivan Pavlov#Reflex system research|conditioned]] to attempt the assassination when the song "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] is played. Matilda, feeling partially responsible for Derek's retirement, becomes suspicious of Mugatu's offer and, tipped off by an anonymous caller, tries to enter the spa, but is thrown out. Matilda tells her concerns to Derek once he leaves, but he ignores her.  Matilda follows Derek to a pre-runway party, where, upon being challenged by Hansel, Derek loses to Hansel in a "walk-off" judged by [[David Bowie]]. Matilda receives another anonymous call to meet at a nearby cemetery. Matilda along with Derek find the anonymous caller is [[hand model]] J.P. Prewett, who explains that the fashion industry has been behind several of history's political assassinations, including [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] and the brainwashed models are soon killed after they have completed their task. Katinka, Mugatu's tough henchwoman, and her aides attack the group, forcing Derek and Matilda to flee.  They go to Hansel's home, the last place they believe Mugatu will think to look. Derek, Hansel, and Matilda bond. Matilda admits the reason she hates models is because she was bullied as a child for being overweight and developed [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], and that she believes models hurt people's self-esteem. Derek and Hansel resolve their differences while partaking of Hansel's collection of narcotics and participating in group sex with Matilda and others. While recovering, Derek also finds that he is falling in love with Matilda. Derek and Hansel break into Maury's office to find evidence of the assassination plot, but they cannot operate his computer to find them. Taking Matilda's words literally, that the "files are ''in'' the computer," Hansel physically takes the computer while Derek leaves for the show.  Matilda tries to intercept Derek before the show, but Katinka thwarts her. As Derek takes the runway, Mugatu's [[disc jockey]] starts playing "Relax", activating Derek's mental programming. Before Derek can kill the Prime Minister, Hansel breaks into the DJ booth and deactivates the music. Expecting to reveal the hidden files, Hansel attempts to expose the assassination plot by smashing Maury's computer on the floor, thereby destroying the evidence.  Mugatu attempts to cover up the incident, but Maury offers to turn over the evidence of the assassination plot after years of guilt for his complicity in the conspiracy. Mugatu attempts to kill the Prime Minister himself by throwing a [[shuriken]], but Derek stops him by unleashing his ultimate model look, "Magnum", that stuns everyone and causes the shuriken to freeze in the air in front of Derek's face and fall harmlessly to the floor. In Derek's rural hometown, Larry is watching the event on TV, and proudly acknowledges Derek as his son. Mugatu is arrested, and Derek is thanked by the Prime Minister.  A few years later Derek, Hansel, and Maury are shown as having left the fashion industry to start ''"The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too"''.
