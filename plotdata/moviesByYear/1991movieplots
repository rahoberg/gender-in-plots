100 Days (1991 film)
 The film opens with a young woman, Devi ([[Madhuri Dixit]]), who gets sudden visions (usually accompanied with a mild panic attack) of incidents and accidents that are yet to happen.<ref></ref> Devi has a vision of her sister Rama ([[Moon Moon Sen]]) being murdered. Her college friends Sudha Mathur ([[Sabeeha]]) and Sunil ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) try to help her sort through her visions, but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle ([[Ajit Vachani]])'s home, where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar ([[Jackie Shroff]]). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out.  Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector ([[Shivaji Satam]]) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: Several such necklaces are available.  Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered. She also pinpoints two details: a magazine named Priya with a horse on its cover page and a video cassette labelled ''100 Days''. Sunil and Devi visit the weekly magazine office. The editor ([[Shashi Kiran]]) politely informs them that the next six months' covers do not feature any equestrian theme whatsoever. The video cassette clue, too, is a dead end: no video store in Bombay carries any such title as '100 days'. Devi begins delving into Rama's life. She learns that Rama was a research scholar and was working on a thesis about ancient sculptures and temples in India. A quick investigation by Devi during a visit to the Bombay Museum reveals that many artifacts listed by Rama either had mysteriously disappeared, got stolen or were replaced by fakes. She also learns that two people working in the museum, Jagmohan ([[Jai Kalgutkar]]), Security Officer and Parvati ([[Neelam Mehra]]), Record Keeper were fired on suspicion. Parvati is revealed to be the new victim of Devi's visions.  Jagmohan is a hot-headed man, while Parvati knows the killer of Rama. Parvati had videotaped the murder. She tries to blackmail the murderer, but the murderer tries to kill her. She sneaks into a video library, sticks a label '100 days' on the cassette and tries to escape. But Jagmohan succeeds in killing her, just as Devi had seen. Later, due to some last minute developments, the weekly magazine 'Priya' prints an issue with a horse on its cover. Devi soon realizes that Parvati has been murdered. She goes to the video library and retrieves the video cassette. Jagmohan tries to kill her, but her luck prevails and she escapes. She comes back into the mansion, where she gets a vision of herself in an injured state and a broken mirror in the mansion. She tells Ram about the developments and sits with him to watch the video cassette. Ram has no idea about the cassette's contents are.  However, as the video cassette is being played, Devi gets another shock: she sees her sister Rama confronting Ram. Based on the evidence in the video cassette, it becomes clear that Ram is the murderer. Devi tells him that she is pregnant with his child. Ram offers to explain. Ram tells that he was from an affluent family, but his father lost all his wealth due to gambling and eventually died. When Ram sought financial help from his relatives, they spurned his requests, leaving him helplessly alone. Consequently, he took to illegal ways of earning money. He ran into Jagmohan and Parvati. Later, the trio became partners and started smuggling the artifacts from museums and replaced some by fakes. Rama suspected it and decided to expose them. That night, Ram went to talk to Rama. But Jagmohan, who was also there, lost his temper and shot her dead. Parvati was secretly taping the incident, but due to her camera's angle, it looked as if Ram was the killer. Ram offers to surrender to police and calls them. He confesses his crime and asks them to arrest him.  No sooner has he stopped talking, than Jagmohan stabs him in his back. Ram loses consciousness, while Devi fights with Jagmohan. In this unequal fight, Devi is overpowered and rendered unconscious after being hit on her forehead by a conch hurled at her by Jagmohan. Then, Jagmohan buries her alive in the same wall where he had buried Rama. Just as he is about to escape, he sees Sunil coming in. Jagmohan hides while Sunil is surprised to see the mansion open with nobody in it. Just then, Devi's wrist watch alarm chimes. Sunil is surprised to hear the sound coming from behind the wall and puts two and two together. He starts removing the bricks of freshly constructed wall, when Jagmohan suddenly attacks him. However, Sunil puts up a good fight with the enemy with an unfair advantage. Ram wakes up too and goes towards the wall to remove the bricks and somehow manages to remove the unconscious Devi from the wall. Sunil soon overpowers Jagmohan and dumps him into the swimming pool.  The police arrive at the scene. Sunil is surprised to see Ram being arrested as well. Devi looks wearily as the police van goes away with Jagmohan and Ram in custody.

Abdullajon
 The film is narrated in the first person through the eyes of Sotiboldi, a security guard at a store in the village, as a letter to "Steven aka (Brother) Spielberg" in broken, but funny Russian. The film tells the story of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] whose spaceship crashes in an Uzbek [[kolhoz]]. Bozorboy, a resident of the village, discovers the alien while looking for his lost cow. In his letter to Spielberg, Sotiboldi writes that the spaceship that crashed in Uzbekistan, "unlike the beautiful spaceship with lights in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', looks like a pot, but is real."  The alien is a [[White people|white]] boy who speaks many languages and can perform miracles such as transporting people and objects through space and making it rain at will. Bozorboy names the alien Abdullajon after his grandfather and adopts the alien as his seventh child. The villagers think that Abdullajon is an illegitimate child of Bozorboy from his Russian wife somewhere.  Meanwhile, Russian scientists in [[Moscow]] predict that an alien will land in the village and ask the head of the [[kolkhoz]] to tell them immediately if anyone comes across the alien.  In the village, Bozorboy and Abdullajon search the gadget that would allow Abdullajon to call for help. Bozorboy finds the gadget first and hides it from Abdullajon. Later the gadget disappears from the place where Bozorboy hid it.  When Bozorboy says to Abdullajon that he needs "big money" to solve all of his problems, Abdullajon understands him literally and makes him a huge one [[Soviet ruble|Ruble]] [[coin]] about the size of a [[manhole]] using the family's [[cauldron]]. Then Bozorboy asks Abdullajon to multiply a Ruble banknote. Abdullajon easily creates much money from a single banknote. However, after reading in one of the notes that making [[counterfeit money]] is illegal, Abdullajon and Bozorboy burn all the money.  Abdullajon performs many more miracles such as enabling people to fly on [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], making [[Chicken|hens]] lay fifty eggs per minute, growing enormous [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] (such as [[watermelon]]s that weigh three tons), making a cow give birth to forty calves, and enabling a local technician to make his own [[hi-fi]] [[videocassette recorder]]s.   The villagers are not aware that Abdullajon is responsible for all of the miracles. An old drunkard tells the head of the kolkhoz that he will tell everyone in the village that the head is responsible for all the miracles in exchange for getting a bottle of [[vodka]] every day. The head agrees and gets all the credit for the miracles. At a public meeting, he is presented a special hoe which fails to fly. Bozorboy tells the head of the kolkhoz about Abdullajon. The head asks Abdullajon to make his hoe fly as well, but Abdullajon refuses to comply, saying that the head is guilty of an "unforgivable crime", namely, of killing a [[bee]]. The head angrily climbs up to a tall tower with his hoe hoping he will be able to fly. However, his hoe doesn't fly and he falls to the ground and gets hurt.  Moscow deploys a fleet of [[tank]]s and [[fighter plane]]s to find the alien. It is revealed that Bozorboy's wife hid the device that would enable Abdullajon to call for help. She gives it to Abdullajon and sees him off as he flies away in another pot-like spaceship. The films ends with Sotiboldi inviting Steven Spielberg to his village to "eat a big watermelon and a melon and ride a hoe."

Lieutenant ''Steklov'', son of a high-ranking General, is assigned to Afghanistan, hoping to take part in combat and earn some medals before the war ends. Sgt. ''Arsionov'' ([[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksei Serebryakov]]) combines his combat experience and bravery with brutal [[Dedovschina|hazing]] of young conscripts back on the field base. Major ''Bandura''`s [[tour of duty]] has expired. He is free to go home and reunite with his wife whom he has almost forgot. This means leaving his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] ''Katya'' ([[Tatyana Dogileva]]), a nurse in the base's hospital—to a much anticipation from Bandura's superior ''Leonid'' () who fell in love with Katya. Anxiety is felt by many characters about the change taking place back in the Soviet Union during the [[Perestroika]]. Bandura himself thinks he might not be able to adapt. Katya says that Afghanistan will be remembered as the best part of their lives.  The Soviet command arranges a deal with a local Afghan [[warlord]] that he won't take action against the withdrawing Soviet troops in exchange for weapons and supplies. When asked why he needs more weapons as the war seems to be coming to an end, he replies that his war will go on for a very long time. On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the [[mujahedin]]. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village. When the preparations are finished, Bandura comes to say good bye to Katya, who is scheduled to leave the country on the morrow. A junky soldier at the hospital insults him by insubordination but Bandura suddenly shows no will for disciplining him. Instead, he requests to be replaced by some other officer on the mission, citing a sore foot as a pretext. But, after realization that his company is setting out, he resumes command. It goes awry again when the neutral warlord is accidentally killed in the raid and his men become hostile and together with the mujahedin attack the paratroopers. Bandura is able to pull his unit out mostly intact, but they are pinned down and call in an [[air strike]] that obliterates the village. After the strike, Bandura becomes apathetic, and without apparent reason, re-enters the village alone. He finds nobody alive except for a 10-year boy clinging to an [[AK-47]]. Bandura hesitates, unsure what to do, then walks away, allowing the boy to shoot him in the back and kill him.

Ajooba
 The [[Afghan]] kingdom of "Baharistan" is ruled by a just and kind [[Sultan]], Ali Rizwan Mohhamad Dokeer Khan ([[Shammi Kapoor]]). All is well in the land except that the [[Sultan]] seemingly can't have children. An evil devil-worshipping [[Vizier|Vazir]] ([[Amrish Puri]]) seeks to usurp the throne, revive his ''"fauladi shaitan"'' (a huge demon-like figure made of stone), and take over the world. The Vazir instructs his maids to strangle every child born to the [[Sultan]]. Finally, however, a spark of divine intervention (presented literally as a spark which descends from the heavens and enters the womb) renders the next newborn son immune to the poisons and strangulations administered by the maids. This Shehezada (''prince'') eventually becomes ''Ajooba'' (miracle).  The [[Sultan]] and his wife Malika ([[Ariadna Shengelaya]]) kick off celebrations throughout the land. The good court magician Ameer Baba ([[Saeed Jaffrey]]), recently returned from his travels to the "land of Hind" (i.e., [[India]]), presents a magic sword to the [[Sultan]]. The [[Sultan]] thrusts it into a pillar (verifying its keenness), and Ameer Baba pronounces that it may be drawn out of the stone again only by a member of the royal family (rather like the [[Excalibur]]).  Soon after, the [[Sultan]] privately discusses "traitors" with Ameer Baba. The Vazir overhears, eventually tricks Ameer Baba, steals his Necklace of Immortality, throws him into the dungeon, attempts to murder the Sultan and his family and take over the throne. The Sultan escapes with his wife and child. After a pitched battle involving magic carpets, storms and ships, the Sultan is missing, Malika is blinded, and the young Shehzada is washed ashore by a dolphin (whom he eventually thinks of as his mother) to a blacksmith. This blacksmith adopts the kid, trains him in all the worldly and martial arts, and thus creates ''Ajooba''. In the meantime, the Vazir blames Ameer Baba for the Sultan's murder, takes over the throne, and begins ravaging the land, always uttering his slogan ''Shaitan Zindabaad'' (Long live the Devil).  ''Ajooba'' is a masked rider in black (rather like Zorro) who thwarts the Vazir's lackeys as they pillage the lands and harass the citizens. His plain self is Ali, an ordinary restaurateur, and his chum is Hasan ([[Rishi Kapoor]]). Together they foil the Vazir's evil schemes, raid his caravans, and woo their girls. Ajooba, as Ali, falls for Rukhsana ([[Dimple Kapadia]], actually the daughter of Ameer Baba, returned from Hind to rescue her imprisoned father), while Hasan's affections are for the Vazir's Shehzadi Henna ([[Sonam]]).  Ajooba inflicts constant pain upon the Vazir. The Vazir eventually raises his ''fauladi shaitan'' and plans an all-out attack. The Raja of Hind ([[Dara Singh]], in a special appearance) brings his forces to aid Ajooba. The resulting war brings all the central characters together.  Several questions are essentially resolved in the ensuing war. The climax is a panorama of demons, magical horses and donkeys, a full-scale combat between the Vazir's army and the Hind army, enchanted swords, and a final revelation about the true identity of Ajooba.

Meanwhile, Tiger's girlfriend, Miss Kitty, leaves him to find a new life out west, remarking that perhaps she is looking for "a cat that's more like a dog."  Soon after, Cat R. Waul, an aristocrat cat forces the mice into the sewers, including the Mousekewitzes. Using a mouse marionette, Cat R. Waul entices the mice into moving yet again to a better life out west. Tiger chases the train, trying to catch up with his friends, but is thrown off course by a pack of angry dogs. While on the train, Fievel wanders into the livestock car, where he overhears the cats revealing their plot to turn them into "mouse burgers." After being discovered, he is thrown from the train by Cat R.'s hench-spider, T.R. Chula, landing him in the middle of the desert. His family is devastated once again over his loss and arrive in [[Green River, Utah]] with heavy hearts.  Upon arrival at Green River, Chula blocks up the water tower, drying up the river. Cat R. approaches the mice and proposes to build a new saloon together, although intending to trick the mice into doing the bulk of the work and then eat them afterwards. Meanwhile, Fievel is wandering aimlessly through the desert, as is Tiger, who has found his way out west as well, and they pass each other. However, they each figure that the other is a mirage and continue on their separate ways. Tiger is captured by mouse [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and hailed as a god.

He sends Tanya to Miss Kitty, who is now a saloon-girl cat, and she reveals that she came at Cat R.'s request. He tells Miss Kitty to put her on stage. With a little encouragement from Miss Kitty, she pulls off a performance for the cats. Meanwhile, Fievel is chased by Chula and briefly taken prisoner, but flees.  While walking out of town, Fievel stops to talk with an elderly bloodhound sleeping outside the jail, discovering that he is actually Wylie Burp. Fievel convinces him to help and train Tiger as a lawman and as a dog. Tiger is reluctant at first, but relents at the suggestion that a new [[wiktionary:persona|persona]] might win back Miss Kitty. They go back to Green River to fight the cats, who attempt to kill the mice at sunset during the opening of Cat R.'s saloon using a giant mouse trap. Tiger, Wylie and Fievel intervene and battle the cats. When Chula threatens to kill Miss Kitty, however, Tiger rescues her and uses a pitchfork and Chula's web as a lasso with him trapped on it to hurtle Cat R. and his men out of town by having them piled on part of the trap, which the heroes use as a catapult. The cats fly into the air and land into a mailbag, which a passing train picks up and leaves.  Enamored by his new personality, Miss Kitty and Tiger are reunited. Tanya becomes a famous singer and the water tower flows with 9,000 gallons of water again, making Green River bloom with thousands of flowers.

The master's actions and behavior are very mysterious and secretive, which causes his [[manservant]] to be suspicious of his whereabouts. The Master is seen doing such things as writing a letter in the secrecy of his study room, gathering eggs from the side of a cliff, and it is even implied he had an affair with the female servant. One day, the shocked manservant discovers the Master in a barn feeding the eggs he gathered to a huge [[boar]], much to the Master's shame. Sometime later, the Master is shown setting the pig off into the wild, perhaps a form of reconciliation with the male servant (who is implied to have an infatuation with his master). With his mental health deteriorating, the Master sheds his clothing and jumps over the edge of the cliff, presumably to his death.

Armour of God II: Operation Condor
 Hong Kong treasure hunter Jackie, a.k.a. "Asian Condor", is summoned by Baron Bannon at his mansion in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], where he is told of a story of a German commander named Hans von Katterling and his regiment burying 240 tons of gold at a secret base deep in the [[Sahara Desert]] in [[Africa]] before the end of [[World War II]]. The 18 soldiers involved in the operation disappeared under mysterious circumstances. By request from the [[United Nations]], Bannon gives Jackie an unofficial mission to locate the base and recover the gold. Aside from acquiring the key to the base, he is partnered with Ada, an expert in African geography. Upon discovery of the gold, Jackie is promised one percent of the treasure, or roughly 2.5 tons of gold.  One night, while snooping around the home of one of the base's caretakers, Jackie meets a young German woman named Elsa, after saving her from a couple of [[Arabs|Arab]] men - Amon and Tasza - who are also searching for the gold. The next day, he goes to a renowned locksmith and learns that the key is intricately designed for use with a special code. After evading an army of black cars chasing him across town, Jackie is asked by Elsa to let her join him and Ada on their expedition, as she is in search of von Katterling, who was her grandfather.  Upon their arrival in the Sahara Desert, the expedition team picks up Momoko, a Japanese woman who is searching for the meaning of death. However, their camp is attacked by black-veiled bandits who kidnap Elsa and Ada. Jackie and Momoko follow the bandits' trail to a slave market, where they save Elsa and Ada from being auctioned off as sex slaves. Meanwhile, the rest of the expedition team is murdered by a group of mercenaries led by a man who uses a wheelchair. After another run-in with Amon and Tasza, Jackie's group returns to their camp to discover their comrades slain, but Momoko recognizes a statue in one of Elsa's grandfather's pictures and leads them to an ancient temple.  After bidding Momoko farewell, the trio enter the ruins, where they encounter a band of vicious tribesmen. While running for their lives, they fall through a loose floor of sand into an underground cavern, which is part of the secret Nazi base. They discover the mummified remains of Elsa's grandfather and look through his log book, revealing that the 18 soldiers under von Katterling ingested cyanide pills and died inside the base upon completion of their mission. However, the trio only counts 17 bodies, with one soldier missing. The man who uses the wheelchair - arriving with his mercenaries and holding Momoko hostage - reveals himself as Adolf, the 18th soldier who murdered Elsa's grandfather after the latter made him a paraplegic for refusing to ingest the cyanide.  Upon arriving at the vault, Jackie uses the key and a secret code from Elsa's grandfather's dog tag and opens it, revealing the elevator leading to the gold. Upon their discovery of the gold, the mercenaries turn their backs on Adolf with the intent of keeping the treasure to themselves. Adolf in turn locks in all of the mercenaries, except for two who chase Jackie to an underground [[wind tunnel]]. While Jackie battles the two mercenaries, Elsa and Ada flip random switches in the control room, activating the tunnel's turbine fan. As the three men hang on for their lives, Elsa and Ada attempt to switch off the fan, but they accidentally trigger the base's self-destruct sequence. Adolf tells the quartet that they can escape by having the turbine blow them through the ventilation duct, but he decides to stay to atone for his sins. The quartet gather as much gold as they can, but the wind force only sends their bodies upward to the desert surface above before the base completely caves in.  As the quartet walk across the desert, they once again encounter Amon and Tasza, who demand water from them. Jackie throws them his empty canteen before they finally overcome their differences and try to find water in the Sahara desert.

Backdraft (film)
  Two firefighters of Engine 17 of the [[Chicago Fire Department]] are brothers. Lt. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the elder, is experienced, while Brian has labored under his brother's shadow his entire life. Brian returns to firefighting after a number of other careers falter, though Stephen has doubts that Brian is fit to be a firefighter. In 1971, Brian witnessed the death of their firefighting father, Captain Dennis McCaffrey, while accompanying him on a call.  The longest serving of all the men at Engine 17, John "Axe" Adcox, served under the McCaffreys' father, and was like an uncle to the boys when their father died. He attacks fires head on, but is concerned about Stephen's unorthodox methods and disregard for safety procedures. Helen McCaffrey is Stephen's estranged wife and the mother of their son, Sean. Helen has grown fearful of Stephen's dedication to firefighting and the risks he takes. While they are still in love, she separated from Stephen to protect herself and Sean.  Martin Swayzak is an [[alderman]] on the [[Chicago City Council]]. Swayzak hopes to be elected mayor, but has made budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the rank and file firemen believe the cuts are endangering firefighters' lives.  Fire Department Captain Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is a dedicated arson investigator and veteran firefighter. He is called in, because a number of recent fires resemble fires committed by pyromaniac Ronald Bartel, who has been imprisoned for years. Brian is reassigned as his assistant after a falling out with Stephen. Rimgale manipulates Bartel's obsession with fire to ensure Bartel's annual parole application is rejected. It is revealed during an investigation that Swayzak was paid off by contractors to shut down firehouses, so they could be converted into community centers, with the contractors receiving contracts for the construction. Brian also begins a relationship with Jennifer Vaitkus, an aide to Swayzak.  When Engine 17 answers a call in a high-rise, Stephen urges them to move in quickly to take out the fire despite Adcox's advice to wait for back-up. Brian's friend and fellow trainee, Tim Krizminski, opens a door, only to be met by a [[backdraft]]. His face is burned beyond recognition, but he barely survives. Adcox and Brian both blame Tim's condition on Stephen's reckless tactics.  Rimgale and Brian go to Swayzak's home to confront him, but interrupt a masked man about to set the place on fire. The latter attacks them with a flashlight, but is burned by an electrical socket on his back. Rimgale saves Brian and Swayzak from the house, but is injured in an explosion. In his hospital bed, Rimgale tells Brian to visit Ronald again. Ronald helps Brian realize that only a firefighter would be so careful as to not let the backdraft fires rage out of control.  Brian suspects Stephen, but later spots a burn in the shape of an electrical socket on Adcox's back, and reveals his suspicions to his brother just before an alarm. When Brian realizes Adcox has heard their exchange, he jumps aboard Truck 46 after borrowing some turnout gear. Stephen confronts Adcox about the deadly backdrafts during a [[multiple-alarm fire]] at a chemical plant. Adcox admits that he set the fires to kill associates of Swayzak, because Swayzak was benefiting from the deaths of firefighters. When an explosion destroys the catwalk they are on, Stephen grabs Adcox's hand while hanging on to the remains of the catwalk. Stephen refuses Adcox' advice to let go of him, but Stephen loses his grip on the catwalk. Adcox is killed, but Stephen, although seriously injured, survives. Stephen dies on the way to the hospital with Brian at his side, his final request being that Brian not reveal that Adcox was behind the fires until after Adcox receives a fitting burial.  After Stephen and Adcox's funeral, Brian and Rimgale, with the help of the police, interrupt Swayzak at a press conference. Rimgale questions Swayzak on a fake manpower study that led to the deaths of several firemen, including Stephen and Adcox. They also state that Swayzak engineered the downsizing of the Chicago Fire Department. This effectively destroys Swayzak's mayoral ambitions. Brian continues as a firefighter despite the loss of his father and brother.  
Back to the Future: The Ride
 [[File:Back to the Future The Ride in Universal Studios Japan.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Back to the Future: The Ride at Universal Studios Japan]] Following the events of ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'', [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown]] and his family, Clara, Jules, Verne, and Einstein, moved to the present in [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]] where, in 1991, he founded the Institute of Future Technology, a scientific institute specializing in his "futuristic" inventions. On May 2, 1991, he invited tourists into the facility as "volunteers" in order to test out his newest invention, the eight-passenger DeLorean time machine, by traveling one day into the future.  Meanwhile, Doc traveled to 2015 in the original DeLorean (a new time machine being built out of another DeLorean) to make sure the space time continuum was back to normal after the events of his previous time traveling adventures, while his other Institute scientists traveled to 1885 and 1955. However, in 1955, [[Biff Tannen]] stowed away on the IFT scientists' time machine, hitching a ride back to the present-day Institute, which set up the ride's main storyline.  ===Queue=== Visitors to the Institute waited outside the facility. The queue video featured clips from the ''Back to the Future'' trilogy, as well as new footage featuring Doc, diagrams for other innovations, ostensibly created by him, newsreel footage of him with [[Albert Einstein]] and other historical figures, and a "live" video feed from 2015 in which he explained the experiment.  ===Pre-show=== Riders entered the ride as "volunteers" for a time travel experiment at the Institute of Future Technology. Doc explained that the plan was for them to travel one day into the future, but that caution must be exercised as Biff, who graduated from Hill Valley High School in 1955, has escaped his time period and is now running amok in the space-time continuum. Once inside, Doc revealed some of the inventions he had been working on, including his "crowning achievement" &ndash; an 8-passenger [[DeLorean DMC-12]] time machine (also a convertible), which is what the riders would be using in the experiment. Unknown to Doc, Biff had infiltrated the Institute &ndash; he appeared to the riders, asking for assistance in finding Doc's time machine. Heather then announced that the pre-flight system checks were in progress and informed the riders to stand by for an announcement from Doc.  Biff trapped Doc in his office, and it was revealed that when one of the time traveling teams were conducting an experiment back in 1955, Biff stowed away. He takes the DeLorean and vanished into time. Worried about the havoc Biff would cause to the space-time continuum, Doc frantically pleaded with the riders to assist him and said that the only way to bring Biff back to the present was to accelerate to 88 miles per hour and bump him (which will open a time vortex that would send both time vehicles back to their original point of departure); they entered the 8-passenger time vehicle, led by one of Doc's assistants, after going over final safety instructions. Doc then informed them with some helpful advice saying that the time vehicle Biff had stolen had a sub-ether time-tracking scanner; that way whatever time period he may be, the riders' vehicle would pin-point to that exact location. They then followed Biff into time.  ===Ride=== When the time machine's doors closed, Doc used his remote control to control it, hover it, and accelerate to 88 miles per hour (with electric sparks coming from it, speeding through the open door and passing through the wormhole) and the ride began. First, Biff lead the riders to [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]] in 2015 where they chased him through town. They smashed into neon signs, flew over neighborhoods and the town square, and the chase culminated at the iconic clock tower. He then departed for the [[ice age]]. The riders followed, and slowly lowered into the icy caverns. Biff honked his horn, causing an avalanche that damaged the riders' vehicle. Flying out of the caverns, the riders saw Biff shoot away into time, but their own engine had failed, and began to plummet down a chasm. Doc managed to restart the vehicle, accelerating backward and through time into the [[Cretaceous Period]].  Upon arriving, the clock display on the DeLorean's dashboard blinked 12:00, as a reference to a [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] that has lost power. The riders followed Biff's vehicle into a dormant volcano in which a [[Tyrannosaurus]] was discovered. Biff goaded it into attacking the riders, who barely escaped. It struck Biff's vehicle, sending it flying out of control; the dinosaur then swallowed the riders' vehicle, but spat it out mere seconds later. It then dropped down onto a lava river to see Biff's DeLorean, then damaged and unable to maneuver, moving down an active [[lava]] flow toward the edge of a cliff, with Biff pleading for help from Doc. As both vehicles plunged over the edge, the riders' one accelerated to time travel speed and bumped Biff's, sending both of them back through the vortex to the original point of departure &ndash; the present, at the Institute of Future Technology (in which they crashed through the ''Back to the Future'' logo in front), where Biff got out and thanked the riders and Doc for saving his life, but was soon seized by security. Riders exited the vehicle, as Doc thanked them and reminded them that, "The future is what you make it!" An animated logo of the Institute of Future Technology flashed up on the screen with the words "Please lift lap bar and exit" and after a few seconds Doc warned, "Hurry up! Get out! Before you meet yourself coming in!" As guests left, the song "[[Back in Time (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Back in Time]]" played.

Barton Fink
  In 1941, Barton Fink's first [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] play, ''Bare Ruined Choirs'', has achieved critical and popular success. His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in Hollywood has offered him a thousand dollars per week to write film scripts. Barton hesitates, worried that moving to California would separate him from "the common man", his focus as a writer. He accepts the offer, however, and checks into the Hotel Earle, a large and unusually deserted building. His room is sparse and draped in subdued colors; its only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun.  In his first meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick, Barton explains that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is (as Lipnick says) "less Hollywood". Lipnick promises that his only concern is Barton's writing ability and assigns his new employee to a wrestling film. Back in his room, however, Barton is unable to write. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, is the source of the noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for "the common man", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman. Later, Barton falls asleep, but is awakened by the incessant whine of a mosquito.  Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Barton consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. While in the men's room, Barton meets the novelist William Preston (W.P.) "Bill" Mayhew, who is vomiting in the next stall. They briefly discuss movie writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. When Barton arrives, Mayhew is drunk and yelling wildly. His secretary, Audrey Taylor, reschedules the meeting and confesses to Barton that she and Mayhew are in love. When they finally meet for lunch, Mayhew, Audrey, and Barton discuss writing and drinking. Before long, Mayhew argues with Audrey, slaps her, and wanders off, drunk. Rejecting Barton's offer of consolation, Audrey explains that she feels sorry for Mayhew since he is married to another woman who is "disturbed".  [[File:John Goodman 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Coen brothers wrote the role of Charlie Meadows for actor John Goodman, in part because of the "warm and friendly image that he projects for the viewer".<ref name="CN176" />]] With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they apparently have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears the sound of the mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it.  Soon afterward, Barton is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's real name is Karl "Madman" Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after shooting his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns to his room and examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie returns as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming "I'll show you the life of the mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to his own room, saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.  In a final meeting, a disappointed Lipnick, in uniform (as he attempts to secure an [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] commission), angrily chastises Barton for writing "a fruity movie about suffering" then informs him that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Barton will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes so he can be ridiculed as a loser around the studio while Lipnick is in the war. Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. She then assumes the pose from the picture.

Basket Case 3: The Progeny
 After crudely trying to sew his monstrous former conjoined twin Belial back on to his side at the end of the previous film, Duane Bradley is re-separated from Belial and put in a straitjacket and padded cell in Granny Ruth's haven for "unique (deformed) individuals". After several months of captivity Duane is released by Granny Ruth, who is preparing to take everyone on a road trip to the home of her ex-husband Doctor Hal Rockwell, who will help in giving birth to Belial's equally misshapen girlfriend Eve's babies; before leaving for the trip, Granny Ruth sternly tells Duane to stay away from Belial, who has stopped speaking to Duane telepathically after Duane's attempt to put them back together.  While traveling via bus to Hal's house in Peachtree County the group stop at a drug store, where Granny Ruth meets local sheriff Andrew Griffin while Duane, attempting to wriggle out a bus window, meets the sheriff's daughter Opal, who he tries to convince help him and Belial escape. Before Duane can talk to Opal any further, Granny Ruth returns and boards the bus and heads back on track to Hal's house, having sweet talked Sheriff Griffin into letting her leave despite the bus being illegally parked.  Eventually reaching Hal's home Duane escapes out a window after Granny Ruth decides to give him a chance and removes his straitjacket; as Duane is imprisoned by Opal and several officers in the local jail, Eve prepares to give birth, which is complicated when Belial mauls Hal, the sight of him in surgical attire causing him to remember his original separation from Duane. With Hal incapacitated Belial is drugged to calm him down and the birth of his and Eve's twelve children is overseen by Little Hal, Hal and Granny Ruth's multi-armed and blob-like prodigy son. Shortly after Eve and Belial's children are born, Deputies Bailey and Baxter break into the Rockwell house, having realized there is a million dollar reward for the capture of both Duane and Belial. While the freaks party Bailey and Baxter find the sleeping babies and, mistaking the groggy Eve for Belial, shoot and kill her before fleeing with the babies when the freaks come after them.  At the police station, Sheriff Griffin finds his daughter in the midst of trying to rape Duane in [[dominatrix]] attire and sends her away, shortly before Bailey and Baxter arrive with the babies. Employing a nice bit of alliteration for which all the deputies names were clearly created: "Bailey, you book the Bradley boy, Baxter take the bassinet of baby Belials in back and get Brody to come by... Where's Brennan and Banner?... Bowling", Sheriff Griffin sends the obviously shaken Bailey and Baxter back to their homes and goes off to see what is going on at the Rockwell residence, leaving Officers Brennan, Banner, and Brody in charge of the station. Breaking into the Rockwell house Sheriff Griffin finds Granny Ruth and the freaks in the midst of mourning the dead Eve and the sheriff, disturbed by the sight of the freaks and Little Hal, hurries back to the station, which Belial had broken into. As Belial attacks Brennan, Banner and Brody, Opal releases Duane from his cell, hoping he can stop Belial. Belial kills Brennan by crushing his throat (causing his eyes and teeth to pop out) and rips Banner's head off before trying to maul Brody, who accidentally blasts Opal (who crushes one of the babies in her death throes) with his shotgun prior to having his neck snapped by Belial. Putting Belial in his basket, Duane runs from the station just as Sheriff Griffin appears and opens fire, injuring Belial. Wanting to help Belial reclaim his babies and take revenge on the remaining police Duane makes up with Belial and has Little Hal construct a robotic exoskeleton for him, which Belial utilizes to butcher Bailey and Baxter.  At Eve's funeral Granny Ruth rallies the grieving freaks and they all travel to the police station, where Sheriff Griffin, grieving over his dead daughter, offers them a deal: Belial for the babies. Granny Ruth agrees to the sheriff's offer and tells him to show up at an abandoned factory on the outskirts of town for the trade; after the meeting at the station Granny Ruth and the freaks ransack a fast food restaurant, scaring away all the customers, much to the chagrin of the staff.  Arriving at the factory with the babies and a shotgun for protection, Sheriff Griffin is ambushed by Belial and the two of them fight; Belial has the upper hand due to his exoskeleton. After seemingly killing Sheriff Griffin with a blow to the head from his mechanical claw, Belial goes to retrieve his children, but the recovered sheriff ambushes and trips him. Flailing about in his armor, Belial scores a hit against Sheriff Griffin, who is swarmed and killed by the babies when he falls into their cradle.  With the babies reclaimed Granny Ruth, Duane, Belial, and the freaks attack a talk show entitled Renaldo; Belial mauls the titular host. Speaking into the camera, Granny Ruth tells the world that the freaks will no longer hide in the shadows and will fight back if oppressed.  She finishes her speech by telling everyone to have a nice day.

Bill's stepmother Missy divorces his father in favor of Ted's, who threatens Ted with military school should they fail the Battle of the Bands. Evil Bill and Evil Ted arrive and the robots eventually replace Bill and Ted, killing them by throwing the two over the side of a cliff at [[Vasquez Rocks]]. The robots behave rudely to the princesses and work to ruin the duo's fame.  Bill and Ted's souls are met by [[Death (personification)|Death]] who challenges them in a game for their souls. Bill and Ted escape after giving Death a [[Wedgie|"melvin"]]. They attempt to alert their families but their ethereal forms prove difficult, and at one point, are cast down into Hell at a [[séance]] held by Missy. In Hell, they are tormented by Satan, made to face their own fears, manifesting as Col Oates, the Easter Bunny, and Granny S. Preston, and realize their only escape is to take Death's offer. Taken to Death's chambers, the spirit gives them the option of what game to play. Bill and Ted, to Death's dismay, select modern games like [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]], [[Cluedo|Clue]] and [[Twister (game)|Twister]],<ref></ref>  in a (ever-changing) best 3 out of 5 format. They easily beat Death. Death admits defeat and unwillingly becomes their servant. Bill and Ted recognize they need to locate the smartest person in the universe to help build robots to counter De Nomolos' evil robots. Death escorts the two to Heaven, and with God's help, are directed to an alien named Station who has the ability to split into two identical twins, and readily offers to help Bill and Ted.  Death brings them back to the mortal world, where it is the night of the Battle of the Bands. Bill and Ted take Station to a hardware store, and then race in their van back to the concert while Station constructs good robots. Just as the evil robots take the stage, Bill and Ted arrive, and Station's robots easily defeat the evil ones. De Nomolos appears in the time booth, ready to defeat Bill and Ted himself, and overrides the broadcasting equipment to send the video footage of this to everyone on the planet. The two recognize they can later go back in time to arrange events for De Nomolos to be trapped in the present, aided by Death and Station; though De Nomolos is apparently able to do the same, Bill and Ted gain the upper hand with the explanation that it is only the winners who get to go back, and De Nomolos is arrested by Ted's father. Ms. Wardroe reveals herself to be a disguised Rufus, having assured Bill and Ted's spot in the concert, and urges them to play.  As Bill and Ted reunite with their fiancées, they realize they are still terrible musicians, and the four use the time booth; though they return immediately, "an intense 16 months of guitar training plus a two week honeymoon" have passed for them, they have married the princesses and each is raising a young infant "Little Ted" and "Little Bill". They begin to perform a stunning rock ballad, joined by Death, Station, and the good robots. The worldwide broadcast set by De Nomolos continues, and Wyld Stallyns' music is played across the globe, creating harmony. Over the credits, it's shown through newspaper articles that the band, along with Death, go through many perks of fame before eventually taking their act to [[Mars]].  
Black Robe (film)
 Set in [[Canada (New France)|New France]] in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the [[Beaver Wars]]), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become [[Quebec City]]. [[Jesuit]] missionaries are trying to encourage the local [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] [[First Nations|Indians]] to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. [[Samuel de Champlain]], founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young [[Jesuit]] priest, to find a distant [[Mission (Christian)|Catholic mission]] in a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] village.  LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] [[First Nations|Indians]] whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina ([[August Schellenberg]]) - an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife ([[Tantoo Cardinal]]); and Annuka ([[Sandrine Holt]]), their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.  The group meet with a band of [[Innu people|Montagnais]], First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais [[shaman]] is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.  As they recover LaForgue, a party of [[Iroquois]] (specifically [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]) attacks them, killing Chomina's wife and taking the rest captive. They are taken to an Iroquois fortress, where they are forced to [[Gauntlet (punishment)|run the gauntlet]], to watch Chomina's young son killed, and told they will be slowly tortured to death the next day. That night Annuka seduces their guard, allowing him to engage in [[coitus]] with her.  When his [[orgasm]] distracts him she strikes him with a caribou hoof, rendering him unconscious and allowing them to escape. Chomina, dying of a wound from his capture, sees a small grove he has dreamed of many times before, and realizes it is the place he is destined to die.  LaForgue tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Chomina to embrace Christ before he dies. As Chomina freezes to death in the snow, he sees the ''[[Manitou|She-Manitou]]'' appearing to him.  As the weather grows colder, Annuka and Daniel take LaForgue to the outskirts of the Huron settlement, but leave him to enter it alone, because Chomina had dreamed that this must happen. LaForgue finds all but one of the French inhabitants dead, murdered by the Hurons who blamed them for a [[smallpox]] epidemic.  The leader of the last survivors tells LaForgue that the Hurons are dying, and he should offer to save them by [[baptizing]] them.  LaForgue confronts the Hurons.  When their leader asks LaForgue if he loves them, LaForgue thinks of the faces of all the Indians he has met on his journey, and answers "Yes".  The leader then asks him to baptize them, and the Hurons accept Christianity.  The film ends with a golden sunrise.  An intertitle explains that fifteen years later, the Huron were massacred by the Iroquois, and the French mission was destroyed.  
Billy Bathgate (film)

Changing his last name to Bathgate, after a local street, he goes to work for Schultz's organization, serving mostly as a gopher for Schultz.  Billy is present when Schultz murders his former partner Bo Weinberg, who Schultz believes betrayed him. Schultz then begins a relationship with Weinberg's beautiful, married, girlfriend, Drew Preston.  Facing legal charges in a court in [[upstate New York]], Schultz brings Billy and Drew along.

Billy is taken before Luciano, who warns him that he knows where Billy's family lives, before letting him go.  
Bingo (1991 film)
 Bingo is an outcast circus dog whom his owners, Steve ([[Simon Webb (actor)|Simon Webb]]) and Ginger ([[Suzie Plakson]]), pay little attention to. Their star puppy, Lauren, develops an infection from having stepped on a nail, so they use Bingo in place of her for their next act - The Ring of Fire. But Bingo is afraid of fire (due to the fact that he experienced it as a young puppy and furthermore lost his own mother that way) and chickens out. In rage of the embarrassment, Steve gets ready to shoot him, but his wife, Ginger stops him and while trying to restrain him, tells Bingo to start over and find a family. Bingo does so when Ginger finally agrees with Steve to kill him when Bingo mistakes her orders several times.  The next day, Chuckie and his brother, Chickie along with friends of his go for a bike ride but Chuckie is too slow. To prove to the clan that he isn't scared, he attempts to jump a bridge (with sunglasses), but based on lack of skills, nearly kills himself in the process. Bingo sees the whole thing and jumps on Chuckie's stomach to get the water out of him. The next day after that, Chuckie wakes up to find himself completely naked and all his clothes have been hung up on the washing line (including Bingo's collar). He eventually finds Bingo and thanks him for saving his life, and that they'll be friends for life. Bingo finds a fish for Chuckie to eat but encounter a bear in the process, to which Bingo manages to drive off.  Meanwhile, Chuckie's parents Natalie and Hal, the latter being the [[place kicker]] for the [[Denver Broncos]], worry over their son. But the next morning, when Chuckie does return, they don't want to know where he was, instead telling him to take a shower as he smells like "wet dog". Chuckie has to leave for school. After that, both boy and dog spend more time together (skateboarding, reading magazines, video games and  doing math homework). Feeling  ignored and even emotionally abused by his parents and older brother who seem to care more about his father's NFL career he considers Bingo to be godsend, but Bingo causes trouble as well (getting into Natalie's cold cream, chewing Chickie's citizenship award, soiling the driveway which Hal had slipped in).  Chuckie returns home and his best friend is largely blamed for the incidents. Hal tells him to go upstairs and start packing as he has been traded to another team, the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Chuckie makes a death-proof box for Bingo to sleep in so he can take him with him. But Bingo sneaks out in the middle of the night and goes to see the next-door's dog (whom he met earlier) with flowers and a bottle of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. The next morning, he misses Chuckie's car as it drives off on the journey to their new home. Chasing the car, Chuckie's parents spot him, and they drive away.  Bingo then gets into an encounter with a policeman, who believes he has been drinking and fines him. After escaping, Bingo passes out from dehydration and is taken in by a man (who turns out that he kills dogs and cooks them). Bingo advises the rest of the captured dogs to dig under the cells and then attack him. Then he drives a truck (with the man and his wife in a cell) and jumps out as they crash.  As Chuckie and his family are staying at a motel, Bingo is around somewhere sniffing garbage. There, he is taken in by two criminals, Lenny and Eli. He sees that they have taken a couple and their two children, Sandy and Cindy, as hostages. Bingo realises they could be killed, so he telephones 911 and frees the family. The next day, the authorities arrive to arrest the kidnappers. In gratitude, the family take him in and the girls argue over what to call their new pet until a man comes in to take Bingo to court. After an unfair trial, Bingo is jailed for contempt of court.  Bingo ends up in a cell with a man known as "Four-Eyes" ([[Wayne Robson]]), who befriends him and saves him from a knife incident (involving Lenny and Eli) in the laundry room. That night, they escape together, but Four-Eyes isn't so lucky (he is shot non-fatally at by a nightwatchman). Then Bingo walks for a long time and stops for a rest at a kind young woman, Bunny's house. She gives him some travel goodies and he walks again. He then finds Chuckie, but sees that he is walking another dog, so he mistakenly thinks he doesn't care about him anymore. Homeless and alone, he finds work in a friendly cook's restaurant.  Lenny and Eli are informed of Bingo's escape and set out to kill him, but when they have him cornered, Chuckie spots them and races his bike towards the criminals, before he is picked up and put in their car. Once at their hideout, Chuckie is tied up and gagged. After an altercation over the phone with Natalie, Eli tells her they have Chuckie and that they want Hal to miss all his field-goals for that day's game. Natalie and Chickie repeatedly answer the door to Bingo, who holds a number of Chuckie's clothes. When he brings home enough of them to confirm evidence, Natalie suddenly becomes worried, and Chickie agrees to go out and try and spot where Chuckie is held hostage, in which he succeeds.  Natalie phones Hal (although he told her numerous times that she shouldn't call him at the stadium) and tells him about how Lenny and Eli have Chuckie and are holding him captive. When said that they'll pay any amount, Natalie informs him that it's not like that and that Hal needs to miss all his field-goals or risk Chuckie being killed. After the phone call, Hal asks if he could have a word with his coach; he asks him "What's more important, family or football?", to which the coach responds that football is his life.  Chickie runs into the room and tells Natalie that he's found Chuckie and that they have no choice but to call the police. Meanwhile, Eli and Lenny are attacked by Bingo, and is captured and tied up with Chuckie. Carelessly, Eli tosses his cigarette, setting the lair on fire just as they break for the car. Chuckie, seemingly dying, tells Bingo to ring the fire alarm. Bingo does so, overcoming his fear of fire. The police move in and listen to the game on the radio. Then they arrest Lenny and Eli and nurse Chuckie's injuries. They call the bomb squad to find a bomb that was hidden in one of the suitcases. After finding out that Chuckie is safe, Hal scores a last-minute, crucial field-goal, but at the same time Bingo is holding the suitcase containing the bomb and it explodes. Natalie screams and faints, and so does Chuckie. The fireman then makes a call and finds a piece of fur in mid-air.  When Chuckie wakes up, he is in the hospital with Natalie, Hal and Chickie. Hal tells him they found Bingo so they go to see him in his room. Once they enter his room, they find a crowd of people (including the dogs that were tortured). They are all the people whom Bingo met on his journey, and Natalie tells Chuckie that they are Bingo's friends and they've been at the hospital all night, since they all heard his story on the news and wanted to wish him well. Chuckie pulls the curtain to reveal Bingo with a bandaged arm, and lying down in bed. Chuckie tells him he needs him and he must pull through, and the doctor muses that he'll be fine. Then Chuckie asks Hal if he can keep Bingo, and after some encouragement from everybody, he gives in and says "Sure, son. Just as soon as we have him neutered." The film ends with a circle around Bingo's head when he gives an upset look as the credits roll.

Chen (Robert Yun Ju Ahn), the owner of the funeral home and prime suspect in the case, claims the three [[mummification|mummified]] corpses in question are not children but ancient [[demon]]s known as "kyoshi". It seems the little monsters have been around for centuries as a result of an age-old curse and can only be placated with offerings of human flesh &mdash; with which the mortician has been supplying them his entire life. When Chen is jailed on murder charges, the under-fed ghouls awaken in search of dinner, trapping the staff inside the mortuary walls and devouring them.

Body Parts (film)
  Bill Chrushank ([[Jeff Fahey]]) is a psychologist working with convicted killers at a prison. While driving to work, Bill gets in a horrific car accident and loses an arm. At the hospital, Dr. Agatha Webb ([[Lindsay Duncan]]) convinces Bill’s wife to sign off on an experimental transplant surgery. Bill is wheeled into the operating room where he notes several armed police in hospital scrubs. While Bill's surgery takes place, Dr. Webb removes the unknown donor’s head from his body on a nearby operating table.   Bill awakens from the surgery and begins to adjust to his new arm. After he is released from the hospital, he resumes his work and things seem to be back to normal. However, Bill starts seeing visions of horrible acts of murder (as if he is committing them) and occasionally loses control of his new arm. At the prison, Ray, a convict whom Bill is interviewing, tells Bill that the tattoo on his new arm is only given to inmates on death row. Bill has a police friend scan his new fingerprints and is shocked to discover the arm came from convicted serial killer Charley Fletcher ([[John Walsh (actor stuntman)|John Walsh]]), who had murdered 20 people.  Bill confronts Dr. Webb, who dismisses his concerns. Unconvinced, he follows her and finds the identities of two other patients: Mark Draper (Peter Murnik) and Remo Lacey ([[Brad Dourif]]) who received the killer’s legs and other arm, respectively. Bill visits Remo, who was a struggling artist before the transplant but now is making a small fortune selling paintings he made with his new arm. Noting Remo’s paintings depict the same visions he had, Bill tells him that he is painting what the killer saw. Remo, however, only cares about his newfound success and dismisses Bill’s warnings. Bill meets Mark and tries to warn him but Mark is just happy to be able to walk again and advises Bill to be grateful and move on.  Bill becomes increasingly agitated and violent. He involuntarily hits his son and almost strangles his wife to death while sleeping. For the safety of his family, Bill stays in a hotel. He demands that Dr. Webb remove his arm but she refuses, stating that the problems he is experiencing are insignificant compared to her experiment's success. Bill meets up with Remo and Mark at a bar. A drunk man recognizes Bill from news about the surgery, and demands to see his arm. Bill snaps and a bar fight breaks out where Bill single-handedly takes out several men and almost kills one before being stopped.  As Mark returns home, his legs suddenly stop functioning. Scared, Mark calls Bill, who hears Mark yell and struggle with someone. Bill goes to Mark’s apartment and finds him dead, with both legs ripped out and missing. Bill calls the police and implores the lead detective to check on Remo. However, they are too late as Charley — who is still alive, having his head transplanted onto a new body — rips Remo's arm off and throws him out a window.  As Bill and the detective stop at a traffic light, Charley pulls up in a car beside them and handcuffs his wrist to Bill's. Charley speeds away, and the detective desperately tries to keep up, lest Bill’s arm gets ripped off. Bill eventually uses the detective's gun to destroy the handcuff just before they hit a divider that splits the road in two. As the detective leaves the car and opens fire on Charley, Bill drives away to pursue the killer. Charley brings his old limbs back to Dr. Webb.  Armed with a gun from the detective’s car, Bill enters the hospital. He finds an operating room where he sees the gruesome sight of Charley’s torso and limbs in a glass case, wiggling as if having a mind of their own. Dr. Webb appears and says she is ready to take the arm back, and Charley knocks Bill unconscious. Bill wakes up strapped to an operating table. As Dr. Webb approaches him with a circular saw, he breaks his restraints, knocks her out and wrestles with Charley for his shotgun. Right before Charley can pull the trigger, Bill is able to snap his neck. He destroys the glass case and shoots at Charley’s body parts. Charley, still alive, aims at Bill with the detective's gun, but accidentally kills Dr. Webb. Bill shoots Charley in the head, killing him for good.  Bill sits with his wife in a park. In his journal, he notes that he hasn’t had any other problems with the arm after Charley's death, and he is still thankful to both Dr. Webb and Charley for the new arm.

Bloodmatch
 The film opens with a man chasing another man. The chaser is Brick Bardo, who is investigating the death of his brother. He catches up to Davey, whose attempt to fight him, results in Davey getting knocked out and being tied up to the ground in the boiling sun. Brick interrogates Davey through torturous methods and tells him that Davey was given evidence that Brick's brother was involved in a kickboxing fight fixing ring, which resulted in his exile and eventual murder. Brick demands the name of the four people who gave Davey the evidence as they are responsible for his death. Davey names Brent Caldwell, Mike Johnson, Billy Munoz, and Connie Angel.   Brick has a partner in Max, a woman who seduces Brent, now a middleweight champion, and after a session of lovemaking, pulls a gun on him knocks him out with ether. Brick calls Billy, a former kickboxing legend who is now working as a janitor. Brick tells Billy he has kidnapped his daughter to meet him in Las Vegas if he wants to see his daughter again. Mike, a former heavyweight champion, is on the run from three hoodlums. Mike attempts to fight them off, but the numbers game is too much. Max arrives and rescues Mike from the thugs and offers to take him to Las Vegas. Connie is a successful businesswoman for the World Martial Arts Council who has been seeing another man behind her estranged husband's back and is only looking to get away from the council as a rich woman after the impending divorce. Brick shows up and beats up Connie's lover and confronts her. She attempts to fight him but fails with Brick knocking her out.  At an abandoned arena in Las Vegas, Brent, Billy, Mike, and Connie are all tied up in front of a ring. Max wakes up the four and all four are shocked to learn about each other. They wonder why they are tied up  and attempt to get loose. Connie remembers Wood Wilson, an old boyfriend who she defeated in a male vs female kickboxing match, and is revealed to be Brick's brother. The four were asked to testify against Wood for fight fixing but they all were cancelled with Brent vehemently denying that he was ever involved in anything involving Wood. Billy nearly goes free, but Brick is able to stop him before escaping. Brick enters the ring and lets them in on what is happening. A recorded conversation reveals that Jack, a sports commissioner, was involved in fight fixing and he had a friend who was involved in the ring. Brick killed Jack and makes a comment about Jack's partner Sam having a friend who set up Wood Wilson, leading to his death. Brick intends to use the ring as his interrogation place, fighting each of the four until he gets answers.   Mike is the first one to face Brick's interrogation. Brick makes the stipulations. If Mike wins, everyone goes free, but if Brick wins, Mike dies and the rest will continue to be interrogated. Brick promises Max will not pull a double cross. Brick confronts Mike about his part in the evidence against Wood after hearsay towards some friends, who in turn, went to the one responsible for killing Wood. Mike attempts to fight hard, but Brick fights harder, and just when Mike is about to die, Billy stops him and offers to talk. Billy heads to the ring and demands to see his daughter. Brick gives Billy the news that his daughter has died. In a rage, Billy begins to fight Brick. At first getting the upper hand, Billy lets his emotions get the best of him and Brick, taking full advantage, telling Brick that he knows of his involvement because of his career coming to an end and a divorce that left him alone to raise his kids. Brick tells Billy if he tells him who set Wood up, he will protect his son's life. Billy says he only received a letter but no name and Brick promises to kill Billy's son. Brick proceeds to break Billy's back, killing him.  Brent is third in line for interrogation. As he makes his way to the ring, he attempts to pull a knife on Max, but has the gun pointed to him again. Brent enters the ring and Brick begins his interrogation, accusing Brent as the fight fixer. Brent once again denies it and promises not to say anything. Brick accuses Brent of being heartless not caring about anyone but himself and his career. Brick accuses Brent of getting his title and when someone threatened to stop him, he would go after them. He flat out accuses Brent of being the one responsible for Wood's exile and eventual murder. Connie, still tied up, deciphers that Brent is the one who killed Wood Wilson. As Brick fights Brent, a barely breathing Mike crawls towards Connie and hands her the knife Brent had earlier. In the ring, an enraged Brick tells Brent, who is begging for his life that Wood didn't beg for his life. When Brent asks how he knew, Brick confesses he was there and kills Brent, telling him he didn't beg him.   When Max goes to retrieve Connie, Connie frees herself and throws the knife at Max, killing her. Brick finally reveals to Connie the whole truth. Brick is actually Wood Wilson. Connie doesn't believe it, but Brick confesses it all. He never had died and changed his face after Brent had viciously beaten him five years ago. While Brick is relieved that he killed his "murderer", he still finds Connie guilty for her actions in the fight fixing scheme. Connie admits she was the mastermind behind the scheme so that she can make enough money and she and Wood could escape together because she felt Wood was being held back. Wood believed in honor and wasn't going along with it, only having a care about making money. Connie admits she was wrong for choosing money over her love for Wood. Asking how to make it right, Brick/Wood tells Connie they have to fight and admits he never killed Billy's daughter, but has her hidden. If Connie wins, he will release Billy's daughter. Brick and Connie fight with Connie getting the upper hand and finally defeating Brick/Wood once again after Brick attempts to overpower her and seduce her again as a trick. A kick to the chest on a down Brick kills him.  The next day, Connie is sitting in her office, awaiting to see Billy's kids. She promises to take care of them.

After chatting for a bit, Furious immediately has Tre rake the leaves off the front lawn. That night, Furious tells Tre that he has him work to teach him how to be responsible. That night, Tre hears his father shooting at a burglar who tries to rob the house. Two policemen arrive an hour later, and while the [[White people|white]] officer is civil and courteous, the [[African-American|black]] one is disrespectful towards Furious. The next day, Tre and his friends go out with Chris who shows them a dead body. While there, a group of older boys in a [[Rollin 60's Neighborhood Crips|Watts Crip]] gang steal Ricky's football and Doughboy tries to retrieve it, but is defeated. While the older boys walk away, one of them gives Ricky his ball back. Later in the day, Furious spends father/son bonding time with Tre, taking him fishing by the seaside and tells the boy more about his life prior to having him, including his military experience in the [[Vietnam War]], in hopes of making his son proud of him. He concludes his story by advising Tre to never join [[United States Army|the army]], stating that a black man has no place in the army.

After a visit from a recruiter, a mildly embarrassing experience for Ricky due to his unkempt home and his brother's rudeness, he is informed that he must score a 700 or higher on the [[SAT]]s test in order to qualify. Ricky and Tre take the test on the same day. Afterwards, they go to see Furious at his office to unwind. Furious takes Tre and Ricky to [[Compton, California]] to talk about the dangers of decreasing property values in the black community. That night, during a local [[street racing]] gathering, Ricky is provoked by Ferris, a member of the [[Bloods|Crenshaw Mafia Gangsters]]. In response, Doughboy brandishes his handgun, leading to a brief argument between the two gangs. When the two gangs are finished arguing, Ferris fires his own gun in the air causing everyone to leave. While Tre talks about leaving [[Los Angeles]], he and Ricky are pulled over by the police. The cop is the exact same one who was disrespectful towards his father seven years earlier; he intimidates and threatens Tre with his gun, knowing he can't do anything. Distraught, Tre goes to Brandi's house, where he finally breaks down. After she consoles him, they [[sexual intercourse|have sex]] for the first time.  The following day, Ricky has a fight with Doughboy. While Ricky and Tre walk to a nearby store, they see Ferris and his gang driving around the neighborhood and in an attempt to avoid them, the pair cut through back alleyways and split up. As Tre turns back to Ricky, Ferris' car pulls up. Ricky turns to run but one of Ferris' men shoots Ricky in the leg with a shotgun. A second shot hits Ricky in the back through the chest, killing him. Doughboy and his gang, who had sensed that Tre and Ricky were in trouble, catch up with them, but are too late. Devastated and helpless, the boys carry Ricky's lifeless body back home. When Brenda and Shanice see Ricky's corpse, they break down in tears and blame Doughboy, who unsuccessfully tries to comfort them and explain the truth. That night, a distraught Brenda reads Ricky's SAT results, discovering he scored a 710, enough to qualify for the scholarship he wanted.  The remaining boys vow vengeance on Ferris and his crew. Furious finds Tre preparing to take his [[.357 Magnum]], but convinces Tre to abandon his plans for revenge. However, Brandi and Furious catch Tre sneaking out of his bedroom window to join Doughboy. That night, as the gang drives across the city, Tre asks to be let out of the car and returns home, realizing that his father was right to keep him from falling into an endless cycle of violence. When Tre gets home, Furious is waiting for him. They both look at each other without saying a word, and Furious retreats into his bedroom. Meanwhile, Doughboy finds Ferris' gang at a local fast-food outlet, and Monster opens fire on them, killing one and wounding the other two. Doughboy gets out and kills the other wounded gang member and executes Ferris.  The next day, Doughboy visits Tre, now understanding Tre's reasons for leaving the gang. Doughboy knows that he will soon face retaliation for Ferris' death, and accepts the consequences of his crime-ridden lifestyle. He plaintively questions why America doesn't care about the life in the ghetto. He sorrowfully says that he has no family left now after Ricky's death and Brenda's disownment of him, but is embraced by Tre, who says to Doughboy that he has a brother in him.  The epilogue reveals that Doughboy saw Ricky buried the next day and was [[murder|murdered]] two weeks later. Tre and Brandi resume their relationship, and go on to attend [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] and [[Spelman College|Spelman]] Colleges in [[Atlanta]], respectively.

He buys a house in [[Beverly Hills]], planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in [[Scarsdale]].  Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from gangster [[Jack Dragna]]. [[Mickey Cohen]] robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed.

Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino.  Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate [[Harry Greenberg]]. Harry has betrayed his old associates to save himself. He has also run out of money, from a combination of his gambling habits and being extorted by prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry's trusted friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill him. He is arrested for the murder, but the only witness is a cab driver who dropped Harry off in front of Bugsy's house. The driver is paid to leave town.  Lansky is waiting for Bugsy outside the jail. He gives a satchel of money to his friend. "Charlie doesn't have to know about it," he tells Bugsy, but warns, "I can't protect you anymore." The Flamingo's opening night is a total failure, and $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for, whereupon Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money. He tells her to "keep it and save it for a rainy day." He then tells Lansky never to sell his share of the casino because he will live to thank him someday.  Later that night, Bugsy is shot and killed in his home. Virginia is told the news in Las Vegas and knows her own days could be numbered.

A Brighter Summer Day
  The film takes place over the course of four years in [[Taiwan]], and is about a student in junior high, Xiao Si'r. Xiao Si'r is the fourth child of a large family living in [[Taipei]]. The family lives modestly off of the father's government job, and it is clear that Si'r's mother and father are uncomfortable in Taiwan. The film opens in 1959, as Si'r's father fruitlessly pleads with a school administrator to keep Si'r in day school, as opposed to the night school, which is populated with delinquents. The morning after, Si'r and his father listen to the radio, which is broadcasting a list of students accepted into various schools in Taipei.  The film then advances to 1960, where Si'r, along with his best friend, Cat, is spying on the filming of a period drama in a movie studio. Caught by a guard in the rafters, they steal his flashlight and flee the studio, returning to their school. Si'r, noticing movement in a darkened classroom, turns on the flashlight and startles a pair of lovers, whose identities remain unclear. Si'r and Cat are blamed for smashing a window with a baseball bat that night, but defend themselves from accusations. Baseball bats are banned at the school as a result. The film then proceeds to introduce Si'r's classmates at his night school and peers, most notably two gangs of students, the Little Park Boys, the children of civil servants, and the 217s, the children of military officers. These two gangs are fierce rivals, often attacking one another. Si'r is not a member of either gang, although he is closer to the Little Park Boys than the 217's. The Little Park Boys are led by Honey, who is currently hiding from police. Sly leads the gang in his absence. Si'r tells the teachers he believes Sly was the boy he saw kissing a girl in the classroom; Sly and his girlfriend Jade get into trouble and a rivalry erupts between the two boys as a result. After Sly copies Si'r's test, both boys receive demerits. Si'r's father tells him not to take his principal's words to heart as he is not interested in the true aim of education - moral and intellectual betterment, but nonetheless warns his son to stay out of trouble.  Also introduced is Ming, a girl at Si'r's school who was the girlfriend of Honey. Her single mother works as a maid and suffers chronic asthma. Si'r and Ming meet and become friends, and Si'r develops a crush on her, who claims to be eagerly awaiting Honey. The director of the movie spots Ming with Si'r at the set and offers her a role in the film. She sits a screen test but does not pursue it further after a group of Little Park Boys see her with Si'r and intimidate him. At the same time, Sly proposes a truce between them and the 217s, and arranges for a concert of Western pop music to be held with members from both gangs. Cat, a budding singer, phonetically transcribes the lyrics of [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''Are You Lonesome Tonight?,'' with the help of Si'r's eldest sister, who speaks English, and attempts to record a cover.  Preparations for the concert appear to be going well until Honey, wearing the stolen uniform of a sailor as a disguise, unexpectedly resurfaces and berates Sly for setting up the concert, however he finds that the Little Park Boys no longer seem to respect him and show more loyalty to Sly. The night before the concert, Honey meets with Si'r, who he has taken a liking to, introduces him to the older gang of criminals he now belongs to, and explains the reasons for his disappearance. He had killed one of the 217s - supposedly over Ming - and fled to avoid arrest. Honey also "bequeaths" Ming to Si'r, believing Si'r to be stable.  The following night, the concert is performed. Honey appears outside of the concert hall, demanding to be let in for free and insulting the leaders of the gangs. He briefly attacks several gang members before being subdued by Shandong, the leader of the 217s, who agrees to talk to Honey. While walking along a road and discussing the concert, Shandong pushes Honey into the street where he is hit by a car. While the next morning's news reports call Honey's death an accident, it is clear to all of the gangs that Honey was murdered. Ming is initially devastated by Honey's death, but soon recovers, and begins to show interest in Si'r. Soon, a typhoon hits Taipei, and the Little Park Boys massacre the 217's in the midst of the storm. Si'r finds them butchered. On that same night, Si'r's father is arrested by the secret police. He is forced to leave his home without understanding why he has been arrested. Sly and the surviving Little Park Boys go into hiding. Si'r's friend Ma, the son of a rich general, invites him on a double-date with Jade (who he is courting) and her friend; Si'r goes but is uninterested in the girl.  The focus of the film briefly shifts to Si'r's father. He has been arrested because of his former (non-political) associations with Communists in mainland China. He is initially subject to sleep deprivation and then other forms of exhaustion, though he cannot remember critical details about these figures or his friendships with them. After several days, the officials in charge of Si'r's father decide that he poses no threat and order his release. He is relieved to be home, although he is fired as a result of the arrest.  Si'r, meanwhile, has begun a relationship with Ming, and seems to be improving academically. However, she reveals to him that she flirts with other boys, including an adult doctor who treats her mother, and this disturbs Si'r. Ming visits the doctor who reveals he is now engaged; Ming dislikes his fiancée but he does not take her views seriously, believing her to be naive. Si'r and Ming are play fighting with weapons at Ma's house when Ming accidentally fires a bullet at Si'r, leaving him stunned in shock. The next day Si'r is sent to see the school doctor (the same one flirting with Ming). The school nurse berates Si'r for chasing girls, causing Si'r to swear at her. He is once again sent to the principal's office and receives another demerit. As Si'r's father and the administrator argue over Si'r's qualities as a student, Si'r grabs a baseball bat (the school had earlier decreed that it would confiscate all baseball bats on school grounds) and shatters a lightbulb. This act gets him expelled from school, and, along with his father's arrest, earns him the distrust of his fellow students.  Si'r studies to re-take the entrance exams for his school, and aims to become reinstated in the day school, something that brings pride to his father, but upsets Ming, who will see him less as a result. Sly emerges from hiding and apologises to Si'r. Ming's mother is fired by her old employer but goes to work for Ma's parents. The two grow closer and flirt, which upsets Si'r. He begins dating Jade, but it does not work out. She bitterly reveals to him that the girl he saw kissing Sly was Ming, not her. He returns home only to see his father beating his older brother, who took the blame for losing his mother's watch, which was actually Si'r's fault. That night, his sister asks him to convert to [[Christianity]], but he tells her he cannot believe for all the suffering and injustice in the world.  The next day, Si'r is meant to visit the local church with his sister, but instead goes to Ma's and threatens him. Cat attempts to keep the peace to no avail. Si'r visits the film studio and berates the director for his interest in Ming's acting abilities. He then steals Cat's knife and waits outside the school for Ma. Instead, he sees Ming, and berates her for her promiscuity, saying that only he and Honey had the ability to change her. She rejects this, saying that she is unchangeable just like the world is unchangeable, and says he does not understand her and is like the rest of the boys. He stabs her in a fit of rage and misery, and immediately after fails to recognize what he has just done, pleading with her to stand up as she bleeds to death.  Si'r is arrested and held at the police station. Ma is brought in for questioning and cries to himself, having lost his only friend. Si'r becomes hysterical and begins screaming for Ming. Ming's mother attempts suicide but survives. The next day, journalists arrive at her house and question the doctor. After they ask if he was having an affair with Ming, he angrily kicks them out.  Si'r is sentenced to death, but the media controversy around the case provokes the sentence to be changed to 15 years imprisonment. Two years into his sentence, Cat delivers him a tape in which he explains he sent his recording to Elvis, who wrote back and sent him a ring. The prison wardens tell Cat they will deliver the tape, but instead throw it away.  The final scene is set in Si'r's house, now almost devoid of furniture. Si'r's mother is hanging up clothes to dry when she unexpectedly finds Si'r's school uniform. As she sobs into it, the radio starts to broadcast another list of distinguished students.

Buddy visits his father in prison after his mother convinces him. Whilst talking to his friend Julius, Buddy notices his mother is seeing her boss Adrian Mandell a lot. Buddy records a tape of himself playing the guitar for his father, and he suggests going into music but Carol wants Buddy to concentrate on his school work. Terry is released on [[Parole Board for England and Wales|parole]] two weeks later and Des King gives them a lift home. They see that Des has Terry's house redecorated where he gives Terry the cash Carol refused. Terry gets Carol to move back in, but rows later arise between them. Terry gets an electric guitar and an amplifier along with a keyboard for Buddy and a camcorder for himself, which gives him the idea of advertising to film weddings in the local newspaper.  Terry resigns from his job at the [[bookmaker]] and starts working for Des King at his [[Wrecking yard|breakers yard]]. Terry then arranges to have Buddy play with a band of middle-aged men called the Hi-Tones who recently lost their singer. They perform gigs at the wedding receptions Terry films. Terry goes to a party at Carol's office where he meets her boss. This leads to Buddy's parents having a row at home. When Terry tries to help Carol after she drops a milk bottle, she says she does not need him and he leaves.  Terry moves into the caravan at the breakers yard where Buddy visits him. Meanwhile, Julius finds a band and Buddy plays with them at the milk depot. Buddy joins Glenn the milkman, along with Mike and Jason, and Julius becomes their manager and tambourine player. Buddy goes to a [[Teddy boy]] pub to perform with the Hi-Tones where Terry meets a young woman named Dawn; then a fight breaks out after Terry unplugs the [[jukebox]]. Terry and the band, along with Dawn, leave in the van. In the morning, Buddy is angered to find Dawn in the caravan with Terry and walks off. Terry catches up with him, where they argue and Buddy tells him he is now in his own band. The band who called themselves the Hurt performs at [[youth club]]s. After seeing them perform, Terry meets with the band backstage. He advises them to make him the manager to help them get to the top, fearing that no record company will do a deal with someone of Jules' age. The band agrees.  On their first gig with Terry as their manager, they perform at the Manhattan Club where the sound system fails. Terry gets them a studio session and arranges a tour where they perform fourteen gigs in fourteen days. As they discuss it, Terry tells Buddy that he does like Dawn a lot but does not love her. On the tour the band discovers that Terry has renamed it the Wild Ones, as he never liked the Hurt. When they get back, Buddy goes to see his girlfriend Elaine, but is disgusted to find Glenn alone in the house with her. At band practice, Glenn apologises and Buddy forgives him though he does not want Elaine back.   At the breakers yard Terry films a music video for the band's song ''Nothing Serious'' and hands the tape to the video editor Donald to be dubbed and cut. Terry finds a note on the caravan door that reads 'Get stuffed' from Dawn then hears a howl of pain from the office. Terry finds two men attacking Des and manages to shift them off him but he gets stabbed. Buddy telephones his mother and she joins him at the hospital to see Terry. At band practice Julius who temporarily replaces Terry gets Kelly, who Buddy fancied, to help get the single for ''Nothing Serious'' in the shops and radio stations and request it on the radio.  When Terry gets out of hospital, he gets in touch with Bobby Rosen at Mammoth Records. He likes the record and the music video so they go to the studio. After a recording session, Bobby speaks to the band in private in the booth but Terry hears on the speakers. Bobby tells them they will have to change the name of the band and they will have to go without Terry because he is inexperienced and has a criminal record. Buddy catches up with his father who advises him to go back and sign with them. The rest of the band comes along, and Terry tells them he is going to concentrate on the videos with Donald. Julius tells Terry that if he had them under a contract when he took over management he would have screwed money out of him for compensation. This gives Terry the idea of getting money for a new video studio called Video King.  At the opening ceremony of Video King, Buddy invites his parents to a meal for his birthday. Carol suggests a new Italian restaurant, and they go with Kelly. The film ends with Terry arriving at the restaurant in style.

The Butcher's Wife
 As a clairvoyant, Marina awaits signs from beyond that her true love, whoever he may be, is waiting for her, somewhere. When New York butcher Leo Lemke shows up on the tiny North Carolina island of Ocracoke, where Marina lives, she is convinced that he is the man predestined to be her husband. After the wedding, Marina moves into Leo's [[blue-collar]] neighborhood, where she successfully commiserates with such eccentrics as withdrawn teenager Eugene, frustrated singer Stella Keefover, unlucky-in-love actress Robyn Graves, over analytical psychiatrist Dr. Alex Tremor, and [[closeted]] [[lesbian]] dress shop clerk Grace. But what Marina fails to grasp about her powers is that she can see the future of strangers far more clearly than her own, and love is unpredictable no matter how many ways you have to look for it.  The film makes use of several phenomena that can be described as occult portents that meeting a love match is imminent or occult tools to help strengthen, seal or bring about love, luck and happiness.  These include the sudden "finding" of a ring that would serve as a wedding band, falling stars with twin tails, zig-zagged rainbows and found objects symbolizing a change in the finder's path that will cause it to cross with their beloved.  It also popularizes, as the character of Alex Tremor calls it, "a corruption" of a section of [[Symposium (Plato)|Plato's Symposium]] regarding soul mates, referred to in the movie as "split aparts".  In one scene, Dr. Tremor notes an aspect of Marina's visions, and Marina says: "Women have been burned for less."  This is a reference to the witch persecutions in Europe and America between the 15th and 19th centuries, the most famous of which were the Salem Witch Trials, although no "witches" were burned in the Salem hysteria. Lastly, it also references common-use bastardizations of voodoo practices, such as "mojo" bags (or gris gris) and the use of chickens or toads.

 On an Arctic flight the crew of a RAF transport aircraft overflies a crashed aircraft. Although a survivor is spotted, the crew realizes that a rescue is not possible and rules out a landing. Rupert Royce ([[Sam Waterston]]), a U.S. meteorologist aboard the flight, volunteers to parachute to the ice with first aid supplies to treat the survivor.  Bringing supplies with him, Royce lands near the wreckage and finds Averyanov (Aleksandr Potapov), a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] navigator, the sole survivor who is injured and unable to be moved. Intending to wait until further help arrives, Royce makes repairs on the shattered aircraft, but soon realizes help is not coming, as the aircraft is far off course. The ice shifts below the wreckage, further complicating their survival.  When a blizzard strands the two men and forces them to survive on their own, they have to accept that different cultural backgrounds cannot jeopardize their survival. As supplies run low and a leaking heater nearly kills them, releasing deadly carbon monoxide into their small enclosure, Royce begins to make plans for both of them to find a way to reach civilization, the nearest settlement, 200 miles away. The isolation, ever-present wolves and dwindling supplies leaves Royce little option.  Setting out into the wilderness with an improvised sled to carry the injured airman, Averyanov urges Royce to save himself, and not to risk his own life in a vain attempt to save someone who will likely die soon anyway. Royce refuses and strives mightily to save the two "captives" of the  wild.

Wallis is one of them, but he gets pinned down in his car due to a faulty seat-belt and by the time he manages to get out of his car, he is mowed down by Hutchinson in his Blazer and is killed instantly. Hutchinson then crashes his car and flees on foot where he encounters Whipple and her boyfriend Julian. Julian runs off and Hutchinson attempts to carjack her. She manages to flee and escape as Hutchinson fires off a few rounds at the car, smashing the back windshield. Hutchinson then encounters John Laurienti ([[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]) and his disabled daughter. He carjacks Laurienti and hides in the passenger seat of Laurienti's truck, ordering him to drive past the approaching police. Laurienti drives past the police officers who are looking for Hutchinson, but they are unaware Hutchinson is even in the vehicle as they lost sight of him after Wallis's death. Only Silva and Stair are aware of the truth but are unable to communicate to the police and inform them of Hutchinson's whereabouts. To prevent Hutchinson from escaping and potentially killing Laurienti, Silva decides to fly the helicopter directly in front of the truck and lands the helicopter on the road, preventing the truck from going any further. Officers then surround Hutchinson and ram the truck to stop him from firing off any rounds. Laurienti is pulled free unharmed, and Hutchinson is then shot dead by police after attempting to kill Laurienti and the approaching police.  At the end of the film, it is revealed that Whipple has now ended her relationship with Julian and is in a much stronger relationship with her father, who is supporting her during her pregnancy. Wallis's son Dale gives a speech at his father's funeral and breaks down over the sudden death of his father. Tammie plans to head off to College for three years to study a degree and appears a lot more self-confident in herself than before, and Laurienti gets given a new white truck on behalf of KCNC-TV.<ref></ref>  
Child's Play 3
 Eight years after [[Child's Play 2|Chucky's second demise]], the Play Pals company has recovered from bad publicity brought along by Chucky's (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]) murder spree and resumes manufacturing of the Good Guy dolls. The company revives the abandoned factory (where Chucky's mutilated body still remains) and starts releasing a new line of Good Guy dolls. However, in the process, the workers accidentally mix Chucky's blood into a vat of plastic. Since the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray still inhabits the remains, the mixture of the plastic and his cursed blood causes Chucky to revive. Chucky is unwittingly given to Play Pals' [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Mr. Sullivan, whom he kills with a variety of toys. He then uses computer records to locate Andy.  Meanwhile, 16-year-old Andy Barclay ([[Justin Whalin]]), still troubled by his past encounters with Chucky, has been sent to Kent Military Academy after having failed to cope in several foster homes. Colonel Cochran ([[Dakin Matthews]]), the school's [[commandant]], begrudgingly enrolls Andy but advises him to forget his "fantasies" about the doll. Andy befriends cadets Harold Aubrey Whitehurst (Dean Jacobson), Ronald Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), and Kristin DeSilva ([[Perrey Reeves]]), for whom he develops romantic feelings. He also meets Brett C. Shelton ([[Travis Fine]]), a [[lieutenant colonel]] who routinely bullies the cadets.  Shortly after Andy arrives, Tyler is asked to deliver a package to his room. Tyler realizes that the package contains a Good Guy doll and, excited, takes it to the cellar to open it, only to have Chucky burst free from the package. Remembering the rule that he can possess the first person who learns his true nature and that he has a new body, Chucky tells Tyler his secret, but just as Chucky is about to possess him, they are interrupted by Cochran who takes the doll away. Cochran throws Chucky into a garbage truck, but Chucky escapes by luring the driver into the truck's [[compactor]] and crushing him. That night, Chucky attacks Andy and tells him his plans for taking over Tyler's soul. Before Andy can attack Chucky, Shelton comes in and takes the doll from him. Andy tries to get the doll back by sneaking into Shelton's room, but Shelton catches him in the act. Upon realizing the doll has vanished, Shelton suspects it stolen and forces all the cadets to do exercises in the courtyard as punishment.  Andy unsuccessfully tries to warn Tyler about Chucky. At one point, Chucky lures Tyler into playing [[hide-and-seek]] in Cochran's office, where he attempts to possess Tyler again. However, they are interrupted by DeSilva and, moments later, Cochran himself. When the cadets leave, Cochran is suddenly confronted by a knife-wielding Chucky. The resulting shock causes Cochran to suffer a fatal [[heart attack]]. Later, Chucky kills the camp barber Sergeant Botnick ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) by slashing his throat with a [[razor]].  Despite Cochran's death, Sgt. Clark declares that the school's annual [[Military simulation|war games]] will proceed as planned, with Andy and Shelton on the same team. However, Chucky secretly replaces the blank paint bullets of the Red team with live ammunition. When the simulation begins, Chucky accosts Tyler. Tyler stabs Chucky with a pocket knife and flees, trying to find Andy. Chucky then attacks Kristin and holds her hostage, attempting to lure the teams into fighting each other to save her. Chucky forces Andy to exchange Kristin for Tyler.  Suddenly, the Red team descends upon the area and obliviously opens fire with their live rounds, with Shelton being killed in the crossfire. Amidst the chaos, Tyler makes a quick getaway, but before giving chase, Chucky tosses a live grenade at the quarreling cadets. Recognizing the danger, Whitehurst bravely leaps on top of the grenade and sacrifices himself to save the others. With no time to mourn his friend, Andy heads off in pursuit of Chucky, with Kristin close behind.  Eventually, the chase leads the group into a fake [[haunted house]] at a nearby [[carnival]]. Tyler tries to get a security guard to help him, but Chucky kills the guard offscreen and kidnaps Tyler. In the ensuing melee, Chucky shoots Kristin in the leg, leaving Andy to fight Chucky alone. When Tyler is inadvertently knocked out, Chucky seizes the opportunity to possess him, but Andy intervenes, shooting him several times. Enraged, Chucky attempts to strangle Andy, but Andy uses Tyler's knife to cut off Chucky's hand, dropping him into a giant fan which mutilates him. Afterwards, Andy is taken into custody by the police for questioning, while Kristin is rushed to the nearby hospital.

Near the end of the film, the interrogator claims that he was the man who had sexually abused the author in her childhood. But one cannot be entirely sure he was the one who abused her, as the film suggests he was just using the abuse against her as a way of breaking her down.  After subjecting her to lengthy physical and mental torture, and pretending to be several other people (another prisoner, a more brutal interrogator) while the Victim is blindfolded, the Interrogator tries to get her to sign a confession—to save her life. While he knows now that the woman is innocent, he implores her to confess to avoid execution. She refuses, and goes to her death.  
The Commitments (film)
 In the [[Northside (Dublin)|northside]] of [[Dublin]], Ireland, Jimmy Rabbitte is a young music fanatic who aspires to manage an Irish [[Soul music|soul]] band in the tradition of 1960s African-American recording artists. He places an advert in the local newspaper and holds auditions in his parents' home. After being deluged by scores of disastrous performers, Jimmy decides to put together a band consisting of friends and people he encounters—lead singer Deco Cuffe, guitarist Outspan Foster, pianist Steven Clifford, saxophonist Dean Fay, bassist Derek Scully, drummer Billy Mooney, and female backup singers Bernie McGloughlin, Natalie Murphy and Imelda Quirke. Jimmy then meets Joey "The Lips" Fagan, a veteran musician who offers his services, and has unlikely stories about meeting and working with famous musicians. Joey names the band "The Commitments".  After purchasing a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures the remainder of the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a [[black market]] dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a [[snooker]] hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-[[heroin]] campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.  Tensions run high among the band members, as Joey begins seducing Imelda, Natalie and Bernie, and Deco grows increasingly obnoxious and unruly. The band performs at another venue where, at the end of one song, Billy accidentally knocks over his [[hi-hat]] cymbals, leading to a heated argument between him and Deco. Billy leaves the band in fear of going to jail if he beats up Deco—much to Jimmy's frustration—and Mickah replaces him as the band's drummer. During the band's next performance at a [[roller disco]], Jimmy is confronted by Duffy, who demands payment for the equipment he provided the band. Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.  After the band secures another gig, Joey promises Jimmy that he can get his friend, [[Wilson Pickett]], to sing alongside them. On this promise, Jimmy convinces several journalists to attend the band's next performance. At the venue, the band draws a large crowd, but its members begin arguing with each other offstage, and become doubtful when it appears that Pickett will not show. They go back on stage, where Deco denounces Jimmy for misleading the audience about Pickett's appearance; the band's performance of one of Pickett's songs, "[[In the Midnight Hour]]", silences the crowd's protests. After the performance, the fighting continues; during a heated argument, Mickah beats up Deco outside the club, and Jimmy storms off in frustration, claiming that the band is finished. Joey follows Jimmy, who berates him for misleading the band about Pickett. Just as Joey leaves, Pickett's limousine pulls up next to Jimmy, and his driver asks for directions to the club. In a closing monologue, Jimmy explains that the band's members have since gone their separate ways, with many of them continuing to pursue musical careers, and implies that he and Natalie are in a relationship.  
Close to Eden
 A Mongolian shepherd Gombo lives in a yurt in Inner Mongolia with his wife, three children, and mother. They are portrayed as unsophisticated and traditional people. Gombo desires [[sexual intercourse|relations]] with his wife, to try for a fourth child, which puts his wife at unease due to Chinese law. Sergei, an intoxicated, buffoonish Russian truck driver, has stranded himself by driving his truck into a river, and is picked up by Gombo, taken to his family's yurt, to join him in dinner. Gombo's family are particularly taken with Sergei's back tattoos, later revealed to be music notation for the popular waltz, "[[On the Hills of Manchuria]]". Gombo and Sergei become mutually dependent despite their language and cultural differences. Gombo and Sergei go into the nearest city together, where Gombo is supposed to buy contraceptives (condoms); buying a television set and other goods, but not contraceptives due to the drugstore staff being women. Sergei, a former army bandsman, becomes drunk and sings "On the Hills of Manchuria" in a nightclub, with the band playing from tattoos on his back. He is arrested and bailed out of jail by Gombo.  Gombo returns home, and along the way stops to eat. He has a strange dream featuring his drunken, horseback-riding relative as Genghis Khan and his wife as the Khan's wife. In the dream both he and Sergei are captured and killed and the TV set is destroyed. Gombo awakes from his dream and arrives home with the TV. He and his family switch between watching a broadcast of the President of the USA and a badly sung variety show. Gombo's wife, although saddened when learning that he bought no contraceptives, leaves the yurt, inviting him to follow her with a gesture. Gombo follows her out onto the prairie, sticking an ''urga'' (a long stick with a lasso on the end used to capture animals) into the ground in a traditional signal that a couple is being intimate. A voiceover from Gombo's fourth son, who was conceived at this time, concludes the film, and a chimney belching smoke stands where Gombo placed his ''urga''.  
Conagher
 The film opens with the Teale family moving west on a wagon into Indian Territory. They reach their home, and plan to go on the cattle business. The father, Jacob, rides out to get the cattle, promising to return in a month. However, he is killed along the way when his horse falls over on him, and he bleeds to death internally.  Meanwhile, a stagecoach passes by the Teale farm; Evie Teale agrees to work for the stagecoach by feeding customers who come by. One of the men on the stagecoach warns Evie of a man named Conn Conagher, who he says is a fierce gunfighter. One day, Conagher does stop by for food, along with his partner Mahler. The Teale farm later comes under attack by Indians. The stagecoach arrives again in the middle of the gunfight, and the drivers and the passengers defend the farm. The Indians retreat in the morning.  Conagher, meanwhile, drifts out in the wilderness. Mahler and he meet an old rancher, Seaborn Tay, who hires both of them. Conagher proves to be a hardworking cowhand, but the ranch comes under threat by the Ladder Five gang, led by Smoke Parnell. Mahler deserts the ranch after an argument with Conagher and joins the Ladder Five. Conagher saves the ranch and Tay's cattle twice from the Ladder Five, both in a series of quick gun battles. He also visits the Teale farm regularly, and Evie and he grow fond of each other and he becomes a father figure to her children.  One day, when Conagher is out herding Tay's cattle, he is ambushed and shot by the Ladder Five gang. The wounded Conagher hides out during the day, and at night returns and holds the Ladder Five, including Parnell, at gunpoint. Weak from his wound, Conagher eventually collapses and passes out, but not before he demands the Ladder Five to clear off of the land. Parnell knows now that he can finish Conagher, as his gang has sworn to do, but instead orders his man to take Conagher to Seaborn Tay. The next day, the Ladder Five gang clears off the land.  Evie Teal writes anonymous poems and ties them to tumbleweeds. Conagher chases tumbleweeds all over the prairie through most of the film, but he  does not guess she is the tumbleweed poet until the end.  When Conagher recovers, he tells Tay he feels like drifting again. Tay says he can stay and own part of the ranch, he has earned it, but Conagher has always been a drifter and he feels he needs to move on.  He stops in the saloon in town and sees the stagecoach manager, who buys him a drink. Conagher tells him he has "tumbleweed fever"  and the stagecoach manager laughs and says, "you, too?" Apparently, cowboys all over the county have been finding the notes tied to the tumbleweeds, and wondering about the woman who wrote them. The conversation shifts to Mrs. Teal, and the stagecoach manager says the family had a hard winter, but they made it through. He tells Conagher he  should go visit, but Conagher says he feels like heading north.   However, in the next scene he rides up to the family's cabin. He has brought some groceries as a gift and Mrs. Teal asks him to stay for dinner. He ends up staying for a few days and helps fix the roof and do other chores.  Mrs. Teal and he are sitting in rockers in front of the house and it seems like he may be about to say something romantic when Mahler rides up. Apparently, he has been courting Mrs. Teal, although she is not very interested.  Conagher and he have a quiet argument about the Ladder Five gang in front of Mrs. Teal, and when Mahler sees that she believes Conagher, he turns and rides away.   Evie asks Conagher what he was about to say when Mahler rode up, but he says he cannot remember.  He tells her it is time for him to be moving on, and he gives her some money to buy more groceries, saying he would like to be able to come back, but he does not want to be an imposition. She gets mad at him for giving her the money, but says he is always welcome. He rides off, telling himself he is a fool, but he does not think he is worthy of Evie.  In town, he plans to get drunk and then drive north, but he finds a drunken Mahler in the saloon. The two argue again, and Conagher challenges Mahler to a fist fight. Mahler starts out beating up Conagher; Conagher finally gains the upper hand. Evie arrives at that moment where she tells Conagher, "It's time for you to come home now."  Conagher is physically hurt, but asks her why she came back. She tells them they all felt lost without him. He takes one of her tumbleweed notes out of his pocket and asks her if she wrote them.  She said she did. She was just so lonely she had to talk to someone even if  no one was there to hear. He says, "There was, Evie, there was me." They kiss, and he says they can start a new life together.  She smiles and they walk out the door together.   The film features Elliott’s friend [[Buck Taylor]], formerly the [[gunsmith]]-turned-[[Deputy sheriff|deputy]] on [[CBS]]’s long-running ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', as Tile Coker, a rider for the Ladder Five Ranch.

Buck Taylor’s father, [[character actor]] [[Dub Taylor]] (1907–1994), plays the station agent.<ref name=imdb/>  [[Ken Curtis]] (1916–1991) plays  elderly but prosperous rancher Seaborn Tay, who is fearful of losing his assets to the rustlers. This was Curtis’ last acting part; he died just weeks after ''Conagher'' finished production. Curtis had also costarred with Buck Taylor as Deputy [[Festus Haggen]] on ''Gunsmoke''. Tay (Curtis) tells Conagher (Elliott), "Well, I'm up into my 70s . . . got a bum ticker to boot. I was kind of hoping to just live out my days and not die out on some sandy slope with lead in my guts. If they get me out on that range, they'll kill me for sure. And then just take my cattle as they please... with nobody to stop 'em."<ref name=quotes/>

The rapper tells Kathy he has to move on, but she decides to follow him. Nick arrives in his car, telling Kathy to get used to being a biker chick because she will never see him again. Kathy holds on as Johnny uses the car as a ramp and the two new lovers ride off into the big city.

After Sue's mother died, Bill raised her himself, growing to love her like his own, thus when they lost their home and money, Bill could not find it in his heart to give Sue up and put her into an orphanage, so he took Sue with him.

Crazy Safari
 An ancient but still fleshy Chinese corpse is on auction in [[England]]. A young businessman (Sam Christopher Chow) purchases the corpse. The corpse is revealed to be the body of his third great-grandfather and he intends to give it a proper burial in [[Hong Kong]].  To keep it from becoming an [[jiangshi|irrepressible vampire]], the descendant hires a good-natured Taoist priest ([[Lam Ching Ying]]) to maintain control of the cadaver using a yellow talisman.  The young descendant and the Taoist priest decide that the best way to get the valued ancestor home is via a direct flight to Hong Kong on a private jet.  During the flight, the plane malfunctions and an altercation breaks out between the ruthless pilot and the two passengers. Luckily, they outsmart the pilot and descend from the troublesome plane by using parachutes. The corpse and the two end up separated during the chaos, and they land in Africa.   The corpse lands in front of Xixo ([[N!xau]]), where he and his tribe are being confronted by a rival clan led by two greedy Caucasians. The corpse's presence scares away the villains. Xixo somehow learns to control the corpse and he takes it to his tribe. Soon he and his family think of it as a gift from God, as it aids them in various matters, such as bringing down fruit from towering trees.  The descendant and the priest land in a vast and dry area miles away from Xixo's home. Confronting an assortment of [[African animals]], they make their way across the foreign land in search of the corpse and rescue. During this time, the corpse forms a strong bond with the compassionate Xixo and his family. Days later, the descendant and the priest meet Xixo and his family. Not knowing they have the corpse, the two nevertheless stay with them, finding food, water, and shelter. They all abruptly form a solid friendship, despite the language barrier, as they all help out each other when in need.  Days later, the priest figures that the corpse must be nearby, since he connects the strange lack of birds in the area with the ominous close presence of a cadaver. Using magic, he summons the corpse to his hut. Xixo and his family frantically chase the corpse. After the corpse reunites with his descendant, the priest proves to Xixo that it belongs to them, and Xixo eventually agrees. After a few more days of living together, they prepare to part ways with the bushmen and Xixo leads them to the main path to civilisation. However, the rival clan is still after what Xixo's homeland has as a natural abundance: [[diamonds]], as they invade the huts and threaten the residents. The corpse, feeling obligated to aid Xixo and his family, goes back, with the priest and the descendant following. A battle takes place between the villains and Xixo's people, with the corpse managing to chase away one of the ruthless leaders.

A devastated Oliver tries to prevent her from going and even offers to move with her, but Sarah has made up her mind: she will enroll college and does not want any company. The children are just as displeased when they find out about their mother's decision, for which Ben and Melissa hold their father responsible. They start acting out as a reaction, which mostly affects Ben. Instead of attending classes and getting good grades, he spends most of his time with promiscuous teenager Bobbi Carver, whom he impregnates.  Meanwhile, Oliver unsuccessfully tries to save his marriage, until Sarah announces that she is seeing someone else. Meanwhile, his mother's health is worsening, and after months of being kept alive through machines, his father George decides to pull the plug. At the funeral, Sarah shows up to reveal her plans on filing for divorce. Feeling that his life has no purpose there anymore, Oliver accepts a job in [[Los Angeles]]. Melissa and Sam move with him, but Ben stays behind with Bobbi and their newly-born son Alexander.  In California, Oliver falls in love with Charlotte Sampson, a successful actress in a popular TV series who dreams of a Broadway career. After a short romance, during which she also connects with the children, they become engaged. However, when she is offered a role on Broadway, Oliver fears the past will repeat itself. Rather than seeing his partner see slip away due to a long distance relationship, he breaks off their engagement. Meanwhile, Bobbi has suddenly left Ben and took Alexander with her.   Desperate, Ben turns to Oliver, and together they fight successfully for sole custody. Afterwards, Ben visits Charlotte, and finds out that she has rejected the Broadway role. Although she is still mad at Oliver for cutting her out of his life, she agrees on visiting him, and they reconcile in the end.

Daughters of the Dust
 ''Daughters of the Dust'' is set in 1902 among the members of the Peazant family, Gullah islanders who live at [[Igbo Landing|Ibo Landing]] on [[St. Simons Island]], off the Georgia coast.<ref name="kviff.com">(2012).

Their dialogue is in Gullah creole.<ref name="kviff.com" />  Narrated by the Unborn Child, the future daughter of Eli and Eula, whose voice is influenced by accounts of her ancestors, the film presents poetic visual images and circular narrative structures to represent the past, present and future for the Gullah, the majority of whom are about to embark for the mainland and a more modern way of life. The old ways are represented by community matriarch Nana Peazant, who practices African and Caribbean spiritual rituals and who says of the Unborn Child, "We are two people in one body. The last of the old and the first of the new."  Contrasting cousins, Viola, a devout Christian, and Yellow Mary, a free spirit who has brought her lover, Trula, from the city, arrive at the island by canoe from their homes on the mainland for a last dinner with their family. Yellow Mary plans to leave for Nova Scotia after her visit. Mr. Snead, a mainland photographer, accompanies Viola and takes portraits of the islanders before they leave their way of life forever. Intertwined with these narratives is the marital rift between Eli and his wife Eula, who is about to give birth after being raped by a white man on the mainland. Eli struggles with the fact that the unborn child may not be his.  Several other family members' stories unfold between these narratives. They include Haagar, a cousin who finds the old spiritual beliefs and provincialism of the island "backwards," and is impatient to leave for a more modern society with its educational and economic opportunities. Her daughter Iona longs to be with her secret lover St. Julien Lastchild, a Native American, who will not leave the island.  While the women prepare a traditional meal for the feast, which includes okra, yams and shellfish prepared at the beach, the men gather nearby in groups to talk. The children and teenagers practice religious rites on the beach and have a Bible-study session with Viola. Bilal Muhammad leads a Muslim prayer. Nana evokes the spirits of the family's ancestors who worked on the island's indigo plantations. Eula and Eli reveal the history and folklore of the slave uprising and mass suicide at Igbo Landing. The Peazant family members make their final decisions to leave the island for a new beginning, or stay behind and maintain their way of life.  
The Dark Backward
  Marty Malt ([[Judd Nelson]]) is an unhappy garbage man who moonlights as an atrociously unfunny [[standup comic]]. He lives in a dark, grimy, garbage-strewn urban netherworld, where a company named Blump's apparently owns everything. His best friend and fellow trash collector, Gus ([[Bill Paxton]]), is the only one who laughs at his jokes, and his sincerity is questionable. The obnoxiously exuberant Gus plays an [[accordion]], which he always carries with him. Marty is seeing Rosarita ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]), a waitress, but she doesn't seem too interested in him.  One day, Gus convinces a [[talent agent]], Jackie Chrome ([[Wayne Newton]]), to check out Marty's act. Jackie isn't impressed. Marty's luck seems to take a turn for the worse when a large lump starts growing on his back. He goes to a [[quackery|quack doctor]] ([[James Caan]]), who calls him a wimp and puts a [[Band-Aid]] on the lump. The lump continues to grow, eventually becoming a full-sized [[arm]]. While Gus uses Marty's newfound freakishness to impress his [[morbidly obese]] girlfriends, a horrified Rosarita breaks up with Marty, and he gets fired from the club where he does his act.  Marty is despondent until Gus brings him to see Jackie, who, it turns out, has always dreamed of finding a real three-armed comic. Re-christened "Desi the Three-Armed Wonder Comic," and with Gus now providing musical accompaniment, Marty gets a fresh start on his career. Marty and Gus have a few semi-successful shows and eventually meet [[Hollywood]] talent agent Dirk Delta ([[Rob Lowe]]), who offers them a job. Marty, Gus and Jackie celebrate this big break and everything seems to be looking up until Marty wakes up the following morning and discovers his third arm has inexplicably vanished.  He goes with Gus to see Jackie, who is furious at first but calms down and decides to tell Dirk the truth upon Marty's suggestion. After calling Dirk and telling him the bad news, Dirk surprisingly asks them to send Gus to fill the spot with his accordion playing. Gus is ecstatic and leaves almost immediately. Marty is sad but gets his job back at the club and uses the story of his third arm in his act and finally gets a few laughs from the crowd.

Dead Again
 Newspapers detail the 1949 murder of Margaret Strauss ([[Emma Thompson]]), who was stabbed during a robbery; her anklet is missing. Her husband, composer Roman Strauss ([[Kenneth Branagh]]), is found guilty of the crime and condemned to death. Before his execution, Roman is visited by reporter Gray Baker ([[Andy Garcia]]). Asked if he killed Margaret, Roman appears to whisper something in Gray’s ear; Baker does not disclose Roman's answer.  Forty years later, private detective Mike Church (Branagh) investigates the identity of a woman who has appeared at the orphanage where he grew up. She has amnesia, cannot speak and has nightmares. Mike takes her in and asks his friend, Pete Dugan ([[Wayne Knight]]), to publish her picture and his contact information. Antiques dealer and [[hypnotist]] Franklyn Madson ([[Derek Jacobi]]) approaches Mike, suggesting that hypnosis may help her recover her memory. When the session is unsuccessful, Madson suggests that they experiment with [[past life regression]]. Mike is skeptical, but the woman details Margaret and Roman's lives in [[Third-person narrative|third person]], from courtship to their wedding. When the session ends, she can speak but still has amnesia. Madson shows them copies of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' from the murder; Mike and the woman bear a striking resemblance to Roman and Margaret. Mike visits disgraced psychiatrist Cozy Carlisle ([[Robin Williams]]), who insists that they continue to see Madson; delving into the problems between Margaret and Roman may resolve her amnesia.  Mike nicknames the woman "Grace", and falls in love with her. Doug ([[Campbell Scott]]) appears and claims that Grace is his fiancée Katherine, but Mike discovers he is lying and chases him away. Hypnotized, Grace remembers that Roman suffers from writer's block and is broke. He believes that Margaret is flirting with Baker, whom she met on their wedding day. Margaret cannot convince Roman that she is faithful and catches Frankie, the son of their housekeeper Inga, looking through her jewelry box. She asks Roman to dismiss them but Roman refuses, saying that they saved his life in Germany.  Grace sees Mike standing over Margaret with scissors, and is convinced he intends to kill her. Mike insists that he would never hurt her, but when he accidentally calls her "Margaret", he agrees to let Madson regress him. During his regression, he realizes he was Margaret and that Grace was actually Roman, but is unable to tell Madson or Grace this revelation.  Dugan then tells Mike that he has identified Grace as artist Amanda Sharp. Amanda, still afraid of Mike, accompanies Pete and Madson to her apartment; her artwork focuses on scissors. Madson gives her a gun to protect herself from Mike. Mike visits Baker in a nursing home and asks him about Roman's secret, but Baker insists that Roman said nothing to him. Baker is convinced that Roman did not kill his wife and urges Mike to find Inga, who would know what happened.   Mike realizes that Madson is Frankie; he questions Inga, who explains that she declared her love for Roman, but he rebuffed her advances. Frankie blamed Margaret for his mother's unhappiness and killed her with scissors; he then stole her anklet. Roman stumbled in, and was found covered in his wife's blood and holding the murder weapon. After Roman's execution, Inga brought Frankie to London; he learned about [[hypnotherapy]] and past-life regression. After returning to Los Angeles, Frankie was convinced that Margaret’s spirit would seek revenge. When he saw Amanda’s picture in the paper, he knew she has returned. He hired Doug, an actor, to separate Mike and Amanda and distract Amanda while he waited to kill her. Inga apologizes for her role in Margaret's death, and gives Mike the anklet. After Mike leaves to find Amanda, Madson smothers Inga with a pillow.  Mike tells Amanda the truth; terrified, she shoots him. Madson arrives, revealing his true identity; Amanda tries to shoot him, but the gun jams and he knocks her out. He puts the scissors he used to kill Margaret in Mike's hand and tries to make it look like Amanda killed him and committed suicide. Mike wakes up and stabs Madson in the leg with the scissors. Madson falls onto a scissors sculpture, which impales and kills him. Mike and Amanda then embrace, which is shown beside Margaret and Roman together.

His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles ([[Melissa Sue Anderson]]) finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka ([[Mabel King]]), who uses her [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a [[zombie]], allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment.  In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose ([[Mark Moses]]). Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan ([[Phil Bruns]]) sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies.  On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh ([[Jack Betts]]), who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.  
Defending Your Life
 Daniel Miller ([[Albert Brooks]]), a [[Los Angeles]] [[advertising]] executive, dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to the afterlife. He arrives in Judgment City, a [[Purgatory]]-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased of the western half of the United States, where he is to undergo the process of having his life on Earth judged. Daniel and the rest of the recently deceased are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities in the city while they undergo their judgment processes—from all-you-can-eat restaurants (which cause no weight gain and serve the best food), to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.  His defense attorney, Bob Diamond ([[Rip Torn]]), explains to Daniel that people from Earth [[ten percent of the brain myth|use so little of their brains]] (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their [[fear]]s. "When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me," says Diamond. If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer. Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.  Daniel's judgment process is presided over by two judges (played by [[Lillian Lehman]] and [[George D. Wallace]]). Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase. His formidable opponent is Lena Foster ([[Lee Grant]]). Diamond informs Daniel that she is known as "the Dragon Lady." Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in the defendants' lives, shown to the judges to illustrate their case.  During the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia ([[Meryl Streep]]), a woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his. (She died after slipping on the ground and falling into her pool and drowning.) The proceedings do not go well for Daniel. Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps. The final nail in his coffin, it seems, is when Foster, on the last day of arguments, plays footage of his previous night with Julia, in which he declines to sleep with her, for what Foster believes is his same fear and lack of courage. It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth. Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on. Before saying goodbye Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right. Daniel remains disappointed.  Daniel finds himself strapped to a seat on a tram poised to return to Earth, when he spots Julia on a different tram. On impulse, he unstraps himself, escapes from the moving tram, and risks electrocution and injury to get to Julia. Although he cannot enter her tram at first, the entire event is being monitored by Foster and Diamond, who convinces the judges that this last-minute display of courage has earned Daniel the right to move on. The judges agree and open the doors on Julia’s tram, allowing Daniel in, reuniting him with Julia, and allowing them to move on to the next phase of existence together.

Soon after the museum curator is mysteriously murdered, and a relic that Jack bought for the museum is revealed to be a fake.  Jack is once again under suspicion, but then Adrienne receives word from the police that Jack died in a fiery car accident.  In trying to wrap up Jack's affairs, Adrienne begins to suspect that her husband isn’t who he claimed to be.  When she sees a high school yearbook picture of her husband attributed to a man named Frank Sullivan, she realizes that she has been deceived.  She tracks down a relative of Sullivan's, who confirms that Frank and Jack were inseparable in high school. After Jack died, the relative never saw Frank again. She explained that Frank's father was an alcoholic and that his mother worked as a toll booth operator. She directs Adrienne to Frank's mother, who lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn. Frank's mother bitterly receives the news that she has a granddaughter, telling Adrienne that Frank was always selfish and that he never looked in on her.  A stalker lurks at Adrienne's loft. He comes in to Adrienne's bed while she is asleep and caresses her. He watches Mary, who is spooked by the man in her room at night. One day, as the housekeeper is finishing up her chores and leaving, she surprises the stalker who attacks her, leaving her almost dead in the bathroom and ransacking the apartment.  At work, Adrienne gets an urgent message from Mrs. Sullivan, and she rushes out to her apartment. When she gets there, the door is open, and Mrs. Sullivan is nowhere to be found. As Adrienne looks for her in the apartment, "Jack" (really Frank) appears. Adrienne slaps him and rages at his cruelty. Jack calms her down and tries to explain. He says that when the real Jack died, he was completely distraught and that he fell into his identity during the mourning process. He reveals that a man named Dan Sherman had discovered Jack's false identity and blackmailed him. Jack faked his death in order to escape, knowing that he would have to give up his life with Adrienne and Mary. He tells her that Sherman is insistent on having an Egyptian necklace which is in their apartment, and he asks Adrienne to look for it. As she leaves the apartment, Jack watches her from the window. Behind him, the body of his dead mother lies on the bed with a plastic bag over her head.  During her search for the necklace, Adrienne discovers a Parks Department photo ID. It bears her husband's picture and the name Dan Sherman. She tracks down an address and pays a surprise visit to the house. A pregnant Mrs. Sherman is on the phone and lets her in, thinking she is with a moving company. Adrienne looks around the house and sees wedding pictures of her husband with Mrs. Sherman. In a photo album, she sees a picture of Mary and confronts Mrs. Sherman about it. Mrs. Sherman says that it is a picture of her husband's dead sister, and demands to know who Adrienne is. The person on the phone is Jack/Frank/Dan, who asks her to give the phone to Adrienne.  He congratulates Adrienne on tracking down his new life, and he reveals that he has kidnapped Mary with no intent to harm her. Mary explained that she had traded the necklace with another girl, and Jack instructs Adrienne to retrieve it and meet him at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. at their loft to exchange Mary for the necklace. At the loft, Adrienne asks to see Mary, and Jack explains that she is downstairs playing in the car. When Adrienne tries to go see her, Jack pins her against a wall and demands the necklace first. Adrienne stabs him and tries to flee. After a long chase throughout the construction in the rest of the building, Jack corners her in the freight elevator, revealing his true nature as always doing "what comes next" to preserve himself. Adrienne lures Jack into the elevator shaft, where he falls to his death; Adrienne had been holding on to an unseen elevator cable to give the illusion of being in the elevator car.  Later, Adrienne and Mary pack up to move out of the loft and start a new life somewhere else.

The Devil's Daughter (1991 film)
 In 1970 in [[Southern California]], a group of [[hippie]]s and their children are approached at a desert encampment by Damon, a wayward traveler. They welcome him and serve him a meal. At nightfall, he kills each of them in [[human sacrifice|ritualized murders]] with the help of several assailants, invoking [[Lucifer]] during the killings.  In 1991 [[Frankfurt]], Germany, a man named Martin Romero pursues Mary Crane through the city streets before murdering her in her home. When confronted in a [[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station by police, he claims to have been forced to commit the crime before taking a gun and killing himself. Meanwhile, schoolteacher Miriam Kreisl nearly hits an elderly man, Moebius Kelly, with her car, near [[Seligenstadt]]. Unaware that he is in fact an elder of a Satanic sect, she invites him to stay at her home. While she sleeps, he releases a [[beetle]] on her body which crawls into her nose. After, Miriam is woken by a disturbing nightmare, and finds Moebius unable to breathe.   She leaves the house to retrieve a doctor; meanwhile, Moebius, having faked his condition, ventures into a secret tunnel leading to underground caverns beneath Miriam's home—a place she is unaware of—and performs a Satanic ritual. Miriam returns with Dr. Franz Pernath, and the two discover the open passageway. In a chamber, they find Moebius's dead body with a shroud over his face. Police remove his body, and the event leaves Miriam rattled. Alone at the house, Miriam's pet rabbit enters the underground chamber, forcing her to chase after it. She discovers a woman hiding in the chamber who has stolen one of her nylon stockings. She fights with the woman and demands to know how she got there, but the woman flees the house into the night.  The following day, Claire Heinz, the mother of one of Miriam's students, goes missing. When Miriam brings Claire's daughter home, she speaks with Mr. Heinz, who informs her that Claire, an [[entomology|entomologist]], had recently discovered an extinct species of beetles from 10,000 years ago. While viewing an illustration of the beetle, Miriam is inexplicably overwhelmed and loses consciousness. Later, at Miriam's house, her friend Kathryn is attacked by a malevolent force, and flees in terror. After, Miriam receives a mysterious phone call from Moebius.  Later a truck stop, Kathryn uncharacteristically propositions a man for sex. During the liaison, she brandishes a butcher knife. When the man's friends come to look for him, they discover him hysterically stabbing Kathryn; he claims he was "only doing what she wanted." Doctors attempt to revive Kathryn in the hospital, but she dies on the operating table. The surgeon informs Miriam that during a moment of lucidity, Kathryn begged to see her. Miriam is allowed into the operating room to view Kathryn's body, which inexplicably comes to life. She attacks Miriam before slitting her own throat, and collapses, dead. The surgeon explains it as a potential case of [[catalepsy]], but Miriam is no less disturbed.  To prove that Moebius is dead, Franz ventures to the hospital's mausoleum to uncover his body, but finds it has disappeared. Simultaneously, the surgeon who operated on Kathryn brings Claire, drugged, to Damon and other members of the sect in the woods near Miriam's home. While Miriam sleeps, Franz explores the underground chamber, and finds a tunnel in a [[Water well|well]] that leads outside to the woods, where Damon and the others are performing a ritual on Claire's body. He disrupts the ritual, and is chased by the sect.  Miriam awakens shortly after, and finds Franz under the spell of the sect, attempting to kill her. She flees in her car, but accidentally crashes, and is forced to return to her house on foot. Franz is left at the car, which is profusely leaking gasoline, ending in an explosion which kills him. At the home, Miriam is confronted by Moebius, who explains to her that the sect has, unbeknownst to her, guided and orchestrated her life to fit their master plan: she will give birth to the [[Antichrist]]. The sect impregnates Miriam in the well, and in a [[Time dilation|dilation of time]], she births the child. When Moebius hands her her son, Miriam flees, and leaps into the fire caused by the car accident. At dawn, firemen extinguish the flames, and Miriam emerges unscathed, her child having sacrificed himself to protect her.

Diksha (film)
 Placed in the early 1930s, ''Diksha'' is the story of a guru and his widowed daughter, the head disciple and the novice; the lowly-born "Koga", who dreams of learning the intricacy of scriptures.  In a weaker moment during the long absence of her father, the young widow falls to the temptation of the flesh. The lover is not ready to accept the responsibility. The widow is forced to abort.  In the ensuing commotion, the father is called back. He is forced to give his decision. He pronounces her dead and performs her "Ghata-Shraddha" (a ritual where an immoral person is ex-communicated, pronounced dead and her last rites performed when the accused is still alive, thus depriving her of all worldly relations).  While the Brahmin society praises the guru, individuals revolt. The head disciple leaves the town; the child-novice goes back to his parents; and the Koga refuses "heaven" and "salvation".  
Dharma Durai
 The story begins with a young couple, Balu and Ishwarya, being chased by some goons. Ishwarya is the daughter of Rajadorai ([[Charan Raj]]) and had eloped and run away with her boyfriend Balu against the wishes of Rajadorai. Rajadorai sends his goons to track down the couple. When the goons finally track down the couple in a forest and start beating up Balu, a man ([[Rajinikanth]]) comes to the couple's rescue. When Rajadorai and his brother Ramadorai ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]) find out about this man, they rush over to his hideout in the forest, only to escape in fear when they see him. The couple is scared and puzzled as to how the man could induce so much fear in the brothers. The man's wife Parvathi ([[Gouthami]]) then tells the couple the story of the man, whose name is Dharmadorai.  Dharmadorai was a farmer in a village named Valliyur. He was the elder brother of Rajadorai and Ramadorai. He had showered so much love and affection on his younger brothers and even borrowed  30,000 for their "education", much against his father's ([[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]]) wishes, who fully knew that his younger sons were crooked and evil. He even got Rajadorai married to Vaibhavi ([[Vaishnavi (Malayali actress)|Vaishnavi]]), a girl whom Rajadorai had raped, to save him from a jail term. The brothers however, showed no sort of affection for Dharmadorai and used his innocence for their sinister desires. Rajadorai convinced Dharmadorai to borrow  6 lakhs so that he could "start a business". Using this money, Rajadorai and Ramadorai moved to Madras (now [[Chennai]]) and went into smuggling. They later double-crossed their smuggler boss Jose by keeping all the items meant to be smuggled and also lodging a police complaint against his son Ajay ([[Ajay Rathnam]]) for their own benefit and soon became rich due to their illegal activities.  One day, Dharmadorai went to Madras when he heard that Ramadorai was going to get engaged to a rich girl and leave with her for the United States to "pursue higher studies". The brothers did not receive him warmly and humiliated him that evening at a farewell party organised for Ramadorai. Later that night, Ajay, who had been released from jail, entered their house to kill Ramadorai in retaliation for having double-crossed Jose and his gang. Ramadorai killed Ajay and convinced Dharmadorai to take the blame for the murder, who was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment as a result. The brothers then got Jose and his henchmen also arrested. While Dharmadorai was in jail, Parvathi gave birth to a baby boy.  A few years later, Rajadorai and Ramadorai decided to sell off their father's house and property to "repay the  6 lakhs Dharmadorai had borrowed". When their father opposed their move, the brothers killed him and drove Parvathi and her son out of the house. With nowhere else to go, Parvathi and her son moved to Madras. The small boy was also eventually killed by Ramadorai when he recognised him as the murderer of his grandfather. With no home, her husband imprisoned and her son dead, a grieving Parvathi took up the job of a housemaid in Madras. Soon, Dharmadorai completed his jail sentence. When he found out about Parvathi's plight and how his brothers had betrayed him, he rushed over to the brothers' house and thrashed them mercilessly, only stopping when their wives intervene. Following this, he disowned them and moved to the forest with Parvathi.  In the present day, Jose and his henchmen get released from jail and kidnap Rajadorai and Ramadorai in retaliation for betraying them. On Parvathi's advice, a reluctant Dharmadorai goes to rescue his brothers. He rescues them, following which they seek his forgiveness, which he accepts.  
Dogfight (film)
 The first portion of the film is set on November&nbsp;21, 1963 (the day before President [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated). Birdlace and three of his [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] buddies have arrived in San Francisco for twenty-four hours, before shipping off to Vietnam, and are planning on attending a "dogfight" (a party where Marines compete to bring the ugliest date, unbeknownst to the girls they bring) later that evening. They separate into the city to attempt to find dates. After a few women reject his advances, Birdlace ducks into a coffee shop, where he encounters Rose, a waitress, on her break, practicing her guitar. She is not particularly "ugly", but rather plain, shy and awkward. Birdlace attempts to charm her, complimenting her on her guitar playing, and inviting her to a party. She is suspicious of his motives, but decides to accept his invitation.  While walking to the bar where the party is to be held, Birdlace begins to have second thoughts about playing such a cruel trick on Rose after realizing she's not ugly enough to compete, and attempts to talk her out of going in. However they encounter one of Birdlace's buddies and his "date" in front of the bar, and so he has no choice but to proceed with Rose into the dogfight. Birdlace proceeds to get drunk, presumably feeling guilty. Shortly after, Rose convinces Birdlace to dance with her, though at first he resists because he knows that's where the dates get judged. The alcohol and dancing eventually make Rose feel dizzy, and she rushes off and ends up getting sick in the rest room. Rose does not win the dogfight; Marcie, the date of Birdlace's friend Berzin, is the winner. In the ladies' room, it is revealed that Marcie is actually a prostitute whom Berzin has hired (which is a violation of the rules of the dogfight) and clues Rose in to the true nature of the party. Rose is devastated, tears into Birdlace, and then storms off. Birdlace immediately regrets having treated Rose so cruelly, and chases after her. He convinces her to let him buy her dinner, in an attempt to make it up to her.  After dinner, the two walk to a club where Rose hopes to perform soon, and then to an arcade. Birdlace is surprised to find himself enjoying spending time with Rose, so much so that he forgets that he was to have met up with his three buddies at a tattoo parlor where they were to get matching tattoos to solidify their friendship. Rose tells Birdlace about her dream to become a folk singer, and he reveals to her that he will be shipping off to Okinawa the following day, and from there on to "a little country called Vietnam," he hopes. She offers to write to him, and asks if he will write back. Birdlace walks Rose home, and they share an awkward moment on her doorstep, before she hesitantly invites him in. They attempt to talk, but end up engaged in a self-conscious yet endearing sexual encounter.  As he is leaving at dawn, Rose gives him her address and asks him to write. Birdlace meets up with his buddies, where they board their bus. Birdlace makes up a story that he did not show up because he spent the night with the beautiful wife of an officer. Berzin later shares with Birdlace that he saw him with Rose; Birdlace counters that he is aware that Berzin's "date", Marcie, was actually a prostitute. They agree to keep one-another's secrets, as Birdlace tears up Rose's address and throws it out the window of the bus.  Rose is then shown with her mother, weeping and watching coverage of President Kennedy's assassination on TV. The film then cuts to 1966, where Birdlace and his three friends are shown in Vietnam. They are playing cards and trying to pass time, when they are suddenly mortared. The scene descends to chaos.  Birdlace is then shown getting off of a [[Greyhound]] bus in San Francisco. Discharged from the Marines, he is walking with a limp (presumably wounds received from combat), and it is suggested that his three friends were all killed. He is taken by how much things have changed in the three years since he was last there, with hippies and flower children everywhere. He walks to the neighborhood where Rose's coffee shop is, and goes to a bar across the street to have a drink. The bartender tells him that Rose's mother has turned the coffee shop over to Rose. He then makes his way across the street and into the coffee shop. Rose, not having heard from him in three years, is surprised to see him, and can only say "hi". She walks over to him, and they fall into an ambiguous embrace, as the film ends.  
Doc Hollywood
 Dr. Benjamin Stone is a promising young surgeon working in [[Washington, D.C.]] with plans of making more money working for a [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] plastic surgeon. On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult written on it.  Driving out west in a 1956 [[Porsche 356|Porsche 356 Speedster]], Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, [[South Carolina]]. The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone to pay for the fence with cash. Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker.  Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car. Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room, with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens.  The small-town experience humbles Ben further when he misdiagnoses a young boy as having [[mitral valve regurgitation]] leading to late [[cyanosis]], a case the town's curmudgeonly doctor, Aurelius Hogue, treats with a [[Coca-Cola]]. Hogue explains that the boy had chewed his father's tobacco and was given too much [[bismuth subnitrate]] as an antacid, causing a blue tinge; the [[carbonic acid]] component of the soda would relieve his stomachache. The two finally bond when Ben saves Hogue after he suffers a near-fatal [[heart attack]]. Since Hogue is eager to retire, Ben is urged by the locals to stay and replace him. Although he is tempted by his budding romance with a tomboyish ambulance driver, Vialula, better known as "Lou," a single mother to a four-year-old named Emma, Ben soon confides to her that he grew up in a small town in rural [[Indiana]], where his parents lived and died, and how he can't see himself confined to a small town.  Lou is also pursued by Hank Gordon, a local insurance salesman. He waits for Ben at the mayor's lakeside lodge, where Ben has been staying. Ben expects a fight, but Hank explains that though he can't give Lou what Ben can, he's still a better man for her. After the two men talk, Ben comes to realize he's not selfless enough for a life with Lou and plans to not see her anymore. Ben is soon pardoned from community service for saving Hogue, allowing him to head to California for his job interview. With his car fixed, he tries to sneak out of town, but his departure is delayed when he finds Kyle and Mary Owens stranded by the side of the road with Mary in deep labor. While he's delivering their baby, a tractor trailer smashes into his Porsche and he must leave town without it.  Ben's new boss, Dr. Halberstrom, hires him at the interview, based on an unexpected recommendation from Hogue. Ben soon tires of the superficiality of Beverly Hills, even going so far as calling to check the weather in Grady on his phone. The next day, he's surprised to receive a message at work from a woman with a "heavy Southern accent" and rushes to a restaurant, where he noticed his restored Porsche in the parking lot. Nancy Lee, the mayor's daughter, and Hank have come to California, and Hank tells Ben he took his own advice to "do what a man's gotta do." Ben returns to Grady, hoping to patch things up with Lou, who takes him back.  
Dolly Dearest
  Elliot Wade (Sam Bottoms) obtains ownership of the Dolly Dearest factory in Mexico. Not far from the factory lies the underground Mayan tomb of Sanzia, or Satan on Earth. An [[archaeologist]] breaks into the sarcophagus but is crushed by the stone slab that covers the entrance, releasing the malevolent spirit of Sanzia. Upon its escape, Sanzia takes refuge in the porcelain doll, Dolly Dearest.  Despite the demise of the archaeologist, the sale is finalized and the Wade family travels to Mexico to see their new home. Upon arrival, the family meets their realtor, Mr. Estrella and housekeeper, Camilla (Lupe Ontiveros)  Estrella takes Elliot, Jimmy, and Jessica to see the factory. The building, long abandoned, is structurally unstable to the consternation of Elliot, but Estrella hurriedly brushes his worries aside and discusses the history of the factory.  During the conversation, Jessica goes exploring. On a shelf she discovers many well-preserved dolls covered by a sheet.  She asks her father if she may have one and he acquiesces, allowing her to take Dolly. Outside, Jimmy finds the entrance to the cave which is blocked by a wire fence. Unaware of recent events, Jimmy inquires about that area, but his father warns him to never go back there again.  That night, Marilyn (Denise Crosby) tucks Jessica into bed. As she falls asleep, Dolly slowly turns her head to stare at the child. The next day, Marilyn finds a disturbing drawing that she believes Jessica drew.   Jessica becomes progressively more violent and obsessive with Dolly. To not arouse her father's suspicion, Jessica acts normal when he is around, but resumes her evil and threatening behavior around her mother. Camilla believes the doll is controlling Jessica. When the daughter speaks harshly in Sanzian tongue, Camilla tries to warn Marilyn, but is killed by the spirit. Jimmy sneaks out of the house one night and breaks into the factory from an unlocked window. He finds the night [[watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]] Luis, dead on the floor and flees.   Marilyn comes to the realization that Jessica may truly be possessed and tries to take the doll from her daughter. Jessica warns her mother not to touch the doll, but when Marilyn persists, Sanzia momentarily possesses Jessica and shouts, "I will kill you!" before adding "The kid's mine."  The next day, Marilyn visits the dig for the first time and talks with the archaeologist, Resnick ([[Rip Torn]]) about the purpose of their dig. Resnick tells Marilyn that they are searching for the remains of the Sanzia devil child inside the tomb, which hasn't been opened yet. Resnick continues to explain that the devil child, a true force of evil, fed on the warm blood of children. The tribe eventually killed the creature because its dietary needs almost wiped out the population of the tribe. Marilyn then explains that Jessica is being controlled by her doll and visits Camilla's sister, a nun, at a convent. The nun informs her it's too late.   At home, Marilyn looks for Jessica. She finds Jimmy hiding on the floor of the hallway closet, and he tells her that Jessica and Dolly are in Jessica's room. He also reveals that he's seen Dolly talk and move. Jimmy hands her the key to Jessica's room, and Dolly reveals its true self to Marilyn.    Marilyn goes back downstairs, loads ammo into the [[shotgun]] and tells Jimmy to call his father. At the factory, the dolls take the phones off the hook. Marilyn returns to Jessica's room to find the doll gone. Jimmy continues to try to contact his father. When he is unable to get through, he attempts to call the operator, but is unable to communicate because he does not speak Spanish.  When Jessica becomes separated from Dolly, her mother attempts to flee with her, only to be blocked by Dolly. Dolly calls to Jessica, and Jessica attacks her mother. As Marilyn and Jessica struggle, Dolly starts advancing towards them with a kitchen knife. Jimmy grabs the shotgun, and after figuring out how it works, fires it at Dolly.  The impact of the bullets sends Dolly crashing through the door, and Jessica becomes herself again. Marilyn, Jessica, and Jimmy get in the car and drive to the factory were Elliot is being attacked by the dolls. Meanwhile, the professor enters the tomb and sees the remains of the devil child, which has the body of an infant and the head of a goat. Realizing the myth was true, the professor runs to the factory where he saves Elliot from the dolls. They run outside and reunite with Elliot's family. The family plants dynamite around the factory. The dolls try to stop them, but fail, and the factory explodes, killing the dolls. As the explosions continue, an agonizing demonic scream is heard, implying the evil Sanzia spirit is destroyed. The film ends as the family watches the factory burn.  
The Doctor (1991 film)
 Dr Jack McKee is a successful surgeon at a leading hospital. He and his wife, Anne, have all the trappings of success, although Jack works such long hours that he rarely has time to see their son and has become somewhat emotionally dead to his wife. His "bedside manner" with his patients, in many cases seriously ill, is also lacking. The decorum in the operating theater is very casual and the chatter between him and his partner, Dr. Murray Kaplan, not particularly professional. (When a patient with a chest scar mentions her husband wants to know if it will go away, Jack responds that she should tell him that she is just like a "Playboy centerfold, because she has the staple marks to prove it.")  Returning home from a charity event, Jack has a coughing fit. His wife is shocked when he coughs up blood all over her and the car. In an examination, Jack has a sample of a growth removed from his throat. The biopsy comes back positive for cancer. His time spent with another, cold impersonal surgeon in this examination is the beginning of his transformation. Further tests and disappointments are blended with scenes of other patients' grace and empathy towards each other and a much better view of the delays and missteps of their doctors and medical support personnel.  As Jack experiences life as a patient, there comes a clearer understanding of the emotionally void hospitals, some doctors, and his own colleagues can display. He befriends June Ellis, a fellow cancer patient who has an inoperable brain tumor. She gets him to promise to never lie or mislead a patient again. Jack begins to bark at the medical establishment. Jack and June take off to see a native Indian show but the pace is too much for her. His wife, meanwhile, struggles to understand Jack's relationship with June.  Jack's radiation treatment does not stop the cancer on his vocal cords. His despair ends in a confrontation with Dr. Leslie Abbott, the surgeon treating him whom he provokes in a heated discussion. Jack asks a colleague he has previously ridiculed, Dr. Eli Bloomfield, to perform his needed surgery. Jack apologizes for his and Murray's insulting behavior, to which Eli replies with a smile, "Well, Jack, I've always wanted to slit your throat, and now I've got the chance." Eli's bedside manner is a perfect example for Jack.  Jack's cancer is treated and cured, but June dies. The experience changes Jack forever. When he returns to work, he begins to teach new medical interns about the importance of showing compassion and sensitivity towards their patients, which in turn will make them better doctors. Jack puts the interns in patient gowns, assigns them various illnesses and orders all the tests for them to "feel" the experience that they will soon put their patients through.  
Dollman (film)
 Brick Bardo is a police officer on the planet Arturos, which is many light years from [[Earth]]. One day, a criminal runs into a laundry venue where lots of plump women and their kids happen to be, and he keeps them hostage while police officers are outside the premise. Bardo humorously enters to do his laundry, and the crook is rather surprised by this defiant act. After saving the scared hostages by causing the fat women to faint and fall onto the bad guy by threatening to use his gun to blow a hole through them&mdash;"the most powerful handgun in the universe", proclaims a young boy&mdash;Bardo, instead of being hailed a hero, is shouted at by the mayor, who knows of Bardo's usually violent methods and Bardo was supposed to be suspended.  The film then cuts to Bardo in his apartment, where a news broadcast implies that Bardo is being framed for the deaths of the hostages in the [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]], as a setup. Just then, a man begins to fire at Bardo and tells him an "old friend" wishes to see him, before using some device which puts Bardo to sleep. After Bardo wakes up on a desert plain, it is revealed that  Bardo's "old friend" is actually his greatest enemy Sprug (who only has his head remaining on a floating jet after all their previous encounters). The two men with Sprug are about to kill Bardo using Bardo's own custom Groger Blaster, but Bardo uses a magnetic field in his hand to retrieve his gun and quickly shoots the two henchmen into bloody chunks. Sprug escapes in his ship with Bardo giving chase. Despite an advertised warning not to enter an energy band, both Sprug and Bardo go through one, eventually reaching Earth where they are shrunken to several inches in height.  The movie then shows various crime acts occurring in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]]. Braxton Red and his gang run things in this part of the city and kill other outside gangsters who find their way into their neighborhood, to ensure control of this urban jungle. Debi, is a young Hispanic single mother who wants the police to do more to protect her area. When Debi is going home, some goons, Hector, Wick, and Jackson, that know about her meddling capture her and threaten her inside their van. As she fights back and tries to get away, the bad guys grab her and almost kill her using [[petrol]], but Bardo appears and shoots Hector in his stomach, mortally wounding him, and shoots Wick in his head, killing him,. Hector and Jackson run off, leaving Debi to wonder if she's in shock due to Bardo being so noticeably tiny. Just as she takes Bardo and his ship away, Braxton Red and one of his gangsters spot Sprug and Sprug tells them that he has a powerful bomb they can use in exchange for them helping Sprug to repair his ship.  Bardo is taken to Debi's house where he is introduced to her excited son, Kevin. Back at the hideout, Braxton kills Hector in a fit of rage, after Jackson explains that it was his idea to burn Debi, since Braxton has feelings for her even though she won't side with him. Jackson said that they were stopped by a little "Dollman" and Braxton doesn't believe that a man that small could hurt anybody, but he takes a lot of the gangsters with him and goes round to Debi's place to demand she tell them where this alleged Dollman is. After they show up to look for the so-called Dollman, Bardo kills all the bewildered gangsters along with Jackson, save for Braxton, who runs away down the stairs but gets seriously hurt. He makes it back to the hideout, bleeding badly, and Sprug knows this is Bardo's handy work. As Braxton is dying, Sprug partially heals his injury after making some demands first, but Braxton recovers and squashes Sprug when he tells Braxton he is his new boss.  Although Braxton is still seriously hurt, he wants to kill Dollman more than ever. Bardo overhears some commotion going on outside the apartment the next day when Debi is coming home from work and being harassed, yet again. Bardo leaps out of a window and grabs onto the side of a car as it speeds off. Bardo follows the entire gang, and they stop near to where the two spaceships landed, as they await Bardo's arrival so they can have their revenge. Bardo enters an underground passage in order to surprise the gangsters who have been waiting for Bardo to show up for to rescue Debi. A huge shootout ensues with Bardo killing most of the gangsters by making their vehicles explode. Debi runs off but Braxton follows her, firing his [[machine gun]] at her. Feeling disrespected for keeping her alive for years, Braxton is about to shoot Debi after cornering her somewhere, but Bardo distracts him and shoots off one of his arms. Debi doesn't want Bardo to finish off Braxton even if he is evil, and so Bardo agrees not to kill Braxton, just for her. Then Braxton uses the bomb Sprug had to attempt a last resort [[murder-suicide]], and Debi and Bardo quickly run for cover.

 Sue Ellen Crandell ([[Christina Applegate]]) is a 17-year-old high school graduate who, due to a lack of funds, cannot go to Europe for the summer with her friends. She is about to head to college in the fall. However, when her mother goes on a vacation to Australia with her boyfriend, Sue Ellen looks forward to an entire summer of freedom with her siblings:  slacker/drug addict Kenny ([[Keith Coogan]]), 14-year-old ladies' man Zach ([[Christopher Pettiet]]), 13-year-old tomboy Melissa ([[Danielle Harris]]), and 11-year-old TV fanatic Walter ([[Robert Hy Gorman]]).<ref></ref> Much to Sue Ellen's dismay, her mother hires a live-in babysitter, Mrs. Sturak, a seemingly sweet, humble old woman who assures Mrs. Crandell that she can take care of all five children. As soon as Mrs. Crandell leaves, Mrs. Sturak shows her true colors as an evil tyrant, quickly drawing the ire of the children. However, she later dies of a heart attack. When her body is discovered by Sue Ellen, the children agree to stuff the babysitter in a trunk and drop her off at a local funeral home and keep her car. They discover that the envelope given to Mrs. Sturak by their mother with their summer money is empty; she had it on her when they delivered her body to the funeral home.  With no money to pay the family's bills, Sue Ellen finds work at a fast food restaurant called Clown Dog. Despite a budding relationship with her co-worker named Bryan, she quits because of the obnoxious manager. Sue Ellen then forges a résumé under the guise of a young fashion designer and applies at General Apparel West (GAW), hoping to secure a job as a receptionist. However, Rose Lindsey ([[Joanna Cassidy]]), a company executive, finds her résumé so impressive that she offers Sue Ellen a job as an administrative assistant, much to the chagrin of Carolyn, a receptionist on Rose's floor who was initially in line for the job. While having dinner at a restaurant that night, Mrs. Sturak's car is stolen by [[drag queens]], forcing Sue Ellen to call in a favor from Bryan to bring them home. Sue Ellen then obtains the keys to her mother's [[Volvo]], and begins stealing from [[petty cash]] at GAW to support the family, intending to return it when she receives her paycheck.  At work, Sue Ellen has to balance the adult responsibilities thrust upon her while still trying to enjoy herself as a teenager. The double life strains her relationship with Bryan when she discovers that he and Carolyn are brother and sister. Sue Ellen then finds herself tested when she learns that GAW is in danger of going out of business. She takes it upon herself to create a new clothing line and Rose suggests holding a fashion show to exhibit their new designs. Sue Ellen offers to host the party, convincing her siblings to help clean up the house, beautify the yard, and act as caterers. Although she manages to pull off the party, it comes to an end when Mrs. Crandell comes home early and catches Sue Ellen in the act, forcing her to confess her lie in front of everyone. While apologizing to Rose after the party, Sue Ellen learns that her unique designs had saved GAW. Rose then offers the real Sue Ellen the job as her personal assistant, which she respectfully declines in favor of going to college first. Rose tells Sue Ellen that she can "pull some strings" to get her in to [[Vassar College|Vassar]] and they make plans to get together for dinner.  In the end, Sue Ellen and Bryan make up, but are soon interrupted by Mrs. Crandell, who inquires about Mrs. Sturak's whereabouts. As the credits roll, the scene cuts away to the cemetery, where two morticians look over a gravestone that reads "Nice Old Lady Inside, Died of Natural Causes."  
The Doors (film)
 The film opens during the recording of Jim's ''[[An American Prayer]]'' and quickly moves to a childhood memory of his family driving along a desert highway in 1949, where a young Jim sees an elderly Native American dying by the roadside. In 1965, Jim arrives in [[California]] and is assimilated into the [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]] culture. During his tenure studying at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], he meets his future girlfriend Pamela Courson, and meets Ray Manzarek for the first time, as well as Robby Krieger and John Densmore; who would found The Doors.  Jim convinces his bandmates to travel to [[Death Valley]] and experience the effects of [[psychedelic drug]]s. Returning to [[Los Angeles]], they play several shows at the famous nightclub [[Whisky a Go Go]] and develop a rabid fan base. Jim's onstage antics and occasionally improvised lyrics raise the ire of club owners; however, the band's popularity continues to expand.  As the Doors become very successful, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as "The Lizard King" and degenerates into alcoholism and drugs. Jim meets [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy]], a rock journalist involved in [[witchcraft]], and participates with her in [[Mysticism|mystical]] ceremonies. He joins her in a [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony. An elder spirit watches these events.  The rest of the band grows weary of Jim's missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. Jim arrives late to a [[Miami]], [[Florida]] concert, becoming increasingly confrontational towards the audience and allegedly [[Indecent exposure|exposing himself]] onstage. The incident is a low point for the band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim's personal relationships, and resentment from the other band members.   In 1970, following a lengthy trial, Jim is found guilty of indecent exposure and ordered to serve time in prison. However, he is allowed to remain free on bail pending the results of an appeal. Patricia tells Jim that she is pregnant with his child, but Jim convinces her to have an abortion. Jim visits his fellow bandmates for the last time, attending a party thrown by Ray where he wishes the band luck in their future endeavours and gives each of them a copy of ''An American Prayer''. As Jim plays in the front garden with the children, he sees that one of the children is his childhood self. Jim comments: "This is the strangest life I've ever known."  In 1971, Pam finds Jim dead in a bathtub in [[Paris]], [[France]], at [[27 club|the age of 27]]. The final scenes of the film before the credits roll are of Jim's gravesite in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris while "The Severed Garden (Adagio)" plays in the background. Just before the credits, the screen whites out and text appears saying "Jim Morrison is said to have died of [[heart failure]]. He was 27. Pam joined him three years later."  During the credits, the band is shown recording the song "[[L.A. Woman (song)|L.A. Woman]]" in the studio.  
The Double Life of Veronique
 In Poland in 1968, a little girl is shown the stars in the winter sky by her mother, who identifies the Christmas Eve star. In France, a little girl is shown one of the first leaves of spring by her mother, who points out the fine veins running through.  In Poland in 1990, a young Polish woman named Weronika ([[Irène Jacob]]) is singing at an outdoor concert with her choir when a sudden downpour causes the singers to rush for cover. Weronika alone continues to hold the last note while the rain falls on her smiling face. After the concert, Weronika meets her boyfriend, Antek (Jerzy Gudejko), and they go to his apartment to make love. The next day she asks her father to tell Antek she is leaving to be with her sick aunt in Kraków. She tells him that lately she feels she's not alone in the world.  Weronika travels to Kraków by train looking out at the passing landscape through a small clear rubber ball. At her aunt's house, Weronika talks about her boyfriend, then meets a friend at a concert rehearsal. As the choir rehearses, Weronika, who is watching offstage, accompanies them in a beautiful high soprano voice. Afterwards, the musical director asks her to audition. Overjoyed, Weronika rushes home with the sheet music. On the way, she passes through Main Market Square, where a protest rally is in progress. One protester runs into her, causing her to drop her music folder. After retrieving the sheet music, Weronika notices a French tourist taking photos of the protestors—a young woman who looks exactly like her. Weronika smiles as she watches her double board the tourist bus that soon pulls away.  At the audition, Weronika's singing impresses the musical director and conductor, and she is later told that she won the audition. The next day, while on a trolley studying the score, Weronika notices her boyfriend Antek following on his motorbike. When they talk, she apologizes for not returning his calls, and Antek tells her he loves her. Later, while getting dressed for the concert, Weronika presses her face against a window and sees an old woman with shopping bags slowly making her way along the street. That night during the concert, while singing a solo part, Weronika collapses onstage and dies—her spirit passing over the audience.  In Paris that day, a young French woman named Véronique (Irène Jacob), after making love with her former boyfriend, is overwhelmed with sadness, as if she were grieving. The next day, at the school where she teaches music, Véronique attends a marionette performance with her class. During the performance—a story about a ballet dancer who breaks her leg and then turns into a butterfly—Véronique watches the puppeteer controlling the marionettes. Back in her classroom, she leads her class in a musical piece by an eighteenth-century composer, Van den Budenmayer—the same piece performed by Weronika when she died. That night while driving home, she sees the puppeteer at a traffic light motioning to her not to light the wrong end of her cigarette. Later she is awakened by a phone call with no one speaking, but in the background she hears a choir singing the music of Van den Budenmayer.  The next day, Véronique drives to her father's house where she reveals she is in love with someone she doesn't know, and that recently she felt she was alone—that someone was gone from her life. Back in Paris, Véronique receives a mysterious letter containing a shoelace which she throws away. That night she is awakened by a strange light reflecting from a neighbor's mirror. Véronique retrieves the mysterious shoelace, and later while contemplating her recent [[EKG]] graph, she holds the shoestring across the graph paper in a straight line, alluding to a EKG showing no activity.  Véronique learns that the puppeteer is a children's book author named Alexandre Fabbri ([[Philippe Volter]]), whose marionette story was based on his book ''Libellule & Papillon''. One of his other books is about a shoelace. In the coming days, Véronique reads several of Alexandre's books. When Véronique visits her father, he gives her a package addressed to her containing a cassette tape. When she's alone, she listens to the mysterious recording of a typewriter, footsteps, a door opening, a train station, and a fragment of music by Van den Budenmayer. There are also sounds of a car accident and explosion. The postage stamp on the envelope leads Véronique to a [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] train station cafe where she believes the cassette recording was made. There she sees Alexandre sitting by himself, as if waiting for her. He tells her he's been waiting for her for two days, that he's working on a new book, and that this was a kind of experiment to see if she would come to him. Angered at being manipulated, Véronique leaves and takes a taxi to a nearby hotel, After checking in, she sees Alexandre, who apparently ran after the taxi. He asks for her forgiveness, and she brings him up to her room, where they both fall asleep. During the night, he wakes her up and tells her he loves her, and they make love.  The next morning she tells him, "All my life I've felt like I was here and somewhere else at the same time." While looking at a proof sheet of photos taken on Véronique's recent trip to Poland, Alexandre notices what he thinks is a photo of Véronique, but she assures him it is not her, that she in fact took the photo—of a young Polish woman carrying a music folder. Véronique crumples the proof sheet and breaks down in tears. Alexandre comforts her and they make love again. Later at his apartment, Véronique sees Alexandre working on a new marionette with her image. When asked about the purpose of a second identical marionette, Alexandre explains, "I handle them a lot when I perform. They get damaged easily." He shows her how to work the one marionette while the double lays lifeless on the table.  Some time later, Alexandre reads his new book to Véronique about two women, born the same day in different cities, who have a mysterious connection. Later that day, Véronique arrives at her father's house, stops at the front gate, and reaches out and touches an old tree. Her father, who is inside the house, seems to sense this without seeing it.

While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a dilapidated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, driving a red [[sports car]]. The mystery woman suggests that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.  Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a [[hearse]] driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge.  At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting. The folded ribbon adorning the casket seen inside the hearse bears a name tantalizingly similar to Devereux's own. The confused, now frightened man follows the hearse to a church where an all-black congregation is mourning at another [[funeral procession]].  Devereux drunkenly disrupts the proceedings, attempting to look inside the closed casket. He gets thrown out of the church by the angry parishioners.  Devereux drives over to a nearby funeral home where he sees that all of the corpses in the open coffins are labeled 'Melvin Devereux'. He finds his doppelganger lying dead in one of the caskets and tries to touch it, but it disappears beneath his outreached hand.  Back on the road, Devereux picks up a beautiful female hitchhiker, and tries to respond to her seductive advances, but he cannot perform, forcing her to leave the car. Next, Devereux drives onto a river barge as it transports a handful of vehicles, including the omnipresent hearse, to the other side of the river. Devereux rips open the hearse's back door and tries to open the coffin which clearly bears his name. The hearse driver intervenes and there is a struggle. Devereux is subdued by the other barge passengers and gets arrested. In a local courtroom, Devereux is given a fine for defiling the casket. Devereux drives away and soon stops to visit a tarot reader. Reading the palm of his right hand, the palmist tells him that he has been dead for several hours. She suddenly falls dead after receiving a phone call from a "Mr. Devereux."  Devereux is once more on the road, driving nowhere. He suddenly sees the hearse again on the road and tries to overtake it, only to crash head-on into an oncoming truck. Devereux is killed instantly. His wristwatch stops at 7:29 PM, the same time as the film's prologue where a briefly seen car crash had appeared to be the cause of his father's death. The mysterious woman observes the fatal accident a short distance away on the road before getting into her car and driving off. The number license place on the woman's car reads: D.E.A.T.H.  At the end of the final scene, the text of a mysterious quote in Italian appears: ''... Quando varcherai le porte del nulla, nessuno ti sara vicino: solo l'ombra della tua morte ... IV Libro dell'Apocalisse''. English translation: ''... When you go to the gates of nothingness, no one will be near you: only the shadow of your death ... Book Four of the Apocalypse.''

Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge
 In the film, [[Frieza]]'s older brother [[Cooler (Dragon Ball)|Cooler]] is introduced. It begins with a flashback to when Frieza destroyed the [[Saiyan (Dragon Ball)|Saiyan]] home world, Planet Vegeta. Cooler's ship soon picks up a Saiyan space pod on the radar. The pod, carrying a baby Saiyan named Kakarot, is shown to be heading towards Earth, but Cooler's henchmen believe it is an escape. Cooler lets the ship go, accounting that it's Frieza's naïveté, and responsibility. More than twenty years later, Kakarot, eventually renamed [[Goku]] because of his adoptive new life on Earth, transforms into a Super Saiyan and defeats Freiza on Planet Namek. Despite showing no compassion towards his brother, Cooler takes his Armored Squadron - Doore, Neiz, and Salza to Earth with the intention of killing Goku in order to reclaim his family's honor. His forces ambush Goku and his friends on a camping trip, and Goku is wounded when he takes a blast from Cooler that was intended for [[Son Gohan|Gohan]] (who has his regrown Saiyan tail).  After [[Krillin]] and [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]] sets up a shelter in a cave with Goku, Gohan flies off on his dragon friend Icarus to obtain Senzu Beans from Korin. After obtaining the beans, Gohan restores the now-exhausted Icarus by feeding him one bean, and they both fly in high speed. But then, they are ambushed by Cooler's henchmen who blast down Icarus and give Gohan a beating. Just as Gohan about to be killed by Doore, the monkey-tailed boy is saved by [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], the last surviving Namekian from his home planet which was destroyed by Frieza. Piccolo dispatches Doore and Neiz, and takes on Salza, easily gaining the upper hand. During the battle, Cooler arrives and catches Piccolo off-guard with a Death Beam, which impales him through the chest but does not kill him. Cooler then sends Salza after Gohan as he continues to blast Piccolo. Gohan gets to the cave with the Senzu Beans, but they are destroyed by Salza. However, he heals Goku with a spare bean that [[Yajirobe]] gave him earlier. After Krillin and Gohan are beaten down by Salza, Goku appears fully healed. Cooler shows up, holding onto an unconscious Piccolo. He then blasts Piccolo's body with an unexpected attack as Goku watches in horror. Now angered, Goku blasts Salza into the distance, and begins to fight Cooler.  After Goku proves to be a worthy opponent, Cooler tells of his bleak history with Frieza. He then reveals his final transformation, one that Frieza never showed or achieved, and this one is far more powerful than Frieza's final form. Now at full power, Cooler pummels Goku around effortlessly, despite Goku using the ''Kaioken'' attack numerous times. Cooler then proceeds to destroy the landscape. However, after seeing a bird die from wounds inflicted by damage caused during the struggle, Goku thinks back on his friends and family, and how they all will be killed if Cooler wins. He then picks up the dead bird and lets out a yell so powerful it cracks solid stone and draws Cooler's attention, transforming into his Super Saiyan form and giving enough of his energy to revive the bird. Cooler then finds himself, like Frieza was, grossly outclassed by Goku's amazing new powers. After attempting to punch and blast the Super Saiyan with no effect, Cooler summons a trump card when he powers up an enormous ball of energy. Cooler launches the attack with hopes to destroy Goku and the Earth along with him. After a stint of struggling, Goku eventually manages to send it back with the ''Kamehameha'' wave, forcing Cooler off the Earth into space and towards the sun. As he hits the sun's surface, Cooler finally realizes that Goku was none other than the baby Saiyan within the escape pod that he ignored back during Frieza's attack on Planet Vegeta. Lamenting his own naïveté, Cooler's body is then seemingly disintegrated by the sun and his own energy blast.  Goku, drained after his battle, is found by Krillin, Gohan, Oolong and Icarus. They are looking for Piccolo when Salza reappears and prepares to kill them all. However, before he can attack, Salza, the last of Cooler's Armored Squadron, is killed by Piccolo's "Special Beam Cannon" from a distance. Gohan looks around for Piccolo, and the movie ends with Piccolo, having recovered, gazing skyward after drinking some water.

Bulma appears and defies Slug's henchmen, who reveal their intentions to Terra-freeze the Earth and turn it into their own star cruiser. After his henchmen knock out Gohan, Slug reads Bulma's mind and learns about the Dragon Radar, and orders his men to find the remaining six Dragon Balls in one hour.  Slug's men eventually bring the Dragon Balls back to base and summon the Eternal Dragon, Shenron. The elderly Slug wishes for eternal youth, which is granted, and he launches a pod into space, where it summons dark clouds to cover the sky, blocking out the sunlight, modifying the atmosphere to accommodate Slug and his men, while proving deadly for the human race. Goku, still exhausted from his ordeal with the meteor, is found by Yajirobe, who gives him and Krillin some of the Senzu Beans.  At Slug's base, Gohan resumes his assault against Slug's army and manages to bring down scores of them, only to get injured. Piccolo appears and rescues Gohan from death. Slug's top men, Angila, Medamatcha and Wings appear and engage them in battle. Piccolo kills Wings while Medamatcha smothers Gohan into unconsciousness by draining his energy with her small clone minions, the Medas. But as Medamatcha moves in to finish Gohan, Piccolo throws himself in front of Gohan and takes the blast. They are almost killed by Angila and Medmatcha, but Goku and Krillin arrive on the scene in time. Goku kills Angila and Medamatcha, but Slug then enters the fray.  Slug blasts Krillin aside and fights Goku one on one, easily taking the upper hand despite Goku's efforts. However, as Slug moves in to finish the seemingly weakened Goku with one punch, overcome by his rage at the damage done to the Earth and its inhabitants, Goku is able to access a sliver of the Super Saiyan form. With his power boosted, Goku easily takes control of the battle and pummels Slug, breaking his arm in the process. To Goku's horror, however, Slug tears his damaged arm off and regenerates it, also removing his helmet and revealing that he is actually a Namekian. As Slug grows into a giant, King Kai telepathically contacts Goku and tells him that Slug is the last Super Namek, a branch of Namekians who grew obsessed with power and were banished from Planet Namek by use of the Dragon Balls.  Goku and Slug continue their fight, but with Slug's increased strength and Goku's superior speed, neither can best the other. Slug eventually grabs Goku and starts to crush him, but Piccolo, knowing his own weaknesses, intervenes and pulls on Slug's antennae. Slug drops Goku and grabs Piccolo in his hands, preparing to kill him instead. But remembering his sensitive hearing, Piccolo rips his own ears off and calls for Gohan to start whistling. The noise deafens and weakens Slug, especially in his giant form, leaving Piccolo to transfer his remaining energy to Goku. After Slug blasted away Gohan and destroys his own ship, Goku powers up with the Kaioken and manages to fly straight through Slug's stomach, knocking him out. Goku then flies into the sky and begins preparing a Spirit Bomb in order to destroy the Terra-freezing pod, but Slug gives chase. Immediately, Goku fires the Spirit Bomb at Slug, hitting him and sending him directly into the Terra-freezing pod which explodes, destroying Slug and removing the dark clouds from Earth's atmosphere.  In the aftermath, Yajirobe appears and provides everyone with Senzu Beans. At Kame House, Master Roshi, who slept through all the events, wakes up and wishes for something exciting to happen.

The Dumbfounded King
 Story set in 17th century Spanish court, where King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] ([[Gabino Diego]]), on a getaway with Count of Peña Andrada, is stunned to see the naked body of Marfisa, a prostitute of the town (in a pose reminiscent of [[Rokeby Venus]]). After this discovery, the king decides to see the naked body of his wife, Queen [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Elisabeth of France]] ([[Anne Roussel]])  Due to this the [[Grand Inquisitor]] is obliged to convene a meeting of theologians to discuss the matter. Both sides of the debate are represented by the figure of the friar Villaescusa (Juan Diego), which ensures that the claim of the king is a serious sin that can bring punishment on the whole country and the Father Almeida, a [[Jesuit]] missionary who replies that the luck of the governed depends on the ability of its rulers rather than their morality and that the desire of the king is a private matter. Although the Queen is willing to accommodate to the wishes of the king, Villaescusa and his minions do enough to frustrate his desires. Finally, with the help of the Jesuit and the Count of la Peña Andrada, the King gets to meet with the queen alone in the [[Convent of San Plácido (Madrid)|monastery of San Plácido]] and achieves his goal.  Meanwhile, the [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]] ([[Javier Gurruchag]]a) fears that he could being punished by God because he fails to have children with his wife, so he gets advice from Villaescusa, who informs him that the pleasure he and his wife obtain when performing the sexual act is to be blamed for the infertility. The "divinely inspired" solution proposed by Villaescusa is that the Earl and his wife copulate in the choir of the church of San Plácido (where by coincidence are also very nearly the kings) in front of the choir nuns. At the end of this sexual encounter the Count-Duke of Olivares receives two letters which informs him of the successful arrival of the Indian fleet to [[Cadiz]] and the victory of Spanish troops in Flanders. Villaescusa says that the happy ending is due to the sacrifices they all have passed, but the Count Duke replies that by the date of the letters it could be seen that the fleet had arrived in Cadiz two days ago "just the day King went whores". The Count-Duke sends Villaescusa to Rome with a sealed letter asking to not let him go until he has changed his attitude.

Edward II (film)
 Once installed as king, Edward II summons his friend and lover, [[Piers Gaveston]], to his side and showers him with gifts, titles and abiding love. Their relationship is fiery and passionate, but it is the focus of gossip and derision throughout the kingdom. Upon his return, Gaveston takes revenge on the Bishop of Winchester, who had been responsible for his banishment from England during the previous reign, by personally [[torture|torturing]] him. Kent, Edward's brother, is the first to protest Gaveston's return. Many others feel the same way, including the Bishop of Winchester and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Lord Mortimer]], who is in charge of the kingdom's army forces. Nevertheless, Edward defends his lover from his mounting enemies.  A pleasure-seeker, Edward is quite distracted from affairs of state, much to the distress and anger of the court (sombre men and women in business suits). [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], Edward's French wife, vainly tries everything to win him back from his lover, but she is mercilessly rejected by her husband. Love-starved, Isabella turns to Gaveston, who inflames Isabella's desire by whispering obscenities in her ear, and then mocks her responsiveness.  The handsome, hedonistic and opportunistic Gaveston repels everyone except the King. His enemies join forces and threaten Edward with dethronment and exile; Edward is forced to comply with their wishes and sends Gaveston away. The lovers' separation is serenaded by [[Annie Lennox]]’s rendition of [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]".  The queen hopes that once Gaveston is away she could reconcile with her husband, but he rejects her once again. In a last effort to regain her husband's affection, she allows Gaveston to return. The king and his lover resume their relationship, but their enemies are ready to strike back.  Isabella and Mortimer, who has become her lover, plan to rule the realm through Edward and Isabella's young son, the future [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. When Kent tries to save his brother, he is murdered by Isabella. The nobles are soon plotting to get rid not only of Gaveston but also the king. Mortimer, their leader, is a military man and practising [[sadomasochism|sadomasochist]] who takes a grim pleasure in personally torturing Gaveston and the lovers' friend Spencer, who he addresses as "girl boy." Their torture takes place while there is a clash between the police and members of the British gay rights organisation Outrage.  After Gaveston and Spencer's assassinations, Edward, who has been thrown in a dungeon, is executed by impalement on a red-hot poker. This hideous fate is presented as a nightmare from which the imprisoned king awakens. The executioner, when he does arrive, tosses away his lethal weapon and kisses the man he was sent to kill.  Back in the castle, Mortimer and Isabella enjoy their triumph just briefly. The king's young son, Edward III, who all along has been neglected by both parents and who has witnessed their quarrels, has donned his mother's earrings and lipstick and, while listening to classical music on his [[Walkman]], walks atop a cage that imprisons his mother and Mortimer.

She researches leukemia and stocks healthier food in the kitchen.  Victor is "finished" with his [[chemotherapy]] and suggests they take a vacation to the coast. They rent a house and Hilary begins to feel that she is no longer needed to care for him. They fall in love and continue living at the coast. Victor hides his use of morphine to kill the pain. During dinner with one of the friends they made at the coast, Victor starts acting aggressively and irrationally. He collapses and is helped to bed. Hilary searches the garbage and discovers his used syringes. She confronts him and he admits he was not finished with his chemotherapy.

Dutch (film)
 Dutch Dooley ([[Ed O'Neill]]) attends a ritzy party with his girlfriend, Natalie Standish ([[JoBeth Williams]]). He stands out terribly among the upper-class aristocrats – wearing a cheap suit and making boorish comments. Natalie's relaxed, less rigid personality also does not fit with the rest of the patrons. Dutch also meets Natalie's snobbish, wealthy ex-husband Reed ([[Christopher McDonald]]), who tells Natalie that he will have to break his [[Thanksgiving]] plans with their son Doyle ([[Ethan Embry]]) for an unexpected business trip to [[London]]. Reed also threatens to strip Natalie's divorce benefits and custody of Doyle if she gives Reed any trouble, much to Dutch's chagrin.  Natalie calls Doyle at his private school in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and invites him home for Thanksgiving, but Doyle rudely refuses the offer and expresses his disdain for his mother, solely blaming her for the divorce. Despite this, Dutch sees an opportunity to get to know Doyle and further his relationship with Natalie, so he offers to go to Georgia and bring Doyle back to [[Chicago]] for the holidays.  Upon arriving in Georgia, Dutch finds Doyle to be much like his father: snobbish, selfish and an elitist. He welcomes Dutch by throwing a book at his face, kicking him and shooting him in the groin with a [[BB gun]], to which Dutch promises revenge. Dutch ultimately hogties Doyle to a hockey stick and carries him to the car to start on the drive back home.  The trip entails several mishaps: A fireworks show Dutch gives Doyle in an attempt to make Doyle warm up to him goes awry when one lit rocket lands in the bag of fireworks and sets them off all at once (destroying his coat in the process in an attempt to extinguish the explosion). Later, after throwing a lit cigar in Dutch's lap, Dutch throws Doyle out of the car and makes him walk to the next motel by himself. Doyle gets even by parking Dutch's car in the middle of the highway, where it is hit and totaled by a truck. They hitch a ride with two [[prostitution|prostitutes]] ([[Elizabeth Daily|E.G. Daily]] and [[Ari Meyers]]) who steal their luggage and leave them stranded with no money.  Doyle calls his father, whom he discovers has lied about his trip to London; he instead spent the holidays with a girlfriend. Stunned by his father's betrayal, and wounded by Dutch's accusation that he "hates his mother", Doyle begins to regret his callous attitude. Dutch initially gives up and wants to call Natalie for assistance, but Doyle refuses and insists on getting home on their own. They sneak a ride on the back of a semi truck and are assaulted by security guards at a trailer drop yard; Doyle feigns insanity and pretends that voices in his head are telling him to kill the guards (they make the guards think his BB gun is a bullet-loaded firearm), which frightens the guards enough to allow them to escape.  The two enter a restaurant, where they meet a married couple who takes them to a homeless shelter in [[Hammond, Indiana]] for the night. At the shelter, Doyle grows fond of a young girl and her family. While getting to know them, he finally realizes that he has been neglecting his mother and indeed wants to be with her for the holidays. The next day, the family drives Dutch and Doyle to Natalie's home, where Reed is waiting. Doyle shares an emotional embrace with his mother and reveals to Reed that he knows the truth about his trip to London. Doyle decides to stay with his mother instead of going with Reed for Thanksgiving. An angry Reed [[Eviction|evicts]] Natalie from the house, which he owns. Dutch follows Reed outside as he departs and hits Reed in the forehead with his pinky ring. He then demands that Reed show more respect to Natalie and become a better father to Doyle, to which a dazed Reed agrees.  The film ends with Natalie, Dutch and Doyle at the dinner table about to begin the Thanksgiving feast. Before they commence, Dutch asks Doyle to retrieve Dutch's coat, as it contains a very special gift for Natalie. As Doyle turns to walk away, Dutch pulls the BB gun Doyle originally shot him with and finally gets his revenge on Doyle by shooting him in the groin.

In the ensuing fight between Trantor and Ernest, Trantor turns Ernest's dog Rimshot into a wooden doll before being driven off by soft serve ice cream covering Ernest's hands.

Back at the treehouse, Trantor successfully summons dozens of trolls while Ernest tries but fails to stop them. The townspeople show up; however, the trolls overwhelm and beat them up. Kenny and his friends arrive and begin destroying the trolls with milk. During the fight Trantor escapes beneath the tree where he summons powers making him invincible, especially to milk. Kenny unsuccessfully tries to destroy Trantor, who turns Kenny into a doll as well. With the rest of the townsfolk now backing him up and telling him to douse Trantor in milk, Ernest realizes that the troll children were susceptible to the milk, while Trantor himself would be weak against unconditional love: "the heart of a child." He takes Trantor and dances with him while the mob watches, filling him with as much love as possible and finishing it off with a kiss to his snot-ridden nose, which causes Trantor to explode.  With Trantor's destruction, Ernest is proclaimed a hero. All of the wooden dolls are restored, including those from the 19th century, and life returns to normal. Sheriff Cliff Binder apologizes to his son for not believing him and Ernest. Ernest is happy that his dog is back to normal.

At a [[truck stop]], Bobby explains that they are going to Los Angeles and lies and says that Cissy loaned it to him for the trip. As they leave, the girl drops her glove in the parking lot. Back in Chicago, Cissy and his men are tearing up Bobby's apartment where they find a letter from Bobby's brother. Late that night, the dog arrives at the truck stop and finds the girl's glove.  While filling up the gas tank, Bobby asks if he should call George. The girl says he should. While he makes the call, the girl goes to the side of the gas station and leaves a sock on the road. On the phone, Bobby tells George he'll be in L.A. that he'll be there in the morning and gets an invitation to come over. Bobby sees Baby putting the sock on the road and tries to take it back. Bobby helps her by putting rocks on it to keep the wind from blowing it. As they head back to the car, Bobby mentions that L.A. has good schools.  The dog continues to follow. Bobby and Baby arrive at George's house where they are greeted warmly.  Bobby tells him that he plans to live there and get a job.  The dog stops in the barn of a small ranch, where the owner and its dog find him.  The man notices the dog's nails are worn down almost to his paws, so he treats them while his dog warms up the Doberman. The next morning, the dog sets off again, arriving in Los Angeles the next morning.  George tells Bobby he has a contractor friend who might have a job for Bobby. Bobby and George end up in another argument which ends when George leave Bobby on the side of a freeway.  When he gets back to the house, Bobby barks at the girl to get her things because they are leaving. They drive to a motel, but someone steals their car, along with the money.  As George and his family eat dinner, Cissy's two goons show up asking where Bobby is. George tells him he doesn't know where Bobby is, so Cissy leaves his number and tells him to call if Bobby contacts him.  Cissy tells him they just want the money and reminds him that they know where George lives.  The girl suggests going back to George, but Bobby refuses. Bobby tells her he's going to take her to George's and leave her there while he gets himself together.  He calls George, and apologizes about the fight, confused about why George is so mad.  After George explains, Bobby hangs up to realize the girl has left.  He searches for her, even calling George again.  The dog arrives at the same bridge the girl stood on a few nights ago, and picks up her scent. He follows it through the city, but finds a crying, drunken Bobby instead.  The dog leads him to the girl back at the bridge where she ecstatically greets the dog. Bobby, still crying, hugs her and apologizes.  They go back to George's where the brothers hug.  While the girl plays outside, Bobby explains everything to George.  Cissy's goons beat Bobby up badly. Cissy offers Baby anything she wants if she goes back to Chicago.  She goes over to Bobby in answer.  As Cissy goes to leave the room, Cissy is confronted by the dog.  Cissy doesn't believe it's the same dog that lost the fight, but when the girl says the dog followed them from Chicago, he decides that he wants the dog to fight again.  Cissy tells Bobby it's his chance to get out of the situation in one piece.  Baby treats Bobby's wounds while the dog looks on.  While Bobby sleeps, Cissy is on the phone ordering a dog to fight the Doberman. Back at the bridge, Baby is crying over the Doberman, where Bobby finds her.  She tells him she's worried and that she loves him.  Bobby tells her he has a plan and reminds her of what she used to do when she was little and he and Brenda were fighting.  The next day they take the dog to the location for the fight.  Bobby leaves Baby outside and tells her he loves her, and tells her to remember "when the bell rings."  The Doberman is pitted against a huge mastiff-looking dog.  When the bell rings, the girl runs in crying Bobby's name.  The crowd's cheers die down and she begs Bobby to make them stop hurting her dog.  They stop the fight and break up the dog, and the Doberman runs over to the girl.  As the crowd quietly stares at Cissy, Bobby walks across the ring and knocks Cissy into the ring, where the Doberman attacks him. It rips his coat and pants before getting hold of Cissy's neck.

Norbert decides to discard their next project, [[John the Baptist]], and move directly to [[Jesus]]. Louis, who is already cash-strapped, faces the prospect of being fired if he does not find an appropriate model for Jesus. Louis' friend Zalman is also worried, as he was supposed to have posed as John the Baptist for the cancelled photo, and now his flu will interfere with another job in film-dubbing that he counts on keeping. He asks Louis to do him a favour and cover his part until he's well.  In spite of his terrible situation, Louis agrees and goes to Zalman's job, which turns out to be voice dubbing for [[pornographic film]]s.

Sybil tells Louis the story of her last unfortunate relationship with a passionate but delusional Pianist ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), who worked in the same restaurant as she did.

Later he is confused when he sees the suit returned to the shop's window. By a stroke of fate, the Pianist finds Norbert's card and arrives there in a downpour of rain. Louis finds the Pianist is the perfect model for Jesus, and helps him obtain a very well-paying contract from Norbert.  Louis is taking the best pictures of his career with the Pianist (who gives various names to himself, including [[Frédéric Chopin]]) as Jesus. However, life is becoming complicated for the Pianist; he is being identified as Jesus by the public that has seen his posters. By another stroke of fate, he is forced to try to cure a blind boy and, during his pretended concentration, a golf ball hits the boy on the head and the boy's sight is restored. Doubting his own identity, the Pianist starts believing that he is Jesus. Through friendly conversations with Louis, he also starts understanding that Louis is disclosing to him his feelings for the same Sybil from the Pianist's past.  Meanwhile, Sybil had returned the suit to the store and returns the borrowed money to the real Zalman, who happens to be too sick to open the door. Still trying to locate Louis, who she thinks is Zalman, she arrives at Norbert's, from where the Pianist has recently been fired. As the Pianist sees Sybil talking to Norbert, he attacks Louis. Louis is caught off guard, as he is still completely unaware of the Pianist's former relation with Sybil.  Finally, the Pianist believing himself to be Jesus tries to walk on water and drowns in a river. Louis, still confused, is carrying his ashes in an urn when Sybil finally finds him. The film ends with the two of them getting close to each other again. At the very end, Sybil, who still believes that Louis is Zalman, notices that he is wearing the very watch that she was once given.

He comes back to an overgrown [[garden]], and after he picks up his [[dog]] and [[cat]], he finds his front door blocked by letters piled up behind it. He starts sifting through them, commenting on all of the different names that children call him. Shortly thereafter, a postman delivers more bags of post.

First Love Letter
 ''First Love Letter'' is a [[Pahlaj Nihalani]] film in which [[Vivek Mushran]] and [[Manisha Koirala]] made their original debut in a romance and action scenario showing that love transcends all barriers. Since [[Subhash Ghai]] was introducing the stars in ''[[Saudagar (1991 film)]]'', [[Pahlaj Nihalani]] had to wait for the release of his film, which was completed before ''Saudagar''.  The story opens with Radha, [[Manisha Koirala]] wanting more from life than just being a rich heiress to her father Thakur Ajit Singh’s, [[Danny Denzongpa]]  fortunes and wants to relocate from her home to the hilly locales of  [[Palampur]], where her father has a house. This is not liked by her father, but he has to relent due to the intervention of his younger brother Thakur Shrikant Singh, played by [[Dalip Tahil]], who is living the life of a recluse after the murder of his lady love Kasturi.   In the hilly locales,  Radha is mesmerized one day to the melodies of a flute, which she follows and meets Shyam, [[Vivek Mushran]], who also saves her life when she is about to fall in the deep gorges of the valleys. They meet again and slowly develop a bond of inseparable love, both being drawn to each other's youth and simplicity. Radha does not disclose her true identity, at first and when Shyam comes to know that she is the daughter of Thakur Ajit Singh, he feels cheated as he considers him to be a tyrant landlord. To top it, Thakur Ajit Singh also dislikes this growing intimacy between a local milk seller, which is the profession of  Shyam and his only daughter. So he fixes the marriage of his daughter to Thakur Ambar Singh, [[Chunky Pandey]].  Meanwhile, Radha is attacked by seasoned killer Bheema, [[Gulshan Grover]], who wants to molest her, but is timely saved by Thakur Ambar Singh, who also now falls in love with her. His mother Uma Devi, [[Sushma Seth]] makes him all the more happy when she tells him that Radha was the same girl that she has fixed his marriage with. This alliance when revealed to Radha by her father and mother [[Beena Banerjee]], is rejected by her, but she is forcibly married to Thakur Ambar Singh. Radha on her part, leaves the marriage ceremony and tells Thakur Ambar Singh that she loved Shyam and had secretly married him.  Thakur Ajit Singh now gets Shyam embroiled in a false police case and gets him imprisoned from where he jail breaks with none other than the killer Bheema. Bheema is hired as a contract killer by Thakur Ajit Singh to kill Shyam. What follows is a bloody encounter with Thakur Ambar Singh, Bheema, Radha and Shyam, where like a true [[Rajput]], Thakur Ambar Singh wants to leave Radha for Shyam, seeing their love, and is horribly wounded in the prospect. The end sees Thakur Ajit Singh realizing his mistake of separating the true lovers and unites them in holy matrimony. The movie is an eye opener on teenage love.

Before he can do so, he is mistaken for a homeless person and is attacked and nearly set on fire by thugs. He is rescued by Parry, a deluded homeless man who is on a mission to find the [[Holy Grail]], and tries to convince Jack to help him. Jack is initially reluctant, but comes to feel responsible for Parry when he learns that the man's condition is a result of witnessing his wife's death during the earlier mass murder. Parry is also continually haunted by a hallucinatory red knight, who terrifies him.  Jack learns that Parry's real name is Henry Sagan and he was a teacher at [[Hunter College]].

A Fool asks the King why he suffers, and when the King says he is thirsty, the Fool gives him a cup of water to drink. The King realizes the cup is the Grail and asks, "How did you find what my brightest and bravest could not?" The Fool said "I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty."

Jack and Anne join them for a dinner date.   Following dinner, Parry declares his love for Lydia but is once again haunted by the Red Knight.

For the Boys
 In the early 1990s, retired entertainer Dixie Leonard (Midler) has a commitment to attend a Hollywood ceremony being televised live to honor her and her longtime show-biz partner Eddie Sparks (Caan). When a young man from the TV show comes to pick her up, Dixie balks and explains what brought Eddie and her together, as well as what drove them apart. The majority of the film is an extended [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].  Dixie's story begins during [[World War II]] when she receives an offer to entertain the troops overseas as part of Eddie's act. Dixie is an instant hit with the boys in uniform, but Eddie wants her gone, ostensibly because he finds her kind of humor too coarse, but really because she stole the show by topping his jokes.  Dixie doesn't care for him much either, but fellow entertainers and her joke-writer uncle (Segal) persuade her to stay.  Eddie wins her over, particularly by reuniting Dixie with her soldier husband on stage. However, later in the war, Dixie's husband dies in battle.  Despite her distaste for Eddie, she continues working with him back in the U.S. to support herself and her son. Eddie is married with daughters, but treats Dixie's son as if he were his own.  As the [[Korean War]] breaks out, Eddie announces on stage that he and Dixie will be performing for the US troops there, without having told Dixie of his plans first. In revenge, Dixie announces that Eddie made a $100,000 donation to the Red Cross. Reluctantly, she travels to Korea with him. On their way to the camp, they encounter a unit of soldiers which has been ambushed. Dixie cares for a wounded soldier but cannot save him: he is pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital. Dixie and Eddie appear to spend the night together. At the Christmas dinner, a fight ensues after Art announces to everybody that Eddie has fired him for being a communist sympathizer.  In the meantime, Danny (Rydell) has grown up to be a soldier like his father, and is deployed to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Dixie eventually agrees to perform there for Christmas with Eddie. On their way to the camp, the performers are warned of the camp possibly getting attacked, because of which they are to be flown out immediately after their performance. Before going on stage, Dixie and Eddie meet Danny, who reveals to them the barbarity which is spreading among his comrades. The show begins with the performance of a dancer, who starts getting harassed by the soldiers, and only Eddie's intervention prevents the situation from getting out of control. Dixie comes on stage and makes some cynical remarks about the soldiers, then sings “[[In My Life]]”. While she is still on stage, the camp is attacked in a mortar barrage. Dixie and Eddie manage to seek shelter, but Danny is killed right in front of them, which they both mourn.  Dixie has not forgiven Eddie for his part in all this, and they have another heated argument in the dressing room. Eddie goes out on stage alone. But, at the last minute, because he speaks of their joint loss in Vietnam, Dixie joins him on stage for one last song and dance, before appearing to accept their mutual love for one another.  
Flirting (film)
 Danny, now an awkward, underdeveloped 17-year-old, has been sent away by his parents to the all-male St. Albans [[boarding school]] in rural [[New South Wales]], Australia, in the hopes he won’t become a delinquent. The year is 1965 and it has been some time since Danny has had any romantic relationship with a girl (his former love, Freya, from ''The Year My Voice Broke'', left him at the end of the first film). Danny is the butt of jokes because of his stutter and long nose (for which he is nicknamed "Bird"). His only friend is Gilbert.  At a school rugby game, he meets and slowly becomes interested in Thandiwe, a Ugandan-Kenyan-British girl (Ugandan father and Kenyan-British mother) attending the all-girls Cirencester Ladies’ College across the lake, while her father, a political activist, is lecturing at university in Canberra. They later meet at a debate between the two schools, and covertly during a school dance. She is punished for leaving the dance without permission and is given chores by the prefect, Nicola. Thandiwe is later befriended by Melissa and Janet.  Throughout the course of the school year, they foster a budding romance, despite the overbearing regulations inflicted upon them – specifically [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial politics]] and [[social conventions]] (Thandiwe is often regarded by the school authorities as rebellious and overtly sexual). After the performance of the musical, Danny introduces his parents to Thandiwe and her parents. They later decide to return to Uganda in response to the political turmoil there. Soon Thandiwe decides to return too, and lies about her true departure date, in order to spend the night in a motel with Danny. They are discovered, leading to his expulsion. Thandiwe writes him regularly from Uganda, but then the letters stop coming. One day a letter arrives from Nairobi saying she is finally safe there.  
The Five Heartbeats
 Donald "Duck" Matthews, Anthony "Choirboy" Stone, J.T. Matthews, Terrence "Dresser" Williams, and Eddie King Jr. perform at a [[Battle of the Bands]] contest as The Heartbeats. The group loses to Flash and the Ebony Sparks but pleases the crowd and is noticed by Jimmy Potter. Jimmy offers to manage the group, promising them $100 if they do not win the next month's Battle of the Bands contest. After the group loses, Jimmy pays them. When the owner of the club asks to hire them, they agree to let Jimmy manage them.  Bird and The Midnight Falcons witness the Heartbeats rehearsing for a competition and are concerned they could lose; frontman Victor "Bird" Thomas asks his girlfriend to invite her friends and boo The Heartbeats while cheering The Falcons. The announcer, a cousin of one of the Falcons, forces The Heartbeats to use the house piano player. Duck grows frustrated with the house piano player and shoves him off the piano stool. Eddie leads the group in a number that results in Bird's girlfriend fainting in Eddie's arms. The Heartbeats win the contest and the interest of Big Red Davis, who owns Big Red Records. Big Red offers them a deal, but Jimmy and his wife Eleanor, aware of Big Red's corruption, decline. The group instead releases their first single on Jimmy's own [[independent label]] and searches for a record company they can trust, but no one else is interested aside from a label which wants to buy Duck's songs for a group they've already signed, The Five Horsemen, prompting The Heartbeats to sign with Big Red.  The group goes on the road, but the travel is marred by racism and poor living conditions. Dresser's girlfriend visits and reveals she is pregnant, and the group is faced with their first album cover featuring white people, despite the label having earlier approved a photo of the Heartbeats as the cover.  Throughout the mid to late 1960s The Five Heartbeats receive numerous awards, chart several hits, and are featured on magazine covers. Eddie abuses [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]], affecting his performance and prompting his girlfriend Baby Doll to break up with him. Convinced that Jimmy intends to replace him due to his deteriorating condition, he cuts a deal with Big Red to have Jimmy cut out of his contract. Jimmy threatens to go to authorities with information about [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged LPs]], cooked books and [[payola]] that could have Big Red arrested, leading Red to have Jimmy killed. The group learns that Eddie's deceit caused the argument between Jimmy and Big Red. Big Red is convicted of Jimmy's murder, forcing the group to sign to a new record label, and a guilt-ridden Eddie to leave in disgrace. Duck later hears on the radio that Eddie was involved in an armed robbery and, after a shootout with the police, was in critical condition.  The Heartbeats add Flash as their lead singer. Duck comes to suspect his fiancé, Tanya Sawyer, is having an affair with Choirboy. He follows her to a hotel, only to discover that Tanya is meeting with J.T., not Choirboy. Tanya's relationship with J.T. predates her relationship with Duck, but she says she is now in love with Duck. J.T. urges Tanya to disclose the affair, but she refuses. At an awards ceremony celebrating their success, Flash announces he is going solo. Duck reveals that he knows about Tanya and J.T. and also leaves.  The film then skips ahead to the early 1990s. Choirboy, true to his nickname, has returned to singing in his father's church. After converting to Christianity, Eddie became clean and sober. He is now married to Baby Doll, sings in Choirboy's choir, and manages a group. He asks Duck to write songs for them, to which he agrees. J.T. has a wife and two children, including a son named "Duck". The brothers reconcile. The only member to have maintained a singing career is Flash, who transitioned from [[doo-wop]] to [[pop music]], and is part of the group Flash and The Five Horsemen.  At a family gathering, Eleanor Potter, coming to terms with her husband's death, forgives Eddie. The Five Heartbeats reunite in front of their families and friends, trying to remember their old moves.  
Flight of the Intruder
 Lieutenant Jake "Cool Hand" Grafton ([[Brad Johnson (actor, born 1959)|Brad Johnson]]) and his bombardier/navigator and best friend Lieutenant Morgan "Morg" McPherson ([[Christopher Rich (actor)|Christopher Rich]]) are flying a Grumman A-6 Intruder over the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] towards [[North Vietnam]]. They hit their target, a 'suspected truck park', which actually turns out to be trees. On the return to carrier, Morg is fatally shot in the neck by an armed Vietnamese peasant. Landing on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS ''Independence'']] with Morg dead, a disturbed Jake, covered in blood, walks into a debriefing with Commander Frank Camparelli ([[Danny Glover]]) and Executive Officer, Commander "Cowboy" Parker ([[J. Kenneth Campbell]]). Camparelli tells Jake to put Morgan's death behind him and to write a letter to Sharon, Morg's wife. New pilot Jack Barlow (Jared Chandler), nicknamed "Razor" because of his youthful appearance, is then introduced.  Lieutenant Commander Virgil Cole ([[Willem Dafoe]]) arrives on board and reports to Camparelli, who later tells Jake's roommate Sammy Lundeen ([[Justin Williams]]) to take Jake, Bob "Boxman" Walkawitz ([[Tom Sizemore]]) and "Mad Jack" ([[Dann Florek]]) to fly into [[Subic Bay]] the next day and help Jake unwind. Jake goes to see Sharon, but she has already departed. He runs into a woman named Callie Troy ([[Rosanna Arquette]]), who is packing Sharon's things, and they have a small, tense encounter. After an altercation with civilian merchant sailors in the Tailhook Bar, Jake runs into Callie again. After they reconcile, dance and spend the night together, she reveals her husband was a Navy pilot himself and was killed on a solo mission over Vietnam.  Jake returns to the carrier, where Camparelli confronts him regarding the bar incident, and Cole reports in Jake's favor. Cole and Jake are paired on "Iron Hand" A-6Bs loaded with [[AGM-78 Standard ARM|Standard]] and [[AGM-45 Shrike|Shrike]] [[anti-radiation missile]]s for [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] suppression. During the mission, after a successful strike, they encounter and manage to evade a North Vietnamese [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]].  Jake suggests to Cole that they bomb [[Hanoi]], which would be a violation of the restrictive [[rules of engagement]] (ROE) and could get them [[court-martial]]ed. Cole initially rejects the idea. On the next raid, Boxman hits the suspected target, but is shot down by another SAM and killed. The North Vietnamese in Hanoi gloat on TV over the downing of U.S. aircraft. Cole then agrees with Jake's plan to attack Hanoi, deciding to hit "SAM City," a [[surface-to-air missile]] depot.  To secure their mission, they coercively enlist the aid of the ship's librarian, who has been caught urinating in the commander's coffee decanter, being the Phantom Shitter who's secretly repeated this deed throughout the first half of the movie. He warns Jake and Cole that there's no chance of succeeding in their mission, but he is soundly ignored.  Sent to bomb a power plant in the vicinity of Hanoi, they drop two of their [[Mark 83 bomb]]s, keeping eight for the missile depot and set a new course for Hanoi for their independent bombing mission. Arriving at SAM City, on their first pass, their armament computer malfunctions and they are forced to bomb 'by hand' (guesswork), and after barely surviving a barrage of enemy fire, their bombs fail to release. The two come back around, rerun the route, successfully drop their bombs and manage to obliterate the missile depot in a spectacular display of secondary explosions. Upon returning to the carrier, Camparelli angrily chastises the pair for their independent mission and informs them of their impending court martial at [[Naval Base Subic Bay]]. During the preliminary hearing, Cole and Grafton are criticized for their actions, and informed that their naval careers are essentially over.  The charges are dropped the next day when [[Operation Linebacker II]] is ordered by President [[Richard M. Nixon]], and the unauthorized mission is covered up. The next day, Camparelli grounds Jake and Cole while the rest of the carrier's A-6 and A-7 crews conduct a daylight raid to destroy anti-aircraft emplacements: the tangible, lucrative targets they've longed to attack. Camparelli is hit by a [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 ''Shilka'' AA tank]] and crash lands, his bombardier dead. Sammy Lundeen is hit and has to head for the ocean. Razor is ordered by Camparelli to disengage and obeys. Jake and Cole, defying orders, man their Intruder, launch and fly one more time to assist Camparelli. They destroy the ZSU, but are forced to eject from their heavily damaged aircraft. After bailing out, Jake lands near Camparelli's crashed Intruder and runs to cover with Camparelli. Separated from Jake, Cole is mortally wounded in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy soldier. On the radio, he lies to Jake, telling him he has already gotten away. Moments later, a pair of U.S. Air Force [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|A-1 Skyraider]]s ("Sandy") appear and provide cover.  Cole instructs the lead Sandy to drop ordnance on the spot he has marked with smoke. He is killed along with a few dozen NVA. Jake and Camparelli retreat into the woods, pursued by a sniper. A [[Sikorsky S-61R|"Jolly Green Giant"]] helicopter picks up the two men, and the Skyraiders make one final [[napalm]] run to finish the job.  Later, recovering from his injuries, Jake joins his crew and Camparelli, all in their Navy whites, on deck to prepare for entry at a port of call. Jake and Camparelli reconcile their differences, and the movie ends in rolling credits.

Maggie remembers what John told her and discovers her own adoption papers, learning that she is Freddy's daughter. Her birth name was Katherine Krueger, and her name was later changed to Maggie Burroughs.  Doc discovers Freddy's power comes from the "dream demons" who continually revive him, and that Freddy can be killed if he is pulled into the real world. Maggie decides that she will be the one to enter Freddy's mind and pull him into the real world. Once in the dream world, she puts on a pair of 3-D glasses and enters Freddy's mind.

Freddy was given the power to become immortal from fiery demons. After some struggling, Maggie pulls Freddy into the real world.  Maggie and Freddy end up in hand-to-hand combat against one another. While Maggie continues to battle Freddy, she uses several weapons confiscated from patients at the shelter. Enraged by the knowledge of what he has done, she disarms him of his clawed glove. Eventually, Maggie stabs Freddy in the stomach with his own glove while she is close to him. Tracy throws Maggie a pipe bomb. After she impales Freddy to a steel support beam she throws the bomb in his chest. She says "Happy Fathers Day", kisses him, and runs.

Fried Green Tomatoes
 Evelyn Couch, a timid, unhappy housewife in her 40s, meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode in an [[Anderson, Alabama]], [[nursing home]]. Over several encounters with Evelyn, Ninny tells her the story of the now abandoned town of Whistle Stop, and the people who lived there. The film's subplot concerns Evelyn's dissatisfaction with her marriage, her life, her growing confidence, and her developing friendship with Ninny. The narrative switches several times between Ninny's story, which is set between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and Evelyn's life in 1980s [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].  Ninny's story begins with [[tomboy]] Idgie Threadgoode, the youngest of the Threadgoode children, whom Ninny describes as her sister-in-law. Idgie's close relationship with her charming older brother, Buddy, is cut short when he is hit by a train after his shoe got stuck, leading to his death. Devastated, she recedes from formal society for much of her childhood and adolescence until Buddy's former girlfriend, the straitlaced Ruth Jamison, intervenes at the request of the concerned Threadgoode family.  Idgie initially resists Ruth's attempts at friendship, but gradually a deep attachment develops between them. Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett and moves to [[Valdosta, Georgia]]. Idgie tries to forget her but later visits her house to find her pregnant and subject to physical abuse from Frank. Against his wishes and violent attempts to stop her, she returns to Whistle Stop with Idgie, where her baby, a boy whom she names Buddy, Jr., is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business so she can care for Ruth and Buddy, Jr. She and Ruth open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing the family cook, Sipsey, and her son, Big George, who excels with a barbecue that becomes popular with their patrons.  Frank eventually returns to Whistle Stop to kidnap Buddy, Jr., but his attempt is thwarted by an unseen assailant, and he is later reported missing. Once his truck appears at the bottom of a nearby drying lake without its owner, Idgie is immediately a suspect, as she had publicly threatened violence against him for beating Ruth. She is detained along with Big George for his murder by Grady Kilgore, the local sheriff, who offers to release her and pin the crime solely on Big George; she refuses to sacrifice him. During the subsequent trial, the local minister, Reverend Scroggins, has no problem lying, providing Idgie and Big George with sound alibis for the time of Frank's disappearance. Taking into account his reputation for getting drunk, the judge rules his death an accident and dismisses the case. Idgie and Big George are cleared of all charges.  After the trial, Ruth is diagnosed with cancer, becomes very ill, and eventually dies. Following her death, the café closes. Over time, many Whistle Stop residents eventually move away, bringing Ninny to the end of her story, but not before the revelation of what really happened to Frank. Sipsey murdered him with a blow to the head with a frying pan while trying to prevent him from kidnapping Buddy, Jr. Idgie got Big George to barbecue Frank's body, which was later served to an investigator from Georgia searching for him. The investigator ate with gusto, proclaiming his meal the best pork barbecue he'd ever tasted.  Evelyn discovers that during Ninny's temporary stay at the nursing home, her house was condemned and torn down. Evelyn, having become friends with her, offers her a room in her house which she accepts. As they walk away from the empty lot where her house used to be, they pass Ruth's grave, freshly adorned with a jar of honey, a honeycomb, and a card which reads, "I'll always love you, the Bee Charmer". The Bee Charmer is Ruth's old nickname for Idgie, and the note reveals that she is still alive.

The Giant of Thunder Mountain
 In the town of Weaverton, signs of a circus are being posted. In Zeke MacGruder's barn, a group of boys are holding a meeting. Two brothers, Tommy ([[Chance Michael Corbitt]]) and Ben ([[Ryan Todd]]) are daring to climb Thunder Mountain, where it is said a giant lives. The boys take the dare and set out up the mountain. They get caught in a thunderstorm and barely escape getting hit by lightning (this is what gives Thunder Mountain its name). They take refuge inside a strange oversized log cabin. Whilst there, they find mysterious carved wooden figures. Suddenly, the giant returns and finds the boys hiding under a table, but they escape with one of the wooden figures and go back to town. When they reach home, they tell their family their amazing story, but no one believes them. The next morning, they set out with another boy, Zeke MacGruder [[Daniel Pipoly]]) who doubts Tommy and Ben have seen the giant. Tommy and Ben's younger sister, Amy ([[Noley Thornton]]) follows them, but almost gets caught in a bear trap. The boys tell her to leave but she persists and continues following them.  The three boys watch the giant from the woods. Zeke excuses himself and runs away, but Amy steps out from the woods and introduces herself and her brothers to the giant, Eli Weaver ([[Richard Kiel]]). They help him with his chores including helping him plant young fir trees. The boys volunteer to get water for the trees and go in the cabin to fetch a bucket. When they do so they discover some of Eli's gold nuggets. Tommy puts a few in his pocket, and they go outside and fill the bucket with water. Eli's pet wolf shows up to check out the children and after this the children return to town. Amy discovers Tommy and Ben looking at the gold nuggets and they allow her to have one of them with the promise she won't tell their mother. Amy goes to the general store to buy candy, and offers to pay for the candy with the gold. Hezekiah Crow ([[Jack Elam]]) overhears Amy and says he is an expert in gauging whether a nugget is gold or not, and proclaims the nugget as being 'Fool's Gold.' But in trade he offers her tickets to his carnival, and she bargains for extra tickets. She goes to see Eli and invites him to dinner and gives him one of the carnival tickets.  Eli comes to Wilson's house for dinner, and after dinner he repairs their cuckoo clock. Hezekiah Crow's circus parades through Weaverton, hosted by Zeke's father, Mr. MacGruder ([[Ed Williams (actor)|Ed Williams]]). The circus's many performers include a juggling act, a trained [[lion]], a [[boa constrictor]], a long-legged clown act, a [[camel]], a high-jumping acrobat, and two white [[horse]]s.  The final act arrives, a trained  [[American black bear|black bear]] act. This reminds Eli of the day that a giant [[grizzly bear]] ([[Bart the Bear]]) killed his parents. Amy admires a beautiful doll at a circus booth, and Eli throws balls to knock down pins. The booth is run by one of Hezekiah's sons (William Sanderson), who puts a rod through the pins so they can't be knocked over. But Eli's throw breaks the pins and he expects the carnival man to give Amy the doll, but instead he gives her an inferior doll. Amy is disappointed, and Eli grabs hold of the carnival man and lifts him in the air and then drops him on the ground. Eli hands the beautiful ceramic doll to Amy. A crowd has gathered around Eli and  Amy's mother appears and scolds Amy for causing trouble. The crowd shout insults at Eli and Eli crushes the doll's head with one squeeze and warns the town to stay off Thunder Mountain. Amy tries to tell him to stay, but he says that he will not visit a town that's disrespectful to him and storms off. The next scene is at a bar, where several men (including old man Doc) are playing poker. Hezekiah and his two sons plot to go to Eli's cabin to obtain Eli's gold. Meanwhile, at his cabin, Eli burns the wooden statuette he carved of Amy.  Amy goes to see Eli and says she is sorry for what happened in town, and the two are friends again. Eli and Amy go for a walk in the woods and he shows her the biggest tree in the forest 'The General.' Tommy and Ben go to find Amy and at the cabin are accosted by Hezekiah Crow and his two sons. They kidnap Ben, knock out Tommy, and take Eli's gold. Hearing the approach of a posse, they escape out a window in the back of the cabin, leaving Tommy lying  unconscious on the floor.  Meanwhile, in the woods, the grizzly approaches and Eli fights it and knocks it out with a tree branch. Amy runs for the cabin and Eli limps along after her. Amy arrives at the cabin and runs to her mother. The posse do not ascertain what is going on and assume Eli has taken Amy's brothers and set out to catch him. While being stalked, Eli is wounded in the leg and has to hide. He hides under a pile of leaves and surprises one of the men of the posse who has caught his leg in his own bear trap. He takes the man's gun and takes the trap off the man's leg. The posse burns Eli's cabin as revenge for their mistaken belief he kidnapped the children.  Amy and her mom return to town with Tommy. The kidnappers go to the MacGruder's house to steal their belongings and Eli tracks them down and frees the MacGruder's and Ben. Hezekiah Crow tries to trick Eli and escapes out a window. Eli follows him and Hezekiah comes face to face in the dark with the true Giant of Thunder Mountain - the grizzly. Caught between Eli and the bear he surrenders to Eli and the posse.  The movie concludes with the town asking Eli if he would become their sheriff, and promise to rebuild his cabin. Eli says he must return to the mountain, but leaves as their friend.

However, he acts as a kind of [[Robin Hood]]: the victims of his scams are government officials, and other, often much more dangerous crooks. Some time ago, Nenashev worked at a secret research institution where he authored a number of technical innovations to which application was not found in the conditions of the Soviet economy. However now Nenashev with his associates expertly use these "gadgets" in fraud.  As a result of a "transaction", a batch of "Parabolic antenna's", fake, of course, were sold to Azerbaijanis who trade flowers on the market. A little later, having received incriminating videos of the intimate kind featuring businessman Baev (orgy with prostitutes) and theater director Arkhipov (homosexual act with a young waiter), Nenashev starts to blackmail both of them.

Nenashev has a teenage daughter from his first marriage, but after the divorce, he is alone. Suddenly, at the hairdresser Sergei meets Nastya, a very beautiful girl from a simple working family. Parents of Nastya perceive "speculator" Nenashev's flirting in a very negative way, Nastya herself also believes that she is just another "plaything" for the cynical rich man.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah
 In 1992, science fiction writer Kenichiro Terasawa ([[Kosuke Toyohara]]) is writing a book about [[Godzilla]] and learns of a group of Japanese soldiers stationed on Lagos Island during the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]]. In February 1944, while threatened by American soldiers, the Japanese soldiers were saved by a mysterious dinosaur. He theorizes that the dinosaur was subsequently mutated into [[Godzilla]] in 1954 after a [[Castle Bravo|hydrogen bomb test]] on the island. Yasuaki Shindo ([[Yoshio Tsuchiya]]), a wealthy businessman who commanded the Japanese soldiers on Lagos Island, confirms that the dinosaur did indeed exist.  Meanwhile, a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] lands on [[Mount Fuji]]. When the Japanese army investigates, they are greeted by Wilson (Chuck Wilson), Grenchiko (Richard Berger), Emmy Kano ([[Anna Nakagawa]]) and an android, M-11 ([[Robert Scott Field]]). The visitors, known as the "Futurians", explain that they are humans from the year [[23rd century|2204]], where Godzilla has completely destroyed Japan. The Futurians plan to [[time travel|travel back in time]] to 1944 to remove the dinosaur from Lagos Island before the island is irradiated in 1954, thus preventing the mutation of the creature into Godzilla. As proof of their story, Emmy presents a copy of Terasawa's book, which has not yet been completed in the present.  The Futurians, Terasawa, [[Miki Saegusa]] ([[Megumi Odaka]]), and Professor Mazaki ([[Katsuhiko Sasaki]]), board a time shuttle and travel back to 1944 to Lagos Island. There, as American forces land and engage the Japanese forces commanded by Shindo, the dinosaur attacks and kills the American soldiers. The American navy then bombs the dinosaur from the sea and gravely wounds it.  After Shindo and his men leave the island, M-11 teleports the dinosaur from Lagos Island to a place in the [[Bering Strait]]. Before returning to 1992, the Futurians secretly leave three small creatures called Dorats on Lagos Island, which are exposed to radiation from the hydrogen bomb test in 1954 and merge to become [[King Ghidorah]], which then appears in present-day Japan. After returning to 1992, the Futurians use King Ghidorah to subjugate Japan. They issue an ultimatum, but Japan refuses to surrender.  Feeling sympathy for the Japanese people, Emmy reveals to Terasawa the truth behind the Futurians' mission: in the future, Japan is an economic superpower that has surpassed the United States, Russia, and China. The Futurians traveled back in time in order to change history and prevent Japan's future economic dominance by creating King Ghidorah and using it to destroy present day Japan. At the same time, they also planned to erase Godzilla from history so it wouldn't pose a threat to their plans. After M-11 brings Emmy back to the UFO, she reprograms the android so it will help her. With M-11 and Terasawa's aid, Emmy sabotages the UFO's control over King Ghidorah.  At the same time, Shindo plans to use his nuclear submarine to recreate Godzilla. En route to the Bering Strait, Shindo's submarine is destroyed by an already mutated Godzilla, who absorbs its radiation and becomes even larger and more powerful. Terasawa discovers that a Russian nuclear submarine sank in the Bering Strait in the 1970s and released enough radiation to mutate the dinosaur into [[The Return of Godzilla|Godzilla]].  Godzilla arrives in Japan and is met by King Ghidorah. They fight at equal strength, each immune to the other's attacks. Godzilla eventually ends the battle by blasting off Ghidorah's middle head. Before the final blow, Godzilla destroys the UFO, killing Wilson and Grenchiko. Godzilla then turns its attention on Tokyo, destroying the metropolis and killing Shindo.  Emmy travels to the future with M-11 and returns to the present day with Mecha-King Ghidorah, a cybernetic version of King Ghidorah. The cybernetic Ghidorah blasts Godzilla with energy beams, which proves useless. Godzilla then counters by relentlessly blasting Ghidorah with its atomic ray, almost decapitating Ghidorah. Ghidorah survives but then Godzilla prevails, knocking Ghidorah down. Emmy carries off Godzilla and drops it and Ghidorah into the ocean. Emmy then returns to the future but not before informing Terasawa that she is his descendant.  At the bottom of the ocean, Godzilla awakens and roars over [[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II|Ghidorah's remains]] before swimming away.

  [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent Max Reed witnesses the murder of Dr. Tetsu Segawa, a researcher for the mysterious Chronos Corporation. Dr. Segawa had stolen an alien device known as “the Guyver” from Chronos, but he hid it among a pile of garbage by the [[Los Angeles River]] before his death. Lisker, leader of the thugs that murdered Dr. Segawa, returns the metal briefcase to Chronos' president Fulton Balcus, only to discover that it contains an old toaster. At a dojo, Reed notifies Dr. Segawa's daughter, Mizki, about the incident, while her boyfriend, Sean Barker, struggles to pay attention in class. Sean follows Reed and Mizki to the crime scene; there, he stumbles upon the Guyver unit stored inside a lunch box and stuffs it in his backpack. On his way home, his scooter breaks down in the middle of a back alley before a gang corners him. While Sean is being attacked by the gang, the Guyver suddenly activates and fuses with him. Sean, in his newly armored form, dispatches the gang members, but is shocked by his physical appearance before the armor quickly disappears into two scars on the back of his neck.  The next night, Sean goes to Mizki's apartment, and discovers his sensei murdered and Mizki abducted by Lisker's thugs. With the help of Reed, Sean rescues Mizki before the trio are chased by Lisker's gang of Zoanoids. They are trapped in an abandoned warehouse, where Lisker's thugs hold Mizki captive, and Sean once again transforms into the Guyver to battle them. Sean defeats the Zoanoids before squaring off against Lisker. During the battle, Sean executes a headbutt, which temporarily malfunctions the armor's Control Metal. He kills Lisker's girlfriend, Weber, but mistakenly knocks Mizki unconscious before the Zoanoids gang up on him, and Lisker rips the Control Metal off his forehead, disintegrating the armor and seemingly killing Sean.  Mizki wakes up at the Chronos headquarters, where Balcus shows her a gallery of Zoanoids before questioning her on how Sean was able to activate the Guyver. Dr. East, the head of genetics research, discovers that the Control Metal is regenerating itself into a new Guyver unit. After seeing Reed being experimented on, Mizki assaults Balcus and takes the Control Metal, threatening to throw it into the disposal chamber. In the middle of the battle, the Control Metal is flung off her hand, and accidentally swallowed by Dr. East, before it bursts through the Zoanoid's body, and once again becomes the Guyver who says he has been rejected by death. Sean and Mizki free Reed from the experimental chamber before Sean once again battles Lisker and kills him. Before the trio proceed to escape, Reed suddenly mutates into a Zoanoid, and dies due to his system rejecting the new form. Balcus reveals his true form as the Zoalord and corners Sean, but the Guyver's defensive system activates the Mega Smasher cannons on his chest and obliterates Balcus and the laboratory. Sean deactivates the Guyver armor before he and Mizki leave Chronos headquarters as Reed's former partner Col. Castle and the Zoanoid thug Striker look on.

The Hard Way (1991 film)
 A [[serial killer]] known as the "Party Crasher" telephones the police, notifying them that he is about to kill another person at a night club, daring them to stop him. Police converge on the night club, but the officers, including cynical [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant John Moss, are unable to stop the murder. The Party Crasher flees in the ensuing chaos, and Moss is thrown off a car while trying to stop the killer. While Moss has his injuries tended to, he makes obscene comments to the media.  In [[Hollywood]], Nick Lang is a pampered movie star who is best known as "Smoking" Joe Gunn, the title character in a series of highly popular [[action film]]s. In order to be taken more seriously as an actor, he is vying for the leading role in the heavy cop drama ''Blood on the Asphalt''. Nick vows to "prepare" for the role by attempting to be an actual police officer. After seeing Moss's outburst on TV, Nick pulls strings with New York City Mayor [[David Dinkins]] to be assigned as Moss's new partner. Moss wants no part of the deal, but is forced to comply by his captain, who is a Nick Lang fan. To make matters worse, looking after Nick means that Moss will have to be removed from the Party Crasher case.  Moss defies orders by continuing the investigation and repeatedly trying to ditch Nick, whose constant questions and attempts to mimic Moss's movements frustrate Moss. Nick wants to know what it feels like to be a cop, while Moss constantly reminds him that this is not a movie. Meanwhile, Moss is also trying to juggle a new romance with Susan. The divorced Moss is unable to communicate with her or open up, and Nick offers advice to him on how to interact with women.  Moss takes Nick to a dark building to catch a perp, ordering him to stay put and giving him a real gun in case of an emergency. Nick, however, enters the building and shoots a man who he believes is a criminal chasing Moss. The man is revealed to be a bystander, leaving Nick terrified. Moss agrees to cover up the act, and urges Nick to leave town immediately. Nick returns from the airport to the police station to confess, only to see that the "dead man" is actually a cop. Moss choreographed the stunt to get Nick out of town.  Nick tracks Moss down and stumbles into a confrontation between Moss and The Party Crasher, during which he saves Moss's life. The Party Crasher is wounded, but he kills several people and escapes. After Moss is told by Susan that his unstable life as a cop will never allow them to have a relationship, he is visited by Nick. Nick predicts that The Party Crasher will follow storytelling protocol and seek out Moss's loved ones in the third act of their story together. Nick is right, and Susan is abducted. Moss and Nick confront The Party Crasher on a billboard, advertising Nick's latest movie Smoking Gunn II, and a brawl ensues. Susan is saved after Nick intervenes and is shot in the chest.

The Heroes of Desert Storm
  On August 2, 1990, at dawn in Kuwait, a long succession of tanks and trucks drive toward and over the TV screen as opening credits roll, with contemporary radio news report playing.   Guy Hunter, Jr., Steven Shaefer, Steve Tate, Beverly Clark, Phoebe Jeter, Jonathan Alston, Ben Pennington, Mary Rhoads, Devon Jones and Lawrence Slade are introduced to the viewer, mostly in the context of family and friends back home, while Iraq invades Kuwait, Kuwaitis resist the invasion, Saddam Hussein takes foreign nationals in Iraq prisoner as human shields, the United States progressively increases its forces in and around Saudi Arabia, Army Reserve units become activated for Desert Shield, the United Nations sets a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and finally, Saddam Hussein ignores that deadline up to the first commercial break. The activations mean that Ben Pennington does not get to tell his father and brother, who are off in the woods, goodbye, Phoebe Jeter does not get to see her ill grandmother for one last time, Daniel Maldonado misses the birth of his daughter, and one bride, Linda Buckholz, has to show her wedding to the guests on video.    The viewer is treated to displays of American and coalition military deployment as contemporary radio news reports inform the viewer that the United Nations coalition has started to attack Iraq and occupied Kuwait as a prelude to liberating Kuwait. As Ben Pennington is deployed aboard an Air Force rescue helicopter, a hidden cameraman interviews him, and Ben replies that they are deliberately attracting Iraqi radar so AH-64 Apache helicopters can target the radars with anti-radiation missiles to clear a corridor for the bombers and simultaneously providing rescue cover in case a pilot is shot down and needs to be rescued by Ben and the crew on board.  The viewer gets to hear more news reports about infrared and night vision technology and laser-guided missiles fired from planes including the F-117 Nighthawk while a Nighthawk is displayed and gun camera footage shows various targets being destroyed in a sterile, precise fashion. Another news report mentions the role played by the Navy battleships Wisconsin and Missouri while they are shown firing their  guns onto Iraqi coastal targets. After Navy Corpsman Julian Crumes (played by Tim Russ) and Marine Gunnery Sergeant Leroy Ford (played by Ken Foree) are interviewed by another hidden cameraman about what they think about the bombing, CNN footage of Baghdad being bombed is shown while a reporter is giving his impression of it. For a finale before the second commercial break, Steve Tate intercepts and destroys an Iraqi aircraft.  Despite the cheers of his mates at King Abdul Aziz air base, Tate does not enjoy having the first air-to-air kill of the war because "a person died in that aircraft."  As General [[Chuck Horner]] was interviewed,<ref>Wings Over The Gulf, episode, F-15 Eagle, as played on the Discovery Channel, Wings New Year's Day special, December 31, 1996 to January 1, 1997. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AX3Nw9Ivos&feature=related  4:11 to 5:05</ref> "I've met Iraqi pilots, and they're good..." but attributed their weaknesses to Iraqi command and control, when, once it and the radars were defeated, made the Iraqis easier to shoot down.    Back home in Pennsylvania, Beverly Clark is dismayed to be activated and deployed, and shares her doubts about coming home alive with her mother. Several starving and frightened Iraqi soldiers, waving white flags and approaching the border, surrender to Crumes' and Ford's Marine squad, and cringe when the Marines fire a warning shot. The prisoners are given food and medical attention as required under the Geneva Convention. In contrast, Iraq's treatment of coalition prisoners such as British Tornado<ref>Discovery Channel Video, On The Inside, episode, Inside the Kill Box, narrated by Michael Ironside, released January 15, 2001. Written by Kurt Sayenga, Web reference https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309715/</ref> pilot John Peters is shown as Iraq depicted to the news media, and new prisoner Guy Hunter is tortured under interrogation and also shown to the news media while his daughter and wife back home watch in anguish. The F-14 Devon Jones is flying is hit by a surface-to-air missile despite attempts to evade it, and both are forced to eject before the jet is engulfed in flame.   Devon Jones lands in Iraq before dawn and activates his emergency transmitter. Soon Ben Pennington is out looking for him. But the Iraqis are also homing in on the rescue signal. Devon notices a truck, and then notices the Air Force helicopter. The helicopter notices the vehicle, and Devon indicates it might be a military vehicle. At least one AH-64 Apache is covering the rescue, and fires Hellfire missiles on the truck. Ben expertly disembarks from the helicopter, rifle drawn, and quickly finds Devon, does a "fireman's carry" for him, runs to the MH-53J helicopter, hands over his rifle, hands over Devon, and quickly secures Devon for liftoff while gunners watch for the enemy. Not a second after Devon is secured when the helicopter lifts off, "inbound" with "survivor on board". Devon demands to know about his backseater, Larry. Ben replies that they will know when they return to base. Indeed, Larry was captured.  Crumes and Ford are enjoying some bottled water when the [[Battle of Khafji]] begins and a unit needs a Corpsman. Crumes is able to save one soldier's life, but reflects to Ford on the terror of war and asks if Vietnam was as bad. Ford replies that the all-volunteer U.S. military in Iraq is better trained than the U.S. military in Vietnam, but adds that the Marines will still go in first, this time like the last.    After another news report and video of Scuds falling on Israel, which although attacked, must remain neutral for the sake of maintaining the international coalition including Egypt and Syria, the Patriot anti-missile system is introduced. Phoebe Jeter's battery saves Gary Buckholz's base. Meanwhile, Beverly Clark and Mary Rhoads are at a processing center for incoming U.S. soldiers, in Dhahran, which will later be hit by a Scud. Meanwhile, Private Steven Shaefer has volunteered for Desert Storm duty, and quickly upon arriving in Kuwait meets Specialist Jonathan Alston. When an explosion is heard in the distance, Alston knows that Shaefer is inexperienced in combat, and questions him about his training. Sure enough, Steven has not been prepped on chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear warfare or even on land mines, merely his basic training. When Jonathan demands to know how the Army messed up sending him into danger, Steven drops his bombshell. Alston is impressed and says they will win medals like Alston's uncles did in the Second World War.   The ground war starts. Marine Captain Michael Shupp (played by Kevin Kilner) instructs Ford and Crumes' unit to fight professionally to keep one another safe, but to reserve compassion for Saddam's draftees deliberately sacrificed by Saddam to keep his Republican Guard in reserve,<ref>Discovery Channel Video, On The Inside, episode, Inside the Kill Box, narrated by Michael Ironside, released January 15, 2001. Written by Kurt Sayenga, Web reference https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309715/</ref> and promises them that they will all make it through and go home. Precision weapons save their unit when the enemy is "danger close". Shupp orders his men only to fire in self-defense after the enemy surrenders. Indeed, another news reporter voices over video of long lines of Iraqi prisoners of war who had been forced to fight with death squads and land mines to prevent desertion.   Guy Hunter, Jr., gets tortured again after a coalition strike that scares him, and probably did more than scare his captors. Threatened with execution and blindfolded, Hunter shows no fear, and says "just do it."   Meanwhile, Beverly Clark is winning at trivia, but pauses long enough to get a soda and chat with her best friend Mary Rhoads. Beverly tells Mary she has come to peace about being deployed in a danger zone, and Mary invites Beverly to join her for fresh air, though Beverly declines. Suddenly there is a Scud alarm. Mary starts putting on chemical warfare gear, and Beverly instructs others to do the same. However, the Patriot is not successful in annihilating the Scud, and Mary watches in horror as Beverly and her comrades are hit by the incoming warhead. Another news reporter voice-over with video of the aftermath.   It is not long before the Clarks in Pennsylvania are summoned to Army Reserve headquarters, where a tactful notification of families is under way, but taking too long for the Clark parents. Beverly's mother found out what her husband, weeping in the senior officer's office, already heard from him, and despite her initial denial, she understands the truth.   Alston and Shaefer get their medals when they volunteer to kill an Iraqi suicide squad ready to detonate an ammunition dump in the way of U.S. forces in Objective Utah, western Kuwait, and overcome various dangers including land mines and trip wires. Shaefer distracts the squad with his M-16 while Alston, above the trench, tosses in a hand grenade.    The Basra-Kuwait "Highway of Death" is depicted next with more videos and voice-overs, indicating that the intent is not to destroy, but to disable the Iraqi retreat. Nevertheless, in contrast to the funeral of Beverly Clark in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of death exists on the Highway for a U.S. Army chaplain, announced by the newscaster as a rabbi, to provide appropriate Muslim rights for.     By now, Hunter has been reunited with other American POWs, including Larry Slade: when one hugs Hunter, it is evident the Iraqis broke his ribs. When the Iraqis come back, they come back with cheap perfume. Hunter challenges the captors, and enraged, one threatens to shoot him, but Hunter is not going to give them the satisfaction of showing fear this time either. He replies, "God bless America."   The U.S. troops return home to widespread jubilation, including one Linda Buckholz in her wedding gown. The celebration contrasts with Phoebe Jeter at the grave site of her grandmother.  Finally, President [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] gives an address celebrating the defeat of aggression and the restoration of Kuwait to its people.

However, just then one of the Breds is being shot, and Zack happens to be the only one on the spot with a car, so he helps Byron to rush the victim into a hospital, where he also threatens the clerk with a [[gross negligence]] lawsuit in case treatment would not be provided.  Afterwards Byron reluctantly allows Zack to stay on the playground, but he assigns him to coach a group of players he considers hopeless and derogatory refers to as the Knuckleheads. Both parties immediately dislike the other, and their cooperation does not seem to be promising at all. One of the players, Casey Caldwell was once one of the Breds himself, but was dropped due to his [[Drinking#Alcoholic beverages|drinking habit]], and is making repeated but unsuccessful attempts to regain Byron's trust.  Byron's most talented prospect is his adopted son, Truth Harrison, a college [[Junior (education)|junior]], who has a 32-point scoring average, but is also developing a [[cocaine addiction]]. Byron hopes to turn him pro before his [[Senior (education)|senior]] year, and tries to arrange a million dollar contract for him with top agent David Racine, for which he also requests Zack's [[legal counsel]].  Also present on the playground is Matthew Lockhart, another vastly talented player, who a few years before was recruited by [[UCLA]], but then quit team play entirely, and since then only plays on his own. Zack manages to gain his trust, and Matthew reveals that he was deliberately injured by Truth on their [[senior night]], when he outplayed him, and he was so disgusted of the entire system, that he decided to quit afterwards.  Zack and his team, now calling themselves as the Shooting Stars, are getting on more friendly terms, but are unsuccessful on the field. Zack repeatedly asks them to play as a team, and not as a group of individuals, but with no success, and they are suffering lopsided defeats from both the Breds and a team of ex-cons, led by pro player Luther Hakim.  Meanwhile, Truth's cocaine problems are deteriorating, and he is unable to cope with the pressure surrounding pro-life. He runs off from a meeting with media members, then later shows up high on drugs at Byron's house, forcing Zack to lead him to Matthew, whom he wants to challenge to play one-on-one, but Matthew outclasses him again. Byron and Zack make attempts to save him, but they don't succeed, and one night he overdoses cocaine, and dies. Byron and Zack try to convince Matthew to play again, but he refuses, saying that he does not want to be "the next Truth".  The story culminates in another game between the Stars and the Breds. Zack's team shows more resistance this time, but are still headed to a large scale defeat, and are still unable to play as a team. Zack desperately calls for a [[Time-out (sport)|timeout]] and begs them to play for their pride, which seems to make some effect, but soon afterwards Casey is injured and has to leave the field. As they have no reserves, the game is called off, when Matthew unexpectedly emerges from among the spectators, and joins Zack's team. The game continues, led by Matthew and with the rest of the team finally playing as a unit, the Stars are closing the gap, and ultimately winning by a long distance shot from the returning Casey.  Following the game, Matthew tells Byron that he is now ready to join UCLA. Byron changes his priorities, and decides to take care to all of his players; as a start he is sending Casey to play for the [[University of Alaska]]. He also offers a partnership to Zack, who accepts it, and together they operate the playground in the future.  
High Heels (film)
 Rebeca, a TV news broadcaster, is at Madrid's airport anxiously awaiting the return of her mother whom she has not seen since she was a child. Her mother, Becky del Páramo, a famous torch song singer, is coming back to Spain after a fifteen-year stay in Mexico. While waiting, Rebeca recalls incidents from her childhood in which her mother left her in the background of her life preoccupied with her career and her romantic life. For fifteen years Rebeca has longed for her mother to come back and for the love and affection of which she had been deprived. Nevertheless, her love is accompanied by a deep resentment.  Rebeca has since become a newsreader for a private television station owned by her husband Manuel. The reunion of mother and daughter is even tenser because Manuel was many years ago one of Becky's lovers. The night of her return, Becky, Rebeca and Manuel have supper and then go out to see Letal, a female impersonator whose drag act is based on Becky. For sometime, Rebeca has been coming to see the show whenever she misses her mother. Backstage, Rebeca helps Letal to remove his costume. Kneeling in front of him as she helps him undress, she is impressed by his manliness. Letal takes advantage of the situation and they make love. Manuel, who no longer loves his wife, wants to sleep with Becky again and divorce Rebeca.  A month later, Manuel is murdered in his villa. He had spent the evening first with his mistress Isabel, who is the sign language interpreter of Rebeca's words on the news, and then with Becky who, having become his lover again has learnt he had another mistress and had come to announce it was over between them. It was Rebeca who discovered the body. The investigating magistrate, Judge Dominguez, centers his suspicions on the mother and daughter whose relationship he knows has not recovered since Rebeca found out Becky was seeing Manuel.  On the day of Manuel's funeral, while reading the news of his death, Rebeca confesses to the murder live on television. She is immediately imprisoned, but the investigating judge seems desperate to prove her innocence despite all the evidence. Becky makes her return to the Madrid stage while Rebeca spends her first night in prison. In jail, she listens on the radio to a triumphant Madrid concert performance of her mother who dedicates her first songs to her. Paula, the social worker, takes a special interest in Rebeca; like her, she is heartbroken, grieving the loss of Hugo, her boyfriend. A nude picture of Hugo that Paula carries with her makes Rebeca think that Letal and Hugo are the same person. The judge arranges for Becky to see her daughter, and Rebeca now denies the murder of Manuel. Mother and daughter confess to each other their lack of love, their jealousy, and their secrets. Rebeca draws a comparison between herself and the daughter in the film ''Autumn Sonata'' in which the girl's mother, an outstanding pianist, asks her to play the piano and then humiliates her by telling her how to improve her performance. Rebeca suggests that she too has always felt inferior to Becky and has been forced to compete with her, winning only once by marrying Manuel. But even this victory was finally denied her, when Becky started an affair with Manuel. If Rebeca's desire to be closer to Becky led her, fifteen years ago, to murder her stepfather, it also played some part in her murder of Manuel, whom she sees as ousting in her mother's affection. The extent of Rebeca's fixation and the limitlessness of her adoration are too much for Becky's frail heart and her condition worsens. Back in prison, Rebeca discovers she is pregnant – carrying Letal's child. At once, the Judge releases her from prison but without any fresh evidence.  Rebeca goes to see Letal's final drag performance and in the dressing room discovers that he is the judge, Letal being one of the Judge's disguises and Hugo being another. He explains that his dressing up was not more than an investigative strategy and, knowing about her pregnancy, asks her to marry him. As Rebeca struggles to take this in, they see a TV broadcast relating Becky's sudden heart attack. They rush to the hospital. Rebeca confesses to her mother the murder of Manuel, and Becky decides to take the blame in order for her daughter to go free. Becky confesses to the murder and when she is taken home to die, Rebeca gives her the gun and Becky leaves her fingerprints on it, thereby incriminating herself and establishing Rebeca's innocence. When Rebeca sees the high heels of the women passing in the street, she tells her mother the sound of the heels from a distance reminds her of her mother coming home when she was little. She turns around and realizes her mother has died while she was talking.  
Highlander II: The Quickening
 In August 1994, news broadcasts announce that the [[ozone layer]] is fading, and will be completely gone in a matter of months. In Africa, millions have perished from the effects of unfiltered sunlight. Among the dead is Connor MacLeod's wife, Brenda Wyatt MacLeod. Before dying, Brenda extracts a promise from Connor that he will solve the problem of the ozone layer.  By 1999, Connor MacLeod becomes the supervisor of a scientific team headed by Dr. Allan Neyman, which attempts to create an electromagnetic shield to cover the planet, and protect it from the Sun’s radiation. The team succeeds, in effect giving Earth an artificial ozone layer. MacLeod and Neyman are proud to have saved humanity, and believe they will be remembered for a thousand years.  The shield has the side effect of condemning the planet to a state of constant night, a high average global temperature, and high humidity. By 2024, the years of darkness have caused humanity to lose hope and fall into a decline. The shield has fallen under the control of the Shield Corporation. The corporation’s current chief executive, David Blake, is focused on profit, and is imposing fees for the corporation’s services. A number of terrorist groups have begun trying to take down the Shield, among them Louise Marcus, a former employee of the Shield Corporation.  Meanwhile, MacLeod, now a frail old man, expects to eventually die of natural causes. As he watches a performance of Wagner’s ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', an image of Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez appears, and induces MacLeod to recall a forgotten event of his past. On the planet Zeist, a last meeting is held between the members of a rebellion against the rule of General Katana. The rebellion’s leader, Ramirez, chooses "a man of great destiny" from among them—MacLeod—to carry out a mission against Katana. At this moment, Katana and his troops attack, crushing the rebellion. Katana orders his men to capture Ramirez and MacLeod alive and kill the rest of the rebels. The two captives are put on trial by Zeist's priests, who sentence them to be exiled and reborn on Earth in pursuit of "The Prize." Winning the Prize gives the victor the choice to either grow old and die on Earth, or to return to Zeist. Katana is unsatisfied with their decision, but the sentence is executed, leading to the events of [[Highlander (film)|the original 1986 film]].  Back in 2024, Louise Marcus discovers that the ozone layer has in fact restored itself naturally, which means that the shield is no longer needed. The Shield Corporation is aware of this development, but has chosen to hide it from the general public in order to maintain its main source of profit. Meanwhile, on Zeist, Katana decides that MacLeod cannot be allowed to return, and sends his immortal henchmen, Corda and Reno, to kill him.  Marcus manages to reach MacLeod first, and asks for his help in taking down the Shield. To her disappointment, she finds the passionate person she once admired has grown into a tired old man. MacLeod explains to her that he is dying and expresses his disapproval of terrorism. Before they can finish their conversation, Corda and Reno attack. MacLeod manages to decapitate them both, absorbs their energy during [[Quickening (Highlander)|the Quickening]], and regains his youthful appearance. In the process, MacLeod summons Ramirez back to life.  In [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]] - the location of his death in the first ''Highlander'' film - Ramirez is revived. He finds himself on a theatrical stage during a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''. Meanwhile, MacLeod has found a new lover in Marcus. He attempts unsuccessfully to explain to her the concepts of his immortality. Elsewhere, General Katana arrives in New York, the scene of The Gathering and begins wreaking havoc.  Both Ramirez and Katana soon adapt to their new environment. Ramirez’s earring is valuable enough to pay both for a new suit he acquires from the finest and oldest tailor’s shop in Scotland, and for an airplane ticket to New York City. Katana finds New York much to his liking. After entertaining himself for a while, Katana encounters MacLeod at a church. Since immortals are forbidden from fighting on holy ground, they do not fight each other, but MacLeod expresses rage at being immortal once again.  Soon thereafter, MacLeod is contacted by Ramirez, who joins them in their plan to take down the Shield. Katana, expecting this, forges an uneasy alliance with David Blake, who mentions that shutting down the planetary shield would require so much energy that the planet would be destroyed. The conflict between the two sets of allies eventually leads to the deaths of Dr. Allan Neyman, Ramirez, Blake and General Katana himself. MacLeod succeeds in taking down the Shield by using the combined energies of his final Quickening from General Katana. Marcus sees the stars for the first time in her life. MacLeod then claims The Prize by returning to Zeist with Marcus.  
High Strung (1991 film)
 The film centers around Thane Furrows, who spends the day messing around his apartment and complaining about a number of random subjects like (among other things) flies, popsicles, junk mail, his boss' wife, his upstairs neighbor, smoking, salesmen, and philosophizes on a number of things such as the morality of [[cannibalism|eating humans]] and the sensibility of keeping [[pet]]s.  Furrows has a number of strange philosophies: he wishes his [[children's books]] to be instructive for the good of society, such as "How to Start the Family Car" (in case "someone chokes on a chicken bone" and "there are no adults around"), and "Bye Bye Grandma" which he wants to help accustom children to death. He refuses to keep pets because he feels they would "turn on you" in a food shortage, choosing instead to keep a cardboard cutout of a dog named Pete.  A number of minor annoyances also perturb him throughout the day: a fly lands on his cereal at breakfast, which he inadvertently eats; an insurance salesman named Ray comes to the door, to which Furrows responds by feigning interest and, shortly after promising to take out a number of policies, slams the door in Ray's face with the words "I'd rather be dead"; an automated survey about [[carpet cleaning]] calls him repeatedly; his boss' wife comes by to pick up a book he was writing, and he (eventually) tells her off. After the fly incident, Furrows suffers from a number of scares. When closing his eyes, he repeatedly sees a menacing face. He receives numerous messages from phone and mail about "eight o'clock".  Furrows' only friend appears to be a man named Al, who comes by in the afternoon for a visit. They eat cereal and Al tries to dissuade Thane of his [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]]. While Thane attacks the [[optimism]] of people like Al, he seems comforted by Al's sympathy over the visit of Melanie, the boss' wife. Later that night, Furrows loses an arm wrestling match to the noisy neighbour upstairs, thereby giving him the right to play metal as loud as he wants whenever he wants. After a day of "messing around", Furrows receives a knock at the door at the dreaded "eight o'clock" and is greeted by a limo driver. When he steps into the limo, the driver (Jim Carrey) turns around and reveals himself to be [[Death (personification)|Death]].  Death tells Furrows that he has met his quota of saying "I wish I were dead" and must die, and Furrows complains about the stupidity of the rule until Death, unable to scare Furrows into line, puts him back into his body. Furrows awakes with frightened Al standing over him, trying to wake him. The story ends with the two going out to a restaurant, though Furrows' insistence that they serve him cereal suggesting the lessons of the past day were lost on him.  After the credits, a short [[epilogue]] involves Death stopping the limo in a dark space and looking at the heavens. He claims that he just couldn't stand Thane and had to return him to life. He adds that he isn't ever coming back for Thane, implying that Thane may have just accidentally become [[immortality|immortal]].  
The Hitman
 Seattle cop Cliff Garret ([[Chuck Norris]]) is severely wounded in a drug bust gone bad—shot by his corrupt partner Ronny “Del” Delany ([[Michael Parks]]).  Garret dies momentarily in the emergency room, but is revived with a defibrillator. His police supervisor has the hospital conceal his survival, and Garret is given a new identity. Garret becomes hit man Danny Grogan, and he infiltrates the organization of mob boss mafioso Marco Luganni ([[Al Waxman]]).  The plan is for Grogan to bring together Luganni and his rival, [[French Canadian]] mafioso boss André LaCombe (Marcel Sabourin), so they can both be taken down together. After two years of working the plan, a gang of Iranian drug dealers looking to muscle in on everyone's territories suddenly enter the picture when they make a hit on one of Luganni's teams just as they finished making a hit on a team of LaCombe's money carriers.  Grogan plays all parties against one another while befriending a fatherless boy named Tim Murphy ([[Salim Grant]]), who lives in the apartment down the hall and is being bullied by a racist white kid in the neighborhood.  Tim's mother works three jobs, so he begins spending time with Grogan. Grogan teaches Tim how to fight after seeing him bullied on the street one day. When Tim stands up to the white kid, he gets the best of him, then watches as the white kid is dragged off by his father and beaten for losing the fight.  Grogan walks across the street, punches the father in the nose through a screen door, so hard that it knocks the father to the ground, then Grogan walks away.  Grogan’s past returns to haunt him in the person of Ronny Delany, who is secretly working with Luganni. Delany recognizes Grogan as Garret, and ties Tim to a chair loaded with explosives in a bid to force Grogan to cooperate. Delany sets off the chair bomb, but Grogan is unharmed and Tim survives.  Grogan turns the tables on them all. At a meeting to set terms of an alliance, Delany has Luganni's men kill LaCombe and his men. Then the Iranians and Delany kill Luganni, but Grogan arrives on the scene and kills all of them. In the end, Grogan blows up Delany while tied to a chair hanging outside a window, in retribution for what he did to Tim.

They fly to [[London]] to visit Moira's grandmother, [[Wendy Darling]]. Wendy is ostensibly the true creator of the [[Peter Pan]] stories, with [[J. M. Barrie]], her childhood neighbor, merely having transcribed the tales. During their stay, Peter angrily yells at the children while their playing disturbs his important call, leading to an audacious argument with Moira, who throws his cellphone out of the window.  Peter, Moira and Wendy go out to a charity dinner honoring Wendy's long life of charitable service to orphans. Upon their return, they discover the house has been ransacked and the children have been abducted. A cryptic ransom note, signed [[Captain Hook|Captain James Hook]], has been pinned to the playroom door with a dagger. Wendy confesses to Peter that the stories of Peter Pan are true and that Peter himself is Pan, having lost all of his childhood memories when he fell in love with Moira. In disbelief, he gets drunk up in the playroom, but [[Tinker Bell]] appears and takes him to [[Neverland]] to rescue his children from Hook.  Hook and his [[pirates]] confront Peter but become depressed when they realize he does not remember his former life and identity. Tinker Bell makes a deal with Hook that Peter will regain his memories in three days for a climactic battle. He is reacquainted with the [[Mermaid]]s and meets the new generation of [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], led by Rufio, who refuses to believe that he is the real Peter Pan. They help him train, and in the process he regains his imagination and lost youth. One of them, Thud Butt, gives him  [[marbles]] that were left behind by [[Tootles]], who is now an old man living with Wendy. Elsewhere, [[Mr. Smee|Smee]] talks Hook into manipulating Jack and Maggie into loving him to break Peter's will. While Maggie refuses to be taken in, Jack comes to view Hook as a father figure.  Hook arranges a makeshift baseball game for Jack, which Peter watches as Hook treats Jack like his own son. Horrified, Peter runs off and tries to fly, but is led to the old treehouse of the Lost Boys by his own shadow.

He flies up into the sky, returning as Peter Pan, and Rufio surrenders his sword and leadership back to him.

On the third day, he and the Lost Boys attack the pirates as promised, leading to a lengthy battle. He rescues Maggie and promises to be a better father to both her and Jack. Rufio fights a duel with Hook but is mortally wounded and dies in Peter's arms.  Peter and Hook duel, leading to Peter's victory. Refusing to leave honorably, Hook attacks Peter one last time, but the stuffed [[crocodile]], whom Hook once feared, springs to life and his mouth falls on top of him, eating Hook. Peter gives his sword to Thud Butt, promoting him the new leader of the Lost Boys, and leaves Neverland for good. He awakens in [[Kensington Gardens]], meeting a sweeper who bears a strong resemblance to Smee and bidding farewell to a tearful Tinker Bell. He climbs up the drain pipe of Wendy's house, reuniting and reconciling with his family and returning Tootles' marbles to him. Tootles discovers the bag contains [[pixie dust]], and he flies out the window to return to Neverland. Wendy wonders if Peter's adventures are over, but he replies, “To live would be an awfully big adventure” as we see Tootles fly off before the screen fades.  
Hot Shots!
 The film begins at Flemner Air Base 20 years in the past. A pilot named Leland "Buzz" Harley ([[Bill Irwin]]) loses control of his plane and ejects, leaving his co-pilot Dominic "Mailman" Farnum ([[Ryan Stiles]]) to crash alone; although Mailman survives, he's mistaken for a deer owing to the branches stuck to his helmet and is shot by a hunter. Topper Harley ([[Charlie Sheen]]) wakes up from a nightmare he's having about the event when Lt. Commander Block ([[Kevin Dunn]]) asks him to return to active duty as a pilot in the [[U.S. Navy]], to help on a new top secret mission: Operation Sleepy Weasel, commanded by the incompetent and oblivious [[Admiral]] Benson ([[Lloyd Bridges]]). Harley starts to show some psychological problems, especially when his father is mentioned. His therapist, Ramada ([[Valeria Golino]]), tries to keep Topper from flying, but she relents, and also starts to build a budding romance with Topper. Meanwhile, Topper gets into a rivalry with another fighter pilot, Kent Gregory ([[Cary Elwes]]), a former lover of Ramada and son of "Mailman" Farnum who blames Buzz Harley for his father's death, and believes Topper cannot handle combat pressure.  Meanwhile, Block starts privately meeting with an airplane tycoon, Mr. Wilson, who has recently built a new "Super Fighter" that will make the American pilots superior. Block reveals that he brought back Topper for the reason of making Sleepy Weasel fail. Block would then report that it was the Navy's planes that were the real reason for the mission failure and that they need to be replaced with Wilson's planes. During one of the last training missions, an accident between Pete "Dead Meat" Thompson ([[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]]) and Jim "Wash-Out" Pfaffenbach ([[Jon Cryer]]) leaves Dead Meat dead and Wash Out reassigned to radar operator. Block believes this is enough to convince the Navy to buy new fighters, but Wilson calls it a "minor incident", saying the planes need to fail in combat.  Meanwhile, Topper starts to show more feelings for Ramada, but she is conflicted by her past with Gregory. On the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] U.S.S. ''Essess'', Benson reveals the mission to be an attack of an Iraqi nuclear plant and Block assigns Topper to lead the mission, much to Gregory's chagrin. Wilson, who is also on board, coerces a crew member to sabotage the planes, putting the pilots' lives at risk. Block mentions Buzz Harley to Topper, who becomes overcome with emotion and unable to lead the mission. Block just starts to call out for the mission to be aborted when Iraqi fighters attack the squadron. All the planes' weapons fail and Block realizes what has happened. He then tells Topper that he saw what really happened with Buzz and Mailman, that Buzz tried to do everything possible to save Mailman, but ended up falling out of the plane, failing in his attempts. Inspired, Topper single-handedly beats the Iraqi fighters and bombs the nuclear plant. Back aboard ship, Wilson's plan is revealed and his standing with the military is lost. Back in port, Gregory accepts Topper as a great pilot and lets Ramada be with Topper.    The end credits show Dead Meat and Buzz Harley in spirit with Dead Meat saluting and Buzz giving a thumbs up.

En route to nab an accomplice of Randolph, Gold and his partner Tim Sullivan happen upon a murder scene: the elderly [[Jewish]] owner of a candy store in a ghetto has been gunned down, reportedly for a fortune hidden in her basement. The deceased woman's son, a doctor, uses his clout to have Gold assigned to the case in the belief that Gold, himself Jewish, might be empathetic to his plight.

Hudson Hawk
 Eddie "Hudson Hawk" Hawkins ([[Bruce Willis]])—"Hudson Hawk" is a nickname for the bracing winds off the [[Hudson River]]—is a master catburglar and [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]], attempting to celebrate his first day of parole from prison with a cappuccino. Before he can get it, he is [[blackmail]]ed by various entities, including his own parole officer, a minor [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] family headed by the Mario Brothers, and the [[CIA]] into doing several dangerous art heists with his singing partner in crime, Tommy "Five-Tone" Messina ([[Danny Aiello]]).  The holders of the puppet strings turn out to be a "psychotic American corporation", Mayflower Industries, run by husband and wife Darwin ([[Richard E. Grant]]) and Minerva Mayflower ([[Sandra Bernhard]]) and their blade-slinging butler, Alfred ([[Donald Burton]]). The company, headquartered in the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]], seeks to take over the world by reconstructing ''La Macchina dell'Oro'', a machine purportedly invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (Stefano Molinari) that [[alchemy|converts lead into gold]]. A special assembly of [[crystal]]s needed for the machine to function are hidden in a variety of Leonardo's artworks: the [[maquette]] of the [[Sforza]], the [[Codex Trivulzianus|Da Vinci Codex]], and a scale model of DaVinci's helicopter design. Sister Anna Baragli ([[Andie MacDowell]]) is an operative for a secretive [[Holy See|Vatican]] [[counter-espionage]] agency, which has arranged with the CIA to assist in the Roman portion of Hawk's mission, though apparently intending all along to foil the robbery at [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  Throughout the adventure, Hudson is foiled in attempts to drink a cappuccino. After blowing up an auctioneer to cover up the theft of the Sforza, the Mario Bros. take Hawk away in an ambulance. Hawk sticks syringes into Antony Mario's face and falls out of the ambulance on a gurney, and the Marios try to run him down with the ambulance as his gurney speeds along the highway.  The brothers are killed when their driver, startled by the array of syringes in Antony's face, crashes the ambulance. Immediately afterwards, Hawk meets [[CIA]] head George Kaplan ([[James Coburn]]) and his CIA agents–Snickers ([[Don Patrick Harvey|Don Harvey]]), Kit Kat ([[David Caruso]]), Almond Joy ([[Lorraine Toussaint]]), and Butterfinger ([[Andrew Bryniarski]])–who take him to Darwin and Minerva Mayflower. Hawk successfully steals the Da Vinci Codex from another museum, but later refuses to steal the helicopter design. Tommy Five-Tone fakes his death so they can escape. They are discovered and attacked by the CIA Agents, and Kaplan reveals that he and his agents stole the piece, and unlike Tommy and Hudson, had no problem killing the guards. Hawk and Tommy escape when Snickers and Almond Joy are killed -Snickers by a misfired explosive, Almond Joy in the ensuing blast after being incapacitated by a backfired paralysis dart- and pursue the remaining agents. Kit Kat and Butterfinger take Anna to the castle where the ''Macchina dell'Oro'' is being reconstructed.  A showdown takes place at the castle between the remaining CIA agents, the Mayflowers, and the team of Hudson, Five-Tone, and Baragli. Kit Kat and Butterfinger are betrayed and killed by Minerva, although Kit Kat frees Baragli before he dies. Tommy fights Darwin and Alfred inside Darwin's speeding limo, and Hudson fights George Kaplan on the roof of the castle.  Kaplan topples from the castle and lands of the roof of the limo. Alfred plants a bomb in the limo and escapes with Darwin; Tommy is trapped inside and Kaplan is hanging onto the hood.  The bomb detonates as the limo speeds over a cliff. Darwin and Minerva force Hawk to put together the crystal powering the machine, but Hawk intentionally leaves out one small piece. When the Mayflowers activate the machine, it malfunctions and explodes, killing Minerva and Darwin. Hawk battles Alfred, using Alfred's own blades to decapitate him. Hawk and Baragli escape the castle using a da Vinci flying machine and discover Tommy waiting for them at a cafe, having miraculously escaped death through an improbable combination of airbags and a sprinkler system in the limo. Hawk finally gets to enjoy a cappuccino.

Impromptu (1991 film)
 Since getting divorced, Baroness Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin, previously Baroness Dudevant, the successful and notorious writer of sensational romance novels now living under the pseudonym [[George Sand]], in Paris, has been in the habit of dressing like a man. In her romantic pursuit of the sensitive Chopin, whose music she fell in love with before seeing him in person, George/Aurora is advised that she must act like a man pursuing a woman, though she is also advised to avoid damaging his health by not pursuing him at all. With this advice Sand is deterred by a fellow countrywoman who pretends to be smitten with [[Chopin]], the mistress of [[Franz Liszt]], the Countess [[Marie d'Agoult]]. Whether the Countess is really in love with Chopin is unlikely; she seeks only to prevent a relationship between Chopin and Sand.  Sand meets Chopin in the French countryside at the house of the Duchess d'Antan, a foolish aspiring socialite who invites artists from Paris to her salon in order to feel cosmopolitan. Sand invites herself, not knowing that several of her former lovers are also in attendance. A small play is written by [[Alfred de Musset]] satirizing the aristocracy, Chopin protests at his lack of manners, de Musset bellows and a fireplace explosion ensues.  Chopin is briefly swayed by a beautifully written love letter ostensibly from d'Agoult, a letter actually written by, and stolen from, Sand. Eventually Sand wins over Chopin when she proves that she wrote the letter, reciting its words to him passionately, and after buying a copy of her memoir he finds the text of the letter in the book.  Chopin is then challenged to a duel by one of Sand's ex-lovers. He faints during the face-off. Sand finishes the duel for him and nurses him back to health in the countryside, solidifying their relationship.  Near the end of the movie, Sand and Chopin dedicate a volume of music to the countess, although this only suggests that she has had an affair with Chopin, causing a falling-out with her lover Liszt. Sand and Chopin depart for [[Majorca]], relieved to escape the competitive nature of artistic alliances and jealousies in Paris.

 Quartermaster's Mate Leslie Harmon is awaiting a court martial when he is brought to Commodore [[Joseph Smith (admiral)|Joseph Smith]] (E.G. Marshall) and his son [[Joseph B. Smith|Lt. Joseph B. Smith, Jr.]] (Kevin O'Rourke). He deliberately interfered with the militarily necessary demolition of the dry dock at Hampton Roads Naval Base to prevent collateral damage and civilian casualties, as Confederates overran the base.  Harmon is introduced to Miss Betty Stuart, a Virginia belle educated in [[Baltimore]] who wishes to help Harmon spy on the C.S. Navy at Gosport on the raised and refitted ''Merrimack'', now the ironclad ''Virginia''.  Once in the South, Harmon encounters many key naval officers and learns that the armor test on 3" of iron plate is staged to offer misinformation to any Union spies...like him.  In reality, the ''Virginia'' brags 4" of armor and cannot be pierced by any Union guns.  Harmon and Betty realize that this information must make it to Washington D.C. to improve firepower to sink the ''Virginia''.  However, upon learning that her childhood friend [[Catesby Jones|Lt. Catesby ap Roger Jones]] had been reassigned as the second-in-command of the CSS ''Virginia'' and is now in danger of death to the very intelligence she intended to send North, Betty has a change of heart when she realizes her actions opposed her fellow Virginians and C.S. sailors.  She tries to stop Harmon from going north with the intelligence, but he goes anyway.  At the launch of the ''Virginia'', she confesses to her now-fiance Lt. Jones that she had helped Leslie Harmon infiltrate the shipyard and spy for the Union.  She tells him of Union gun power and their most likely upgrades--upgrades made on her advice--and now advises him on adding armor to counter the improved Union firepower.  He is stunned and distraught at her betrayal, yet sails to war without turning her in as one final act of love for his traitorous fiancee.  The ''Virginia'' sails off to break the Union blockade at Hampton Roads. Betty is promptly arrested by Lt. Guilford (Philip Casnoff) on suspicion of espionage.  The ''Virginia'' first approaches the [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']] as her skipper, Lt. Smith, rallies his men on board to do their duty.  Captain [[Franklin Buchanan]] (Leon B. Stevens) of the ''Virginia'' rallies his men similarly. The ''Congress'' fires a full broadside into the ''Virginia'' to no effect.  In the ensuing action, the ''Virginia'' bypasses the ''Congress'', promptly sinks the [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']], and returns to sink the ''Congress''.  When the ''Congress'' is destroyed and sunk, Lt. Smith is killed.  That same night, Lt. Guilford interrogates Betty who denies being a spy based on the captured letter to her from Lt. Smith.  She is informed then of Smith's death aboard the ''Congress''.  When informed that her fate is the gallows if she does not cooperate, she hopes for the courtesy and respect shown an executed spy the day before (whose hanging she witnessed).  Lt. Guilford rebuffs her, showing his contempt for her treason when compared to the bravery of the hanged soldier who was honorably fighting for his side.  The ''Monitor'' sails in between the burning ''Congress'' and the ''Virginia'' to protect the [[USS Minnesota (1855)|USS ''Minnesota'']], which has run aground and is defenseless until high tide returns the next day. Only the low tide has prevented ''Virginia'' from finishing off the ''Minnesota'' immediately. Captain Van Brunt (Joel Abel)<ref>[http://www.wtj.com/archives/acwnavies/unavy02.htm Civil War Navy Dispatches]</ref> offered instructions and Leslie Harmon to Captain [[John L. Worden|John Worden]] (Andy Park) of the ''Monitor''. Worden makes Harmon, familiar with Hampton Roads and the CSS ''Virginia'', midshipman on the spot.  The morning of the second day of battle, Lt. [[Catesby Jones]] (now in command of the CSS Virginia following the wounding of Captain [[Franklin Buchanan]] the day before) introduces his crew to the ''Monitor'' between them and the ''Minnesota''. Worden does his best to engage ''Virginia'' as far from the ''Minnesota'' as he can. ''Virginia''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first shot demonstrates that ''Monitor''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s armor will hold. ''Virginia'' "steers worse than Noah's Ark", Lt. Simms (J. Michael Hunter) informs Catesby that ''Virginia'' is leaking at the bow, Harmon tells Worden it would take ''Virginia'' 30 minutes to turn, and later adds that ''Virginia'' would be grounded in shallow water. It is grounded temporarily, but backs off.  The ships ram each other and the Union ''Monitor'' withdraws, having delayed the ''Virginia'' from sinking the ''Minnesota'' and low tide forcing her back to port.  Both sides claimed victory, but the ''Monitor'' denied Confederate access to the ocean. John Ericsson (Fritz Weaver) has an argument with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles (Conrad McLaren) over the use of insufficient powder in ''Monitor''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s guns to sink the ''Virginia'': Welles responds it was a calculated decision to save the lives of the crew.  Back at Gosport, Lt. Guilford is pleased to release Betty, informing her that she saved the ''Virginia'' based on a report by Lt. Jones.  Demonstrating Southern chivalry, he was pleased to not have to hang her.  In reality, Lt. Jones used Betty's confession the day before to send false intelligence to the Union, which resulted in the lesser powder charges used by the ''Monitor''.  Lt. Jones tells Betty that he couldn't bear to see her hang, but that he can never be with her again due to her treasonous actions.  She is sent north, forever marked as a traitor to her family, friends, and fellow Virginians.  A voice over indicates that the ''Virginia'' was scuttled later that year after Union troops took Norfolk, and that the ''Monitor'' sank off Cape Hatteras later that year as well.

Anthony is convinced by the hospital chaplain head doctor Philips ([[V. Gopalakrishnan (actor)|V. Gopalakrsihnan]]) to secretly adopt an orphan whose mother dies at the same time. Anthony agrees, but does not reveal to his wife that the child is not theirs. They name the child as Damien Anthony. Soon after, Anthony is appointed [[Tamil Nadu Chief Minister]]'s [[private secretary]]. When Damien reaches the age of five, Anthony is transferred to [[Madras]]. Mysterious events plague the Anthonys: large black dogs congregate near the Anthony home; Damien's nanny publicly hangs herself at his 5th birthday party; a new nanny Mrs. Elizabeth (Indradevi) arrives unannounced to replace her; the five-year-old Damien violently resists entering a church; and zoo animals are terrified of Damien.

JFK (film)
 The film opens with newsreel footage, including the [[Eisenhower's farewell address|farewell address]] in 1961 of outgoing President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], warning about the build-up of the "[[military-industrial complex]]". This is followed by a summary of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s years as president, emphasizing the events that, in Stone's thesis, would lead to his assassination. This builds to a reconstruction of the assassination on November 22, 1963. [[New Orleans]] [[District Attorney]] Jim Garrison subsequently learns about potential links to the assassination in New Orleans. Garrison and his team investigate several possible conspirators, including private pilot [[David Ferrie]], but are forced to let them go after their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government. Kennedy's suspected assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] is killed by [[Jack Ruby]], and Garrison closes the investigation.  The investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the [[Warren Report]] and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. Garrison and his staff interrogate several witnesses to the Kennedy assassination, and others involved with Oswald, Ruby, and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O'Keefe, a male prostitute serving five years in prison for [[soliciting]], who reveals he witnessed Ferrie discussing a coup d'état. As well as briefly meeting Oswald, O'Keefe was romantically involved with a man called "Clay Bertrand". [[Jean Hill]], a teacher who says she witnessed shots fired from the grassy knoll, tells the investigators that [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] threatened her into saying three shots came from the book depository, revealing changes that were made to her testimony by the [[Warren Commission]]. Garrison's staff also test the [[single bullet theory]] by aiming an empty rifle from the window through which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy. They conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, indicating someone else, or multiple marksmen, were involved.  In 1968, Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as "X". He suggests a conspiracy at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the [[CIA]], the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], the [[military-industrial complex]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[FBI]], and Kennedy's vice-president and then president [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] as either co-conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. X explains that the President was killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the [[Vietnam War]] and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute New Orleans-based international businessman [[Clay Shaw]] for his alleged involvement. When Shaw is interrogated, the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald, but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President.  Some of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his [[homosexuality]]. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.  The [[trial of Clay Shaw]] takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the [[single bullet theory]], and proposes a [[Dealey Plaza]] shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer [[J. D. Tippit]], but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw died of lung cancer in 1974, but in 1979, [[Richard Helms]] testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.  
Johnny Stecchino
  After unsuccessfully hitting on his co-worker and other women at a soiree, Dante ([[Roberto Benigni]]) meets Maria after she nearly runs him over with her car. Maria is taken aback by Dante's striking resemblance to her husband Johnny Stecchino, an Italian mobster wanted by the [[Sicilian Mafia]] for killing head mobster Cozzamara's wife and despised by the locals of [[Palermo]] for [[treason]].  During the day, Dante works in [[Cesena]] as a bus driver for students with [[down syndrome]], defrauds the government into receiving disability payments for a faked disability, and steals bananas from greengrocers. Dante's best friend is Lillo, a student with down syndrome and [[diabetes]], who he has to constantly deter from eating sweets.  Dante runs into Maria again, this time near his apartment, who unbeknownst to him, has tracked him down in a plan to turn him over to the Sicilian mafia so they can kill Dante, thinking that he is Stecchino. Maria begins to make Dante's appearance more identical to Stecchino, by dressing him in a similar suit and tie, placing a faux mole on his face and convincing him to have a toothpick in his mouth at all time ('stecchino' is the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for toothpick). Maria then begins to call him 'Johnny' or Johnny Stecchino. She later invites Dante to join her in her residence in Palermo where she will begin to plan his murder so she and the real Johnny Stecchino can escape to South America.  Upon arriving at the train station, Dante meets Maria's 'uncle', a [[cocaine]] addict who convinces Dante into believing the drug is a cure for diabetes. While attempting to steal a banana from local greengrocer Nicola Travaglia, Dante gets spotted and confused for Stecchino by mobsters, who begin to shoot at him as he attempts to steal a banana. He manages to dodge a hailstorm of bullets and quickly runs to the police station where he relates his understanding of the incident to the police chief of having stolen a banana and thinking the greengrocer in turn had security guards attempt to shoot him for theft. The chief, bewildered by the story, goes along with the story and informs him that he has indeed committed a serious crime but by confessing and turning in the banana as evidence, he will be forgiven for his offense. After leaving the police station, he runs into Judge Cataratta who mistakens Dante for Stecchino and questions his motives in confessing to the police and turning over any evidence. Cataratta advises him to forcefully take back his evidence and demand that the chief prints his story on the front page of newspapers denouncing his confession to the police. Maria finds Dante and returns him to her residence immediately, though surprised to find him strolling through the streets unharmed. Stecchino's belief that Dante bears no resemblance to him is only reinforced upon hearing that Dante spent the morning in Palermo going unnoticed by locals.  As a final attempt to determine whether the public will mistake him for Stecchino, Maria takes Dante to an opera. Upon arriving at the opera house, Dante sees fruit sold at a concession stand. The vendor says he can simply take a banana, but Dante tries to pay, fearful of the earlier uproar. While waiting for the show to commence, the crowd immediately interrupts the show and begins to jeer Dante, thinking he is Stecchino, which Dante confuses as a public reprimand for not paying for the banana. When the crowd begins to shame Maria as an accomplice, Dante shouts down all the hecklers to respect her honor. Dante is escorted by the police to a private party where he meets a politician, an accomplice of Stecchino, who informs will protect him if they keep their meeting a secret. As a gift, he gives Dante a bag of cocaine. Maria meets up with Dante and both retreat back to her residence. The next day, Maria meets Cozzamara to plan the assassination of Johnny Stecchino.  On the day of the planned hit, Maria learns of Stecchino's plan to kill her 'uncle' after Dante has been killed, upsetting news to Maria. Maria drops off Dante at a barbershop owned by Cozzamara. Cozzamara's men begin to suspect Dante is not Stecchino when they notice a faux facial mole, and they ask him about his mother, to which Dante replies "she is okay" a question which would have upset Stecchino (his mother is deceased and he gets very angry when someone discusses her).  Maria ends up setting up Stecchino by kissing him at a gas station, an act which he despises, and he in turn goes to use the men's room to wash his face. While using one of the urinals, several armed Sicilian mobsters come out of the stalls to seal his doom. Stecchino realizes Maria's plot and reluctantly accepts his fate, seeing it as a chance to end his miserable life. Meanwhile, the other mobsters are laughing uproariously at Dante's jokes and proceed to sing a song that had earlier been sung by the student on Dante's school bus.  Maria drives Dante back to his apartment, now referring to his proper name of Dante, and telling him she'll be back to see him someday. Maria walks away a free woman and satisfied that she has done the right thing. Dante meets with Lillo outside of his apartment, relating to him his time in Palermo, and of the experience as wacky customs of the locals. The film ends with Lillo running rampantly after sniffing a bag of [[cocaine]], Dante's "gift" to Lillo, which he has been convinced is proper medicine for [[diabetes]].

Kickboxer 2
 One year after the events of the first film, it is revealed that kickboxing brothers Kurt and Eric Sloane have been killed by Tong Po in Thailand.  David Sloane (Mitchell), the last surviving brother, struggles to keep the family's Los Angeles [[kickboxing]] gym afloat. He offers free kickboxing lessons to local kids, often demonstrating a technique he calls the "rock and the river" which allows him to defend against attacks while blindfolded.  Although his will to compete has waned since the loss of his brothers, financial problems eventually force Sloane to fight again in a new organization run by a crooked promoter. His surprising comeback ultimately attracts the attention of Po (Qissi) who, having been defeated by Kurt, seeks to defeat David in the ring and regain his honor. But when Sloane announces his retirement after the bout, Po's manager Sangha (Tagawa) hires a group of thugs to burn down the gym, injuring Sloane and killing one of his young students.  While recovering in the hospital, Sloane is visited by Xian Chow (Chan), who trained his brother Kurt in [[Thailand]]. Though David initially wants nothing to do with him, he finally relents and allows Xian to nurse him back to health. Meanwhile, one of Sloane's most promising students, Brian Wagner, has secured a championship bout and invites Sloane to watch the fight. However, the champion is unexpectedly replaced by Po, who brutalizes the young man and kills him in the ring despite Sloane's efforts to talk the young fighter down. Now with no other recourse, Sloane is forced to accept Po's challenge. In a bloody bout reminiscent of the "ancient way" of fighting in Thailand, Sloane is beaten badly and has clouded vision. Utilizing his "rock and the river" technique, however, David ultimately exacts his revenge and defeats his rival. Having lost his honor, Sangha confronts David in the ring at gunpoint, but thanks to a distraction by his friend Jack, David is able to disarm and incapacitate him.  The next day, David unsuccessfully teaches Xian to drive a car.

Khomeini's Boys
 The film opens with a queue of armed boys who have joined the Islamic Bassidj boarding a bus to take them to the battlefront of the Iran–Iraq War. Passing nearby are the film's main protagonists, Hassan and Iraj, two [[high school]] boys whose friendship is slowly starting to deteriorate, although they do not yet know it, due to the conflict between their opposing viewpoints in the purpose of the war: Iraj is in the Bassidj, while Hassan is reluctant to join, since his older brother, Abbas, is already fighting on the front. Iraj tries to strong-arm Hassan into joining: according to the film, official policy is to reward the families of the children lost in the war with items such as free fridges and supermarket coupons. Also, children in the Bassidj are to be given special privileges at school, such as higher marks and immunity from punishments: Iraj demonstrates this at one point in class when the teacher is about to fail him for not doing his homework, as he blackmails the teacher into passing him in exchange not going to the Islam office to complain.  The film also takes some liberties with government policy: it is obligatory for children to report [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] to the [[Islam]] office so that the counter-revolutionaries can be exterminated by the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]]. It is also now obligatory for children to join the Bassidj, or they and their families will suffer the consequences. To prove this, the P.E. teacher at school shows the students two dead bodies: one of a child who died in battle and whose body is clean and whose spirit "in Heaven"; and the other of a dirty, open-eyed child who was executed for refusing to join the Bassidj and is now suffering "in Hell".  Hassan fills his parents in on this, who are reluctant to let him join, since Abbas has already joined.  Later, however, Abbas turns up at home on sick leave after his arm is injured by [[shrapnel shell]]. After enjoying a happy reunion with his brother, Hassan begins to tell Abbas about his intentions to join the Bassidj. Abbas opposes this, and tells Hassan that the whole war is pointless and stupid, along with all the preachings the [[Muslim]]s give about going to Heaven with "special keys" if they fight on the front, and also reveals the true terror of the battle. Hassan changes his mind, and Abbas reveals his intention to flee from Iran with the help of some smugglers who will take him to [[Turkey]], from where he will flee to [[Europe]] for a better future.  At school, Hassan and Iraj get into an argument about the war, and Hassan lets slip that Abbas told him what he believes. Iraj severs his ties with Hassan, but secretly reports Abbas to the Islamic Office. That night, the Revolutionary Guard turn up at Hassan's house to execute Abbas, but Abbas and Hassan's father sees them from outside, and orders Abbas to hide. Abbas narrowly escapes to a nearby garage unharmed. The next day, with the Guards waiting outside their house for Abbas' return, Abbas sends a note to Hassan, instructing him to bring him anything valuable until the smugglers arrive. Hassan does so with his family's help, and meets Abbas in a deserted piece of land. The smugglers arrive, and Abbas leaves with them, bidding his brother farewell until Khomeini is overthrown, and instructing him not to join the Bassidj no matter what.  Hassan confronts Iraj at school, but does not reveal that Abbas has left the country. Iraj insists that he did it to spare Hassan from any trouble. Later that day, after school, Iraj and the Revolutionary Guard arrive at Hassan's house, prepared to execute them all for aiding Abbas in escaping from Iran. Hassan offers to join the Bassidj in return for his family's safety, and Iraj accepts.  The film ends with Hassan and Iraj boarding a bus with another group of Bassidj soldiers, ready to go somewhere they will never return from.

After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in [[Las Vegas]], Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandfather, the first Duke of Warren, had an affair with a hotel waitress while visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph the ring that was bequeathed by his grandmother.  Ralph is flown to [[London]], where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a [[strip club]] and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the [[House of Stuart]], of which he is patriarch. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII]], Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her affair with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.  Despite Ralph's reluctance to accept British culture and his ineptness in formal affairs, he makes a positive impression on King Mulambon  of [[Zambezi]] during the latter's [[state visit]]. The two monarchs share their concerns about the role of leadership they have assumed and the economic interests of their nations. Ralph accumulates a small but loyal following.  Ralph's staff arrange for him to marry Princess Anna of [[Finland]] to continue the royal bloodline and guarantee jobs for the UK in Finland's newly discovered oil reserves in the [[Baltic Sea]]. On the night of the Finnish Royal Family's visit, Ralph is turned off by Princess Anna's unusually deep voice and her desire to marry just for royalty. Miranda attends the royal ball as a set-up by Graves and photos of her affair with Ralph are given to King Gustav, which, along with Ralph's wild musical number, results in Finland turning down the UK in favor of Japan for the offshore equipment contract. Having failed to realize that the role of King comes with certain expectations, and that he cannot rely on his charm or blue-collar background, Ralph accepts a stern rebuke from Cedric and endeavors to set things right. Miranda confesses to Ralph her role in the scandal before he walks out on her. Ralph develops suspicions about his circumstances, and learns through Phipps that Cedric is another heir to the throne and had refused the role.  Ralph addresses [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], apologizing for his recent actions and informing the country that he has worked out a deal with King Mulambon for Zambezi to purchase £200 million worth of British mining equipment and to open three car engine plants in Britain, ensuring jobs for Miranda's family and thousands of Britons. He then reveals that Graves has been sabotaging his succession to the throne and has him arrested for violating the [[Treason Act 1702]]. Finally, he announces that he will [[Abdication|abdicate]] and reveals Cedric as his successor.  After Cedric accepts his duty as King, Ralph is appointed as the Third Duke of Warren, with a lucrative annual salary and his own recording studio in the Palace. He also marries Miranda and raises a family with her while running his own band.

A blonde student, Dorothy Carlsson ([[Sean Young]]) doodles in her notebook during class, drawing herself being married to a suitor. After class, she changes into a more formal outfit, and runs into her friend Patricia Farren ([[Martha Gehman]]) on her way out. Patricia asks if she is going to meet her "mystery man", but Dorothy claims she is just going to meet her father for lunch.  On her way across town, Dorothy asks the cab to wait while she buys a new pair of shoes. At city hall, she meets Jonathan Corliss ([[Matt Dillon]]). The couple go up to the marriage license bureau, but it is closed for lunch. They discuss how her father would disown her if he knew what she was doing. Jonathan convinces her to wait for the office to reopen on the roof of the building. Eventually, he tosses her over the edge, taking her gold lighter and cigarettes, leaving her purse and tossing her new shoes after her plunging body. In the lobby, he mails a letter and calmly walks past her body as the crowd gathers.  Thor and his daughter Ellen, Dorothy's twin, are shocked to find out Dorothy was pregnant and to read Dorothy's suicide note, which was mailed the day she died. Ellen cannot believe that her sister would kill herself. Jonathan returns to his working class home in Pittsburgh possessing a portfolio of clippings regarding the Carlsson family and fortunes, particularly the suicides of Thor's wife and son.  Promising his mother that he will make something of his life, he hitchikes to New York, getting a ride from Jay Faraday ([[Ad-Rock|Adam Horovitz]]) who reveals that he is a bohemian drifter whose parents had died on [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]].  Four months later, Ellen is working at Castle House, a shelter and outreach program working to help troubled kids and prostitutes. Ellen takes off from the night shift to visit Philadelphia and investigate Dorothy's death. She meets Detective Dan Corelli ([[James Russo]]) and shows him the drawing Dorothy had made in class of her wedding. Because the drawing is dated on the day she died, and given the fact that the building houses a marriage license bureau, Ellen believes Dorothy had no motive to kill herself, and that the suicide note must have been mailed as a cover. As such, she believes that Dorothy must have been lured to her death with the promise of marriage, and that her killer was her boyfriend.  Det. Corelli dismisses her theory, and Ellen returns to the UPenn campus, speaking with Patricia, who reveals that Dorothy had been dating some mystery man. Patricia's tip leads Ellen to the law library where she meets Dorothy's ex-boyfriend Tommy Roussell ([[Ben Browder]]). Tommy explains that he had a breakdown after his relationship with Dorothy ended, and he was out of school when she died, then remembered that she was dating a new man, and he takes her back to his apartment to show her the yearbook photo of the man she was dating. Ellen waits outside Tommy's building, while Jonathan silently stalks her in his car. Tommy finds Jonathan's photo in the yearbook, but as he heads downstairs, Jonathan surprises him and strangles Tommy with his belt then types a suicide note that admits to killing Dorothy on Tommy's computer and strings his body up. Ellen is left convinced that Tommy must have killed Dorothy.  Back in New York, she gets ready for bed, when her boyfriend comes over. Jonathan has assumed the identity of Jay Faraday and begun a relationship with Ellen. The pair seem quite happy, and she has no idea who he really is. As their relationship develops, they work together at Castle House, and Jay manages to impress Thor with his ambition and good nature. Ellen and Jay marry, and he begins to work for Carlsson Copper. One day, he intercepts a phone call from Patricia, who is heading to New York because she has remembered the identity of Dorothy's boyfriend at the time that she died. Jay claims that Ellen is out of town, but arranges for Patricia to wait in her hotel room for a call from Ellen the next day at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. At that time, he attacks Patricia, strangling her and dismembering her body in the bathtub. Jay stuffs her carcass in a suitcase, and packs it in the trunk of his car, before going out on a date with Ellen. After dropping Ellen off back home, he dumps the suitcase off of a bridge into the [[East River]].  A police detective visits Ellen to ask if Patricia had contacted her by investigating her disappearance, and Ellen's name and number were in Patricia's diary. The disappearance strikes Ellen as one coincidence too many in which she calls Tommy's parents and confirms that he was institutionalised at the time of Dorothy's death. Ellen then asks Det. Corelli to reopen the investigation, but nothing turns up.  One night when she is at a bar with Jay, one of his co-workers from a burger joint back at UPenn recognises him as Jonathan Corliss. Jay insists that he is mistaken, eventually hitting him. The incident deeply unsettles Ellen, who digs up an old UPenn yearbook, where she finds a picture of Jonathan, confirming that he looks identical to Jay. Tracking down Jonathan's mother, she explains that Jonathan died three years ago. Ellen visits Jonathan's mother in the house where he grew up, and hears about his childhood. After the mother leaves, Ellen sneaks back into the house to snoop around Jonathan's room, finding his suitcase of clippings about her family, which also contains her sister's lighter. Jonathan has followed her back to his home, and he confesses that he killed Jay Faraday and assumed his identity since no one would miss him. Afterwards, he had planned to position himself in the Carlsson lineage by marrying Dorothy, but her unplanned pregnancy had meant that she would be disinherited. Jonathan unties his belt and approaches Ellen explaining that he will simply have to comfort her father as he loses another child. Ellen manages to escape, fleeing out the back of the house and up to the train tracks. Jonathan pursues her and is run over by a Carlsson train.

 During [[halftime]] at a televised football game, L.A. Stallions [[running back]] Billy Cole ([[Billy Blanks]]) receives a phone call from a mysterious man named Milo ([[Taylor Negron]]), who warns him to win the game or he will be assassinated. Cole ingests [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] and, in a drug-induced rage, brings a gun onto the field, shooting three opposing players to reach the end zone. Cole then shoots himself in the head. Meanwhile, [[private investigator]] Joe Hallenbeck ([[Bruce Willis]]), a disgraced former [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent, who at one time was a national hero for saving the president from an assassination attempt, discovers that his wife Sarah ([[Chelsea Field]]) is having an affair with his best friend and business partner, Mike Matthews ([[Bruce McGill]]). Mike gives Joe an assignment to act as bodyguard for a stripper named Cory ([[Halle Berry]]). Mike is then killed by a car bomb outside Joe's house.  Joe is approached by Cory's boyfriend, former Stallions [[quarterback]] Jimmy Dix ([[Damon Wayans]]), who was banned from the league on gambling charges and alleged drug abuse. After an argument between Joe and Jimmy, an annoyed Jimmy takes Cory from the stage while she is performing. Joe plans to wait outside, where he is knocked out by a team of hitmen. Jimmy and Cory leave the bar in separate cars while Joe is left to dispatch one of the hitmen. When Cory is struck from behind and stops to confront the other driver, she is killed by the hitmen. Jimmy is fired upon and pinned down, but is saved by Joe.  At Cory's house, Jimmy and Joe find a taped phone conversation between Senator Calvin Baynard ([[Chelcie Ross]]), who is leading a congressional investigation into gambling in sports, and Stallions owner Sheldon Marcone ([[Noble Willingham]]). When the tape is ruined in Joe's faulty car stereo, Jimmy realizes that Cory tried using the tape against Marcone to put Jimmy back on the team, prompting Marcone to send the hitmen. Joe saves Jimmy from a second car bomb, and manages to trick two hitmen into blowing themselves up. But the explosion destroys the remaining evidence.  Joe reveals to Jimmy that when he was in the Secret Service, he witnessed Baynard torturing a woman in a hotel room and assaulted the senator to thwart the attack. Baynard retaliated by having Joe fired from the Secret Service for refusing to cover up the incident. At Joe's house, Jimmy meets Joe's abrasive daughter Darian ([[Danielle Harris]]). When Joe catches Jimmy attempting to use illegal painkillers in the bathroom, Joe kicks him out. As Jimmy leaves, he is asked by Darian to sign a football trading card, stating that Joe was a fan of Jimmy's and never watched another game after he was banned from the league. He leaves her with the signed card, "To the daughter of the last Boy Scout."  Learning of Mike's affair with Sarah, the police assumed that he was killed by Joe and move to make an arrest. But Milo, Marcone's top henchman, captures Joe first and shoots a detective using Joe's gun. Marcone explains to Joe that he has been buying Senate votes to legalize sports gambling, but that Baynard tried to [[blackmail]] Marcone for $6 million. Being aware of Joe's history with Baynard, Marcone says that it would be cheaper to kill the senator and frame Joe for the murder. Joe is forced to hand a briefcase filled with money to Baynard's bodyguards, who switched it with a wired briefcase. Joe is rescued by Jimmy and Darian, and acquires both briefcases after running the bodyguards and Milo off the road. However, Milo survives and while Darian is left to wait for the police, he abducts her.  Heading to the stadium to rescue Darian, Joe and Jimmy are captured and escorted to Marcone's office. Jimmy creates a diversion, allowing them to fight their way free. Realizing Milo will attempt to shoot Baynard, Joe goes after him while sending Jimmy to warn the senator. Grabbing the game ball, Jimmy throws it at Baynard, knocking him down just as Milo starts shooting. Joe knocks Milo to the edge of the stadium light platform, where [[SWAT]] officers shoot him several times. Milo then falls into the moving rotor blades of a police helicopter. The briefcase of money is recovered and Marcone, having escaped with the rigged briefcase, is killed when he opens it at his estate. The next day, Joe and Sarah reconcile, and Joe and Jimmy decide to become partners.  
Lamhe
  Virendra "Viren" Pratap Singh ([[Anil Kapoor]]) travels to Rajasthan with his governess, affectionately called Daijaan ([[Waheeda Rehman]]). Viren spends most of his youth and childhood in Rajasthan, where he meets the beautiful Pallavi ([[Sridevi]]) and falls in love with her. He is unable to fully express his love for her and remains her friend. Throughout this relationship, Pallavi keeps telling Viren that she is older than him, but this never bothers or deters Viren from wooing her. Daijaan sadly watches Viren's disappointments, but can not do anything to help him.  During a property dispute and a major civil court case, and all the stress that apparently comes from it, Pallavi's father (a respected dignitary and elder) dies of a major heart attack. Pallavi is shocked and so shattered that she goes into major depression and isolates herself in a nearby secluded town. At this sad event, Viren as a good friend goes there to console her, on which she runs past him&nbsp;— towards Siddharth, the man she truly loves and is romantically involved with.  At this twist of fate, Viren is heartbroken and sad, but in respect of Pallavi's father's (an elder in the community) dying wish, he attends the wedding of Siddharth and Pallavi. Unable to hold his disappointment much longer,  Viren decides to migrate far away and moves to settle permanently in London.  After about one year and a half into the happy marriage, Siddharth and Pallavi are both involved in a fatal car crash. Luckily, her baby girl (Pooja) survives this car accident and is placed in the care of '''Daijaan''' (who was also Viren's trusted governess).  In London, Viren spends time with his childhood friend, Prem ([[Anupam Kher]]), who is well-aware that Viren's heart still pines for Pallavi. Over the course of time, and with much persuasion, Viren slowly hops back into reality and makes new friends, including a girlfriend and business partner&nbsp;– Anita (Dippy Sagoo), who eventually falls in love with him; she finds out about Viren's love for Pallavi from his childhood friend Prem, and thus constantly feels envious and tries to gain his attention.  Viren visits Rajasthan once every year for Pallavi's death anniversary, and to buy gifts for the young Pooja and also to say hello to his governess, Daijaan. He never spends time with Pooja because she reminds him too much of Pallavi, which makes Pooja very sad.  A few years later, Viren returns from London and meets the grown-up Pooja for the first time. He is super-shocked to see that she not only looks exactly like her mother but laughs, talks and cries like her too! Everything about her reminds him of his long-lost sweetheart- Pallavi.  After another two to three years, Daijaan brings a grown-up Pooja to visit London for vacation, and enjoy to see the big wide world outside Rajasthan, India. She meets with Anita in Viren's house, and Anita soon discovers the reason why Viren can't forget Pallavi at all even if he tried&nbsp;– is because Pooja is the spitting&nbsp;– image of Pallavi! This upsets Anita as she is afraid that Viren will eventually fall for Pooja and hence, ultimately desert her... so Anita becomes more perplexed and anxious.  On the other hand, Pooja is completely unaware of her striking resemblance to her own mother and why it would bother anyone so much. Pooja continues to develop feelings for Viren, whom she lovingly calls "Kunwarji". Prem also admires Pooja's bubbly and amiable personality and understands how much Pooja is attached to Viren. Although Prem likes the alliance, he is skeptical since Viren is still living in the past.  Later on, Anita realises that Viren is over Pallavi and has fallen for Pooja now. Anita's worst fears come true, so she confronts Pooja about her feelings for Viren and tells her that she is a responsibility for Viren and nothing else. She tries to explain to Pooja that she is a kid infatuated by Viren and asks what relation Pooja is to Viren that she always acts authoritatively over him. Pooja retorts by saying that if she is not related to Viren, Anita is not related to him either. This frustrates Anita leading her to lambast Viren about having feelings for a woman who is around fifteen-twenty years younger than himself!  In Viren's house, Pooja explores his room while he is away on a short trip and finds a pencil sketch (which Viren had made years earlier of his beloved Pallavi, her mother) and misunderstands that it is a sketch of hers. She dresses in traditional clothes and when he comes home, she points at the pencil sketch and asks him to please put "sindoor" on her since she knows that he loves her. Furious, he reveals to her that he had loved her mother and not her. At this outburst of truth, Pooja is extremely heartbroken, in tears and runs to her governess Daijaan for solace. Diana comforts her and relates to her the whole entire tragic story of how Viren grew up with her mother as his childhood chum, and so on and so forth till now. Pooja begins to understand why Anita was being so possessive about Viren earlier. Now, Pooja feels too humiliated to stay in London any longer, so she asks Daijaan to accompany her back to India.  In India, Daijaan and the community members, relatives etc. start looking for a good potential suitor for the now beautiful and grown up Pooja. As soon as suitors start flooding in, Pooja mentions that she would be happy to marry only when Viren is first married before her!  Back in London, Viren is confused and in an emotional frenzy. His friend Prem advises him to marry Pooja, but Viren thinks that not right or fair to Anita as he feels she has been waiting for him for a very long time. He orders wedding cards to be printed, but then changes his mind last minute when the wedding day draws near, (much to Anita's dismay).  One fine day, when Viren talks to Pooja over the phone, he asks her if she is married by now. she lies to Viren that she is already married. Viren knows that Pooja is lying (as he asks Daijaan and everybody else) and next time when Pooja asks him if he is married, he lies to her as well. To prove it, Viren sends Daaijaan and Pooja the fake marriage invitations that had been printed already to make Pooja believe that he is truly getting married.  Anyway, on receiving the wedding cards, Pooja and Daijaan never bother to visit London and attend the wedding as they become very busy with their life and after many years of living apart and losing touch, Pooja could not bring herself to face Viren again. Therefore, we see a heartbroken Pooja who begins (or tries to begin) her own independent life as a story-teller in the villages, narrating folk tales using puppets to an audience in a village shows, under caring guidance of her governess.  However strange this may sound, Viren could not forget the beautiful daughter of his beloved Pallavi, Pooja. He deserts Anita in London and travels to Rajasthan, India where he finds out the whereabouts of Pooja and Daijaan. He finds out that Pooja will be performing in one upcoming show in a particular village of her choice. After the show, Viren approaches a confused and wary Pooja.  Viren reveals that he realised, after she left London, that he still loved her and he knew that she had lied to him about being married. He tells her that he also lied to her in response to her lie about "being married and busy".  Pooja can not believe her ears! She runs into his arms and they are together at last and forever. Even though she is much younger to him, their relationship becomes special as she resembles her mother in many different ways and for Viren, it was like drinking water and quenching his thirst in a dry hot desert.  
Late for Dinner
 In 1962, best friends and brothers-in-law, Willie Husband ([[Brian Wimmer]]) and simple-minded Frank Lovegren ([[Peter Berg]]), are running from the police because Willie shot and killed a man. It was self-defense, but a witness intends to frame them both for kidnapping and murder.  Frank explains what happened: Willie; his wife, Joy ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]); and little daughter, Jess (Cassy Friel); live a happy life in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], where Joy's brother, Frank, lives with them. Willie lost his job at the milk company, and they have fallen behind in house payments. They learn the bank intends to foreclose, so Willie pays a visit to the banker, Bob Freeman ([[Peter Gallagher]]), to show that he made up the back payments with funds borrowed from relatives. Freeman takes Willie's receipt and burns it, then offers to buy his house for less than it's worth. He is building a huge, new home development in the area, and he needs all the land in Willie's neighborhood to do it. Willie refuses to undersell or to bow to pressure, and destroys an expensive chair and rug before storming out of the office. That's the last straw for Freeman, and he vows revenge.  On the drive home, Willie discovers Frank "borrowed" Freeman's little boy, Donald ([[Ross Malinger]]), because Frank realized the boy was being emotionally abused by his father. He pleads to Willie to let him keep Donald, as he is small and won't eat much. When they get home, Joy convinces Willie they have to accept the lowball offer and just get out while they can. Willie calls Freeman to tell him that he will accept his offer after all, and that, by the way, his son had somehow "wedged himself into the back seat" of his car. Realizing this is his chance to get what he wants, Freeman accuses Willie of kidnapping. They agree to meet in the desert just outside town, Willie believing it is only to return the boy and to get the $9,000 Freeman offered for his house.  Once they are face to face, Freeman produces an envelope filled with $15,000, intending to make this look like a ransom exchange. Freeman and his henchman then both pull guns, right in front of little Donald, as Freeman admits he was the one who got Willie fired from his job so he would be unable to pay his mortgage, making it possible for him to buy the house for a low price. He is confident Donald will tell the police whatever he says to tell them, and as he aims his gun, Willie jumps Freeman, and the henchman shoots Willie in the shoulder. Freeman reaches for the gun, but Frank tackles him and knocks him out. The henchman aims his gun at Frank, but Willie manages to shoot the man in the chest. It was self-defense, but they know Freeman will claim otherwise. They have to leave Donald there and take off before the police arrive, whom Freeman called before he got there. They try to stop at home first, but they can see police cars are already there. Willie's little daughter sees them coming, and silently shakes her head to tell them not to stop, so, sadly, they drive away. They don't realize this is the last time they may ever see Joy and Jess.  After escaping for hours through the desert, they come across Dr. Dan Chilblains ([[Bo Brundin]]) in [[Pomona, California]]. Willie has passed out, but the doctor fixes up his wound, and discovers that Frank has [[glomerulonephritis]], which will eventually kill him. Chilblains has invented a [[cryogenics|procedure that can freeze a human being]] without killing him, and convinces Frank to let him freeze them both until Frank can be treated for kidney disease – maybe even get a new kidney (a procedure that is not widely known in 1962) – and to hide them from the police. Excited by the prospect of being cured, Frank agrees, and assumes the unconscious Willie will be okay with it. The doctor allows Frank to think it's just like sleeping, and it will only be for a little while. He sedates them, then Chilblains' colleagues show up, and reluctantly help him prepare the men for the [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] process.  Twenty-nine years later, in 1991, a truck crashes, destroying and flooding the cryogenic storage facility, and causing the tanks storing the two men to burst open. Willie and Frank, in body bags, are revived by floating in electrified water. Suddenly regaining consciousness, they escape from the bags, freezing, wet, and feeling confused. Once they get their wits about them, they decide they need to get back to Santa Fe, assuming Joy and Jess will be there waiting. Dr. Chilblains left them clothing, $100, and a note that doesn't really explain much. They are starving and go to buy food. The culture shock, high prices, and modern technology are amazing and overwhelming to them. Frank realizes he needs his medication, so they visit a hospital, which is where they finally learn the date and what actually happened to them.  They manage to get back to Santa Fe and track down Willie's daughter, Jess ([[Colleen Flynn]]), who is now grown up with "her own telephone number… her own house." Seeing Jess all grown up, only now does Frank accept that so much time has passed. Once she calms down, she explains to Willie that Joy had to move on; she married someone else, but is now divorced, because her second husband just didn't measure up to the standard set by her first husband. She also told him that Joy stood up to Freeman; she managed to keep their home, and she exposed Freeman's scam. Freeman then went away and built half of Phoenix, and eventually someone murdered him.  Willie and Jess leave Frank at her house, and go to Joy's house to meet her. While they're gone, Frank meets Jess' husband, who turns out to be Donald Freeman ([[Richard Steinmetz]]). At Joy's house, Jess makes her sit down and listen to Willie explain, but to keep her back turned and not look at him. When she finally does look, she has trouble accepting the fact that he hasn't aged, and says they can never be together again because too much has changed and she is too old. Willie manages to woo her back by reminding her why he loved her, that he still loves her, and he knows she hasn't changed.  Finally, through a series of "home movies" and photographs, their renewed lives together are revealed, including the fact that Joy donated a kidney to save Frank's life.  
The Last Blood
  One night a man approaches a residence to deliver a video-tape to its occupants, all of whom are armed terrorists. When his face is shown on the video someone hands him a gun and they kill most of the terrorists as armed police arrive. But their leader is able to escape, leaving nearly the entire arrest team dead or wounded. It is revealed to be an Interpol operation, under the responsibility of officers Lui Tai and Stone. The hideout belonged to a cell of the [[Japanese Red Army]], under the leadership of the cell's Chinese commander named Kama Kura. They know that the JRA threat is not over as Kama Kura has many members of his cell all across Singapore.  The next day, on the 25th [[National Day (Singapore)|Singapore National Day]], the Daka Lama visits [[Singapore]] for an interview. However the JRA ambushes the detail at [[Changi Airport]] and the religious leader is seriously injured. Big B, a vacationing [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] member from Hong Kong, is also caught up in the attack and his girlfriend is also shot in the incident. Both are admitted to the same hospital and it is discovered that they both have the same type of rare blood type of which only three people have in the whole of Singapore. Due to the security threat the Singaporean Army sends men to the hospital.  Big B and the police quickly search for the three donors. However, the Japanese Red Army soon kill the first two, leaving Big B to find and protect the final donor, a lowlife named Fatty who is reluctant to help either the gangster or the police. However a JRA ambush at Sentosa means Fatty and Big B are apprehended by the police. Things worsen when their convoy is ambushed in the night, leaving Lui Tai, Big B, Fatty and Lui's partner, Stone the only survivors; only to be pursued by Japanese Red Army terrorists on motorcycles which ends with the 4 of them escaping on the MRT, but not before capturing one terrorist. The way of how the JRA are able to know of the Daka Lama's arrival, the donors as well as their movements, lead Lui Tai to suspect that there may be a mole.  Meanwhile, the JRA cell and their leader Kama Kura continue plotting their next move, which involves going after Fatty and his girlfriend. But that fails with 2 of the 4-strong hit squad losing 2 men to Stone and Lui Tai. However the terrorists soon figure out where Fatty has gone to, and target the family of his girlfriend. In the battle that ensues, Fatty's girlfriend and all but one member of her family are killed, leading Fatty to personally exact revenge on one of the hitmen.  Outside the residence Stone finally reveals that he was the mole working with the JRA, due to the high extra pay offered by Kama Kura which was badly needed due to his big family. This explains why; in a raid earlier on, did Kama Kura manage to escape: Stone did fire at Kama Kura but missed the terrorist leader (most likely on purpose) . Lui Tai however ends the betrayal in a match of quick-draw whereby Lui shoots Stone in the head, but Stone missed. After witnessing the tragedy of his girlfriend Fatty agrees to donate his blood to save the Daka as well as B's girlfriend, as a promise to his own deceased girlfriend.  With the information reaching Kama Kura, he attacks the hospital with his last terrorists; losing his female assassin when the Daka throws a surgical knife and hits her throat. This prompts Kama Kura himself to lead the last attack, killing all the guards before the henchman is killed by Lui. A final battle rages between Big B, Lui and Kama Kura while Fatty goes for the blood donation, handled by a local doctor there only known as Dr. Ferrari by his colleagues. Lui, meanwhile is overpowered by Kama Kura who repeatedly uses a grenade launcher; but Big B intervenes and disarms the terrorist leader by removing the magazine from his M16A1 assault rifle, leaving the pair to engage in hand-to-hand combat to which Big B is nearly defeated but holds off the terrorist leader with an oxygen cylinder. Lui is able to retrieve his gun by using a remote control car belonging to one of Stone's daughters and shoot the cylinder just as Kama Kura tries to throw it at Big B; thus ending the JRA threat to the Daka; who together with B's girlfriend, are both saved thanks to the badly needed blood transfusion.

During the 1960s, Lee Rock's power is monstrous, not only does he control the entire [[Hong Kong Police Force]]'s operations, but also actively invests in commercial real estate, entertainment and many other fields. He becomes a major figure with an estimated wealth of HK$500 million.  In 1972 Britain sent Sutcliffe to Hong Kong to be the new Commissioner of Police. He finds the Hong Kong Police Force to be extremely corrupt, making the entire community a big hotbed of crime, and he is determined to actively combat all criminal activities. This makes life difficult for Lee and everyone else. In 1974, the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] was established and is committed to combating all forms of corruption, which leads to Lee Rock's idea of early retirement. Lee decides to transfer all of its assets to Canada and migrating there with his family.  In the aspect of his family, Rose's arrival to Hong Kong coincides with the time polygamy was being abolished in Hong Kong. In order to avoid being the third party between Lee and his wife Grace, she chooses to bring their son Bill Lee away, and settled in Australia. Rose works hard to raise Bill, and they come back to Hong Kong after Bill grows up. Bill also became a staff member of the ICAC. Bill learned about his father's crimes, which causes strong hatred towards his father. The conflict between the father and son causes Rose to fall ill and be hospitalized. When Lee Rock learns that Rose is dying, he rushes to the hospital but was being hunted at the same time. It was King Crab's younger brother from Netherlands, who came to avenge his brother when he believed Ngan who told him that Lee killed Crab. Lee suffers from a gunshot wound and witnessed Rose's death at the hospital. The killers also arrived at that time and Lee Rock and his son work together to kill off the killers, which also improves the relationship between the father and son.  In the end, a lot of corruption is still happening in Hong Kong, especially in the police force where various police officers have been arrested by the ICAC and treated by the law; while the wanted Lee Rock enjoys a stable life with his family in Canada.  
The Linguini Incident
  Lucy (Arquette) is a young woman who works at a restaurant in [[Manhattan]]. She is constantly annoyed by her gambling, egotistical bosses. She has an ambition to be an [[Escapology|escape artist]], specifically a modern female version of [[Harry Houdini]], with her best friend, Vivian (Balint) as her assistant. Lucy also collects anything that once belonged to Mrs. Houdini.  The movie starts with Lucy questioning who the new bartender (Bowie) is. She finds out his name is Monte, he's from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and will tell any lie in order to get a woman to [[Marriage|marry]] him. He makes it clear he only wants to marry because he is in dire need of a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]], because if he doesn't and has to go back to Britain, he will surely die. The two chat, with Monte desperately asking Lucy out for breakfast, even though Lucy doesn't want to.  Later on, Lucy is practising an escape trick when she loses her balance and becomes trapped by the [[noose]] she was planning to escape from. Her wrists and ankles are both cuffed, meaning Lucy can't free herself. She cries herself to sleep after having not been able to reach the key that unlocks the cuffs. She is awoken in the morning by a phone call. She struggles to answer it but manages to by kicking the phone onto the ground so she can hear it. It's Monte wanting to take her out for breakfast, having found her number in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. Lucy begs him to come to her [[apartment]] to untie her. He frees her legs and unties the noose but will only free her hands on the condition that she marries him. Lucy, unsettled, declines, so Monte handcuffs Lucy to himself and the bed before falling asleep, with an upset Lucy following suit.  Vivian enters the apartment the following morning to find Monte and Lucy asleep on the bed, handcuffed. Vivian unlocks Lucy but leaves the handcuffs on Monte. He later arises and eats a [[marshmallow]] for breakfast whilst the girls whisper in the bathroom about who gets to sleep with him.  Later on, Viv and Lucy ride to an [[antique shop]] where Lucy has her eye on Mrs. Houdini's [[wedding ring]]. Lucy will do anything to have it, but is unable to purchase it, as she doesn't have the $5,000 to pay for it. Lucy wonders how she can get the money. She decides to rob the restaurant after her bosses, Dante (Gregory) and Cecil (Henry) once again decide to fine the waitresses if they don't sell enough [[dessert]]s. Monte is also present at the meeting, with one of his hands still cuffed.  Vivian goes to the restaurant to tell Lucy some big news: a designer is interested in meeting Viv to discuss her line of [[lingerie]]. The only problem is, Viv can only meet with the designer the following day at 3:00. This is a problem because Lucy has an [[audition]] for her escape trick, and Viv is her assistant. After an argument, Vivian storms off to go and talk to Monte, who's serving at the bar. Jealous, Lucy unlocks Monte from the handcuff and agrees to go out with him if he'll be her assistant at the audition; he accepts.  Monte has his doubts about Lucy, so he strikes a deal with Jeanette (Matlin), a [[Hearing loss|deaf]] colleague: Jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. This leads to a conversation Monte has on the phone with his friend. Lucy overhears the conversation and decides to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]]. He explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.  Lucy confronts Monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. Both become frustrated because they both want to rob the [[restaurant]] at the same time. Lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. Unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. Lucy is obviously upset so Monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. They can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and Monte needs it all to pay Jeanette. Monte comes up with another plan: he will help Lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. This way, Monte won't need the $10,000 to pay Jeanette.  Lucy begins to cry again so Monte tries to cheer her up by talking about Mrs. Houdini. Lucy, still upset, explains that Mrs. Houdini was vital to Harry Houdini's escape routines: before Mr. Houdini commenced with his trick, Mrs. Houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his. Lucy's mood has improved somewhat after this so the two walk down the street and discuss the possibility of sleeping together. Monte wants to, but Lucy declines and explains Viv was hoping to sleep with him first. With Viv in mind, he suggests that a third person that doesn't work at the restaurant and wouldn't be recognised would be ideal for the [[robbery]]. Lucy agrees and the two head to Vivian's apartment, where she's working on her 'self-defence bra'.  It's later on when the trio discuss the plan: at 12:00 AM, Viv will enter the restaurant and demand money, which she will take from the register. To appear more threatening, she will carry a [[gun]] which fires blanks. It's vitally important that it happens before the 12:30 AM drop. Monte and Lucy will create some clever [[:wikt:diversion|diversions]] so that the guests will be on edge. At 11:59, they will drop a loud set of glasses to really unsettle the guests; seconds later, Viv will enter. Viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from Monte.  At 11:59, Monte and Lucy drop the [[Champagne|champagne bottles]] and glasses... But Viv doesn't show up. Thinking she has dropped out, Monte storms off, and Lucy follows. She finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. With [[adrenaline]] rushing through him, he makes out with Lucy. As it turns out, Viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. She makes [[threat]]s but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.  In the freezer, Lucy flees the room, leaving Monte confused. She tracks down Vivian, who explains what happened. The situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so Viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'Sorry, I guess I wasn't kidding... Money. Now. All of it.' Jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand Vivian because the disguise is covering her face. Annoyed, Viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. Jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. Lucy and Monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.  Expecting Lucy to uphold her side of the deal, Monte heads to the [[Register office|Register Office]] and waits for her. Meanwhile, Lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. She heads over to Viv's apartment to mope. Viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. Lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. Viv asks if she and Monte tied the knot. Lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and Vivian rush to the Register Office.  The girls arrive and Monte whisks Lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her [[Identity document|I.D.]] at Viv's apartment. There is simply no time to get married any other day, so Monte leaves in anger. The two girls leave, too, and Lucy, full of guilt, confesses to Vivian that she made out with Monte. The two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]].  Monte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when Cecil and Dante approach him. It is revealed that Monte didn't need to get married to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with Cecil and Dante. We also learn that Monte has a terrible [[gambling]] problem. He manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: Lucy will have one minute to escape from a [[straitjacket]], hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (In Cecil and Dante's giant [[aquarium]] at the restaurant). If she is unable to, Monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo [[plastic surgery]] to make himself look like Dante.  Of course, Monte can't win without Lucy's help. He arrives at Lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. He wakes them up and discovers they have serious [[hangover]]s. Worried that they won't help him, Monte makes up a story, 'Cecil and Dante know about the robbery... I don't know how they found out... There's still hope. I made a deal- a bet-a bet with Cecil and Dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened... [If we lose,] 20 years [[Penal labour|hard labour]]'. Vivian and Monte believe that they can train Lucy, but quickly, for the stunt is to be performed the following night. Lucy trains for hours, and before long, the three fall asleep, exhausted. Vivian wakes up in the early hours of the [[morning]] and leaves, which, in turn, causes Monte and Lucy to wake up. Lucy wants to get up and train, but Monte convinces her to stay, and the two make love in Lucy's apartment.  Later in the morning, Lucy is out shopping and sees Cecil and Dante driving past in a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. She tries to avoid them, but they drag her into the vehicle so they can rant about their excitement for the bet. After a bit of chatting, Lucy finds out that Cecil and Dante don't know who committed the robbery, even though Monte told her they knew. She discovers that Monte will have to pay Cecil and Dante $4,000,000 (or get plastic surgery) if he doesn't win the bet, even though Monte told her they'd go to jail if the bet was lost. Lucy is visibly shocked and asks the driver to stop before climbing out of the taxi.  It's the night of the bet and Monte is nervous, particularly because Lucy hasn't showed up. Monte learns that Cecil and Dante told her the [[truth]] about the bet. He now doubts that she will show, but begs the two men to stall the audience until she comes, so they do. Lucy finally shows up, surprising Cecil, Dante, and Monte. After an awkward arrival, she puts on the straitjacket, has her legs cuffed, and is almost in the canvas bag when Monte interrupts, wanting a 'goodbye kiss'. Lucy, still angry at him, refuses, until she sees he has Mrs. Houdini's wedding ring between his [[Tooth|teeth]].  Lucy is locked in the bag, suspended upside down, and dropped into the water. She appears to be struggling to escape when several [[Gunshot|gun shots]] fire. It's Vivian, dressed in a red [[disguise]] but with the same black [[veil]] covering her face. She presses her 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. She demands money and the audience give it to her whilst Monte stares in shock. Jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.  When Viv leaves, the attention turns back to Lucy. The canvas bag is still in the water. Monte- aware that if he tries to save her, he will lose the bet- jumps into the water, before finding out that the bag is devoid of Lucy. The audience is confused until they find her on the second level of the restaurant, dripping from the water but otherwise fine.  Later on, Monte is still somewhat damp but approaches Lucy nonetheless. She's less angry with him since he risked $4,000,000 to save her, but she shakes his hand and prepares to leave him for the last time. Monte calls her back and asks if she will go out with him the following day, but this time, it's for real. The two kiss before Lucy leaves. Outside, Viv is waiting by two new [[Bicycle|bikes]] from Cecil and Dante and the movie ends with the two girls riding down the dark street.  
Life, and Nothing More...
 A film director and his son start a journey towards Koker, where approximately half of ''[[Where is the Friend's Home?]]'' took place. During the first half, they search for a highway to the village, as most of the roads have been damaged or blocked by [[1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake|a severe earthquake two years prior]]; meanwhile, the two cross paths with several locals (who were also witnesses of the earthquake) and often ask directions.  After changing his route several times, the two finally reach one of the villages in which the aforementioned movie was filmed. They visit one of those who acted, and accompany him for a little while. The director and his son visit the destroyed village and hear additional stories of those who survived, among them a young married couple that lost many relatives in the disaster but [[Persian marriage|decided to marry anyway (since the dead did not foresee their demise)]]. One scene featuring this couple is a focal point of the third film in Kiarostami's Koker trilogy, ''[[Through the Olive Trees]]''.  Later, the director and his son find another child who acted in the movie and take him to the tents, where most Koker inhabitants whose houses have been destroyed stay. The son of the director wants to watch the final match of the Football World Cup with the other kids, so his father leaves him there and comes back later to pick him up. He talks with other witnesses of the earthquake and admires the spirit they have had to move on with their lives.  The film's last shot is several minutes long; the director is struggling to reach the town in his car. He passes a man carrying a tank and drives up a hill until the engine begins overheating and he is unable to continue. The man with the tank helps him restart the engine. The director seemingly leaves as the man with the tank goes walking uphill. The director's car races several meters before trying to climb the hill again and after he makes it, the director picks up the man with the tank. Following this scene, the movie goes black.  
Life Stinks
 Goddard Bolt (Mel Brooks) is the callous CEO of Bolt Enterprises. Bolt shows little regard for other people's needs or for the environment, and has his eye on the [[slum]] of Los Angeles so he can [[urban renewal|tear it down]]. Bolt makes a bet with his biggest rival, Vance Crasswell (Jeffrey Tambor), who also has an interest in the property, that he can survive on those streets for 30 days. Should Bolt lose, Crasswell owns the property, but should Bolt win, Crasswell will sell it for practically nothing.  There are three conditions: #1) Bolt will be completely penniless; #2) He must wear an [[electronic anklet]] that will activate if he leaves the boundaries, forfeiting the bet if he exceeds 30 seconds out of bounds; #3) At no time can he reveal to any of the slum area residents that he is Goddard Bolt. To add to the look, Bolt has his mustache shaved off, then Crasswell confiscates his [[toupee]] and rips the top pocket of his jacket.  Unbeknown to Bolt, Crasswell schemes to make Goddard's stay on the streets as bad as possible. Bolt, homeless, hungry and filthy, is befriended by [[skid-row]] inhabitants like Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Theodore Wilson) and given the nickname "Pepto" after falling asleep in a crate with a [[Pepto-Bismol]] logo on its side. In the process, he meets and eventually becomes attracted to Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a homeless woman who used to be a dancer on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. During a scuffle with two muggers, Bolt is pushed out of bounds, which activates his anklet. To prevent the "30-second forfeiture", Bolt rushes back in, which impresses Molly with his supposed bravery as it looks like he is tackling the muggers.  Bolt learns a series of important life lessons during his 'adventure', namely that life is not about accomplishments or material success but rather the integrity of the human spirit. However, Bolt is unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet. When Crasswell realizes Bolt is honoring the bet fair and square, Crasswell bribes Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind and has his property seized. Forced to live on the streets for good and remanded to a free clinic by mistake, a drugged Bolt murmurs that "life stinks", but Molly implores him to remember small things such as the two of them waltzing that make life livable. Crasswell, meanwhile has his own plans for the slum area, planning to tear it down as well. Bolt incites Fumes and the other slum residents to stage a mock battle on the ceremony while it is televised. Crasswell attempts to stop Bolt with a hydraulic excavator, to which Bolt fights Crasswell in another hydraulic excavator akin to "dinosaur fights". When Bolt's grapple has plucked Crasswell and has him hanging by his jacket, the scene is freeze-framed into a news report saying that Crasswell, in a court case, was forced to admit he made a bet with Bolt in order to get him to understand the slum conditions, then reneged on the terms. Bolt, now in control of the area, has plans to renovate it into the "Bolt Center" which will give the slum residents employment, renovate the tenements into livable homes and give the children a private school financed entirely out of pocket by Goddard Bolt. The news report ends by saying Bolt has married Molly and the press are expecting an extravagant CEO-type event, only to then be shown Goddard and Molly taking their wedding vows in a simple [[chapel]] in the slum area, then driving off in a limousine with a [[vanity plate]] "PEPTO".  
Lionheart (1990 film)
 Lyon Gaultier is a [[paratrooper]] in the [[French Foreign Legion]], stationed in [[Djibouti]], North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in [[Los Angeles]], is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers [[third-degree burn]]s, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a [[tramp steamer]] headed for the [[United States|U.S.]] Meanwhile, the Legion commanding officer also travels to the States, arriving at the French Embassy, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], so he orders two of his own Legionnaires to do the job.  Lyon arrives in New York City and travels to California to be with his brother's family. Along the way, he meets Joshua, a man who runs fights for money, and also learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Tagging along with Joshua, Lyon meets Cynthia, who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money his family needs, Lyon fights in no-holds-barred [[bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle]] fights to finance the trip. Once they reach L.A., he tracks down his brother's widow, who is reluctant to accept financial aid, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for "deserting" his brother years ago.  This is when he finds out that his brother has already died. Joshua introduces Lyon in the fighting circuit as the titular "Lionheart," derived from "Lyon." Lyon continues fighting, and Joshua uses the prize money to give to Lyon's sister-in-law in the form of checks, with Joshua claiming to be from a life insurance firm her husband allegedly subscribed to long ago.  Meanwhile, the two Legionnaires catch up with Lyon in Los Angeles. Lyon fights them off, but suffers a broken rib. Cynthia decides to take advantage of Lyon's string of victories by stacking the odds in favor of a massive, brutal fighter named ''"Attila the Hun"'', who has so far been unbeatable. Cynthia stacks the odds by smuggling a video of Atilla fighting poorly from one of his earlier bouts, which as expected fails to impress the odds-makers. Cynthia later reveals Attila's true prowess to the Legionnaires, and she promises to deliver Lyon to them after he has been thoroughly humiliated and beaten. The Legionnaires agree to this, provided they can be in the audience.  Lyon's fight with Atilla is hampered by his broken rib. Atilla's trademark (deliberately withheld from Lyon) is to let his opponent tire themselves out before viciously breaking them, often killing them in the process. When it appears "Attila" has won, Joshua begs Lyon to give up, revealing that they were both used by Cynthia. Joshua, for the best of reasons (Lionheart's family), placed all of his own money on Attila as a form of "insurance," as all the odds are against Lyon winning. Lyon, angered by this news, bounces back and summons up all his remaining strength to defeat Atilla, subduing but not killing him. While bookies sideline Cynthia demanding she pay up, the Legionnaires capture Lyon. They escort him back to the apartment, where they give him some time to say his goodbyes before being returned back to Africa, where he will be [[court-martial]]ed for [[desertion]]. Lyon tells his niece that he must go but to try to look for times when life can be good, which is emotional as she does not understand. However, just down the road, moved by the family's heartbreak, the Legionnaires decide to let Lyon go. They believe he has shown the Legion's values of honor, determination and service to others, both during the fight and helping out the family, and wish him luck in his new life in America. Ultimately, Lyon is shown running back to a pleased Joshua and joyous family.

Lies Before Kisses
 The film opens at the birthday party of Elaine ([[Jaclyn Smith]]) and successful businessman Grant's ([[Ben Gazzara]]) daughter Abby (Laura Dobbin). A seemingly happy housewife, Elaine is shocked to overhear a romantic phone conversation of Grant and a 20-year-old girl. Elaine confronts her husband, who claims that the affair was nothing more than a [[one-night stand]] with a [[call girl]].  Life seems to turn to normal, until one day Grant runs into the call girl, Adrianne Arness ([[Lisa Rinna]]), and pictures are taken of their meeting. The pictures, along with photos of a bruised Adrianne, are sent to Elaine. Grant is able to make Elaine believe that Adrianne is setting her up, and inspires her to contact an old family friend, Sonny ([[Nick Mancuso]]), to investigate Adrianne on her background and motives. Adrianne sues Grant for abuse. When Adrianne offers to drop the case in exchange for $50,000, Grant gives in to the demand and gives her a late visit to hand over the money.  The next day, Adrianne is found murdered with the money missing, and Grant becomes the prime suspect. Elaine seeks comfort with Sonny, with whom she engages in a sexual affair.  The viewer learns that Ross made the picture of Grant and Adrianne together, and that Elaine has been wanting to ruin Grant's life since finding out about his betrayal. While playing his supporting wife, Elaine conspires with Ross to have Grant convicted for a crime he did not commit. Elaine and Ross's eventual plan is to take over the half of Grant's business and be wealthy forever.  Sonny has found out that Ross was at Adrianne's place when she was murdered, and orders a house warrant to collect proof for it. As expected, he finds the evidence, and Ross is quickly arrested. After bail, Ross confronts Elaine, but Elaine assures him that no evidence will ever lead to her. Elaine is unaware, though, that Ross had Sonny hidden in the room, who hears Elaine's entire confession and conspiracy. Elaine attempts to seduce him in order not to take a fall, and claims that Ross is responsible for the outlet of the conspiracy. Sonny dismisses her, though, and announces to make sure to destroy her life, like she did with Grant.

Little Man Tate
 Dede Tate ([[Jodie Foster]]) is a single mother, a working-class woman of average intelligence raising her seven-year-old son, Fred ([[Adam Hann-Byrd]]). Fred shows every indication of being a [[genius]]. Fred's reading and [[mathematics]] abilities are remarkable, and he plays the [[piano]] "at competition level,"  but his intellect has isolated him from his public school classmates.  Fred's abilities come to the attention of Jane Grierson ([[Dianne Wiest]]), a former [[music prodigy]] and now a [[psychologist]] running a school for gifted children. She asks permission from Dede to admit Fred to the school, in order to develop his intellectual gifts in ways that a public school cannot. Dede is reluctant, preferring that Fred have a more normal upbringing, but when no friends come to Fred's seventh birthday party, Dede consents.  Fred joins other brilliant young people, and participates in Jane’s  [[Odyssey of the Mind]] event for part of the spring. There he meets one of his heroes, who is one of Jane's prized pupils, the brilliant but slightly bizarre "Mathemagician" Damon Wells ([[P.J. Ochlan]]), a whiz at math who wears a black cape wherever he goes. After Fred unintentionally upstages Damon at one of the competitions at Odyssey of the Mind, Damon is upset with Fred. Damon however warms up to Fred when out horseback riding on Jane’s ranch, and is Fred's first insight to a world outside academia. Damon tells him, "it is not how much IQ a man has; it is how he uses it". Jane attempts to become more nurturing, but is unable to relate to Fred as anything other than a case study.  Fred is later enrolled at a university, where he studies [[quantum physics]] while his mother, aunt and cousins travel to Florida for the summer. An adult student named Eddie ([[Harry Connick Jr.]]) accidentally hits Fred with a globe when goofing around. To make it up to Fred, Eddie takes him out for a ride on his moped and shows him things such as how to shoot pool; it is good for Fred to spend time with someone who is not a genius. However, when Fred walks into Eddie's room while Eddie is in bed with a coed, Fred runs out and Eddie chases after him. Eddie explains that he cannot be a babysitter for Fred; although he enjoys Fred's company, Fred needs to find friends closer to his own age. The return to isolation takes its toll on Fred, as he suffers from nightmares in which he is treated as a freak and an outsider.  Jane is asked to bring Fred onto a TV panel discussion show on the topic of gifted children. Fred attends but breaks down. He claims his mother is dead, and recites a childish poem (a word for word repetition of a poem by one of his former grade school classmates) before taking off his microphone and walking out of the studio.  Dede witnesses some of this as it is being broadcast, and flies back to New York.  Jane is unable to find Fred, but Dede discovers him back at their apartment, and embraces him.  One year later, Fred has adjusted to the pressures of being a child genius, particularly after an even younger student is admitted to Jane's school.  Dede hosts a well-attended birthday party for Fred, reconciling Fred's emotional development with his intellect.

The Little Engine That Could (1991 film)
   Eric, a young boy, is excited about his birthday after reading a book and believes that a train will come for him, much to his teenage sister Jill's disbelief. A few hours later, the train station's [[control tower]] wakes up and in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], Tillie, a young little blue switcher engine, along with her best [[bird]] friend, Chip, wakes up four other trains: Georgia, a kind all-purpose engine, Farnsworth, a stuck-up, shiny, new passenger engine, Jebediah, a worn-out, rusty, old engine, and Pete, a gruff, burly, big, strong freight engine. After the tower assigns Farnsworth and Pete their jobs, he declines Tillie's offer to help with the [[milk train]] assigned to Jebediah due to her small stature. Georgia is assigned to pull the birthday train. A clown named Rollo leads the toys into the train, including Jeepers, a monkey, Stretch, a basketball player, Missy, a ballerina, Handy Pandy, a panda, Perky, an elephant, and Grumpella, a stuffed bird.  But during her journey, something goes haywire inside of Georgia causing her smokestack to explode and her boiler had burst and forced her to stop at a siding and is taken back to the roundhouse by Doc. Left behind, Rollo eventually takes Doc's advice of flagging down one of the other engines returning from their daily runs over the mountain. Farnsworth and Pete turn blind eyes to the offer, and Jebediah explains that going over the mountain is too much for him. Meanwhile, despite the tower turning down Tillie's offer to help carry the birthday train, she and Chip sneak past the tower and pulls the birthday train up a mountain. Despite being ridiculed by the animals along the way, Tillie manages to reach the summit after crossing a bridge that collapses but loses the last train car, which snaps off and falls into the river along the way.  However, an [[avalanche]] knocks Tillie out cold. Eric is woken up by a thunderstorm and is worried about Tillie and the birthday train. After Tillie regains consciousness, she pulls the train out of the snow using her cowcatcher as a snowplow and down the mountain before they reach the town, much to Eric's delight and Jill's amazement. The film ends with Tillie, who although very tired from her long and adventurous journey over the mountain, is very proud and happy and tells her best friend Chip that she did what she could.  
Livin' Large
 Dexter Jackson (Carson) is a young, black deliveryman in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], who aspires to become a news reporter. He gets what he considers his big break when he drives up to a hostage situation. When the reporter on the scene is killed, Dexter steps in and confronts the hostage-taker, who threatens to kill himself on live television. However, Dexter talks the man out of it, and ratings-obsessed executive producer Kate Penndragin ([[Blanche Baker]]) offers Dexter a reporter position at "News 4 Atlanta".  A recurring gag throughout the film involves Jackson seeing himself on TV with notably different facial features, i.e. thinner lips, straight hair, and a lighter complexion. As Kate tries to transform Dexter's urban image (mainly his [[dreadlocks]], clothing, and vocabulary), he begins questioning whether he's starting to sell out as he becomes more and more successful. In other words, he wonders whether becoming successful also means becoming "white".  Although Dexter begins to fulfill his dream, he also starts forgetting where he came from and begins destroying his important relationships. He alienates those close to him with tabloid-style exposé stories, such as a local barber's illegal [[numbers racket]] and a restaurant's unhealthy cooking style. Dexter loses his [[fiancée]], Toynelle (Arrindell Anderson), after a night on the town results in him spending the night with ditzy weather forecaster Missy Carnes ([[Julia Campbell]]). Dexter also betrays his best friend Baker Moon ([[Afrika Baby Bam|Nathaniel 'Afrika' Hall]]) by revealing a local criminal's plan to commit [[Motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]], a plan Baker secretly confided to Dexter. As a result of the report, Baker winds up in the hospital.  After longtime anchor Clifford Worthy ([[Bernie McInerney]]) loses it on the air, Kate promotes Dexter to lead anchor and teams him with Missy, much to his chagrin. Kate also arranges a live marriage between the two, which she plans to exploit for ratings. However, in the end, Dexter comes to his senses and calls off the wedding, deciding to go back to Toynelle. Finally admitting his fault for the entire ordeal, he publicly apologizes to those he stepped over. Dexter finally (and truly) reaches his goal, becoming co-anchor at News 4 Atlanta, alongside Clifford Worthy.

Lovers (1991 film)
 In [[Madrid]], in the mid-1950s, Paco, a handsome young man from the provinces serving the last days of his military service, is in search of both a steady job and lodging. He is engaged to be married to Trini, his major’s maid.  Trini is not only sweet and pretty, but also has saved a sizable amount of money through years of hard work and frugal living, which will enable her and Paco to start their lives together comfortably. With a factory job lined up, Paco moves out of his barracks and looks for somewhere to live until the wedding. Trini unwittingly refers him to Luisa, a beautiful widow who periodically takes in boarders and rents him a spare bedroom.  Besides supplementing her income with boarders, Luisa engages in swindles with underworld contracts, and is not above cheating her partners by skimming money off her illicit earnings. Instantly smitten by Paco, the attractive Luisa quickly seduces her new tenant.  Paco, frustrated by his unfruitful job hunt and by Trini's refusal to sleep with him until they are married, offers little resistance when Luisa seduces him, initiating an affair. He is dazzled with the sexual delight to which she introduces him.  So intense is Paco’s attraction for Luisa, that he abandons Trini for long periods, finally showing up at the major’s house to spend Christmas Eve with her. Trini feels a distance between herself and Paco, and while the couple is strolling in the street, she is surprised to see the “old widow” and immediately guesses that she and Paco are having a relationship.  Trini seeks the advice of the major’s wife, who tells her that she should use her own sexual powers to win Paco back. Waiting for Luisa to leave the apartment, Trini goes to Paco’s room and gives herself to him, making sure that Luisa later sees her leaving. At first, her tactic works and Paco reaffirms his love for her and they leave to visit Trini’s mother in her village. However, Trini is no match for her rival as a lover and Paco cannot get Luisa out of his mind.  When they come back to Madrid, Paco is willing to continue his twin relationship, but Luisa, who knows of Trini’s existence, is wildly jealous of her rival. Things become more complicated for Paco by Luisa’s shady business dealings with Minuta and Gordo, members of a gang of swindlers whom she owes money. They have threatened her life, and Paco, attempting to aid his lover, suggests that he get the money by swindling Trini of her savings. Luisa would prefer that they simply kill Trini, but proposes that Paco should marry Trini, then steal her savings and run away with Luisa. Paco uneasily agrees.  The plan is for Paco to propose marriage to Trini and bring her to the provincial city of Aranda del Duero where they have planned to purchase a bar. Under that pretense, Paco and Trini leave Madrid. Luisa follows them, unsure of Paco’s resolve. While Trini is asleep, Paco steals the money from her handbag. He offers it to Luisa but pulls out of their plan to flee together. Luisa, very upset, tells him he's botched the plan, and when he tells her to wait and, "Things will be okay," she excitedly utters, "Kill her!", and walks away, tossing the money at her feet – it is Paco she wants. Paco retrieves the money, and, driven by guilt, he returns to Trini to explain the situation.  After the disappearance of the money, Trini realized the fraud and understands that her love for Paco is doomed. When Paco comes back to the hotel room and confesses the plan, Trini locks herself in the bathroom and attempts to commit suicide using Paco's razor. She is thwarted by Paco breaking the window and snatching the razor from her. Later, as the two sit in the rain on a bench in front of the cathedral of the town, Trini refuses to forgive Paco, and tells him she prefers death to abandonment. Thwarted in her attempt to cut her own wrist with Paco’s razor, she begs him to kill her since that is what he really wants. He does so, then rushes to the train station to prevent Luisa from leaving. Placing his bloody hands on her compartment window, signaling to Luisa that the mission has been accomplished, she gets off the moving train. The couple embraces passionately on the platform as the train pulls out. A title informs viewers that the police captured the pair three days later.  
Lost in Siberia
 The film follows Andrei Miller, an English archaeologist played by [[Anthony Andrews]], as he gets arrested while doing a special assignment for the Shah of Iran. Mistaken for an English spy with the same name, he gets sent to a labor camp. On the way he meets a Japanese prisoner who speaks some English. He testifies to the military officer that he is totally innocent and asks him to contact the royal family. Most of the movie is a very realistic and ugly picture of the terrible plight of prisoners in Siberia during the Stalin years.  Human life has absolutely no value.  The only place he finally finds human kindness is when he is dying and is sent to the hospital.  A romance develops between him and the camp's doctor, which attracts the anger of the camp's chief who is hoping to marry Anna, the young blond female doctor. Miller gets sent to one of the infamous [[Kolyma]] labour camps, and the camp's chief becomes even more evil and hateful towards all the prisoners left in his command. In an ambiguous ending, word comes to the camp that the Shah of Iran and his wife are asking that he be freed.  He is released and goes back to his pleasant life, or that is just a delusion that he has while dying of cold and hunger.

Madonna: Truth or Dare
 The film begins on August 6, 1990, the day after the final show of the [[Blond Ambition Tour]] in [[Nice]]. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] cleans up her hotel room while, in a [[voice-over]], she explains that she is not as emotional as the rest of her group over the end of the tour. She has already grieved, she says, but it will hit her later and she hopes she will be in a safe place when it happens.  In a flashback to April 1990, the tour is about to kick off in Japan. Everything is a mess; there are sound problems and Madonna did not realize that the tour is during the [[rainy season]] in Japan. Because it is cold and wet, Madonna and the dancers scrap their costumes for warmer attire. In a voice-over, Madonna confesses that the only thing keeping her from "slashing my wrists" is the thought of returning to [[North America]] and performing the show as it is meant to be. In America, Madonna meets the families of her dancers. One dancer, Oliver, sees his father for the first time in several years, while Madonna talks with her father, Silvio "Tony" Ciccone, on the phone.  Though she insists that she can get him tickets, he is reluctant to impose.  The Blond Ambition tour stops in [[Los Angeles]], where sound problems abound. Despite reassurances, Madonna focuses on the technical problems and yells at her manager, [[Freddy DeMann]], for allowing so many people from the music industry, who appeared bored by her performance, in the front rows.  Though then-boyfriend [[Warren Beatty]] tries to console her, he is distracted by the cameras and walks away laughing. Madonna parties with several celebrities, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' co-stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Mandy Patinkin]], and [[Olivia Newton-John]]. [[Kevin Costner]] offends Madonna by calling her show "neat". Madonna pretends to gag after he leaves. Despite the lively atmosphere, Beatty still seems bothered by the cameras' presence. During her stay in Washington, D.C., Madonna attends the premiere of ''Dick Tracy'' with Beatty, with whom she co-starred.  In another voice-over, she describes a dream that she had the night before: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to her show and she thought about how jealous Beatty would be that she met him first. She declares it "a good dream". On the final night of the show in [[Toronto]], Madonna is informed that [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] officers are prepared to arrest her if she performs the simulated [[masturbation]] scene at the end of "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]".  Madonna refuses to change her show, stating, "Last time I was on tour, [[Sean Penn|Sean]] [Penn] was in jail.  I guess it's my turn."  Freddy DeMann bets that the threat of arrest will only make Madonna go further and no one takes his bet.  According to a news report, Toronto police decide not to arrest the singer, claiming that no threats were made.  The Blond Ambition tour goes to Madonna's hometown of [[Detroit]].  In a voice-over, Madonna expresses the difficulty she has going back home, especially since fame seems to change one's loved ones.  At the end of "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", Madonna calls her father on stage and sings "[[Happy Birthday to You]]".  Backstage, Tony and his wife, Joan, compliment Madonna (and Christopher) on the show, though Tony expresses his displeasure at some of the more "burlesque" aspects. Madonna and Christopher wait for their older brother, Martin, to show up while they discuss his substance abuse problems.  By the time Martin arrives, Christopher has left and Madonna has gone to bed. Madonna reunites with her "childhood idol", Moira McFarland-Messana. Moira gives Madonna a painting she made entitled "Madonna and Child", and asks Madonna to be the godmother to her unborn child. Before leaving Detroit, Madonna visits her mother's grave as "Promise to Try" plays in the background.  It is the first time she has visited her mother's grave since she was a little girl.  Madonna lies down beside her mother's grave as Christopher watches and Madonna whispers that, "I'm going to fit in right here.  They're going to bury me sideways."  As the tour continues, Madonna's throat problems worsen while Beatty becomes more fed up with the cameras. During a throat examination in Madonna's hotel room, Beatty chastises her for the documentary, telling her the atmosphere is driving everyone insane.  Madonna ignores Beatty, and when she declines to have the rest of her examination done off camera, Beatty starts laughing, saying, "She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk... What point is there of existing off-camera?"  Due to Madonna's throat problems she cancels some of her shows. In [[New York City|New York]], Madonna's doctor instructs her not to talk and she finds herself isolated in her apartment with only her assistant, Melissa, as contact to the outside world. Everything seems to fall apart and she loses contact with the dancers. ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' reports that Madonna dumped Beatty for one of her dancers, Oliver Crumes. The other dancers torment him and Madonna chastises them.  Sharon, a make-up artist, is drugged and [[sodomy|sodomized]] while partying. In a prayer circle before the final show in New York, Madonna attempts to pull everyone back together.  The third leg of the tour kicks off in [[Europe]] with everyone in better spirits. Madonna and the dancers visit [[Chanel]] in [[Paris]], fool around at Melissa's birthday party and imitate Madonna's 1984 "Like a Virgin" music video. As the tour nears Italy, the [[Pope]] attempts to have it banned, forcing Madonna to cancel two shows. [[Sandra Bernhard]] appears to cheer up Madonna. Sandra asks who would really blow her away if she could meet them and Madonna replies, "God, I think I've met everybody... oh, except that guy who's in all of [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s films—[[Antonio Banderas]]." When Almodóvar throws a party in [[Madrid]] and invites the future ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' co-stars, Madonna spends a week thinking up ways to seduce Banderas. It turns out that he is married, ending Madonna's two-year crush.  While Madonna works in her hotel room, voice-overs from her family, friends, and co-workers describe the star.  Though she is happier now than she was on her [[Who's That Girl Tour|last tour]], Sandra Bernhard does not think that she takes enough time to enjoy her successes. Others describe her in unflattering terms. Luis Camacho says, "I just feel like she's a little girl lost in the storm sometimes. You know, there's just a whole whirlwind of things going on around her, and sometimes she gets caught up in it." As the tour winds down, the group plays a game of [[Truth or Dare?]] and Madonna is dared to perform [[Fellatio]] on a glass bottle. Madonna is asked, "Who has been the love of your life for your whole life??" Madonna replies without hesitation, "[[Sean Penn|Sean]]. Sean." Madonna invites her dancers, and backup singers, one-by-one, to join her in bed, where she imparts words of wisdom to each.  While the show's closing act, "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]", plays, a montage of Madonna saying good-bye to her dancers is shown. The film ends with a clip of Madonna telling director [[Alek Keshishian]] to go away and, "Cut it, Alek! Cut it, Goddamnit!"

His four best friends accompany Charley on a drive to Las Vegas for a bachelor's fling. Charley is willing to foot the bill for Phil, Sammy, Tony, and George but is eager to get back home to his fiancee. They make a quick stop for a drink at a nightclub where Vicki Anderson, a glamorous singer, disrupts Charley's thoughts of wedded bliss. He tries to pick up Vicki after her performance but is warned that she belongs to somebody else. Vicki responds to Charley's charm, however, and offers to leave a window open at her home. Charley shows up and they end up in bed, only to be caught by her other lover—Bugsy Siegel, the notorious gangster.  Bugsy amuses himself with the notion that he will take the scared-stiff Vicki and Charley to a justice of the peace in the middle of the night and make them marry one another. Charley drives her back to California and offers to pay her expenses, but Vicki walks out. In the meantime, their wedding photo pops up on the front page of the morning newspaper—with Charley's engagement announcement to Lew Horner's daughter appearing on a later page. Charley apologizes and still wants to marry Adele. He agrees to get an annulment from Vicki and to pay a considerable sum to charity if he should dare disappoint Horner's daughter again.  Charley runs into Vicki again and can't help himself. Charley remarries Vicki, again leaving his fiancee in the lurch. Lew Horner stops just short of killing Charley, instead sending a couple of thugs to beat him and toss him into a swimming pool. Vicki is happy, too, momentarily, coming home with an offer that could advance her career, only to learn that Charley's father has died and he is needed in Boston, where he is expected to run the family's business.  Vicki puts her career on hold and spends two years in Boston, enduring high society and boring tea parties. She can't wait to get back to California and her career, but when Charley reneges on his promise, Vicki gets a divorce. Charley and his friends track Vicki to a nightclub where she has taken up with another shady figure. They become involved in a violent brawl. Charley then makes off with Vicki and marries her a third time. As a gesture of gratitude, Charley sinks millions of dollars into a movie studio where he intends to produce pictures featuring his wife. But while the careers of his buddies take off, Charley and Vicki begin to have children. Nothing at the new studio gets under way, and Charley goes broke, blaming Vicki, who walks out on him yet again.  Divorced and depressed, Charley is found by his friends quite a bit later at a nightclub, where he tells them he has recently gone into a promising new line of work: computers. He stares dreamily at the stage where Vicki is performing her act. Charley shows his friends a diamond engagement ring that he has brought with him. Vicki slides it onto her finger.  
Manta, Manta
 Bertie ([[Til Schweiger]]) is the proud owner of a well-tuned Manta. Together with his friends Gerd ([[Stefan Gebelhoff]]), Klausi ([[Michael Kessler]]) and Hakan ([[Ömer Simsek]]) he enjoys driving in his Opel Manta as a hobby. One day, while Bertie was driving his car in a peace race against a VW Golf GTI, a [[Mercedes-AMG|Mercedes]] driver Axel ([[Martin Armknecht]]), came up rapidly from behind. While sensible Gerd lets him pass, provocative Hakan chases him and hits his car which slows Axel down, but eventually they all gather at a fast food joint. Axel is offended and furiously shouts "Can you not practice on the hill you idiots?" After a few scuffles and insults from Axel towards Bertie and his friends, Bertie challenges Axel to a race which Axel agrees to only after Bertie stakes the money which he and his girlfriend Uschi have saved to set up their family home. Uschi, who gets angry with Bertie for staking all their money and because she thinks that Bertie pays more attention to his car than her, meets nightclub owner Helmut, who offers her to take part in a beauty contest, which she decides to participate in to make Bertie jealous.  Bertie and his friends start preparing for the race. Klausi, while driving in Gerd's car, which was lent to him temporarily for his birthday, reaches an ice cream joint where he mixes up the gears and his car accidentally hits Helmut. Helmut, embarrassed by this incident, starts chasing Klausi driving in Gerd's car with his Ferrari 328 GTS and Klausi unintentionally ends up sinking Gerd's car in a lake, misdirecting Helmut. Later, with the help of Hakan, they manage to pull the car out of the lake and restore it to working condition. Meanwhile, on the way to Westfalen Stadium, Dortmund, Bertie had damaged the engine of his car by over-revving it despite Gerd's warnings in a street race against a Bavarian BMW 3 Series full of Bayern Munich fans heading for the stadium. They both then push the car to the nearby workshop where Gerd previously worked and was fired from and fit the engine of a parked touring car into Bertie's car. Bertie and Gerd then get to Helmut's nightclub, where Bertie objects to Uschi's participation in the beauty contest. Helmut tells him not to bother Uschi, takes him aside, punches him and bans him from entering his nightclub. Bertie then gets heavily drunk at a fast food joint while listening with Gerd to a radio station broadcasting Manta jokes and later also a secretly taken recording of his explanation of his lifestyle to a radio station intern called Florentine ([[Lena Sabine Berg]]). Hearing this, Bertie gets angry and goes to the radio station where he creates a rumpus and consequently the radio station's security guard throws him out, along with Gerd and Florentine. The three then go back to Helmut's nightclub where Bertie happens to encounter Axel. Axel, aware of Bertie's condition, challenges Bertie to race immediately.  Despite his condition, Bertie gets into his Manta and goes to the place where the race is to be held. Meanwhile, Uschi won the beauty contest at Helmut's nightclub and after Gerd warns her that Berti is about to race despite being drunk, she takes Helmut's keys and drives off in his Ferrari to stop Bertie from racing. Uschi arrives and tells Bertie that she is pregnant and will soon give birth to his child and Uschi and Bertie are reunited. Klausi races against Axel in Bertie's place with Bertie's car. While Helmut, who came to collect his Ferrari, furiously leaves the area, Axel comes at him on full throttle and his Mercedes collides with Helmut's Ferrari, ejecting the Mercedes against a lamp post and totally trashing it, enabling Klausi to win the race.

Meet the Applegates
 The film starts off in a forest with a family being attacked by a family of huge [[Mantis|Brazilian Cocorada]]. It then moves to a typical-looking family moving into a well-off suburban [[Ohio]] neighborhood. They are the bugs that were seen earlier, after they took on human form and met every "normality" standard from the magazine ''Family Bazaar''. They moved to the suburbs after the husband, Richard, got a job at a [[nuclear power]] plant; he works there in order to cause an explosion one day that will rid the world of humans and leave bugs in peace. But after a while they drift from all-American family normalities &mdash; the son, Johnny, a straight-laced A student, begins listening to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and becomes a junkie; Richard and his wife, Jane, drift away from each other, he having an affair at work and she becoming attached to her credit card; lastly the daughter, Sally, becomes a pregnant [[lesbian]] after being raped by a jock from the high school.   They each show their true bug form at least once in the film: Johnny while smoking [[marijuana]] with his metalhead buddies, Sally while being raped by the jock, Richard when infiltrating the nuclear plant, and  Jane when two ''Family Bazaar'' agents come to their house.

 Cynthia Kellogg is interrogated by two investigators at the police station. The deposition given by Cynthia is supported by detailed flashbacks. The interrogation arouses particular suspicion about whether Cynthia's own husband could have informed the police about the incident and anything which his wife could have confided in him.  In flashback, Cynthia and Joyce are best friends who work together. Joyce's husband, Jimmy, is abusive, both physically and emotionally, and she expresses a desire to kill him several times. One night, Cynthia accompanies Joyce, and Jimmy, to a festival. When Jimmy becomes drunk and picks a fight with Joyce, he heads back to their van to go home. Cynthia follows him to make sure he gets to the van and to take the keys from him, to let him sleep it off in the van. Jimmy makes an advance to Cynthia, who spurns him and leaves him at the van. Later Jimmy is found dead in the van, with his throat cut.  After Cynthia's husband, Artie, is found shot to death, she comes forward to the police to tell her version of events. She also tells the police she thinks Joyce killed Artie to keep him from going to the police about what Cynthia told him. Meanwhile, she didn't think Joyce was capable of killing him, so she didn't take her threats seriously. The police release Cynthia, and bring Joyce in for interrogation at the same time.  In a final flashback, we see what happened with Jimmy and Cynthia at the festival. He attempted to rape her when she helped him into the van. She grabbed a box cutter and sliced his throat to get away from him. Cynthia and Joyce initially head for the hospital, but the fear that Cynthia will go to jail. Joyce's belief that Jimmy would kill both of them if he recovers convinces Joyce to turn around. They take the van back to the festival and leave him there to bleed out as if the attack involved someone else. Cynthia is then seen heading back to the police station to make a confession.

When she attends Thomas J.'s funeral, her emotions become so strong that she runs away. Vada hurries to Mr. Bixler's house, wanting to stay with him, and discovers that he is about to get married to someone else. She then runs to her and Thomas J.'s favorite spot near the tree to reflect on what has happened. When Vada returns home, everyone is relieved, including Shelly, whom Vada begins to accept as her future stepmother. Her grief also manages to mend the rift between her and her father. Harry explains to Vada that her mother's death wasn't her fault and things like that can happen without explanation.  Toward the end of summer, Vada and her father see Mrs. Sennett, who still struggles with her son's death.

He seeks refuge in a dwelling area nearby only to return and find out  his whole family has been murdered. With no aim left in life, Narsimha decides to turn to crime and alcohol. He later decides to work for a man called Suraj Narayan Singh, aka Bapji, who is a big goon lord and capitalist of the city and basically controls the law and order of the city and rules over it using muscle power and his immense wealth. Bapji was delighted to get hold of a man like Narsimha, who has wits and also muscle power, but has lost the desire to live and hence Narsimha executes his most difficult works which others can't accomplish. Bapji believes that he has become invincible and nobody can dare protest him since he has the city under his complete subjugation. He considers Narsimha as a weapon which can unlock his most difficult problems and Narsimha accomplishes them without asking any questions. Narsimha remains drunk all day and only comes when summoned by Bapji to execute Bapji's assignments and receive his payments.  However, all humanity is not lost in Narsimha and he occasionally helps out people in distress. But he remains drunk most of the time and leads life solely on the money provided by Bapji. Bapji openly declared to the city that since he is so powerful, influential and rich, hence nobody can kill him, not man or animal, neither by weapons nor any device, not in day neither in night, just like the Hindu Mythological Demon King Hiranyakshapu, who had obtained the same boon from Lord Brahma after a long penance. Hence Bapji asks the people of the city to consider him as their Lord since he completely controls the money and the goon force of the city and practically rules the city as per his own wish.  But when Bapji asks Narsimha to kill a young boy named Ravi Rastogi for falling in love with his daughter, Meenu, Narasimha refuses. Witnessing the love of the young couple as well as the revolutionary honest character of Ravi's sister Anita, humanity rekindles again in Narsimha and he joins forces with Ravi and his sister, Anita to force Bapji to get the young couple married. Narsimha openly conflicts with Bapji as he is the only one smart and strong enough to take on Bapji and is aided by his few loyal friends and Anita. The conflict escalates to very large extent and Anita, with Narsimha's help, was successful in rousing local help and mob support against Bapji's Oppressive and illegal rule. Bapji tries all the tricks in book to curb this rising opposition using his goons, muscle men etc. but is thwarted every time by Narsimha. Narsimha even kills Bapji's famous wrestlers in Bapji's private court in front of entire city and showed the whole city that Bapji was afraid for first time and hence they need not obey Bapji from now on. Bapji was later arrested by police due to his illegal activities after being pressured by the people of the city led by Narsimha and Anita. While being taken by the police, Bapji was humiliated by the people of the city who were fed up with his long tyranny and oppression. However, later he gets released on bail using his money and employing the best lawyers.  Bapji forcibly decides to marry Meenu and locks her up. He finally captures Narsimha and brings him to his palace. There Bapji informs Narsimha that it was him, who planned the communal riot which killed Narsimha's family since riots were necessary to keep the mob afraid and weak and hence aided Bapji in controlling the entire city. He then stabs a fuming Narsimha in his abdomen using his sword and wounds him fatally. Then he orders his men to bury a half dead Narsimha inside a pillar of his palace and plaster it up. Next morning, when he tries to forcibly wed Meenu, Anita and Ravi arrives with their friends to stop the wedding. However Bapji releases the prisoners of the jail and hands them weapons to control the mob. When Meenu refuses to marry and instead comes to Ravi, Bapji orders both Meenu and Ravi to be plastered alive in his palace wall while their helpless friends watch being guarded over by armed criminals and prisoners freed by Bapji. Suddenly, a wounded Narsimha breaks the pillar inside which he was plastered up, thus fulfilling his name which is synonymous to the fourth reincarnation or avatar of Lord Visnhu who broke out of the pillar to kill the demon Hiranyakshapu when called by Hiranyakshapu's pious son Prahlad. Similar to Lord Vishnu's 4th avatar, Narsimha breaks out from the pillar and takes on the goons of Bapji while his friends and people also join hands to help Narsimha. He vanquishes the goons with the help of his friends and rescues Meenu and Ravi by breaking the wall in which they were plastered up. Breaking of the pillar and walls by Narsimha disturbs the foundation of the palace and its roof and other walls starts crumbling down. Lastly Bapji gets killed by the arms of the tower clock of his palace which breaks down and falls on him. Finally Anita and Narsimha unite and so do Ravi and Meenu and peace returns to the city.

Necessary Roughness (film)
 The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. After winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit years' worth of victories. All of the coaches were fired and all of the players are banned from returning and expelled from college except Charlie Banks, the only "clean" player, who never got to play despite having "heart".  All of the coaches were forced out as well, forcing new head coach Ed "Straight Arrow" Gennero (Elizondo) to build an almost entirely new team with little assistance. No athletic [[scholarship]]s are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Phillip Elias (Miller), who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. The coaches soon have a makeshift team in place.  Due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, only 17 players are allowed on the team—not enough for separate [[offense (sports)|offensive]] and [[defence (sports)|defensive]] squads. The Armadillos are thus forced to play [[ironman football]]. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at [[quarterback]], [[placekicker]], and the [[defensive line]]. Assistant coach Wally "Rig" Riggendorf (Loggia) finds Paul Blake (Bakula), a 34-year-old high school star who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and become the Armadillos' quarterback.  Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter (Kozak). Blake then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm (Sinbad), who is also enrolled at the school and still has some eligibility remaining. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team is unable to win.  Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship which Dean Elias opposes due to their student-teacher dynamic—not to mention Elias' own interest in Carter.  Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper (Ireland) from the school's [[association football|women's soccer]] team.  When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3–3 tie with [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] (in real life, Kansas holds the all-time NCAA Division I-A record for number of tie games with 57<ref>[http://www.totalfootballstats.com/KansasJayhawks.asp Total Football Stats.com] Division I-A All-Time Wins</ref>). After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with Gennero and Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back.  With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the state of Texas, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Gennero, who is hospitalized just before the game for a potential heart attack, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they rally in the second half to cut the deficit to one, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a [[two-point conversion]]. They fake a [[extra point|point after]] attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game. After learning about his scheme to get rid of the football program, TSU president Purcell fires Dean Elias.  
Nekromantik 2
 The film begins where the first one left off, with a flashback to Robert "Rob" Schmadtke's suicide (Daktari Lorenz), whose corpse Monika (Monika M.) retrieves from a church's graveyard after the opening credits. This introductory scene establishes that Monika is not simply the local [[gravedigger]]. The [[Body snatching|body snatcher]] is depicted with a particularly feminine appearance: red [[nail polish]] in her fingernails, [[pencil skirt]] and [[polka dot]] [[blouse]].<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref> Monika apparently evades notice while carrying Rob's corpse into her apartment, where she unwraps him from his body bag. Images of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines inform viewers of the source of Monika's knowledge of Rob and his activities.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref> Meanwhile, Mark ([[Mark Reeder]]) heads to his as-yet-unspecified job, and the film then cuts back to a scene of Monika undressing Rob. Mark's job is thereupon revealed to be dubbing porn films, and this scene foreshadows the next, in which Monika has sex with Rob's corpse. Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed.  Monika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to [[Vomiting|vomit]]. The implication is that "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak".<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref> Once Monika has cleaned Rob's corpse, she takes photos with him using her camera's self-timer. She is seen [[Hug#Cuddling|cuddling]] the corpse in the photos.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref> Mark, meanwhile, makes plans to meet a friend (Simone Spörl) at the [[movie theater]]. Mark's friend, however, is late, and Mark offers his ticket instead to Monika, a stranger who happens to be passing by.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref> Monika and Mark hit it off and soon go on a carnival date, after which point Monika decides to break up with Rob. She is apparently attempting to live a normal life with a real boyfriend.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref>  She tearfully saws the corpse of Rob into pieces and putting them into garbage bags, saving just his head and genitals. She then disposes of the garbage bags. She keeps the genitals in her fridge.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref> The next scene depicts Monika and Mark in her apartment. She is showing him a [[photograph album]], containing images of several dead relatives, sometimes in their coffins. The two end up having sex, though the experience is less than satisfying for Monika. Mark subsequently spends the night at Monika's, and, through a morning raid of her refrigerator, Mark discovers Rob's genitals. This discovery, combined with Monika's desire to photograph Mark in positions that make him appear dead, plants doubts in his mind about the relationship. He does not dare express these doubts to her.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref><ref name="Halle2">Halle (2003), p. 294</ref> Consequently, Mark consults first his perennially tardy friend and then a drunk in a bar regarding his relationship with the perverse Monika.  Soon thereafter, Monika and her fellow necrophiliac friends have a movie night at Monika's apartment, suggesting that she is part of a network of people with similar interests. The film they are watching depicts the dissection of a seal. Positioned on the coffee table during their viewing experience is Rob's severed head.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref><ref name="Halle2">Halle (2003), p. 294</ref> Mark unexpectedly drops by, bringing a pizza. This brings the movie night to a premature end, with Monika hiding the severed head and her friends leaving. When Mark insistently asks what Monika and her friends had been doing, she reluctantly shows him the seal video. The images both disgust and enrage Mark, who says it's perverse to watch such a thing for fun, leading to a quarrel.<ref name="Kerekes2">Kerekes (1998), p. 76-90</ref>  The couple later speak on the phone and makes plans to meet at Monika's and discuss the matter. In the meantime, Monika makes a trip to the ocean, where she contemplates what course of action to take. When Mark arrives the next day, they have make-up sex, during which Monika severs Mark's head and replaces it with Rob's severed head. In addition, Monika is finally shown climaxing, which suggests that she has chosen the correct lover.  Finally, in the last scene, a doctor congratulates Monika on her pregnancy.  
Neon City
 In the 2050s, extensive ecological damage has resulted in largely lawless areas that are controlled by mutant raiders.  Harry Stark, an ex-cop who now works as a bounty hunter in the wastelands, saves a woman from mutant outlaws.  After she pulls a knife on him, he knocks her unconscious and brings her back to town for her bounty.  Captain Raymond, Stark's former commanding officer, tells him that the woman, Reno, must be brought to Neon City to collect his payment.  Raymond requests that Stark ride shotgun on a transport that is going to Neon City, but he refuses.  When Stark's truck blows up, Raymond claims it to be an act of terrorism by mutants.  Stark attacks Raymond, only to be knocked unconscious and placed on the transport with Reno.  On board the transport are Bulk, a former friend and ex-cop whom Stark once arrested; Tom, a serial killer who pretends to be a doctor; Dickie Devine, a clown; Sandy, Stark's ex-wife; Twink, the sheltered daughter of an influential Neon City politician; and Wing, an old man who keeps to himself.  Before they leave, Raymond gives them the opportunity to receive a refund and stay behind, as mutant activity along the road has been excessive; all elect to remain.  Along the way, they pass through a deadly Xander Cloud, and, when they stop afterward, they meet a family who is suffering from extensive radiation damage.  Stark buys a euthanasia kit from Devine and donates it to the grateful family.  Disgusted, Reno calls Devine and Stark no better than herself.  When they reach their first destination, an outpost where they are to meet with an escort, mutant raiders have killed almost everyone.  The sole survivor, Bulk's sister, is entrusted to Tom, who pretends to aid her until the others leave him alone, after which he murders her.  Reno saves Twink's life and flees the site on a motorcycle, but Stark recovers her.  Stark proposes that they continue without the escort and surprises Reno when he gives her a vote.  She sides with the majority, and they push on.  Their next stop is at a restaurant staffed by mutants.  Twink is surprised when the others treat the mutant staffers as equals.  While on the road, mutant raiders attack, and Devine is wounded.  They jettison some of their cargo to escape.  After they barely survive a "bright", an intense temperature change, Tom murders Devine.  After burying Devine, the transport encounters a shelter, where they rest and recuperate.  Tom tries to force himself on Reno, but she beats him; Tom claims she could not handle his rejection.  Reno and Stark bond as he consoles her, and she reveals that she killed her foster parents accidentally when fleeing from their child prostitution ring.  After they have sex, Reno asks Stark to run away with her, but he refuses to leave the others.  After discussing the world's ecological damage with Wing, Bulk realizes that Wing is actually Dr. Xander, the scientist responsible for much of the damage.  Xander explains that he was attempting to solve the world's problems, and, if he reached a proper laboratory, he might be able to reverse the effects.  Bulk promises not to turn him in, and they return to their journey.  During the next mutant raid, they run out of ammunition.  Xander improvises a laser weapon that saves them, but not before Sandy is shot and the transport finally dies.  Xander elects to leave for the border, and the rest walk to Neon City, which is nearby.  Tom gives Sandy a dose of painkillers.  When they arrive at Neon City, Twink expedites their entry and smooths things over between Stark and the local police, who are commanded by Jenkins, a man with a grudge against Stark.  When Sandy dies of a massive drug overdose, Tom is finally exposed.  He takes Twink hostage, but Stark kills him.  This results in a standoff between Stark and Jenkins; Reno calms Stark, and they leave together.  When Jenkins asks about his prisoner, Stark says she died during transport.  As they leave Neon City, Stark and Reno pick up Xander.  
New Jack City
 The story begins in Harlem, 1986, and Nino Brown and his gang, the Cash Money Brothers (CMB), become the dominant drug ring in New York City once [[crack cocaine]] is introduced to the streets. His gang consists of his best friend, Gee Money; enforcer Duh Duh Duh Man; gun moll Keisha; Nino's girlfriend, Selina, and her tech-savvy cousin, Kareem. Nino converts the Carter, an apartment complex, into a [[crack house]]. Gee Money and Keisha kill rival Fat Smitty, the CMB throws out the tenants, and Nino forces the landlord out onto the streets naked. Meanwhile, Undercover detective Scotty Appleton attempts to make a deal with stick-up kid Pookie, but Pookie runs off with the money. Scotty chases Pookie and shoots him in the leg, but the police let him go. Nino's gang successfully run the streets of Harlem over the next three years.  When Det. Stone comes under pressure, Scotty volunteers to infiltrate Nino's gang and is partnered with loose-cannon Nick Peretti. Elsewhere, mobster Frankie Needles attempts to collect taxes from Nino, who refuses to pay. While Scotty and Nick spy on Nino and his gang as they hand out [[Thanksgiving]] turkeys to the poor, Scotty spots Pookie, now a crack addict, as Pookie beats his junkie girlfriend. Instead of arresting him, Scotty puts Pookie in rehab, and, later, Pookie offers to help bring down Nino. Against his better judgment and the disapproval of Stone and Peretti, Scotty recruits Pookie as an informant in the Carter.  When Pookie relapses, Gee Money realizes that he is wired, and he orders the Carter destroyed. The cops find Pookie's bloody corpse, but it is booby-trapped; Nick defuses the explosives mere seconds before it explodes. Angry, Nino warns Gee Money not to make such a costly mistake again. After Pookie's funeral and no longer needed by Stone, Scotty and Nick go undercover as drug dealers. After bribing Frankie Needles, Scotty infiltrates the CMB due in part to Gee Money's increasing ambition and drug use. Though Nino distrusts them, he agrees to do business. After relating an anecdote about his own violent initiation into a gang, Nino warns that he will kill both Scotty and Gee Money if there are any problems.  Scotty gains Nino's trust when he reveals information about Gee Money's side deal and saves Nino from a gun-toting old man who had earlier attempted to convince the police of Nino's destructiveness. While Nino, Scotty, and the CMB attend a wedding, Nick sneaks into Nino's mansion to collect evidence, and Don Armeteo sends hitmen to assassinate Nino; a massive shootout erupts between the CMB and hitmen. When Nino uses a child as a shield, Scotty attempts to shoot Nino behind his back. Keisha is gunned down as she sprays bullets into the hitmen's van as they escape. Later, Selina condemns Nino for his murderous activities, and Nino throws her out. Nino later kills Don Armeteo and his crew from a speeding motorcycle in retaliation for the wedding shootout.  Stone, Scotty, and Nick arrange a sting operation to nab Nino. Kareem, who knows that Scotty and Pookie are connected, blows Scotty's cover, and a shootout ensues. Nick saves Scotty by killing the Duh Duh Duh Man, and Nino escapes. That night, Nino confronts Gee Money, who accuses Nino of egotism, and Nino regretfully kills him. After the gang's collapse, Nino holes up in an apartment and continues his criminal empire solo. Scotty and Nick assault the complex, and Scotty brutally beats Nino, revealing that it was his mother that Nino killed in his gang initiation. Nick talks Scotty out of killing Nino, who is taken into custody amid threats of retaliation.  At his trial, Nino pleads guilty to a lesser charge, claims to have been forced to help the gang due to threats, and identifies Kareem as the leader. When Nino is sentenced to only one year in jail, Scotty is outraged. As Nino speaks with reporters outside of the courtroom, the old man again confronts Nino and shoots him in the chest. Scotty and Nick are both satisfied as Nino falls over the balcony to his death. As onlookers look down at Nino's body, an epilogue states to the viewers that decisive action must be taken to stop real-life Nino Brown analogues.  
Not Without My Daughter (film)
 In 1984, an Iranian physician, Sayyed Bozorg "Moody" Mahmoody wants to visit [[Iran]] with his American family. He claims that his Iranian family wants to meet his wife Betty and daughter Mahtob, and asks them to come with him for a two-week visit.   Despite her deep fears about visiting Iran, particularly due to the [[Iranian Hostage Crisis]] of several years earlier, Betty reluctantly agrees. Upon their arrival, they are all greeted warmly by Moody's family, but shortly before their flight back to the [[United States]], Moody announces to his wife that he wishes for them to stay in Iran. Betty realizes that she has been deceived by her husband, even though Moody took an oath that they would return to the United States, swearing on the sacred [[Quran]]. When she protests, Moody strikes her, and nobody in Moody's family sympathises with her.  Moody becomes more hostile and abusive, preventing her from leaving the house or using the telephone. Betty briefly manages to visit the [[Protecting power|American Interests Section]] of the [[Swiss Embassy]], but is told that she is now an [[Iranian citizenship|Iranian citizen]] since she is married to an Iranian, and as long as she lives in Iran, she cannot leave the country without her husband's written consent and has no parental rights over her daughter. Moody, alarmed by Betty's absence from the house, threatens to kill her if she tries anything again.  Knowing that her chances of escape are minuscule, Betty conforms to her husband's wishes in order to gain Moody's trust. By chance, during a trip to the marketplace, she meets a sympathetic shopkeeper who overhears her telephone conversations with the Swiss Embassy and puts her in contact with a pair of humanitarian Iranians, Hossein and his sister, who offer to help Betty and Mahtob in their passage back to the United States. Betty accepts Hossein's assistance, especially after he mentions that Mahtob could be at risk of being forced into marriage at nine years old or be chosen to serve in the military as a [[child soldier]].  The plan becomes complicated when Betty receives news from the U.S that her father is seriously ill and may be dying. Moody allows Betty to return to see her dying father, but will not let Mahtob go with her. Betty decides to wait to return to the United States with Mahtob, but Moody unknowingly foils her by having her booked on a flight several days early thanks to his relatives' contacts in the airport.  Betty eventually gets what seems to be her last chance to escape when Moody is suddenly called to the clinic for an emergency. On the pretense of going to buy presents for her father, Betty takes Mahtob and they contact Hossein, who manages to send Betty and Mahtob off with some Iranian smugglers, and using fake identity documents, they make their way past the checkpoints.  Despite the difficult and very dangerous journey, Betty and Mahtob are eventually dropped off in a street in [[Ankara]], where they see the flag of the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] in the distance. The film's end title cards reveal that Betty and Mahtob eventually made it back home to the United States, and Betty became a successful author and dedicates herself to helping those in need.  
Night on Earth
  ===Los Angeles=== As evening falls, tomboy cabby Corky ([[Winona Ryder]]) picks up Hollywood executive Victoria Snelling ([[Gena Rowlands]]) from the airport, and as Corky drives, Victoria tries to conduct business on her phone. Despite their extreme differences socially, the two develop a certain connection. When Victoria suggests that cab driving is not much a career, Corky counters that her dream in fact is to become a mechanic. During the ride Victoria, who is evidently a talent scout, comes to realise that Corky would be ideal for a part in a movie she is casting, but Corky rejects the offer because she intends to be a mechanic.  ===New York=== Helmut ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), an immigrant from [[East Germany]] who was a clown in his home country, has found work as a taxi driver. After dark, he picks up a passenger named YoYo ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), a streetwise young man who wants to go to Brooklyn. Increasingly alarmed at Helmut's inability to handle automatic transmission, ignorance of New York geography and feeble command of the English language, YoYo takes over the wheel. Helmut is glad to pick up tips from his fare on how to become part of the culture of his new home. On the street in skimpy clothing, YoYo sees his sassy sister-in-law Angela ([[Rosie Perez]]) and forces her into the car to take her back home. Helmut is amused and instructed by the vituperation flowing between the two. When they are dropped off, he faces the problem of mastering the gears and navigating back to Manhattan.  ===Paris=== At night, a cab picks up two drunk African diplomats, who mock the lowly driver ([[Isaach De Bankolé]]) and find it hilarious that he is from the [[Ivory Coast]]. In French, when he says he is ''ivoirien'', they say ''il voit rien'' (he can't see a thing). Sick of their insults, he throws them out without making them pay. Next he picks up an attractive young woman ([[Béatrice Dalle]]), who is blind. As she cannot see the colour of his skin, he asks her where she thinks he is from. After a moment's thought, she says ''the Ivory Coast''. Prickly and sexually provocative, she rejects most of his efforts to be friendly, regarding him as beneath her, but he is genuinely fascinated by her and her predicament. So much so that, after dropping her off, he watches her walk beside a canal in the dark and drives into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind.  ===Rome=== In the early morning hours, an eccentric cabbie ([[Roberto Benigni]]) picks up a priest ([[Paolo Bonacelli]]). As he drives, he starts to confess his sins. Much to the priest's discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality, first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brother's wife, miming the actions and mouthing the cries. Already ailing, overwhelmed by the barrage of unwanted information, the priest has a fatal heart attack. Unable to revive him, the cabbie leaves him on a bench to be found once it is light.  ===Helsinki=== After an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers ([[Kari Väänänen]], [[Sakari Kuosmanen]], and [[Tomi Salmela]]), one of whom has just been fired from his job and has passed out, climb into a cab to return home. On the way, the two conscious workers talk about the terrible situation their unconscious friend is in, being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. The driver, Mika ([[Matti Pellonpää]]), then tells them all the saddest story they have ever heard. The workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. Leaving him in the cab, they pay up and stagger off to their homes. Mika drags him out and leaves him in the snow for someone to find.

Njan Gandharvan
  On a study tour, Bhama ([[Suparna Anand]]), a final-year degree student, finds a wooden sculpture on the beach. She finds it beautiful and decides to keep it. The same night in her hotel room, when all her friends have gone for dinner, Bhama takes it out and keeps it on her bed. The sculpture magically turns into a young man ([[Nitish Bharadwaj]]), who passionately kisses Bhama. Bhama is attracted to him, but he vanishes. At her study leave, while preparing for examinations, Bhama again feels his presence. She moves towards a tree, but is stunned to find a beautiful blue butterfly. She hears his voice in the air, introducing himself as a [[gandharva]] who has developed a particular liking for her. At her request, he appears in front of her as a normal man. The gandharva asks her to call him Devan and she falls in love with him. [[File:Njangandharvan.jpg|left|thumb|Nitish Bharadwaj and Suparna Anand in a scene from the film Njan Gandharvan.]] Bhama asks her grandmother ([[Philomina]]) about gandharvas.  [[Gandharva]]s, according to [[Hindu mythology]], are celestial musicians and [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] providers in [[Devaloka]], and are destined to entertain [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and lords. They are born from the sweat (or breath) of Lord [[Brahma]] and have no death, with the ability to change form or appear anywhere at will. When gandharvas commit crimes, they are cursed to roam the earth for several [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]], inhabiting [[Alstonia scholaris|Paala trees]], seducing mortal women and stealing their virginity before abandoning them. Bhama asks Devan if he would ever desert her, to which he replies that he is just a slave of Lord Indra and has no power to remember the past once they left the earth. But Devan assures her that he will stay back on earth and will never return to Devaloka. Devan hands her a [[diamond]] named [[Rudraksha|Rudhiraksham]], which is holy and divine. He adds that whenever she feels like seeing him, she just has to kiss it.  Meanwhile, Pradeep ([[K. B. Ganesh Kumar|Ganeshan]]), Bhama's fiancé, is desperately trying to woo her, which she flatly refuses. He finds Devan and Bhama together at restaurants and parks, which he reports to her mother ([[Sulakshana (actress)|Sulakshana]]). One day, Devan makes a surprise visit  to Bhama's house and stuns her. With his magical talent in music, he wins the hearts of both her mother and grandmother. Both now are willing to see her married to him.  Everything seems to be going fine, when one evening, Devan loses his voice. A voice ([[Padmarajan]]) speaks to Devan from the fallen branch of the [[Alstonia scholaris|Paala tree]], whose sap starts to bring forth blood, warning him that he has broken the laws of [[Devaloka]] and that he is to be punished for his crimes by [[Tumburu|Chitraradhan]], who is the king of the celestial city of the [[gandharvas]]. Devan and Bhama frantically try to run away from the situation, but in vain. As he is about to be taken away from Bhama, Devan motions to Bhama to not summon him with the holy [[Rudraksha|Rudhiraksham]] again. A lost and gloomy Bhama pines for her beloved in the forthcoming period, which worries her family, making them agree to her marrying Devan, assuming that would make her happy. However, when her father ([[M. G. Soman]]) asks her to request Devan to bring his parents so that their marriage may be fixed, Bhama finds herself in a quandary.  Left without a choice, she is forced to violate Devan's warning and summon him with the Rudhiraksham. Devan does not appear before her; instead, Bhama perceives the terrible lashes that are being meted out in punishment to the gandharvan.  More than a week passes, and one night Bhama finds, to her joy, that Devan has returned to her. Devan informs Bhama that he had to undergo cruel tortures in the halls of Chitraradhan's celestial palace for seven nights and seven days. While a gandharva is not supposed to come in daylight and is not permitted to meet human beings other than his lover, Devan had broken the law by appearing in public and singing songs for others. He also violated the rule of turning the mortal woman he comes into contact with into a mere slave for taking away her virginity, and gave Bhama control over him by giving her his holy Rudhiraksha, with which she could summon him at will. After the punishments were over he was given back his voice, on condition that he should not speak to Bhama with it. A worried Bhama listens to Devan as he tells her how he needs no voice, if it were not to speak to her, and that he had to wait the past two nights to hoodwink the Spies of the Night to come and meet her. He declares that he is fed up with the bondages of [[Svarga]] (Heaven), and that unlike his previous encounters with mortal women, he passionately loves Bhama, and the warmth of her family and human relationships, to the point of wanting to live and die as a human being with her. He tells Bhama that if he manages to not attract the Spies this third night, he will succeed in permanently turning into a human.  Suddenly, strong winds blow at the couple. As the winds die down, a burning celestial handcuff falls onto Devan's forearm and as he painfully manages to remove it, the Divine Creator and the gandharvas' celestial father, [[Lord Brahma]] ([[Narendra Prasad]]), speaks to the gandharvan, informing him that he and his crimes, which include his persistence in desiring the lowly mortality of earth, have once again been discovered. Lord Brahma also warns him that the harsh punishments of [[Indra]], lord of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], await him in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (hell), including having to embrace and sleep with molten hot female figurines, each one representing a moment he spends with Bhama that night, among other tortures in hells filled with snakes, poisoned spears and floors slipping with blood.  Lord Brahma informs his son that he is now forbidden from all sunlit days and moonlit nights for all time to come and that the holy Rudhiraksham which he had given Bhama will turn into powerless white dust, which Bhama immediately confirms to be true, to her utter horror. The only way for him to alleviate some of the gravity of his punishment is to take Bhama's virginity from her before the Seventeenth Wind of the Night comes to take him to hell, thus erasing both their mutual memories forever, and failing which, Brahma tells Devan, he will be sentenced to turn into a hideous, foul-smelling beast, neither human nor gandharva, roaming around for a billion [[kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]. Devan decides to refuse his Divine Father's advice, and prepares to welcome his terrible fate. Bhama advises him to leave her and go back, so that he will not have to undergo the severe tortures of [[Indra]]. She also wants to give up her [[virginity]] to him, for although Devan's memories are her most valued possession, she wants to sacrifice them in order to save him and to not have to bear the continued perception of his cruel tortures which would otherwise haunt her throughout her life. They indulge in a physical relationship that night, which she considers the most valuable gift that she can have from him. The night fades away and the heavy Seventeenth Wind of the Night comes in. When the wind moves away, Devan slowly vanishes and Bhama is shown weeping and looking far away.

The band leaves without understanding him, and a furious Alvin sentences Chris to die in "Mr. Bonestripper". The machine breaks down the instant before Chris is fed into it, and he escapes.

Chris and Diane are asked to accompany the officers to the site, only to find out that the officers involved are fully aware of and in league with the Judge. The couple escapes when the area's underground coal fires cause a collapse, destroying the town.

One Good Cop
 Artie Lewis (Keaton) is a [[New York City Police Department]] detective who believes in his work, loves his wife Rita (Russo), and is close to his partner of eight years, Stevie Diroma (LaPaglia), a widower with three young daughters. After a hard, violent encounter in a [[housing project]] while on duty, Artie and Stevie reassure each other that, although battered and bruised, they have survived.  Stevie is then killed in the line of duty by drug addict Mickey Garrett (David Barry Gray) during a [[hostage situation]]. Stevie's daughters Marian (Grace Johnston), Barbara (Rhea Silver-Smith), and Carol (Blair Swanson) are left orphaned with no relatives able to take them in. Artie is informed that Stevie, in his will, had named Artie the legal guardian of his children in the event of his death.  Artie and Rita take the children in and want to adopt them. (It is revealed the couple are unable to have children of their own). However, Child Welfare Services decides that their apartment is too small for three children, and Barbara is a diabetic who needs insulin shots.  To gain the welfare agency's approval, Artie feels he must buy a house. The one he has chosen requires a $25,000 down payment that he does not have. In desperation, he grabs his gun and a ski mask and robs drug kingpin Beniamino Rios ([[Tony Plana]]), whom he has investigated and knows is indirectly responsible for Stevie's death and orphaning the girls since Garret killed Stevie under the influence of Rios' drugs.  Artie uses $25,000 of the take for a down payment on the house. He gives the rest to Father Wills ([[Vondie Curtis-Hall]]), who runs a local makeshift shelter, and admits to Rita how he got the money for their house. Beniamino's girlfriend Grace De Feliz ([[Rachel Ticotin]]) is actually an undercover narcotics agent who suspects Artie, but his superior, Lieutenant Danny Quinn ([[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]), defends Artie as one of his best officers and no action is taken against him.  One of Beniamino's customers, who gave Artie a tip as to the location where Beniamino kept his money, breaks down under his questioning and gives Artie to the drug lord. Beniamino kidnaps Artie and tortures him to find out what he did with the money. Knowing that Artie will not reveal the information, and is about to be killed, Grace blows her cover and saves him. Together they are forced to kill Beniamino and his colleagues.  Artie writes a confession to Lt. Quinn, preparing to turn himself in for his crime. However, Father Wills turns in most of the money Artie gave him; he used only $200 dollars of it to pay for a museum trip with the shelter's children, and all of Artie's co-workers make up the rest of the stolen money. Grace refuses to testify against him after learning that Artie's actions were not motivated by greed but as a father, so the federal government walks away from the case to avoid compromising its field agents. Quinn understands Artie's motives, is short-staffed for good detectives, and out of loyalty to Artie's slain partner, whose kids will be fatherless again if Artie goes to prison, tells Artie that no charges will be filed against him. Quinn tears up the confession letter and sends Artie home to be with his wife and adoptive children.  Relieved from the ordeal, Artie happily calls Rita to tell her that he is coming home early, and that their family is still together.  
Once Upon a Time in China
 The film is set in [[Foshan]], [[China]] sometime in the late 19th century during the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Liu Yongfu]], the commander of the [[Black Flag Army]], invites [[Wong Fei-hung]] on board his ship to watch a [[lion dance]]. Some sailors on board a nearby French ship hear the sound of [[firecracker]]s and mistakenly think that Liu's ship is opening fire at them, so they return fire and injure the dancers. Wong picks up the lion head and finishes the performance. Liu comments about the perilous situation China is in, and then gives Wong a [[hand fan]] inscribed with all the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] signed between China and other countries.  Wong is the martial arts instructor of the local militia in Foshan. He also runs his own [[traditional Chinese medicine]] clinic, Po-chi-lam, and has three apprentices: [[Lam Sai-wing|"Pork" Wing]], "Bucktooth" So, and Kai. He meets Siu-kwan, the daughter of a [[sworn brother]] of his grandfather. Even though she is around the same age as him, he still has to address her as "[[Thirteenth Aunt|13th Aunt]]" as she is considered more "senior" than him. They have romantic feelings for each other, but their relationship is restrained because it is seen as taboo in the conservative Chinese society of their time.  Leung Foon arrives in Foshan with an opera troupe to stage performances. He encounters 13th Aunt by chance, has a few clumsy encounters with her, and develops a crush on her. He also runs into trouble with the Shaho Gang, which terrorises and extorts money from local businesses. A fight breaks out between the gang and the local militia while Wong is having a meeting at a restaurant with the Governor of Foshan. The gangsters flee when they realise they are no match for Wong. The Governor blames Wong for the disturbance, and disbands and arrests the militia members. Wong confronts the Shaho Gang's leader, defeats him and captures him, but the authorities release him because no one wants to help Wong by testifying as a witness in court.  In the meantime, Leung Foon meets a northern martial artist, "Iron Vest" Yim, and decides to follow him. Yim wants to become famous and start a martial arts school in Foshan, but he needs to prove himself first. One night, the Shaho Gang sets fire to Po-chi-lam in revenge, after which they flee and take shelter under Jackson, an American official. In return for protection from the authorities, the Shaho Gang helps Jackson run his underground [[human trafficking]] ring by kidnapping Chinese women to be sent to America as prostitutes. When Wong and the Governor are watching an opera performance, the Shaho Gang and Jackson's men ambush them and try to assassinate the Governor and kill Wong. Their plan fails but many innocent people at the theatre are wounded. The Governor blames Wong and threatens to arrest and execute him, but allows him to give medical attention to the injured.  While tending to the injured people in his clinic, Wong meets an escaped Chinese labourer from America who relates his story of how he and his fellow labourers were treated in America. Just then, Yim arrives at Po-chi-lam and insists on challenging Wong to a fight to prove he is the better fighter. Yim leaves with Leung Foon after he is defeated by Wong and joins the Shaho Gang – even though Leung strongly objects to Yim working with the gang. Shortly after Yim left, the Governor shows up and orders his men to search Po-chi-lam for fugitives. While buying time for the labourer, 13th Aunt and "Bucktooth" So to escape, Wong and his apprentices fight with the Governor's men until 13th Aunt, "Bucktooth" So and the labourer have escaped. Wong then surrenders himself and is imprisoned along with his apprentices. In the meantime, the Shaho Gang kills the labourer, abducts 13th Aunt and takes her to their base. Bucktooth So escapes and goes to the prison to inform Wong. The prison guards release Wong and his apprentices out of respect for him.  Wong and his apprentices disguise themselves and infiltrate Jackson's base to find and rescue 13th Aunt. Wong engages Yim in a one-on-one fight and defeats him again. At the same time, Wong's apprentices and Leung Foon overcome the Shaho Gang and Jackson's men, and save 13th Aunt and the kidnapped women. Yim is killed by gunfire from Jackson's men. During the fight on the boat, the Shaho gang leader is thrown into the furnace and burned alive. At the critical moment, Jackson takes the Governor hostage at gunpoint, but Wong kills Jackson by using his fingers to flick an unused bullet into Jackson's forehead, and saves the Governor. At the end of the film, Wong accepts Leung as his fourth apprentice and they take a group photo in Po-chi-lam.  
Once Around
 The Bellas are a close-knit family of Italian-Americans living in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Joe, the head of the family, owns a construction company. He has been married to Marilyn for 34 years and they have three children—Tony, Renata and Jan. Jan is about to get married, leading Renata to wonder why boyfriend Rob has not yet proposed to her. Once Rob reveals that he never plans on marrying her, she leaves him and moves back in with her parents.  Renata travels to the Caribbean, where she takes a course on selling condominiums. She meets Sam Sharpe, a highly successful salesman who makes a speech at a training seminar. They are instantly attracted to each other, and Sam accompanies her back to Boston, where Renata introduces him to her family. The chain-smoking, abrasive Sam is overly eager to please. While the majority of the Bellas give Sam a chance, Jan seems to have a particular dislike of him. This upsets Renata and the siblings' rapport becomes strained. Jan eventually apologizes and gives Renata her blessing.  Sam and Renata get married, with Sam relocating his business from New York to Boston so he can spend as much time with Renata as possible. At a memorial for Joe's late mother, Sam attempts to sing a song in her honor, but the Bellas, especially Marilyn, tell him it is highly inappropriate. Renata tells Sam he is tearing her family apart. They reconcile, and the next day Renata gives birth to their child. At the baptism, Sam suffers a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital.  Now in a wheelchair, Sam is welcomed home to the Bella residence to celebrate Christmas as a family. During dinner, he lights up a cigarette, which an irritated Renata throws into a glass of wine. On a frozen lake, Renata goes skating, while Sam and their daughter watch from a distance. Sam passes away while still holding his child. After the funeral, Renata mourns, but is grateful for the time they had together and for Sam changing her life for the better. Renata's father directs the funeral procession through several rotations on a traffic round-about, something Sam greatly enjoyed during his life.  
Old Scores
 ''Old Scores'' revolves around a controversial (fictional) rugby match between Wales and New Zealand which was won by Wales. On his death-bed, the [[touch judge]] confesses to failing to disallow the winning try for an infringement by the Welsh scorer. The [[Welsh Rugby Union]] president announces that in order to set the record straight, there should be a rematch between the two teams - using the same players who had played the match 25 years earlier.<ref>This fictional incident is probably inspired by the real-life incident in the first ever test match between New Zealand and Wales, played in 1905. Wales won the game 5-3 after a "try" scored by [[Bob Deans]] was disallowed by the referee who had failed to keep up with play and was 40 yards from the action. The result was a bone of contention between Welsh and New Zealand fans for decades afterwards [http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/that1905try.html]</ref>  The teams are forced to re-assemble, each bringing along not only their 25 years of unfitness, but also various skeletons in the closet - most notably the major falling-out between two of Wales's star players, Bleddyn Morgan and David Llewellyn, whose friendship had ended acrimoniously many years earlier. Morgan, had since moved to New Zealand, and initially refuses to play the match. It is later revealed that this is because of a love triangle which had developed between the two and Llewellyn's fiancée Bronwen. He is persuaded to play, for the sake of his country, but there is considerable acrimony between the two players which threatens to disrupt the team's performance.  The film is a blend of drama and comedy - the latter especially revolving around the efforts of the players to come to grips with both their middle-aged bodies and the changes in rugby since their time as international players (rugby was a totally amateur sport in 1966; by 1991 it had become big business). The New Zealand team are a rag-tag bunch whose later lives have taken them in different directions: the team's "hard man" has become a peace-loving [[Salvation Army]] officer, one of the team has become a vote-grabbing politician, yet another has become a homeless drunk. All are reassembled and put through their paces by their 1970s coach, "Acid" (a biting caricature by [[Martyn Sanderson]] of fabled All Blacks coach [[Fred Allen (rugby union)|Fred Allen]]). The film culminates in the replayed game, played at [[Cardiff Arms Park]].  According to the Helen Martin and Sam Edwards' book ''New Zealand Film 1912 - 1996'': "The dialogue is witty and characterisations are fine, if deliberately overplayed, but the ending turns the film into a shaggy-dog story."<ref>Martin & Edwards (1997), p. 155.</ref> The match ball is replaced by Wales's "lucky ball", an antique taken from the Welsh Rugby Museum by Price. With the scores tied, a shot is taken at goal, but the ancient leather of the ball is not strong enough and it deflates, landing limply on the crossbar where it remains. The final scene of the film shows an official review into the match deciding that it should be replayed again.  
Only Yesterday (1991 film)
 In 1982, Taeko Okajima is 27 years old, unmarried, has lived her whole life in [[Tokyo]] and now works at a company there. She decides to take another trip to visit the family of the elder brother of her brother-in-law in the rural countryside to help with the [[safflower]] harvest and get away from city life. While traveling at night on a [[sleeper train]] to [[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]], she begins to recall memories of herself as a schoolgirl in 1966, and her intense desire to go on holiday like her classmates, all of whom have family outside of the big city.  At the arrival train station, she is surprised to find out that her brother in law's second cousin Toshio, whom she barely knows, is the one who came to pick her up. During her stay in Yamagata, she finds herself increasingly nostalgic and wistful for her childhood self, while simultaneously wrestling with adult issues of career and love. The trip dredges up forgotten memories (not all of them good ones) — the first stirrings of childish romance, puberty and growing up, the frustrations of math and boys. In lyrical switches between the present and the past, Taeko wonders if she has been true to the dreams of her childhood self. In doing so, she begins to realize that Toshio has helped her along the way. Finally, Taeko faces her own true self, how she views the world and the people around her. Taeko chooses to stay in the countryside instead of returning to Tokyo. It is implied that she and Toshio begin a relationship.  
Oscar (1991 film)
 In the prologue, [[gangster]] Angelo "Snaps" Provolone ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) promises his dying father ([[Kirk Douglas]]) that he will give up a life of crime, and instead "go straight".  A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bank’s board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that he’s in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually "Snaps' daughter." Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa.  Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the world’s great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry "Snaps' daughter"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former [[chauffeur]] who is now serving overseas in the military.  Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' [[Dialectology|dialectician]], whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature.  Meanwhile, local police lieutenant Toomey is keeping an eye on the mansion, believing that Snaps is meeting with [[Chicago]] [[mobsters]] soon. Also watching Snaps is mob rival Vendetti, who, too, believes that Snaps is meeting Chicago mobsters. Vendetti plans a hit on Snaps in the early afternoon while Toomey plans a raid at the same time to catch Snaps red-handed.  While Anthony seeks out Theresa, Snaps meets his mansion's new maid, Roxie. As it turns out, Roxie is an old flame of Snaps, and the pair talk memories and the life that never was. Theresa comes to the mansion and is revealed to be Roxie's daughter—who was actually fathered by Snaps long ago—making Snaps her dad after all. The impromptu celebration of both his daughters' engagements is cut short by the arrival of the bankers. During the meeting, Snaps senses the bankers are giving him a raw deal—they don't intend to give him any actual influence in the bank's operations, despite the money he's willing to invest. The meeting is interrupted by police officers and Toomey, who is embarrassed to find no money or gangsters present on site. He leaves the mansion just in time for Vendetti's car full of armed men to crash right outside. Toomey smiles for reporters and arrests the men.  With the realization that he'd rather deal with gangsters and gunmen than "respectable" bankers, Snaps decides to abandon his short-lived honest ways and return to a life of crime (looking skyward and admitting to his father, "Sorry, pop... I did the best I could"). The final scene of the movie shows a double wedding for both his daughters. Oscar himself finally appears and objects to Lisa's marriage, but he is carried off by Snaps' men and the weddings end happily.  
Only the Lonely (film)
 Danny Muldoon ([[John Candy]]), a 38-year-old [[Chicago]] [[Chicago Police Department|policeman]], still lives with his overbearing [[Irish American|Irish]] mother, Rose Muldoon ([[Maureen O'Hara]]). A lonely bachelor, Danny falls in love with Theresa Luna ([[Ally Sheedy]]), an introverted, lonely girl who works in her father's [[funeral home]] as a [[cosmetician]]. On their first date, he takes her to [[Comiskey Park]] and has a picnic on the field. Their courtship eventually becomes very difficult because Rose begins to feel threatened that Theresa is trying to steal her son away; the fact that Theresa is not Irish (she is [[Sicilian American|Sicilian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]]) only exacerbates the situation.   Danny's brother Patrick ([[Kevin Dunn]]) tries to convince Danny to remain unmarried so that Danny and Rose can move down to [[Florida]], where Danny can take care of her; Salvatore "Sal" Buonarte ([[James Belushi]]), one of Danny's married friends and fellow police officers, tries to tell Danny that he can do better and not to settle down just yet, as he did. Because of this, Danny begins to feel guilty about his relationship with Theresa, especially towards his mother. This leads to his interrupting dates with Theresa to check on his mother.   When Theresa is finally introduced to Rose at a fancy dinner, Rose immediately begins to put her down. Theresa stands up to Rose, and complains to Danny as to why he didn't stand up for her. After Theresa leaves, Danny scolds his mother for being so cruel to Theresa, saying that her way of "telling it like it is" is really her attempt to hurt people. He then reminds her that she lost a $450,000 account for his late father's company by making racist remarks.  Danny then tells Rose that he will propose to Theresa, whether she approves or not.  That night, Danny apologizes to Theresa and proposes to her from the bucket of a [[Chicago Fire Department|Chicago fire truck]]. She says yes and the two are set to be married. However, even though Rose finally does approve of Theresa, on the night before the wedding, Danny calls to check on his mother in front of Theresa. Angered at the fact that they might never be alone, Theresa walks off. Both Danny and Theresa fail to show up for the wedding, thus, the two don't marry. A few weeks later, Danny's friends question what caused them to call off the wedding, but Danny avoids an answer. Then, when a friend of the family, Doyle ([[Milo O'Shea]]) passes away, alone with no wife or children, Danny realizes that he doesn't want to end up that way, and realizes that he can't let Theresa go.

Out for Justice
 Gino Felino is an [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detective from [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn]] who has strong ties within his neighborhood.  Gino and his partner Bobby Lupo wait to bust up a multimillion-dollar drug deal. However, Gino sees a pimp violently assaulting one of his girls and intervenes. Shortly afterward, Richie Madano murders Bobby in broad daylight in front of his wife, Laurie, and his two children.  Richie is a [[crack cocaine|crack]] addict who grew up with Gino and Bobby. He has become psychotic and homicidal due to rage and drug use, and seems not to care about the consequences of his actions. Richie then murders a woman at a traffic stop because she abruptly tells him to move the car. He heads off into Brooklyn alongside his goons, who are horrified by what he does but continue to work alongside him.  Gino knows Richie is not going to leave the neighborhood. Ronnie Donziger, his captain, gives him the clearance for a manhunt and provides him with a shotgun and an unmarked car. Gino visits his mob connection Frankie and his boss Don Vittorio, and he tells them he will not get out of the way of their own plans to take out Richie, whom they view as a loose cannon. While driving, Gino sees a fellow driver discard something moving from his car. Upon investigating, Gino rescues an abandoned German Shepherd puppy.  Gino starts the hunt for Richie at a bar run by Richie's brother Vinnie Madano. Vinnie and his friends all refuse to provide information, so Gino beats up all of them. He still does not find out where Richie is, but his concern about getting an attitude problem has been taken care of. Richie later comes back to the bar and beats up Vinnie for not killing Gino when it was one cop against a bar full of armed men. He also has info leaked to the mob that he is at the bar, then emerges from hiding and ambushes the mob's hitmen in a shoot-out.  After visiting a number of local hangouts and establishments trying to find information, Gino discovers Richie killed Bobby because Bobby was having an affair with two women – Richie's girlfriend, Roxanne Ford, and a waitress named Terry Malloy. When Gino goes to Roxanne's home, he finds she is dead. Gino believes that Richie killed Roxanne before he killed Bobby. Gino goes to Laurie's house and tells the widow what is going on. In Laurie's purse, Gino finds the picture that Richie dropped on Bobby's body after killing him. It turns out that Bobby was a corrupt cop who had wanted a money-making lifestyle like Richie's, and Laurie knew Bobby was corrupt. Laurie had found a picture of Bobby and Roxanne having sex. She had given Richie the picture out of jealousy, never expecting Richie to kill Bobby for sleeping with Roxanne. Laurie took the picture away from where Richie dropped it on Bobby because she wanted to protect her husband's reputation.  Gino attempts to get Richie out of hiding by arresting his sister Pattie and by talking to his estranged, elderly father. Following a tip from his local snitch Picolino, Gino eventually finds Richie in a house in the old neighborhood having a party. Gino kills or wounds all of Richie's men. Gino then finds Richie and fights him hand-to-hand. After beating Richie senseless, Gino finally kills him by stabbing him in the forehead with a corkscrew. The mobsters arrive soon after, also intent on killing Richie. Gino uses the lead mobster's gun to shoot the already-dead Richie several times, then tells him to return to his boss and take credit for Richie's death.  Gino and his wife adopt the puppy as a family pet, naming him Coraggio (Italian for courage or bravery). Whilst out walking, they encounter the same man who abandoned the puppy earlier, and Gino confronts him.  When the man attacks him, Gino defends himself, knocking the man down.  Gino and his wife laugh as the puppy urinates on the man's head.  
Other People's Money
 Lawrence "Larry the Liquidator" Garfield ([[Danny DeVito]]) is a successful [[corporate raid]]er who has become rich buying up companies and selling off their assets. With the help of a computerized stock analyzing program called "Carmen", Garfield has identified New England Wire & Cable Company as his next target. The struggling company is run by the benevolent and folksy Andrew "Jorgy" Jorgenson ([[Gregory Peck]]) and is the primary employer in its small [[Rhode Island]] town in [[New England]]. The company is doing okay and stock is rising.  Garfield decides to take over the company. After Jorgy learns that he has filed a [[Schedule 13D]] report, and after stubbornly insisting that no outsider can seize control of a business his father began, Jorgy is finally persuaded to hire his stepdaughter Kate ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), a big-city lawyer, to defend against a hostile takeover. Garfield is instantly smitten with the beautiful Kate, although he is on to her tactics and does not waver from his goal of becoming the majority stockholder of New England Wire & Cable. Garfield tactlessly and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Despite their antagonism, Kate finds herself attracted to Garfield's bold nature.  The takeover attempt begins to fracture the New England Wire & Cable Company family. Kate's mother Bea ([[Piper Laurie]]) secretly travels to Garfield's offices to offer one million dollars in [[greenmail]] to Garfield if he'll go away, but he refuses, stating, "I don't take money from widows or orphans." Trusted company president Bill Coles ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), fearful that the takeover will leave him with nothing, offers to let Garfield vote his shares in the company in exchange for a million-dollar payout. Garfield agrees, but specifies that Coles will get only half as much if his shares fail to make up the [[margin of victory]].  Garfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting. Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money. The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal.  In his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire & Cable to the last [[buggy whip]] manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete. Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise. At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.  When the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company. The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get.  Back at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate. Just then, Kate calls. She's been having discussions with a [[Japan]]ese automaker that wants to hire New England Wire & Cable to manufacture stainless steel wire cloth for making automobile [[airbag]]s, something which will make the company profitable again on a new expanding industrial product. An excited Garfield invites her to dinner to discuss it.

Perumthachan (film)
 In this Indian story, based on a Kerala legend, a pious and self-disciplined master carpenter of a supposedly mixed-caste background,  moves easily in his world, building temples and then carving the stone statues which embellish them. He is at home in his traditional world, is at peace with his inner self and the social mores of the time. By way of contrast, he begets a son who is of rebellious nature and questioning of the traditional social hierarchies of the time. He falls in love with  the daughter of a royal household which ultimately leads to his demise.<ref></ref>  Raman Perumthachan ([[Thilakan]]) is unsurpassed as a wood-carver, sculptor and architect and his creations were so exquisite that he was regarded a reincarnation of the architect of the gods.He was also a man of great erudition. Though brought up  as a carpenter, he was alluded to be the son of a Brahmin. Perumthachan himself doubted this supposition and in one part of the film he smiles approvingly when his son suggests to him that perhaps the made up story about his Brahmanical antecedents was a ruse by the uppercastes to lay claim to some of  his ability and prestige.  The screenplay begins at dusk with an old ambalavasi trying to light a stone lamp. But due to a strong gust of wind the lamp struggles to remain alight. A man lying in the tanner pandal close by gets up and places a stone slab strategically in such a way  that the path of the wind is breached. He wears a sacred thread(poonool) and hence is mistaken for a Namboodiri. But he tells the ambalavasi that he is no Namboodiri, but an Asari(carpenter) who had forgotten to remove his thread which he had worn during the construction of a temple. Immediately the ambalavasi recognises that this was no ordinary carpenter but the legendary Perumthachan himself. News spreads about the arrival of Perumthachan .  He meets up with a rich Brahmin who was his childhood friend and who is now the Thampuran of a rich royal household(Kovilakam). He is requested to oversee the construction of the family's shrine and the sculpting of the image of the goddess . The ravishing beauty of the Brahmin householder's wife Bhargavi Thampuratti([[Vinaya Prasad]])catches his imagination and he sculpts the face of the goddess in the mould of the Thampuratti. Though a man of principles, Perumthachan feels drawn to the woman whose looks he compares to 'Swayamvara Durga'; but steps back, knowing well the consequences of any indiscretion on his part. This apparent attraction leads to a minor misunderstanding towards  Perumtachan in the mind of the Thampuran and consequently he is not allowed to complete the work on the idol  to his satisfaction and is insulted by the Thampuran during the consecration of the idol.Perunthachan leaves the place disillusioned.  Years roll on and his son Kannan([[Prashanth (actor)|Prasanth]])has grown into an insightful young man of great charms and talent. Perumthachan is  proud of his son's abilities and pleased by his son's growing reputation, but is also worried by his son's tendency to overlook the traditional rules and values of sculptural art  and by the strain of unscrupulousness in the son which is a mark of the new, more materialistic and self- centred generation. It is Perumthachan's long cherished wish that he be the one who  builds the Saraswati mandapam which Bhargavi Thamburatti had desired for.  Kunhikkavu Thamburatti([[Monisha Unni]]), the daughter agrees to her late mother's wish, but it is Kannan, not Perumthachan, who is called up to do the work. The young man goes to the very household of the same rich Brahmin for whom his father had carved the image of the goddess years ago and  designs and supervises the building of the temple. In an ironical repetition of his father's experience, he falls in love with Kunhikkavu. But unlike his father, he does not hold himself back and a scandal erupts in the royal household . Seeing that the scandal is slowly destroying his old patron, the father of the girl, Perumthachan arrives to oversee the construction of the temple. He tries to cajole his son to walk away from his relationship. The son refuses to yield and the distraught Perunthachan, in a final act of desperation, drops his chisel deliberately on his son's neck, killing him during the work of the final touches to the dome of the temple.<ref>http://www.cinemaofmalayalam.net/ajayan.html</ref>  
Perum Pulli
 ''Perum Pulli'' is the story of an innocent youth and his love for his mother.  
Point Break
 Former [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] quarterback and rookie [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Johnny Utah is assigned to assist experienced agent and [[Vietnam veteran|veteran]] Angelo Pappas in investigating a string of bank robberies by the "Ex-Presidents", a gang of robbers who wear face-masks depicting former US presidents [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Jimmy Carter]] to disguise their true identities. They raid only the cash drawers in the banks that they rob—never going for the vault—and are out within 90 seconds.  Pursuing Pappas's theory that the criminals are [[Surfing|surfers]], Utah goes [[Undercover operation|undercover]] to infiltrate the surfing community. He fabricates a personal family tragedy in order to persuade [[orphan]]ed surfer Tyler Endicott to teach him to surf, after she had saved him from drowning during his first attempt at surfing. Through her, he meets Bodhi, the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathaniel. The group are initially wary of Utah, but accept him when Bodhi recognizes him as the former college football star. As he masters the art of surfing, Utah finds himself increasingly drawn to the surfers' adrenaline-charged lifestyle, Bodhi's philosophies, and Tyler. Following a clue retrieved by analyzing toxins found in the hair of one of the bank robbers, Utah and Pappas lead an FBI raid on another gang of surfers, resulting in the deaths of two of them. Despite their criminal records, these surfers turn out to not be the Ex-Presidents and the raid inadvertently ruins a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] undercover operation.  Watching Bodhi's group surfing, Utah begins to suspect that they are the "Ex-Presidents," noting how close a group they are and the way one of them [[Mooning|moons]] everyone in the same manner one of the robbers does when leaving a bank. Utah and Pappas stake out a bank and the Ex-Presidents appear. While wearing a Reagan mask, the gang leader (implied to be Bodhi) leads Utah on a foot chase through the neighborhood, which ends when Utah causes an old knee injury to flare up again after jumping into an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]. Despite having a clear shot, Utah does not shoot and the leader escapes.  At a campfire that night, it is confirmed that Bodhi and his gang are the Ex-Presidents. Tyler discovers Utah's FBI badge and angrily terminates their relationship. Shortly afterwards, Bodhi aggressively recruits Utah into going skydiving with the group and he accepts. After the jump, Bodhi reveals that he knows Utah is an FBI agent and has arranged for his friend Rosie, a non-surfing thug, to hold Tyler hostage. Utah is thus blackmailed into participating in the Ex-Presidents last bank robbery of the summer. As a result, Grommet, along with an off-duty police officer and a bank guard—who both attempt to foil the robbery—are killed. Outraged by Grommet's death, Bodhi knocks Utah out and leaves the scene.  Defying their senior officer who arrests Utah for armed robbery, Pappas and Utah head to the airport where Bodhi, Roach, and Nathaniel are about to leave for Mexico. During a shootout, Pappas and Nathaniel are killed, whereas Roach is seriously wounded. With Roach aboard, Bodhi forces Utah onto the plane at gunpoint. Once airborne and over their intended drop zone, Bodhi and Roach put on their parachutes and jump from the plane, leaving Utah to take the blame again. With no other parachutes available, Utah jumps from the plane with Bodhi's gun and intercepts him. After landing safely, Utah's knee gives out again, allowing Bodhi to escape Utah's grasp. Bodhi meets with Rosie and releases Tyler, who reunites with Utah. Roach dies of his wounds, and Bodhi and Rosie leave with the money.  Nine months later, Utah tracks Bodhi at [[Bells Beach]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], where a record storm is producing lethal waves. This is an event Bodhi had talked about experiencing, calling it the "50-Year Storm." Utah attempts to bring Bodhi into custody, but Bodhi refuses. During a brawl in the surf, Utah manages to handcuff himself to Bodhi, who begs Utah to release him so he can ride the once-in-a-lifetime wave. Knowing Bodhi will not come back alive, Utah releases him, bids him farewell, and sees him step towards the wave. While the authorities watch Bodhi surf to his death, Utah walks away, throwing his FBI badge into the ocean.

The Pope Must Die
 The plot is predicated on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] being controlled by the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] boss Vittorio Corelli ([[Herbert Lom]]). The movie opens with the death of the previous [[Pope]] followed by a deadlocked [[conclave]] that lasts for 25 days. The conclave is ended by the Mafia's tame [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Rocco (Alex Rocco), who successfully persuades the [[College of Cardinals]] to elect ''in absentia'' the Mafia's favoured candidate to the papacy, Albini (Janez Vajevec), a priest in the service of the Mafia, whom Rocco passes off as an absent "Cardinal Albini".  Unfortunately for the Mafia, the secretary of the College of Cardinals Fr. Rookie ([[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]]) is hard of hearing, and while recording the official results of the election, he misheard the pope-elect's name and instead of writing "Cardinal Albini" he writes down "Cardinal ''Albinizi''" and "Albinizi" happens to be the surname of an honest parish priest, C. David "Dave" Albinizi, ([[Robbie Coltrane]]). As a result, Fr. Albinizi becomes Pope and takes the name of Pope David I. Father Albinizi is an unorthodox priest, interested in cars, women and [[Rock and Roll]]. However, his interests in those are rather benign and not overly carnal. Prior to his ascent to the papacy, Albinzi had been a priest in an Italian orphanage, where he took a genuine interest in the children's welfare and wished them to grow up enjoying the gospel, as opposed to the curmedgeonly nuns who believe [[poverty theology|misery is deserved]]. Inside the Vatican, the Pope gets along with Bish ([[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]]), a priest in charge of coordinating the pope's security and an unnamed nun (Mirta Zecevic) assigned to bring him his meals. The pope initially considers abdicating due to a failed assassination attempt against him but is convinced by the nun to stay. As the plot develops, one of the journalists at the press conference asks the Pope to explain the corruption inside the Vatican bank. The Pope demands to see the Vatican accounts. Bish had previously received a disk upon the previous pope's death containing information about the financial irregularities and when Pope David looks into the Vatican accounts, Bish gives the disk to the pope. With Bish's help, the Pope discovers the gun-smuggling and stolen merchandise operations, and confronts Cardinal Rocco. Albinizi immediately has Rocco defrocked as punishment and to help put an end to the corruption. In revenge, Rocco persuades his mafia backers to intensify the assassination efforts against Pope David.  Together with the papal chamberlain Monsignor Fitchie ([[Paul Bartel]]), Cardinal Rocco decides to find any affair to blackmail the Pope. They find out that before joining the priesthood, Albinizi fathered a son with Veronica Dante ([[Beverly D'Angelo]]), an American tourist. Albinizi had joined the priesthood because Veronica did not want to marry him or stay with him. Consequently, Veronica had given birth to their son, but never informed Albinizi of this. Their son is now a rock star, Joe Don Dante ([[Balthazar Getty]]), dating Corelli's daughter Luccia (Khedija Sassi). Corelli doesn't approve this relationship and sends thugs to kill Joe. However, the bomb which destroys Joe's trailer kills Luccia and seriously wounds Joe who is then revealed the truth about his father. Albinizi, now Pope David I, learns about his son from Veronica and subsequently visits him before Joe dies.  Pope David learns the Vatican Bank is a tool of the Mafia, and has it dissolved. Soon after that the Pope's affair is revealed and he is forced to resign and Corelli's candidate Albini is elected Pope. Corelli and Fr. Albini move into the papal apartments. Out in the streets, Albinizi gets back with Veronica. He also finds out that the orphanage where he previously worked before becoming pope had closed. Albinizi reads the news about Albini becoming pope and rushes back to the Vatican to ask Bish to help him stop the coronation. On the way to the papal apartments the two encounter a dying Cardinal Rocco who had just been shot by Corelli. While Bish continues to the papal apartments, Rocco confesses to Albinizi who grants him absolution in his dying moments interrupted by a phone call to Rocco from his female partner. Rocco subsequently dies and Albinizi having completed the absolution rite goes to the papal chamber and finds Bish bound. Bish however tells Albinizi that the coronation was about to take place and tells him to get there fast instead of freeing him. Albinizi rushes off to the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Mons. Fitchie who had previously overheard Corelli shoot Cardinal Rocco eventually comes and frees Bish. Albinizi manages to get into the Sistine Chapel just before the end of the ceremony and reveals to the public that the man in the chapel called Albini is really Corelli in disguise. Corelli admits that there was no Cardinal Albini, declares himself as "Pope Vittorio I, Emperor of the Vatican" and draws the gun to hold Albinizi at gunpoint. He fires a few shots which hit the ceiling, causing it to collapse and bury Corelli. After Corelli is defeated, a nun (the one who served Albinizi when he was pope) is chosen to become the first female Pope in history. The new Pope (or Popess) announces that she will give the Vatican's gold to the world's poor. She also gives her blessing for [[married priesthood|Albinizi to take a bride]]. Albinizi and Veronica marry (with Bish as the priest), adopt the children from the orphanage and have children of their own as well.  
Prahaar: The Final Attack
 2nd Lt. Peter D'Souza ([[Gautam Joglekar]]) is an [[Indian Army]] officer who wants to join his battalion's specialist commando platoon. His father John D'Souza ([[Habib Tanvir]]) wants Peter to run the family bakery after him, his fiancée Shirley ([[Madhuri Dixit]]) wants him to marry her while his neighbour Kiran ([[Dimple Kapadia]]) tells Peter to follow his heart. Peter leaves for commando training at the [[Rajputana Rifles]] Regimental Centre.  Enter Major Pratap Chauhan ([[Nana Patekar]]). Chauhan is described as a nightmare for every aspiring cadet, and he proves that the "honour" is well deserved. Under his leadership, cadets get exhausted in commando training. He has a sordid past; his mother was a ''kothewali'' (a woman who dances and entertains rich people privately to earn money), who was probably sold to one of her customers. That was the last time Chauhan saw her. A classical song that his mother usually sang for practice, seems to dominate his memories of his mother and his own childhood.  The unit resents Chauhan's attitude, but this same attitude moulds them into a formidable unit. Peter hates Chauhan's approach and decides to leave. Chauhan tells him that if he flees from his training, he will be considered a coward in the eyes of the people and his girlfriend. This motivates Peter, and as a result, he completes the training and tops his class. During a rescue operation, he loses the use of his legs and is honourably discharged from the Army. Later, he writes to Chauhan inviting him to his marriage.  When Chauhan reaches Peter's address in Mumbai for the wedding, he is informed by a neighbour that Peter is dead. Chauhan learns many shocking truths of Peter's area. Kiran tells him that a group of goons was extorting money from the people of the area. Peter, having taken over his father's bakery refused to pay and challenged them. The gang killed Peter in front of the whole locality, while Peter fought like a soldier till his end. Chauhan finds that not a single person, not even Peter's father, is willing to testify against them out of fear.  Chauhan takes matters into his own hands and speaks to the police and the media in pursuit of justice. The police cite the need for eyewitnesses for filing a case while the media is disinterested. Chauhan felt that the part of civil society became corrupted and spineless. Later when the gang harasses Kiran, Chauhan vents his fury on them. He kills the goons single-handedly and avenges Peter's murder by killing his murderer.  Chauhan is arrested and tried for killing the goons. In court, Chauhan is accused of abusing his powers and taking the law into his hands. An outraged Chauhan fervently reminds the people present of all the hardships suffered by their forefathers and security personnel to keep them safe. He states that people have become too feeble to oppose injustice and, unless this changes, society is lost.  In the end, the judge sends him to a mental institution, keeping his military designations intact. Kiran goes to meet him there with her son. The movie ends with a sequence of Major Chauhan giving army training to hundreds of children.  
Popcorn (1991 film)
  College film student and aspiring film writer Maggie Butler ([[Jill Schoelen]]) has been having recurring dreams of a young girl named Sarah who is caught in a fire and being chased by a strange man who is trying to kill her. She records what she remembers on an audio tape and plans on making the story into a film. Maggie lives with her mother Suzanne ([[Dee Wallace Stone]]), who has been receiving strange, demonic prank calls recently. On her way to class, her boyfriend Mark ([[Derek Rydall]]) embraces her and tries to get her go to his place. Maggie shuns his advances, explaining that she can't be distracted from writing her script.  The university's new fledgling film department is somewhat saved when classmate Toby D'Amato ([[Tom Villard]]) has an idea to put on an all-night Horror-thon to raise funds. They set up shop in the defunct Dreamland theater, an old live theater and cinema that is to be razed in three weeks. Professor Davis ([[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]]) is concerned about the time constraints,  but Toby has enlisted the help of Dr. Mnesyne ([[Ray Walston]]), an owner of a [[film memorabilia]] shop who has the appropriate gimmicks for the films chosen for the festival. There are three main [[Story within a story#Film within a film|films within a film]].<ref name="Muir3">Muir (2011), p. 170-172</ref> ''Mosquito'' is a [[3D film]], ''The Attack of the Amazing Electrified Man'' was released with an accompanying "Shock-o-Scope" gimmick (electrical "buzzers" in seats), and ''The Stench'' is a Japanese film released in [[Odorama]].<ref name="Muir3">Muir (2011), p. 170-172</ref>  As they go through Dr. Mnesyne's trunks of equipment, they find a short cult film called ''Possessor'', that greatly resembles Maggie's dreams. Davis informs them that back in the 1960s the film's creator, Lanyard Gates, went on to kill his own family on stage in the live final scene of the film before setting the theater on fire, trapping the audience inside. Maggie soon becomes obsessed with the film and trying to figure out why she has been dreaming about it. When she asks her mother if she has heard of Gates or ''Possessor'', Suzanne becomes uncomfortable; she urges Maggie to quit the festival and wants them to go away together. After Maggie goes to bed, Suzanne receives another prank call from someone she believes to be Gates. He tells her to meet him at Dreamland so they can talk and advises her to bring a gun.  On the night of the festival, Maggie is working the box office when Mark arrives with another girl, Joy ([[Karen Witter]]). Later, a man buys a ticket and calls Maggie "Sarah" before he walks away.  Maggie chases after him and asks her classmate Tina ([[Freddie Marie Simpson]]) to watch the box office for her. Unable to find the man in the theater, Maggie goes up to the projection booth to tell Toby that she thinks she saw Gates. Toby decides to check the theater himself and leaves Maggie to run the projection booth. Meanwhile, Mark has left his date to sneak up on Maggie to scare her and Davis is busy preparing the giant mosquito model to fly across the theater from backstage that he operates with a remote control. Once the mosquito is released above the audience, a figure is shown up in the catwalks above the professor with another remote control. Davis then notices that his controller is no longer working. The mosquito model turns around and zooms back down the track to the professor, stabbing him in the chest with the giant stinger. The scene cuts to a laboratory of sorts, where a figure is seen making a mask of the dead professor's face.  Meanwhile, Maggie is trying to explain the story of Gates to Mark and she thinks Gates is there when Toby comes back to the booth upset and accuses them of playing a joke on him by locking him out of the theater. The second film starts and we see Bud ([[Malcolm Danare]]), who is wheelchair-bound, preparing the seat shockers from a control panel above the audience. Maggie makes her way back to the box office to an annoyed Tina, who starts looking for Davis.  She asks Bud if he has seen him, but he says he hasn't and that he is having trouble with the control panel. Maggie is then shown listening to her audio recordings when the tape is cut off with a message from Gates. As she tries to exit the box office, she opens the door on Mark, knocking him down and unknowingly smashing the recorder in the process. Maggie tries to prove to him that Gates is really there when she realizes she accidentally destroyed the tape. They go looking for Tina who probably saw Gates while Maggie was away.  Tina finds Davis securing the mosquito on the catwalk and goes up to meet him, where it is revealed that they have been having an affair. She is unaware that he is the killer posing as the professor, and he strangles her with a rope. Mark and Maggie find her shortly thereafter, but the killer manipulates her voice and body in the darkness and the fact that she is dead goes unnoticed.  Someone enters the control booth who Bud thinks is Tina. He is then strapped into a makeshift electric chair that is set to go off when a series of lights comes on. Bud frantically tries to free himself as the light sequence begins. As he is electrocuted, the theater loses power. Meanwhile, Maggie and Mark continue searching the theater with the help of Cheryl ([[Kelly Jo Minter]]). Mark falls down the stairs and Maggie leaves him with Cheryl while she finds her way to Bud, only to find him dead. As she approaches his body, he turns around and it's Gates. Maggie screams and runs away, having flashbacks of ''Possessor''. It is then that she realizes that she is Sarah Gates, Lanyard is her father, and Suzanne is not her mother but her aunt who saved her from being killed so long ago. She runs into Toby and tells him everything she remembers, believing that Gates has returned for her.<ref name="Muir3">Muir (2011), p. 170-172</ref> She and Toby enter the basement to find the circuit breakers and Toby falls, disappearing into the darkness. With only a flashlight, Maggie hears odd noises and thinks she sees Davis and Tina, but runs into Gates. The power comes back on and Maggie finds herself in the killer's lair, strapped into the chair he uses to make facial masks of his victims.  The killer is revealed to be Toby, who was badly burned as a child after attending the showing of ''Possessor'' with his mother. Toby's mother was a member of Gates' film cult and was killed in the fire. Toby holds Maggie and Suzanne responsible for his injuries and the loss of his mother, and plans to exact his revenge on them by re-enacting the final scene of ''Possessor'' onstage that evening, only with the ending that Gates had originally intended. He then wheels out Suzanne whom he has cast full-body, pointing her gun.  Meanwhile, Cheryl and Joanie ([[Ivette Soler]]) tend to Mark's injuries as they are met with an upset Joy, who tells Mark she saw Maggie and Toby together and that they went back to Toby's place. Mark leaves to find them and Joanie realizes she is late for her Odorama cue and goes to join Leon ([[Elliott Hurst]]) to activate the odor pellets during the third film. Leon leaves to go to the bathroom and is met by a mirror image of himself at the next urinal. After urinating on him, the doppelganger attacks Leon and locks him in one of the stalls and drops some type of material into the toilet that creates a thick smoke and Leon passes out. Soon after, there is an explosion from the stall and Leon is killed. Toby returns to the booth dressed as Leon with the plan to stab Joanie from behind, but spares her when she mentions her unrequited love for Toby. Shocked by this, Toby gets upset and storms out to continue setting up for the final scene of ''Possessor''.  Mark arrives at Toby's apartment to find that the landlord is evicting Toby. Toby's walls are plastered with articles concerning the incident, pictures of his facial reconstruction, and pictures of Maggie with scissors through her eyes. Realizing she is in real danger, Mark rushes back to the theater but the front doors are locked. He scales the building, climbs through a window on the balcony level and finds the final scene of ''Possessor'' playing on stage. Maggie has been drugged and placed in a metal dress so she has no mobility except for her head. She pleads to the audience to save her, but they believe this is all part of the show. Mark uses his belt on the mosquito track and zip-lines onto the stage, causing the secured mosquito to unlatch and swing out across the stage. The stinger stabs Toby in the chest, killing him. Mark releases Maggie and Suzanne as the crowd erupts in applause.

The Prince of Tides
 Tom Wingo, a teacher and football coach from [[South Carolina]], is asked by his mother, Lila, to travel to New York City to help his twin sister's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, after his sister Savannah's latest suicide attempt. Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and an overly proud, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at that profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty.  Tom is also torn with his own problems but hides behind what he calls "the Southern way"; i.e., laughing about everything. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin having feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. Tom discovers that Savannah has been in such a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociated state]] that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer.  Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. Tom reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom suffers a mental breakdown, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah's troubled life. After a session of football, Herbert orders Bernard to return to his music lessons and to prepare to leave for [[Tanglewood Music Center|Tanglewood]], a prestigious music academy. Tom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein's home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom's sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband's affairs. Tom takes Herbert's "million dollar" violin and threatens to throw it off the high-rise balcony unless Herbert apologizes.  Tom throws the violin in the air, Herbert nervously apologizes, and Tom catches the violin before it falls.    Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts. Tom then receives a call from his wife who has finally decided she wants him back. He loves Lowenstein and his wife both, but "has loved his wife longer, not more", he tells Lowenstein. He returns home, not being a man to abandon his wife and three daughters, wishing that two lives could be given to each man and woman. He's happy in his renewed life, after finally working out the traumatic events in his past, thanks to Lowenstein, but thinks of her daily as he reaches the top of the bridge on his drive home from work. Her name comes to him as a kind of prayer, a blessing.  
Problem Child 2
   After Ben's divorce from Flo, he and Junior move from Cold River, Illinois to Mortville, Oregon, a quiet community, as a way to start over. Before they arrive at their new house, Junior sees a girl roller skating on the sidewalk with a balloon. He pops it with his sling shot and laughs at her as he goes by. Ben and Junior arrive at their new house, and moments later, dozens of women line up in their front yard, all wanting to date Ben.  When Junior starts his first day of third grade, he sees that Igor Peabody ([[Gilbert Gottfried]]), the adoption agent from the first film, happens to be the principal at his new school. Igor panics at the sight of Junior and promptly promotes him to the sixth grade. There Junior meets Murph (Eric Edwards), the school bully who's incapable of learning, and gets on his bad side when he tapes him to the chalkboard. Murph retaliates by trying to drop the school's satellite dish on Junior, but it misses him and hits Ben instead, knocking him out. When he comes to, he sees the school nurse, Annie Young, and becomes smitten with her. Junior, annoyed at Ben's sudden love interest, retaliates by attempting to draw a mustache on Annie's picture hanging in the hall, only to be foiled by Trixie ([[Ivyann Schwan]]), the girl whose balloon he popped earlier. Throughout the film, they engage in an escalating prank war.  Ben decides to date again to find a new wife and mother, but Junior is against it. His first date is with Debbie Claukinski ([[Charlene Tilton]]) a divorced woman whose former husband, Voytek ([[Zach Grenier]]) is a slob, eats dog food, and is insanely jealous. Ben hires a babysitter named Rhoda to look after Junior. Unfortunately, she is an irresponsible slob who eats junk food and watches a TV documentary on pigs. After she insults Junior, he calls Voytek and tells him about Debbie's date, causing him to storm to the restaurant where she and Ben are. He gets into a fight with Ben, but this only causes Debbie to have a change of heart about him.   Back at the house, Rhoda's scuzzy boyfriend shows up on his motorcycle and they decide to have sex in the master bedroom. Junior uses Ben's video camera to tape them doing so, and puts on a movie showcase on the front of the house for the whole neighborhood to see.   While Ben is driving home, Debbie and Voytek ferociously make out in the passenger seat, and Ben sees several cars parked in his driveway, along with the whole neighborhood watching Rhoda and her boyfriend having sex. He is shocked and reminds Junior they're new in the neighborhood and need to attempt to fit in. Afterward, Ben's father, Big Ben Healy ([[Jack Warden]]) and his dog, Nippy, arrive to live with them after he loses all of his money in a bad investment. Ben's second date is with Emily ([[Martha Quinn]]), and Junior rewires the doorbell and she gets electrocuted. Ben is shocked at her appearance, and she falls face first onto the ground after Ben closes the door.   Around the same time, LaWanda DuMore ([[Laraine Newman]]), the richest, snootiest, kid-hating woman in Mortville, takes an interest in Ben, much to Junior's chagrin. While Ben and Junior are gone for the day, she redecorates the house to impress Ben. Junior ruins a dinner she makes by putting live cockroaches in it. Afterwards, she tells him that when she is his mother she will send him to boarding school in Baghdad. He tries to tell Ben this, but he refuses to believe him, saying he's no longer credible.  While at a school function, Ben sees the puppet show go awry. He stops it but is surprised to see it was Trixie ruining it. It is also revealed that Annie is her mother. Annie rushes to take her home: Ben tries to tell her he understands what it is like raising a problem child and thinks they can help one another. She tells him she likes him, but if they date, Trixie's behavior will only get worse. He proposes to LaWanda believing she is the only woman who will marry him.   By a chance meeting in a pizza restaurant, Ben, Annie, Junior, and Trixie dine together and have a good time, even after the food fight that the kids start with Igor and his girlfriend gets them thrown out. Junior and Trixie apologize and decide their parents should date. He tries to stop the wedding by switching LaWanda's blood sample with that of a rabid dog. While celebrating her engagement to Ben, she gets cake icing on her face, which bears a striking resemblance to foaming at the mouth (a symptom of rabies). As a result, she is handcuffed by animal control officers and sent to the hospital for observation.    At the altar, Trixie shows up operating a bulldozer with the Love Rock and LaWanda gets trapped underneath it. Ben tells Annie she's the one he really wants, and tells Big Ben to marry LaWanda himself, which he does. Junior uses his sling shot with Trixie's firecracker, causing the cake to blast off and land on LaWanda and Big Ben.

[[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]], the daughter of Prospero, an exiled magician, falls in love with [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]], the son of his enemy; while the sorcerer's sprite, [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]], convinces him to abandon revenge against the traitors from his earlier life. In the film, Prospero stands in for Shakespeare himself, and is seen writing and speaking the story's action as it unfolds.

Proof (1991 film)
 The story concerns the tribulations of Martin (Hugo Weaving), a [[Visual impairment|blind]] photographer. Through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, Martin is shown as a child, distrustful of his own mother, and also she describes to him the garden outside his bedroom window. She tells him that someone is raking leaves, but he can't hear the sound and angrily decides she is lying to him.  This childhood experience strongly affects Martin as an adult, as he anticipates that sighted people will take advantage of his blindness to lie to him, or worse yet, [[pity]] him. He has become a resentful, vaguely bitter person who spends his days taking some [[photograph]]s of the world around him, then having various people describe them. He uses these photographs and the [[Braille]] descriptions before he stamps on them as "proof" that the world around him really is as others describe it to him. He also takes secret pleasure in rebuking the romantic advances of Celia (Geneviève Picot), his housekeeper. Celia harbors a deep-seated and possibly obsessive crush on Martin, as evidenced by the scores of photographs of him adorning the walls of her flat, and takes out her frustration at her [[unrequited love]] by tormenting Martin in small ways, such as rearranging the furniture in his house. Martin keeps Celia around because her love and hatred of him means he knows she can't pity him.  One day Martin encounters Andy (Russell Crowe), and is pleased with the depth and detail with which Andy describes his photos. The two become fast close friends, and Martin soon comes to trust him implicitly. The jealous Celia is threatened by Andy's increasing presence in Martin's life. She [[Seduction|seduce]]s Andy, and Martin catches the two in the act, before Andy reluctantly lies to him about it. Celia recognizes this opportunity to foil Martin yet again, and sets up a series of events leading Martin to discover Andy's dishonesty. Martin is devastated and plunged into a deep despair, and breaks off his friendship with Andy. Later on, Andy confronts him, and tries to convince him that everyone has flaws, and shouldn't be judged on such simple terms. "People lie," he tells Martin, "but not all the time. And that's the point." Martin doesn't respond, but is swayed by Andy's impassioned words. Near the story's conclusion, Martin decides to fire Celia, but acknowledges his own role in purposely antagonizing her in their [[Love–hate relationship|love-hate relationship]]. Despite his openness she is extremely angry that her efforts have gone to waste, and when asked to return her key to Martin's house, she throws it in the sink (which is full of water).  Finally, Martin asks Andy to describe one last photo for him, one he has kept locked away for years. Martin had previously told Andy that this was the first and most important photo he had ever taken. It is a photo of the garden from Martin's childhood, taken moments after his mother described it on that fateful day. However, Andy's detailed description includes the iconic man raking leaves Martin's mother told him about, that he had rejected for all these years. This revelation provides Martin with his proof, and emotional release.  
Puppet Master II
  The film begins in 1990, when [[Andre Toulon|André Toulon]]'s grave is being excavated in [[Shady Oaks]], a [[cemetery]] in the backyard of the [[Hotel Green|Bodega Bay Inn]]. We see [[Pinhead (Puppet Master)|Pinhead]] digging Andre’ Toulon's grave. Pinhead opens up the coffin, climbs out, and pours a vial of the potion on the skeleton, with [[Tunneler (Puppet Master)|Tunneler]], [[Leech Woman]], [[Blade (Puppet Master)|Blade]] and [[Jester (Puppet Master)|Jester]] watching. After pouring the formula, the [[skeleton]] raises its arms, indicating that André Toulon is alive again. A few months later, a group of [[parapsychologists]], led by Carolyn Bramwell, are sent to the hotel to investigate the strange murder of Megan Gallagher and the lunatic ravings of a now insane Alex Whitaker. It is explained that Megan's brain was extracted through her nose '''('''''by Blade''''')''', and Alex, suspected of the murder, is now locked up in an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]]. While at the asylum, he begins to experience terrible [[seizures]] and [[premonitions]].  That very evening, one of the investigators, Camille Kenney, decides to leave after spotting two of the puppets in her room. However, while packing, Pinhead and Jester attack and kidnap her. The next day, Carolyn talks to Michael about the disappearance of his mother, due to finding Camille's belongings and car still at the hotel. That very evening Carolyn's brother Patrick ([[Gregory Webb]]) gets his head tunneled by Tunneler. Another investigator, Lance ([[Jeff Weston]]) runs in, knocks Tunneler out, and kills him by crushing him with a lamp. After dissecting Tunneler, they realize that the puppets are not remote controlled, but rather that their gears and wood are run by a chemical. From this, they deduce that the chemical must be the secret of [[artificial intelligence]].  The next morning, while still trying understand the puppet's motivation, a man named Eriquee Chaneé comes in, stating that he had inherited the hotel, and that he was in [[Bucharest]] while the investigators moved in. Afterwards, Camille's son Michael travels to the hotel, trying to figure out what happened to his mother. That very evening, Blade and Leech Woman go to a local farmer's house, where Leech Woman kills the husband, Matthew, but gets thrown into the fireplace by the wife, Martha. Just before Martha shoots Blade with her shotgun, a new puppet, [[Torch (Puppet Master)|Torch]], walks in and burns Martha with his flame-throwing arm. It is then revealed that Eriquee is really André Toulon and he created Torch after being brought back to life, and he believes that Carolyn is a [[reincarnation]] of his now deceased wife, Elsa.  Toulon then has a flashback of him and Elsa buying the formula of eternal life from a Cairo Merchant. The next morning, Michael and Carolyn go into town to find Camille and to find out more about Eriquee Chanee. During this, it is revealed that the puppets are killing because they are growing weaker and need the secret ingredient that makes that formula: brain tissue. Carolyn finds no records of Eriquee Chaneé, and starts to connect Eriquee to the disappearance of Camille and the death of her brother, Patrick. At the same time, she also realizes she has a crush on Michael. That same evening, Carolyn and Michael kiss, and have a little romantic interlude, as do Lance and Wanda, the remaining two investigators. While Wanda goes back to her room, Blade kills Lance, killing Wanda afterwards. After killing them, he uses their tissue for the formula.  During this, Carolyn sneaks into Eriquee's room, and finds two life sized mannequins in the wardrobe. Eriquee sneaks up behind Carolyn, and still thinking she is Elsa, ties her up. Michael, hearing her screams, wakes up and goes to rescue her, all while fighting off Torch, Pinhead, and Blade. On his way up, the [[freight elevator|dumbwaiter]] opens, revealing Jester and Michael's dead mother, Camille. Toulon transfers his soul into one of the mannequins, and explains that after seeing Carolyn, he decided for them to live together forever. The puppets, upon hearing this, realize Toulon used them for his evil needs, and start torturing him. Michael then breaks into the room, saves Carolyn, and the two run out of the hotel. Up in the attic, Torch sets Toulon on fire, causing him to fall out a window and die. Afterward, Jester goes back to Camille's body with the remaining of the formula.  Several days later, it is revealed that Camille's soul has been put in the woman-sized mannequin, and is now running her own little puppet show. Blade, Pinhead, and Jester, are locked up in a cage, leaving Torch free. Camille takes them to the Bouldeston Institution for the mentally troubled tots and teens. Camille puts the puppets in the back of her car, and Torch up on the passenger's seat, and drives off, leaving this movie as a [[cliff-hanger]].  
Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge
 The film is set during 1941 in [[World War II]] [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]]. A [[scientist]] named Dr. Hess is forced by the [[Nazis]], especially his [[Gestapo]] liaison Major Kraus, to create a [[drug]] capable of animating corpses to use as living shields on the battlefield after losing too many on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. But, Dr. Hess cannot get it right: While the corpses do reanimate, they have a tendency towards mindless [[violence]]. In a small [[theater]] downtown, [[Andre Toulon|André Toulon]] has set up a [[Political satire|politically satirical]] puppet show for children, starring a six-armed [[American Old West]] puppet named [[Six Shooter (Puppet Master)|Six-Shooter]], who attacks an inanimate reconstruction [[puppet]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]. The show is, next to a crowd of children, also attended by [[Leutnant|Lt]]. Erich Stein, Kraus' driver. After the performance, Toulon and his wife Elsa feed the puppets with the formula which sustains their life force, but they are watched by Stein, who informs his superior the next morning. Hess, genuinely fascinated by the formula, wants Toulon to freely share the secret with him, but Kraus wants to take Toulon in for [[treason]] and insulting of the [[Führer]].  The next day, André gives Elsa a puppet crafted in her likeness as a gift, but soon afterwards Kraus, Hess, and a squad of soldiers break into the [[Atelier (art)|atelier]] and take Toulon, Tunneler, and Pinhead. When Elsa attempts to prevent them from taking the formula as well, she is shot by one of the escort, and Toulon is dragged away from her. When Kraus prepares to leave, the wounded Elsa [[Spitting|spits]] at him in defiance, and in [[retaliation]], Kraus shoots her dead in cold blood. However, while transporting Toulon off, the two soldiers guarding him are killed by Pinhead and Tunneler, enabling Toulon to escape.  After hiding for the remainder of the night, Toulon returns to his theater to find that the stage has been burnt by the Nazis. He finds Six-Shooter and Jester and leaves with them, then discovers a partially destroyed hospital and decides to set up camp in it. Seeking [[revenge]], Toulon, Pinhead, and Jester break into the morgue to get his wife's life essence and inserts it into the woman puppet he made for her, and as she comes to life, he inserts several [[leech]]es he found in a jar into her. Later that night, Toulon carries out the first revenge attack on Stein while he fixes Kraus' car, along with Pinhead, Jester and [[Leech Woman]]. On his flight from his pursuers, Toulon subsequently finds [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] in a [[bombed-out]] [[building]].  Back in his lab, Dr. Hess is studying Toulon's formula, and desperate to meet and talk with him, he goes back to the old theater. Meanwhile, some friends from the puppet show, a boy named Peter Hertz and his father, find André and decide to live with him after Peter's mother was arrested on charges of espionage. The next day, Toulon sends Six-Shooter to kill [[General]] Müller, the supervisor of the Nazi reanimation project, while Müller is visiting a [[brothel]]. Six-Shooter manages to kill the general, but Müller shoots off one of the puppet's arms beforehand. Peter goes back to Toulon's old atelier to look for a replacement arm and is caught by Dr. Hess, who treats him kindly and gets him to take him to Toulon.  Dr. Hess finds and talks to Toulon, who tells him about the puppets' secret, and the two become friends. But Peter's father betrays Toulon by telling Major Kraus about his hideout in exchange for a pardon for his family. Kraus and his men storm the ruin, but the puppets fight back, enabling Toulon and Hess to escape. Kraus stops Peter and his father, demanding to know where Toulon is; Hertz fights against and is shot by Kraus. While searching the nearby houses, one of Kraus' men is shot by Six-Shooter; but when Hess approaches him, the soldier puts a [[knife]] into him before expiring. Hess dies from the injury, telling Toulon to keep fighting. Toulon returns once more to his old theater, where he falls asleep from exhaustion and is soon joined by the now orphaned Peter.  At night, Major Kraus returns to his office, only to fall prey to an ambush by Toulon and his puppets, now joined by [[Blade (Puppet Master)|Blade]], infused with Hess' essence. Toulon takes terrible revenge on Kraus by hanging him from the ceiling by his [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and [[neck]], which are impaled by sharp [[wikt:hooks|hooks]]. After having a [[halberd]] from Kraus' office decorations planted into the floor, point up, Toulon sets the rope on [[fire]]; the rope eventually snaps, and Kraus fatally falls right onto the halberd. The film ends with Toulon, posing as Kraus, and Peter leaving the country for [[Geneva]] on the [[express train]].

Soon after, an encounter with some street thieves knocks her unconscious and she loses her memory, then a local criminal named Frank Grimes ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) spirits Valerie away from her hotel.   A [[psychologist]] named Monosoff ([[Harry Shearer]]), knowing that Valerie has ultra bad [[luck]], persuades her father to send one of his employees, Eugene Proctor ([[Martin Short]]), an [[accountant]] with super bad luck, to find her. Perhaps he will be lucky, and his bad luck could help to find the unlucky girl. Eugene is partnered with Raymond Campanella ([[Danny Glover]]), a hardnosed investigator, who bristles at Eugene's every move.   As they travel to Mexico together, they endure one mishap after another, from damaged luggage and bad hotel rooms to bar fights with strangers. Eventually, they are told by the local police that Valerie was last seen with Frank Grimes. Eugene thinks that he can press a local prostitute for information, but she robs him. Raymond tracks the prostitute down at a gambling club (run by a man named Fernando) and confronts several men at gunpoint to retrieve Eugene's money. Neither of them realizes that Frank Grimes is seated at the table, until after they drive away and look at his picture one more time.   Raymond and Eugene return to the club and abduct Grimes to find out where Valerie is. He confesses that Valerie's extreme clumsiness required him to keep going to hospitals with her, wiping out all his money. He could no longer afford to keep her hostage. So, Grimes turned Valerie over to Fernando (Puebla). Before Grimes can take them to Valerie, he is killed in a drive-by shooting. The police arrest Raymond and Eugene by mistake.

As he recovers at a field hospital, he talks to a local man who tells about a strange woman who wandered into their village one day. She was so grateful for being taken in by the villagers that she offered to make them all breakfast in the morning, but she ended up burning the village down on accident. Musing that she might be Valerie, Raymond shows the man her picture, and he screams in terror.   Raymond and Eugene head towards the burned village in search of Valerie. Eugene nearly drives them off a cliff. After barely escaping, Raymond has had enough of Eugene's dreadful luck. In a rage, he reveals to Eugene that the only reason he was hired to find Valerie was because Monosoff thought Eugene's bad luck would somehow combine with Valerie's to create some good luck. Eugene tries to fight Raymond, but he only manages to knock himself out.   Raymond takes Eugene to a local hospital. Realizing that he has befriended Eugene, he asks the nurse to take extra care with him. When Eugene wakes up, he is in a bed next to Valerie, who has also suffered a head wound. They blithely walk off hand in hand. Raymond discovers their empty beds and spots them on the end of a pier. He shouts at Eugene to let him know that he has found Valerie.

Raise the Red Lantern
 The film is set in 1920s China during the Warlord Era, years before the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Nineteen-year-old Songlian (Sònglián, played by Gong Li), an educated woman whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, is forced by her stepmother to marry into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress (Sì Tàitai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.  Songlian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine with whom he will spend the night; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affections. It is this hierarchical competition, and the artificiality of human relations within the compound, that projects the film's strongest critique.<ref></ref>  The First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Zhuóyún, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (Méishan, He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion.  Songlian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master's time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er (Yàn'ér, played by Kong Lin) who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.  Zhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's "pregnancy". Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.  Yan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize, and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a "robe" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.  As Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, who later catches the adulterous couple together. Following the old customs and traditions, Meishan is dragged to a lone room (also known as the room of death earlier on) on the roof of the estate and is hanged to death by the master's servants.  Songlian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. The following summer, after the Master's marriage to yet another concubine, Songlian is shown wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, having gone completely insane.

It is on one of those hikes that the three kidnappers make their move. Toji calmly negotiates with the kidnappers to let Kimi go.  But once they have Toji in their car en route to the hideout, she begins giving them advice on how to avoid the police, convincing them to take her to a former servant's house instead of to their hideout. There, Toji is insulted to hear the kidnappers say her ransom is only 50 million [[yen]] (about 350,000 in American dollars of the time), and demands they raise it to 10 billion yen (a conversion to $6,666,666 is explicitly stated in the film). The kidnappers are aghast, but ultimately they comply. Furthermore, Toji also orchestrates how the ransom note will be delivered, how her family will get the money together, and how the police will deliver it.  Police inspector Daigoro Igari ([[Ken Ogata]]) takes a special interest in the case because of Toji's charity towards him in the past. He addresses the kidnappers on TV to express skepticism that Toji really is safe. Toji arranges a TV broadcast from an undisclosed location, to show that she really is safe and to instruct her family on how to sell off some of their land so that after taxes there is enough money to pay the ransom.  Ten billion yen turn out to take up a lot of space, so much so that a helicopter loaded with it barely has room left for the pilot. A second helicopter follows the ransom helicopter, but after setting down in a mountain pass, the ransom helicopter disappears. After flying an erratic path all over the wilderness, the pilot is found in a cave, drugged to sleep.  Meanwhile, one of the kidnappers has fallen in love with a local woman and decided to become an honest man; he refuses his share of the ransom. Another kidnapper does take his cut, but he takes it to mean what he was originally promised, ten million yen. And the kidnapper who came up with the idea in the first place decides to go to work for Toji as a carpenter. His first task is to repair a shrine. Inspector Igari shows up to let Toji know he has figured out most of her plan and its purpose: to evade taxes and prevent "her" mountains from falling into government ownership. Igari suspects most of the ten billion yen are hidden in the recently repaired shrine, but he also indicates he won't pursue the matter.

Kane's mental health and memory begin to falter. Her recollections of her lost spouse have never been fully reconciled within her own memory of her lost loved one. She begins to show signs of odd behavior in laying out her husband's old clothing as if her husband might suddenly reappear and need them to put on. When a storm is brewing, her mental health seems to confuse the storm for an air raid warning of another atomic bomb attack and she seeks to protect her visiting grandchildren by employing folk remedies, which confuse her children and especially her grandchildren. As the storm later intensifies again, Kane becomes more disoriented and mistakenly confuses the storm for the atmospheric disturbance caused by the bombing of Nagasaki which she witnessed visually from a safe distance when her husband was killed many years ago. In her disoriented state, Kane decides that she must save her husband, still alive in her memory, from the impending atomic blast. With all her remaining strength, she takes her small umbrella to battle the storm on foot on the way to warn her husband in Nagasaki of the mortal threat still fresh in her mind of the atomic blast which she cannot forget.  
Regarding Henry
   Ambitious, callous, [[narcissism|narcissistic]], and at times unethical, Henry Turner is a highly successful [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose obsession with his work leaves him little time for his prim socialite wife, Sarah, and troubled preteen daughter, Rachel. He has just won a [[malpractice]] suit in which he defended a hospital against a plaintiff who claims, but is unable to prove, that he warned the hospital of an existing condition that then caused a problem.  Running out to a [[convenience store]] to buy cigarettes one night, Henry is shot when he interrupts a robbery. One bullet hits his right [[frontal lobe]], while the other pierces his chest and hits his left [[subclavian vein]], causing excessive internal bleeding and [[cardiac arrest]]. He experiences [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], resulting in [[brain damage]].  Henry survives but initially he can neither move nor talk and he suffers [[retrograde amnesia]]. He slowly regains movement and speech with the help of a [[physical therapy|physical therapist]] named Bradley. Upon returning to his apartment, he, almost childlike, is impressed by the surroundings he once barely noticed. As he forges new relationships with his family, he realizes he does not like the person he was before the shooting.  As Sarah thinks it is best for all of them, Rachel is put into an out-of-town elite school for girls, as had been planned but now that she and her father are closer than ever, she is not happy to go. At orientation, he tells her a fib to encourage her to enjoy the new surroundings and people. He and Sarah become much closer, as they had been when they first met. He also misses Rachel dearly.  His firm allows him to return to work out of deference to his previous contributions to its success. Sarah suggests they relocate to a smaller, less expensive residence. As his firm takes away his old assignments and large office and essentially assigns him only busy work, he begins to realize he does not want to be a lawyer anymore either. While he and Sarah are at a dinner party, they overhear several of their "friends" making derogatory comments about him.  He finds letters to Sarah from a former colleague disclosing an affair they had, becomes angry and upset, and leaves home. He is confronted by Linda, a fellow attorney at his firm, who reveals that they were also having an affair and that he had told her he would leave Sarah for her, making him have second thoughts about himself and his relationships.  He gives documents from his last case that were suppressed by his firm to the plaintiff who was in the right all along and apologizes. He then goes back to the firm and resigns, says goodbye to Linda, and realizing that (as Sarah had said) everything had been wrong before but was now so much better, returns to her and they reconcile.  They go to Rachel's school and withdraw her and she is overjoyed to be with her parents. As they leave the building, she tosses her school-uniform hat away.

Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves
 [[Robin Hood|Robin]] of [[Loxley, South Yorkshire|Locksley]] — an English nobleman who joined [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart, King of England]] in the [[Third Crusade]] — is imprisoned in [[Jerusalem]] along with his comrade, Peter Dubois. Facing the amputation of Peter's hand by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] prison guards, Robin escapes with Peter, saving the life of a [[Moors|Moor]] named Azeem in the process. Robin, Peter, and Azeem escape through a sewer and into an alley, but Peter is shot and mortally wounded by an archer. Before making his last stand against the approaching guards, Peter has Robin swear to protect his sister, Marian. Robin returns to [[England]] with Azeem, who has vowed to accompany him until Azeem's life-debt to Robin is repaid.  In England, with King Richard away in France, the cruel [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] rules over the land, aided by his cousin [[Guy of Gisbourne]], the [[Witchcraft|witch]] Mortianna, and the corrupt [[Bishop of Hereford (Robin Hood)|Bishop of Hereford]]. At Locksley Castle, Robin's father, who is loyal to [[Richard I of England|King Richard]], is killed by the Sheriff's men after refusing to join them.  Robin returns to England to find his father dead, his home in ruins, and the Sheriff and his men oppressing the people. After telling Marian of Peter's demise, and while fleeing the Sheriff's forces afterwards, Robin and Azeem encounter a band of outlaws hiding in [[Sherwood Forest]], led by [[Little John]]. Among the band is [[Will Scarlett]], who holds a belligerent grudge against Robin. Robin assumes command of the group, training them to defend themselves and fight against Nottingham. They rob soldiers and convoys that pass through the forest, then distribute the stolen wealth among the poor. One of their early targets is [[Friar Tuck]], who subsequently joins these [[Merry Men]]. Marian begins to sympathize with the band and renders Robin any aid she can muster. Robin's successes infuriate the Sheriff, who increases the mistreatment of the people, resulting in greater local support for Robin Hood.  The Sheriff kills Gisbourne for his failure to prevent the looting of several convoys, and hires [[Celts|Celtic warriors]] from [[Scotland]] to assist his forces in assaulting the hideout. The Sheriff manages to locate the outlaws' hideout and launches an attack, destroying the refuge and capturing most of the outlaws. With the Bishop's help, the Sherrif has Marian confined when she tries to summon help from France. To consolidate his claim to the throne, the Sheriff proposes to Marian (who is Richard's cousin), claiming that if she accepts, he will spare the lives of the captured outlaws. Nevertheless, several of the rebels are due to be executed by hanging as part of the wedding celebration. Among the captured is Will Scarlett, who makes a deal with the Sheriff to find and kill Robin in exchange for his freedom.  Will meets up with Robin and a handful of his aides who survived the Celts' assault. Will informs Robin of the Sheriff's plans to marry Marian and execute Robin's men. Will continues to display anger against Robin, which motivates Robin to question why Will hates him so much. Will then reveals himself to be Robin's younger [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] [[half-brother]]; Will's mother was a peasant woman with whom Robin's father took comfort after Robin's mother died. Robin's anger toward his father caused him to separate from her and leave Will fatherless. Despite his anger, Robin is overjoyed to learn that he has a brother, and reconciles with Will.  On the day of the wedding and hangings, Robin and his men infiltrate Nottingham Castle, freeing the prisoners. Although Robin's band originally planned to free their friends and retreat, Azeem reveals himself and his willingness to fight the Sheriff, inciting the peasants to revolt. After a fierce fight, Robin kills the Sheriff, but is attacked by Mortianna with a spear. Azeem slays Mortianna, fulfilling his life-debt to Robin. Tuck kills the Bishop by burdening him with treasure and [[Defenestration|throwing him out a window]].  Robin and Marian profess their love for each other and are married in the forest. Their wedding is briefly interrupted by King Richard, who blesses the marriage and thanks Robin for his deeds.  
Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky
 By the year 2001, all correctional facilities have been [[Privatization|privatized]]. Lik Wong/Ricky Ho, a martial artist and former music student, is sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter after killing a crime lord indirectly responsible for the death of his girlfriend Keiko/Anne after a group of thugs chased her off the building to her death after witnessing their [[heroin]] deal. It is revealed in a flashback Ricky's name as a child was Rick, but his uncle, after seeing how strong he was, decided to call him Ricky.  An elderly inmate, Ma/Omar, is attacked by the captain of the cells Wildcat/Samuel. Ricky trips Samuel, who falls face first on a piece of wood with nails. After this, one of the inmates suggest that Zorro, a dangerous, [[morbidly obese]] inmate should kill him. Omar is informed by the guards that his probation was turned down after Samuel lies, telling the guards that Omar was spreading rumors. Stricken by grief, Omar hangs himself. Zorro attacks Ricky, but is killed by Ricky's bare hands. Ricky thwarts Samuel's attack and kills him as well.   Shortly after, a member of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] ([[Gang of Four]] in the English dub) named Hai/Oscar the leader of the North Cell, suggests that Ricky see the one-eyed Assistant Warden Dan. After Ricky's confrontation, Dan suggests Oscar kill him. Outside the prison yard, Oscar and Ricky engage in a fight. After losing an eye, Oscar cuts a hole in his stomach and uses his intestines to strangle Ricky. Ricky breaks free, delivering a crushing blow which kills Oscar. Ricky soon discovers that the Gang of Four is growing illegal [[opium]] for profit. Huang Chung/Rogan, leader of the West Cell, discovers Ricky set the poppy garden on fire, leading to a fight. Brandon, leader of the South Cell, throws needles to tie Ricky up with them, leaving him defenseless. Meanwhile, the guards report to Dan that the Warden is returning from his vacation, prompting Dan to raise the Zero Alarm, causing the defense system to shoot anyone not in their cell. As the fight continues, Tarzan, leader of the East Cell, arrives announcing his intent to fight Ricky but leaves along with the Gang as the Zero Alarm goes off.  The next day, the Warden and his spoiled son return from their vacation. Dan informs the Warden about the incidents, including the poppy garden. This infuriates the Warden, almost transforming into a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] like creature, though he prevents it by taking medication. As the Warden questions Ricky, Tarzan bursts through the wall to fight Ricky, which ends in Ricky dismembering half of Tarzan's left arm and breaking his [[mandible]]. The Warden activates a ceiling trap on Ricky who struggles to stay alive. Tarzan regains consciousness and holds the ceiling, only to unintentionally save Ricky by being crushed himself. After escaping, Ricky finds a photo showing Tarzan had a family waiting for him. The Warden orders the inmates bury Ricky alive, which they reluctantly obey. The Warden proposes if Ricky survives staying underground for a week, he will free him. Ricky does survive by eating dog meat, however the Warden denies him freedom. Later that night, Ricky is brought food by an inmate Freddy. Another inmate informs Dan who mortally wounds Freddy. Dan then opens Ricky's cell to taunt him. However, Ricky breaks free and kills the inmate who told, and knocks out Dan's remaining eye. The inmates then rebel and violently ambush Dan.  In the kitchen, Ricky, the prisoners, and Dan burst through the wall. The Warden shoots Dan with a homemade gas-pressured bullet, causing him to inflate and violently explode. Rogan and Brandon confront Ricky, who gravely injures Rogan. Brandon, realizing Ricky is far too powerful for him, flees from the scene, but not before the Warden shoots and kills Brandon. The Warden, revealing that he too, is a martial artist, transforms into a grotesque creature and battles Ricky. The fight ends with Ricky crippling and throwing the mutated Warden into a meat grinder. The prisoners rebel once again and start to attack the guards until Ricky reaches the prison wall, breaking it allowing the prisoners and himself to go free.

Terrified and enraged, Styles heads to the park, sees a black-clad figure who is a clown, and holds him at gunpoint. After the tape has been substituted with the video recording of Styles' rape, he vehemently protests his innocence and Blake's complicity to District Attorney Priscilla Brimleigh ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who suspends Styles. After receiving evidence of Blake's obsession, Styles and Doyle go to the bookstore that night, and Styles beats information out of the owner. Blake ambushes Doyle, fatally wounds him in the alley, and escapes.  Desperate, Styles contacts Odessa for help, evacuates his family from their home, and takes them to the housing project Odessa uses as a drug lab. Styles then goes to the roof and raves to the street below, appearing to be suicidal. Blake arrives at the project, while Styles fakes his own death by starting a fiery explosion in the building and escaping. Odessa's gang abducts Kim, and Odessa sends a message to Blake that Styles is alive and intends to get him, challenging him to come to the [[Watts Towers]]. Blake finds Kim tied to the scaffolding and kills him. On the towers, Blake and Styles fight until Styles knocks Blake off the tower, fatally impaling him on a spike. Styles reunites with his family and calls out to Odessa one last time, inviting him to [[basketball]].

Rock-a-Doodle
 Chanticleer is a rooster whose job is to wake the sun up every morning, but the Grand Duke of Owls, whose kind hates sunshine, sabotages him to make it look like the sun comes up on its own without Chanticleer's crow by sending a stranger to fight him. Chanticleer defeats his attacker, but forgets to crow, and the sun comes up without him. Detested by the farm animals as a result, Chanticleer has no choice but to leave the farm to find work in the city. Afterwards, perpetual darkness and rainfall threaten the farm with flooding.  Turning out to be a storybook read to Edmond in 1959 Midwest Tennessee, it seems that the flooding has found his family. When his mother and brothers go to help his father stop it, Edmond calls out to Chanticleer and is heard by the Grand Duke himself, who takes a dislike to Edmond's interference with his plans. Using his magic breath, the Duke turns Edmond into a kitten to devour him, but he is saved at the last second by Patou, a [[bloodhound]] who struggles to learn how to tie his shoes, from Chanticleer's farm. After chasing the Duke away with his flashlight, Edmond is met by Snipes, a [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] [[magpie]] and Peepers, an intellectual [[Apodemus|field mouse]], as well as several animals from the farm, hoping to find Chanticleer and apologize to him for their behavior. Edmond accompanies Patou, Snipes, and Peepers to the city (which is [[Los Angeles, California]]), while the rest of the animals remain at Edmond's house. En route, they are attacked by Hunch, the Duke's diminutive nephew who always calls him "Uncle Dukey", assigned by him to stop Edmond and the others from finding Chanticleer. They narrowly escape and enter the city through an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct pipe]].  Chanticleer — now under the name of "King" — has risen to fame in the city, thanks to his manager Pinky Fox, employed by the Duke to keep the rooster in the city and prevent Edmond and the others from reaching him. At a show featuring an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]-type theme, he is introduced to Goldie Pheasant as a distraction in case Chanticleer's friends come to find him. Goldie soon grows genuinely attracted to Chanticleer, and realizes Pinky's true intentions when he captures Edmond and the others trying to get a letter to Chanticleer.  Meanwhile, the Duke and his party stalk the farm animals at Edmond's house, who continually use a flashlight to drive them off as long as the batteries hold out. Realizing that she is in love with him, Goldie confesses to Chanticleer that his friends had come to see him, and Pinky blackmails Chanticleer to attend his show or never see his friends again. Chanticleer goes on with the show, Hunch inadvertently frees Edmond and the others, and they help Chanticleer and Goldie make a grand escape in a helicopter, foiling Pinky's plans and destroying his [[Cadillac]] simultaneously. They return to the farm, using the helicopter.  After their batteries run out, the denizens of the farm are nearly made a meal of by the Duke and his minions when they are driven off by the helicopter's spotlight. Chanticleer confronts the Duke, but realizes he has forgotten how to crow. The Duke taunts him and tries to drown him, but Edmond refuses to lose hope and starts chanting Chanticleer's name in hopes of reviving his spirit. The Duke grows tired of this, and as an effort to silence Edmond, magically strangles the kitten until he losses consciousness. Saddened and enraged by Edmond's assumed death, Patou starts to chant Chanticleer's name, followed by everyone else, and the Duke — furious at the animals' persistence — transforms himself into a massive, violent tornado to destroy them. Chanticleer finally remembers how to crow, and begins to sing for the sun to emerge; his cries are heard, driving the Duke's minions away. The sun rises and strikes the Duke with a single ray, shrinking him to a very minuscule size. Hunch, having survived the crash of the helicopter which he damaged in the controls earlier, barely recognizes his uncle, but uses this to exact revenge for his harsh threatenings by chasing him with a fly swatter.  As the animals mourn Edmond, he transforms back into his human form in front of them, making them realize he was telling the truth about being a little boy. As Peepers tries to wake him, he does so in his own room, with his mother watching over him after an accident where a tree collapsed into his room; this reveals that Edmond is having a dream in his unconsciousness. The sun is shining outside and the floods have ended, but his family does not believe him about his adventures and he is told to get his rest. He picks up Chanticleer's book and thanks him for coming back, before he is magically transported into Chanticleer's world, where he witnesses the rooster singing to make the sun shine.  
The Roller Blade Seven
 ''The Roller Blade Seven'' unfolds in an abstract, dreamlike structure, utilizing minimal dialogue and repetition of footage in key scenes. Several sequences occur repeatedly, such as a scene in which the protagonist is seen to get on his motorcycle and ride out of a car-park eight times in a row, leaving from a different parking bay each time.  The film follows Hawk Goodman ([[Scott Shaw]]) who is sent on a mission by Father Donaldo ([[Donald G. Jackson]]) to rescue his sister, Sister Sparrow Goodman, from the clutches of the evil overlord Pharaoh ([[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]]) in the apocalyptic world of the future. The film takes place in a region known as the Wheelzone whose populace travels solely by the means of [[roller skates]] or [[skateboard]]s. Hawk, however, arrives riding a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle.  Sister Sparrow has been abducted from the Master of Light Institute by the evil Saint Offender ([[Joe Estevez]]). Before Hawk can complete his task, he must take [[psychedelic mushroom]]s with cult movie actress [[Karen Black]] and learn to [[rollerblade]]. Armed only with his [[Katana|samurai sword]], Hawk does battle with the Black Knight ([[Frank Stallone]]), rollerblading ninjas and other gangs that inhabit the Wheelzone. Joining him on this mission are a [[Kabuki]] [[mime]] with a [[Wiffle Ball|wiffle bat]], a rollerblading [[banjo]] player entirely swathed in bandages and a pacifist named Stella Speed.  Pharoh's minions have been abducting women to make them his slaves. He explains that he uses a [[wheelchair]] due to an old skateboarding accident, and he longs for the days when he used to be able to ride a skateboard.  
Rock 'n' Roll High School Forever
  The movie begins on May 14, also known as ''Rock 'n' Roll High School'' day at Ronald Reagan High. The students decide to play a prank on the faculty of the staff, flushing all of the toilets in unison and causing the faulty pipes to burst (yet again), causing for widespread mayhem in the school, as other students leave their classrooms and run rampant down the hall with the perpetrators who organized the entire thing: four members of the band known as The Eradicators.  During the confusion, their friend (and the fifth band member) rides through the halls on a dirt bike as well.  Having had enough, the board of trustees tell Principal McGree that he is a failure as a disciplinarian, and that he is incapable of handling the school by himself. They tell him they're going to bring in someone new. The next day, an all black [[BMW]] seeping smoke from the insides arrives in the parking lot of the high school, and out steps a figure wearing a suit. Jesse, meanwhile, makes an encounter with Rita, a substitute teacher filling in for Mrs. Poindexter, the music teacher. After being chastised and asked to correct his behavior, Jesse becomes smitten with her.  After viewing the personal ads, they find someone advertising the sale of their refrigerator, and pile into their car to go to the appropriate location, posing as the ''Luthuanian Church of Applicance Worship'', meanwhile Vadar (the new vice principal) makes a new announcement for her entrance to Reagan High. Later that night Jones rigs a device to continually dial the same number over and over again to 1-900-976-ROCK to enter a contest and nominate their band The Eradicators as local heroes, in order to win tickets to go see a concert performed by [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|The Pursuit of Happiness]], before they perform a show at Reagan High to both make some money, and get their band better known, before thrashing the show after being insulted by the debutante Whitney and her friend Margaret.  Apprehended by Vadar's hall monitors at the conclusion of the dance, they are chastised by Vadar and their classes are changed to no longer coincide with one another's schedules. Further, their lunch schedules are changed as well, making it impossible for them to practice any longer. In their new lunch period, they encounter a shut-in named Tabatha, the supposed daughter of a witch, who believes that the four basic food groups are Sugar, Salt, Fat, and Booze. This doesn't curb their behavior, however, and they continue with their trouble making in a business as usual fashion, mentally traumatizing Mrs. Grossman in the process (something that enrages Vadar), which leads to Vadar implementing a new operation known as 'Reagan High Super Secret Security Program'.  Mag makes friends with Tabatha at this point, after a misunderstanding and they begin to hang out together. However, in the new RHSSSP program, the school is made into (as Vadar describes it) a school-wide detention hall. Their efforts to get the Pursuit of Happiness tickets are made useless, as Vadar and her monitors assault Screaming Steve and the Rock TV crew. Then, as punishment (for nothing at all it would seem) they are given four days of detention. At this point, Jesse is infuriated by the sentence, and vows revenge on Vadar, spurring The Eradicators to begin fighting back to protest, and they vow to play at the prom.  Enlisting the help of Eaglebauer, a business man who seems to work out of one of the bathrooms in the school to disrupt the school in any way possible, such as selling test answers and other services that clearly violate school policy. He rigs the auditions for the school prom, and they enact his plan, winning the audition in the absence of Vadar. Thinking they're on drugs, Vadar institutes drug tests which provides no solution to dealing with the Eradicators. However, they are set up by Vadar, Whitney and Marget and made unable to participate through vandalism of school property (and planting Evidence in the lockers of the four).  Vowing to get even, they go to even greater lengths than before to get vengeance, and use video cameras this time around, taping numerous embarrassing situations, such as Bob and Margaret cheating on Whitney and Donovan, Whitney projectile vomiting on a teacher, Donovan posing with women's underwear, and Vadar having an intimate moment with a submissive slave in her office. They also trick the band Zillion Kisses, getting them to set up and wait in the school's storage room during the prom. The Eradicators make their appearance at the prom, meanwhile. Upon the appearance of the Yupettes, the Eradicators begin playing the video tapes that they've managed to record over the previous week.  Severely embarrassing (and causing infighting among the Yupettes) the Yupettes and Vadar, the situation causes Vadar to go on a homicidal rampage. Driving her car through the school grounds, she has no regard for the safety of anyone on the school grounds. During the aftermath, she tries to kill The Eradicators, as well as Eaglebauer, and even substitute teacher Rita. Not so easily defeated, however, the Eradicators continue to fight back even against the vehicular attempt at manslaughter, and slick a section of the school with chemical extinguishers, which cause Vadar to crash into the school, causing it to explode, and the school catches fire for the second time in 12 years.  During the final sequence, when everyone is witnessing the destruction of the school something emerges from the fire, which quickly turns out to be a flaming tire (which no one attempts to stop, and continues rolling even after the credits finish rolling).  
The Rocketeer (film)
 In 1938 [[Los Angeles]], two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a [[rocket pack]] from [[Howard Hughes]]. During their escape from the authorities that ends up on an airfield, one gangster is shot to death, the getaway driver hides the rocket pack, and [[Stunt pilot]] Cliff Secord's [[Gee Bee Model Z|Gee Bee racer]] is totaled in the resulting auto-airplane accident, crippling his career; he and [[Aircraft maintenance technician|airplane mechanic]] Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, and he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him the rocket pack is at the airfield.  Cliff's girlfriend is aspiring actress Jenny Blake, who has a bit part in Sinclair's latest [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] film, but recent events begin to drive a wedge in their relationship. Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local [[air show]], Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting the biplane. The newsreel press and Valentine's gangsters all see him from the airshow audience, whereupon "The Rocketeer" becomes a media sensation, but also sets Sinclair and the [[FBI]] on Cliff's tail.  Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new rocket-powered alter ego. The Valentine Gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.  At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a [[Nazi]] [[secret agent]] and knocks him out. She is later detained and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the [[Griffith Observatory]] in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the jet pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing; he shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes must be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes (using a scale model prototype of the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules|Spruce Goose]] as a glider), but inadvertently leaves behind a clue to where he is headed.  Cliff flies to the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands that Cliff give him the jet pack. Cliff divulges to the mobsters that the actor is a Nazi; Valentine's gang turn their weapons on Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons sixty heavily armed Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|S.A.]] stormtroopers hidden at the observatory. The Nazi [[rigid airship]] ''Luxembourg'' (under the guise of a peace mission) appears overhead to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship.  Cliff flies to and boards the airship, but during the ensuing showdown, Jenny accidentally sets the bridge on fire with a [[flare gun]]. Sinclair holds Jenny hostage, forcing Cliff to give him the rocket, but not before he secretly removes the chewing gum patch, allowing fuel to leak near the jet pack's exhaust. Sinclair dons the rocket pack and flies off, but the leaked fuel causes the rocket pack to catch on fire, causing Sinclair to plummet to his death on fire near the [[Hollywood Sign|HOLLYWOODLAND sign]]; the resulting explosion destroys the "LAND" part of the sign. Lothar is engulfed in flames as the airship explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued at the last moment by Hughes and Peevy flying an [[autogyro]].  Hughes later presents Cliff with a brand-new Gee Bee air racer and a fresh pack of [[Beemans gum]]. As Hughes leaves, Jenny returns Peevy's rocket pack blueprints, which she found in Sinclair's home; Peevy decides that, with some modifications, he can build an even better one.  
Rölli – hirmuisia kertomuksia
 The film begins with Rölli going to look for some [[firewood]]. As he is about to chop an old [[tree]], the tree begins to speak to him begging to instead collect the dead branches from the ground, promising that he'll repay the favour if he ever has the chance. All the while, Rölli is stalked by Big Rölli. He encounters a Forest Fairy (Maahiskeiju) and tries to scare her, but gets captured by Big Rölli instead. The Forest Fairy uses a log which the Big Rölli dragged with him to hit him on his foot to release Rölli. The two escape from Big Rölli and become friends.  Meanwhile, the owner of a toy company, Seesteinen (Risto Kaskilahti), and his butler Lerkkanen come to Rölli Forest to inspect it for the building of a new toy-factory. Rölli and the Forest Fairy try to scare them off by pretending to be a giant, but they're plan fails and the humans give chance. They, however, run into Big Rölli and flee the forest in their [[jeep]]. However, ''the High Priest of the Kingdom of Evil'' (Rolf Labbart), has plans for the two humans. He causes the car to veer off the road and both Seesteinen and Lerkkanen are taken by the Priests lackeys, The Trashers, to their secret lair where they're brought before the Great Trash, a monstrous creature with the vague resemblance of a human head, which the Trashers worship. They are converted into Trashers and begin to plot the destruction of the Rölli Forest.  Seesteinen, pretending to be a good fairy god spirit, convinces Rölli that the sudden amounts of trash that have appeared all over the forest, confusing the residents and turning them on one another, are a good thing. He also leaves him a bottle of [[whisky]] telling it is a magic potion. Rölli becomes violently drunk and chases the Forest Fairy away. Disappointed at her own inability to stop the pollution in the forest she decides to leave but is captured by the Trashers.   Rölli regains his composure and realises that the other inhabitants of the forest are being fooled with an elaborate shopping mall like structure, where they dance to peppy music before being sucked down into the Trashers' lair and converted. Rölli tries to sneak in but is caught. At the lair he is reunited with Forest Fairy. At the same time Big Rölli stumbles upon the fake shopping mall and is also sucked down, but the Trashers are easily over-powered by him. He constantly grooms himself with a piece of a [[broom]] he got when the Forest Fairy hit him over the head with it earlier in the film. Brooms and brushes are the Trasher's and the Great Trash's only weakness and thus the Trashers try to get it. The agitated Big Rölli throws the brush at the Trashers and it bounces off their helmets into the mouth of the Great Trash. He begins to deflate and this causes the cave to collapse. The Trashers flee in horror and seem to regain their prior personalities.  Rölli and the Forest Fairy escape also, arriving at the very same tree that Rölli spared earlier in the film. The High Priest ambushes them and reveals his face which has begun to deteriorate due to his defeat. In a final effort he tries to kill Rölli and the Forest Fairy but the tree begins to scream, bewildering him. As his cape is stuck in a nook the tree falls on him killing him.

Rush (1991 film)
  In [[Texas]], seasoned [[undercover]] narcotics police officer Jim Raynor is told by his superior Lt. Dodd to choose a partner from a group of recent [[police academy]] graduates for his undercover investigation, which has been ongoing for two years. His choice of Kristen Cates surprises Dodd, but Raynor is confident she is the right fit for what he needs.  Raynor explains to Cates that all they will have is each other in this assignment. They are caught between the legal world and the illegal underworld, belonging to neither and able to trust only one another. Though initially startled by Raynor's intensity, Cates insists she is capable of doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Later at Raynor's apartment, he teaches Cates how to properly [[shoot up]] [[heroin]]. Cates informs Raynor that she was instructed how to fake drug use at the police academy, which prompts a strong rebuke from Raynor. He informs her in no uncertain terms that she will be put in situations where she will ''have'' to take the drugs they will be buying. The drug dealers they will be doing business with are not stupid, and if she tries to fake drug use in front of them, she will get both of them killed.  Raynor and now Cates's main objective in their operation is to take down the cunning, mysterious, and powerful Will Gaines. While Raynor (and the police department) is certain Gaines is the main drug boss in the town, Gaines is an expert at avoiding detection, and deeply mistrustful of Raynor. Unable to secure access to him, Cates and Raynor buy large quantities of drugs from minor dealers in the town. These drugs are cataloged and given to Dodd, along with information detailing from whom they bought the drugs. Raynor and Cates quickly go from pretending to be lovers to the real thing.  As Raynor predicted, Cates is soon put into a position where she is forced to inject drugs in front of a drug dealer. Raynor tries to intervene and tell the dealer that "his lady doesn't fix", but the dealer insists at gunpoint. Cates first tries nervously to talk her way out of the situation, then yanks off her jacket and with shaking hands begins to prepare a heroin shot as Raynor had taught her. Seeing her high level of anxiety, Raynor takes the prepared needle from her and injects it into her arm. While the dealer watches approvingly and laughs, Cates quietly vomits off screen.  Soon enough, Cates is [[addiction|addicted]] to the drugs she has to use to maintain her cover, and Raynor arrives home one day to find Cates combing the carpet, desperately searching for any crumbs of drugs that may have fallen. Raynor nurses Cates through her [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] while appearing largely unaffected by his own drug use. However, over the course of the film he becomes even more addicted than she. Eventually, both are able to get clean, but remain traumatized and scarred by their drug experiences.  Though they have successfully infiltrated the town's drug underworld, Raynor and Cates are no closer to obtaining evidence against Gaines. Under pressure from the department, they falsify evidence against Gaines in order to secure his arrest and indictment. They move into a small trailer awaiting the beginning of the trial. Cates is startled awake one evening by a double barrel [[shotgun]] caressing her face.  A gunfight ensues in which Raynor is shot in the thigh, striking his [[femoral artery]]. Cates frantically goes for help, then returns to the trailer to find Raynor barely conscious. He dies in her arms.  At Gaines's trial, Cates is on the witness stand. During her testimony, she mentions that she has resigned from the police force. Her testimony sticks to the fabricated story Raynor and she concocted, and appears to earn the support of the jury and courtroom spectators. When she looks directly at Gaines, however, he slides two fingers down the bridge of his nose, mimicking the movement of the shotgun that eventually killed Raynor. Stunned, Cates retracts her statements about Gaines's involvement in the drug trade, and testifies that they were ordered to fabricate evidence by the Chief of Police. This of course secures Gaines's acquittal.  Freed from police custody, Gaines gets into his car a few nights later. As he drives down the road, he notices someone hiding in the backseat. Gaines pulls over, and as he turns to confront them, he is killed by a double barrel shotgun blast to the face. The killer is never shown, but it is implied is that it is Cates.

Sadak
 Maharani ([[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]]) is an evil madam running a brothel that employs many girls like Pooja ([[Pooja Bhatt]]) and Chanda ([[Neelima Azeem]]). Ravi ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), a taxi driver, meets Pooja before she is bought by Maharani, and his friend Gotya ([[Deepak Tijori]]) is in love with Chanda. Ravi witnessed his sister Roopa ([[Soni Razdan]]) plunge to her death after being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. She had eloped with her lover who sold her off at a brothel and forced her to become a prostitute. This violent incident has left Ravi traumatised and scarred for life, as he has become an insomniac who keeps having disturbing visions of his sister's death and is restless and violent on occasions. On one of his taxi-plying days, he meets Inspector Irani ([[Pankaj Dheer]]), who Ravi recognises from an article that was published about the cop when he had won a medal. Ravi drops him off to his destination, refuses to take any money from him and the cop tells him to come to him if he ever needs help of any kind.  Ravi meets Pooja again as she tries to flee the brothel of Maharani and tries to help her in vain. He procures his life's savings, a meagre sum of thirty thousand rupees from Salim Bhai ([[Avtar Gill]]), his taxi's owner and takes out Pooja for one night, posing as her customer. He does so with the help of his friend Gotya and a pimp Gullu ([[Mushtaq Khan]]). Gotya, however, is held as collateral under Maharani's orders in case Pooja is not safely returned. They roam around Bombay, spend some romantic time with each other, during which Ravi tells Pooja that he loves her and would keep on coming back to the brothel for her every night (presumably—so that she is not sold to other customers).  The next night, Ravi mortgages the taxi and goes back to the brothel. He is, however, chided by Maharani who suspects he's either mad or in love with Pooja for offering high sums of money for her on consecutive nights. She also tells Ravi that since she has been running this business for the past thirty years, she knew when Pooja came back in the morning that Ravi did not sleep with her. After much argument, and requests from Ravi and Gotya, Maharani agrees to letting him spend the night with Pooja under the condition that he have sex with her in front of her. Ravi agrees, and then stabs Maharani, and escapes with Pooja in the ensuing chaos. Gotya also grabs his girlfriend Chanda and escapes. They run away to a distant location where Gotya and Chanda get married in a temple with the blessings of Ravi and Pooja. All four come back and take refuge with Salim Bhai.  In the meantime, Maharani's henchmen find the pimp and break his legs. Salim Bhai advises Ravi and Gotya to enlist police protection and Ravi decides to approach Inspector Irani. He assures them of his help and asks them to meet him in the parking lot of an apartment complex at a scheduled time. However, when the four reach there, Maharani and his henchmen are already waiting and attack them with firearms. As the four try to escape, Gotya and Chanda are both shot and Ravi manages to escape with Pooja in Irani's police jeep. Once they reach safety, he calls up Irani and warns him that he will have to pay heavily for his betrayal.  Pooja is, however, captured again by Maharani, after Ravi is tortured and left for dead. Ravi, remembering that the fate of his sister and Pooja are the same, regains his lost strength. He fights his way back to Maharani by killing Inspector Irani and setting ablaze to Maharani's brothel and finally killing Maharani and rescuing Pooja.

Immediately after the attack Angela is found by twin brothers (both played by Railsback) who live next door to her.  The first brother Alex is the star of a successful soap opera, whereas the other, Cole, is a wheelchair-bound artist. An attraction develops between Angela and Alex, which is constantly restrained by Angela's sexual repression. [[Hypnotherapy]] sessions with her psychiatrist Dr. Steven Carter (Cox) reveal a red-bearded man named Billy in Angela's past, a startling coincidence to her recent attack.  Following her attack in the elevator, the increasing attention from Alex, and the fear of Cole she develops, Angela's sheltered world starts to fall apart.  After another encounter with her red-bearded attacker, and harassment from Cole, Angela finds herself lured with the prospect of a job to a large and mysterious apartment where she finds herself trapped.  In the master bedroom, Angela finds the body of her red-bearded attacker, who has been murdered with the same pair of scissors she bought earlier. The only other living thing in the apartment with her is a caged raven, who caws repeatedly that Angela killed him. As Angela explores the apartment, she finds it is full of exhibits relating to her own psychology, it is clear at this point that someone wants to drive Angela into insanity.  Meanwhile, Alex has discovered that Angie is missing and while trying to discover her whereabouts, his brother Cole suddenly stands up from his wheelchair, attacks Alex, and then mysteriously leaves.  After many failed escape attempts Angela takes the raven from its cage, ties a message to its leg and, using the blood-stained scissors to remove a vent cover, releases the raven into an air vent. Angela wakes up the following morning to find that the body of her attacker has been moved to the dining room, and the mutilated corpse of the raven sits on a plate before it. The sight of this causes Angela to collapse in shock where she experiences a childhood flashback. In the flashback, her red-bearded stepfather Billy is murdered by her mother with a pair of scissors before her eyes - the horror being the root of her repression.  The next day the apartment is visited by Dr Carter's wife, who is having an affair with the owner. She arrives to find her husband waiting for her, disguised in a red beard, revealing that he was Angela's attacker. He reveals to his wife that when he learned of the affair, he murdered her lover with a pair of scissors and had set Angela up to take the fall by luring her to the apartment, and exploiting what he had discovered about her past during hypnotherapy sessions. Carter convinces his horrified but politically ambitious wife to go along with the frame, and they set out to find the scissors used in the murder, since they may be used as evidence against him. While wandering in a trance-like state, Angela ventures through the main door (carelessly left open by Carter), closing it behind her and trapping Carter and his wife inside.  Dr. Carter attempts to lure Angela back by posing as Billy, to no avail.  Outside Angela is rescued by Alex, who had tracked her to the apartment's address. A trapped Carter bangs the scissors furiously against the glass of the window, as a liberated Angela looks back with a vengeful smile.

 During one of his classes, a young [[veterinarian]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|intern]] named David Kellum ([[David Hewlett]]) discovers that he has mental abilities to read and control minds of others. When he moves from his country home to the city to continue his studies, he finds difficulty in controlling himself: the congestion of many minds and the ability to hear voices overwhelm him.  He stumbles across a store robbery and kills the gunman with his mind. Police Commander John Forrester watches the store's security tape and plans to enlist David to work for him. He tells David that he knows what he is: a Scanner. And, there are others like him around the world. He asks for David's help in tracking down elusive criminals and David agrees.  After capturing a man who put [[strychnine]] in milk containers throughout the city, Forrester introduces David to Peter Drak, another Scanner who also works for him. Drak proves to be more aggressive when it comes to using his powers. Forrester teaches David techniques by using Drak as a test subject. Drak considers Kellum an enemy but is injected with the drug Eph2, a variant of Ephemerol. It calms him down before he could harm David.  The drug Ephemerol was what originally created Scanners. It was administered to ease expecting mother's discomfort in the 50's. Its side effect caused babies to develop into Scanners. Forrester tells David that although Eph2 manages to calm a Scanner's mind, the drug is addictive and that he should never use it. Forrester encourages him to develop and control his mental abilities on his own.  David feels he has accomplished something by helping with law enforcement. His feeling changes when Forrester orders him to control the [[mayor]] and have her announce Forrester as the next [[Chief of police|Chief of Police]]. Forrester reassures him that it is the best choice for everyone and together they can stop all crimes. David, feeling guilty, disagrees and questions Forrester's agenda. He explains to the mayor how he forced her to appoint Forrester and apologizes. They then plan a way to remove Forrester from office. David tells Forrester that he is quitting, so Forrester has Drak attack David and kill the mayor before she can react. David escapes and hides at his parents's home.  He asks his parents about his abilities, and they tell him that he was [[Adoption|adopted]]. They explain that his birth parents were Cameron Vale and Kim Obrist ([[Stephen Lack]] and [[Jennifer O'Neill]], respectively, from the first film ''[[Scanners]]''). Vale and Obrist told them about his abilities and that he was in danger. They took David in as their own. David needs to go for a walk but while he is gone, Drak and his accomplices kill David's mother and leave David's father for dead. When David returns, his father tells him about his older sister, Julie Vale. He leaves his father with paramedics and begin searching for his sister.  He finds Julie in a secluded cabin. She confirms who she is and explains that their parents were killed by Forrester for resisting him. She also states that her former boyfriend Walter agreed to test the earlier version of Ephemerol and was one of the first Scanner to use the drug, a more unstable version. Walter was kidnapped by Forrester and never seen again. Julie agrees to help David.  Together they go to Forrester's secret compound and discover that Walter is alive and is one of the test subjects with addiction in Eph2. Julie and David disable the perimeter guards. But, once inside, Julie is tranqilized by a [[Tranquilliser gun|dart]]. David leaves her behind to destroy the research and free the test subject Scanners.  Drak attacks David in the test subject quarters. Drak almost succeeds in killing him, but is stopped by a combined attack by all test subjects, which drains away Drak's life force. This reverses the physical damage all addicted Scanners were suffering from, as well as David's injuries from Drak's attack.  Forrester arrives on the scene, in response to David and Julie's assault. Television news reporters and camera crews also show up. He denies the existence of Scanners and his connection to the mayor's death. With his power, David forces Forrester to admit his involvement and motivation before camera. Afterward, Forrester grabs a gun and tries to shoot David, but David and Julie deform Forrester with telekinesis: everything was caught on tape.

 The movie begins with a grizzly bear cub, Griselda, being told by her mother a story about bears from prehistoric times, led by Ursus, who were sent to the stars (The [[Ursa Major]] constellation) by their leader, in order to watch over the bears on Earth from there and protect them from harm.  Meanwhile, in [[San Francisco]], a local theatre owner, Draco, is being intimidated by gangster McGrath, whom he owes a large amount of money. Standing at the edge of bankruptcy, Draco desperately needs a new show, that would guarantee him a money income and thus repaying McGrath (in fact, Draco plans to escape with the money after the show). He decides to organize a performance of dancing bears. From now on, along with his simply-minded assistant Muggsy and Maestro - a pianist working at his theatre - Draco sets on a journey, hunting and imprisoning bears from around the world, forcing them to dance in his show.  One of the bears that were kidnapped by Draco was Griselda's mother. During the hunt, Draco and Muggsy were accompanied by adopted city dog, Sniffy, who chased Griselda (who saved herself by climbing on a tree), but simultaneously separated from his masters, who left him behind, as they left with Griselda's mother as captive. Hours pass. Griselda, still hiding on a tree, grows more and more upset, as she fruitlessly awaits her mother. As she starts crying, she looks into the stars, and reminds herself a story told by her mother. When she asks for help, a star ship arrives from the [[Ursa Major]] constellation, landing nearby. It appears, that it is piloted by Sebastian, the star bear, who comes in response for Griselda's plea for help. Along with her, his robot assistant SOUCI and Sniffy (who decided to join Sebastian), he sets on a journey to save Griselda's mother, and ruin Draco's plans, freeing bears imprisoned by him.  Using Sebastian's star ship, the team locates a train, transporting Draco and his assistants, as well as imprisoned Griselda's mother. They struggle to release the latter, but they are unable to do it, because she is held in a cage, locked on a padlock, to that only Draco has the key. During the action on a train, however, Sebastian manages to enter the Draco's car (in an attempt to find the keys) and gain his personal notes. Soon after that, Sebastian is almost caught by humans, and the team is forced to run, leaving Griselda's mother - as well as Sniffy, who merely felt asleep in Draco's truck.  At the same time, Griselda, SOUCI and Sebastian travel by the latter's star ship again, this time trying to find out, what Draco's next move will be. Basing on the notes Sebastian found on the train, they arrive to the circus placed in Boulder Plains. As it soon appears, that circus has a show performed by bears in its repertoire, and is going be Draco's next target. After arriving there, they find Sniffy, who rejoins their team. To Draco's anger, Sebastian intervenes, when Draco and Muggsy are attempting to kidnap the performing bears. However, although Sebastian manages to ruin Draco's plans, he gets caught himself. He is taken away on the Draco's truck, which later boards transport aeroplane. Griselda and SOUCI are shocked to witness that, but are unable to save Sebastian on time, and thus are forced to look for him, on the board of the star ship. Meanwhile, on the Draco's aeroplane, Sebastian in held captive in a cage. Draco, as it appears, plans to kill him, by dropping him into sea and therefore drowning. However, that plan is not realized, because when Draco, Muggsy and Maestro fell all asleep, Sebastian uses his graviton (a portable device, capable of eliminating gravity and thus levitating objects) to obtain the key to the cage he is held in (using the graviton also enables SOUCI to lock on Sebastian's position). Sebastian then gets into the truck's cockpit and drives away from the board of aeroplane through cargo door, despite Muggsy's attempts to stop him. Floating in the space, Sebastian is finally found by SOUCI and reunites with the team.  The next theatre of Draco's actions proves to be [[China]], where he plans to catch a local panda. Sebastian and his team arrive there as well, and run into Draco during their travel through the country. SOUCI is badly damaged and almost destroyed, when Draco's truck runs over her. Sebastian and Griselda are almost caught, but Sniffy helps them to escape, desperately attacking humans. SOUCI, damaged too heavily to walk, is carried away by Sebastian. After getting far away from Draco, Sebastian leaves SOUCI on the ground, promising, that we will be back to take her home. Sebastian, Griselda and Sniffy visit the mysterious magician and inventor, Ha So, who invites them to his palace, and presents the device of his project, the transvisualator, which enables them to observe the panda. The latter is being caught by Draco at the same time, but Sebastian modifies the device, making it capable of "teleporting" the panda safely into Ha So's palace, therefore disrupting Draco's plans again. Sebastian then uses transvisualator to teleport Muggsy, who is next tied to a chair and questioned by Sebastian, who forces him (by using the graviton to make him fly and become dizzy) to reveal, where the Draco's bear show will be performed. With this information, Sebastian, Griselda and Sniffy fly to [[San Francisco]] in order to begin the final showdown with Draco.  When they arrive, the show starts already, and the house is full of people (including McGrath). Although Draco tries to stop Sebastian, the actions of the latter, as well as Griselda and Sniffy, cause the disarray. When Griselda gets on the scene, the bear trainer, trying to catch her, uses his whip, hurting the dancing bears as a consequence, and thus enraging the audience, who demand to stop the show. Later the people panic, when released bears leave the scene. In the chaos, Draco escapes as well, taking money he earned on the performance, to McGrath's anger. Sebastian leads the bears out of theatre and uses the tramway to transport them all out from the city. During this, they nearly run over Draco's truck, damaging it heavily and making to run out of control. Draco, Muggsy and Maestro drive into the lake, where they are caught by enraged McGrath. Meanwhile, the tramway full of bears reaches the forest near the city - bears imprisoned by Draco, along with Griselda's mother, are finally free.  Sebastian's mission is over, so he brings Griselda and her mother back to the land they came from (Sniffy, however, stays in San Francisco). After bidding goodbye with Griselda (who hopes of seeing him again in the future), he flies back to China, picking up SOUCI still lying there. They both fly back to their planet. During that travel, SOUCI miraculously becomes what she has dreamed of to become - the true star bear.

The girls want to unite their parents, so the twins swap their places to convince their parents. In the meantime, Jagannath is urged to recover the tubes. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.  
Shadows and Fog
 Kleinman is awakened from his sleep by a [[vigilante]] mob, who claims to be looking for a [[serial killer]] and therefore to be needing his help. Kleinman's landlady and fiancée gives him a bag containing pepper spray. Irmy and her boyfriend Paul, performers at a circus, quarrel about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where he has sex with Marie, another artist. Seeing this, Irmy runs to the city and enters a brothel. Irmy also ends up having sex with a student named Jack.  Kleinman visits a coroner's house and has a glass of sherry with him. But after he leaves, the coroner is murdered by the killer. Kleinman comes to the police station to protest a local family's eviction. There, the police talk about the coroner's murder, saying that they have a clue about the killer in the fingerprints on the sherry glass. A panicked Kleinman meets Irmy in the police station, who had been arrested at the brothel for prostitution. She protests against the police calling her "whore", and in the confusion Kleinman confiscates the evidence. Irmy is allowed to leave the police station after a $50 fine, and she meets Kleinman outside. Together they start exploring the city, seeing its different scenes — a man peeping into a woman's room, a starving mother and child, a church — and decide to go back.  Paul arrives in the city looking for Irmy. He goes into a bar where Jack is having a drink. The student reflects on the wonderful experience he had with "a sword-swallower", shocking Paul. Kleinman and Irmy return to his place to stay but are refused entry by his fiancée. They go to the pier but are ambushed by the vigilante mob who find the sherry glass in Kleinman's pocket. Thinking him to be the killer, they decide to lynch Irmy and Kleinman, but the latter uses the pepper spray and they escape.  Meanwhile, Irmy and Paul meet, and at first Paul is ready to kill Irmy for sleeping with another man. They break off their fight when they find the starving woman murdered, and the baby lying on the ground. They decide to keep the child and return to the circus. Kleinman comes to the brothel searching for Irmy but is unable to find her. From his rival at work, he learns about the circus leaving the town and decides to follow it. At the circus, Kleinman meets the magician Armstead, whom he greatly admires. The murderer arrives and try to kill them but is thwarted by Armstead. Kleinman becomes Armstead's assistant on the circus and Irmy and Paul continue their careers as circus performers, while raising their newfound child.  
Sex and Zen
 The story is about a lustful scholar (played by Lawrence Ng) who dares to challenge the moral teachings of the Sack Monk. The monk attempts to lecture the scholar that [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]] transcends the passions of the flesh but the scholar, who enjoys women, doesn't agree. However, the most powerful man in the town marries his daughter, played by Amy Yip, to the scholar. The daughter is a [[virgin]] and has been taught that sex is dirty.  The scholar, after a disastrous yet humorous wedding night, soon initiates his bride into the pleasures of sex, aided greatly by the illustrations of a copy of a sex manual. The amorous husband goes about his 'scholastic travels' where he meets the greatest thief known to man. The thief is able to sneak into people's houses undetected, and the scholar wants to learn this skill so that he can sleep with other men's wives. The thief is initially willing to help him, until he catches the scholar one day and discovers that the scholar is not very [[Penis size|well-endowed]].  The thief tells the scholar that stealing other men's wives requires good lovemaking skills and equipment. He promises to help the scholar only if he has a [[horse's penis]]. Of course, the thief does not think it is possible, until the scholar returns one day, indeed, with a horse's penis attached as his own. Apparently, the scholar met a doctor who was able to [[Organ transplant|replace anatomical parts]] (a scene with a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by Hong Kong comedian [[Kent Cheng]]).  The doctor managed to transplant a horse's penis to replace the scholar's meager one. Armed with his new 20-inch penis, the scholar goes on a sexual rampage, not caring if he is seducing other men's wives or is nearly caught in the process. Meanwhile, the scholar's wife, after experiencing the joys of sex, becomes sexually frustrated. She tries [[masturbating]] with paintbrushes but is left unsatisfied until she has an affair with the gardener, the husband of one of the wives the scholar seduced. She becomes pregnant and runs away with the man, who out of revenge sells her to a brothel, the madam assaults her leading to a miscarriage, originally unwilling she is coerced into becoming a prostitute and comes to enjoy her new life.  The scholar has become frail and sick due to too much sex (involving two sisters-in-law who are bisexual and into [[Sadomasochism|S&M]]). He goes to the brothel for treatment, where he is offered the top courtesan. At first, husband and wife cannot recognize each other; she looks at his penis and thinks it cannot be her husband's because his is small; he cannot recognize her because his eyesight is failing. While they are having sex, he takes a close look at her figure and nipple and recognizes her. To her dismay, he screams, shouts and calls her a disgrace. To his dismay, she runs off and hangs herself. The man, completely broken, goes back to the monk to ask for forgiveness.  
Separate but Equal (film)
 The issue before the United States Supreme Court is whether the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution mandates the individual states to desegregate public schools; that is, whether the nation's "separate but equal" policy heretofore upheld under the law, is unconstitutional.  The issue is placed before the Court by ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and its companion case, ''[[Briggs v. Elliott]]''.  Many of the justices personally believe segregation is morally unacceptable, but have difficulty justifying the idea legally under the 14th Amendment.  Marshall and Davis argue their respective cases.  Marshall argues the equal protection clause extends far enough to the states to prohibit segregated schools.  Davis counters that control of public schools is a "[[states' rights]]" issue that Congress never intended to be covered by the 14th Amendment when it was passed.  Taking the case under advisement, the stalemated justices agree to allow Marshall and Davis an opportunity to re-argue their respective cases as to whether the equal protection clause specifically extends to the desegregation of schools.  In the interim, Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] dies and is replaced by a non-jurist, Governor [[Earl Warren]] of California.  Meanwhile, Marshall and his staff are fruitless in finding any research showing the Civil-War era crafters of the 14th Amendment in 1866 intended for schools to be desegregated.  On the other hand, Davis and his Ivy League-educated staff find several examples of segregated schools having existed ever since the passage of the equal protection clause.  Finally, the NAACP staffers discover a quote by [[Thaddeus Stevens]] delivered on the floor of the Senate during the debate over the Amendment, which directly states segregation is constitutionally and morally wrong.  They place it at the front of their brief.  Marshall's argument is compelling.  As the case is taken under advisement a second time, new Chief Justice Warren is taken on a tour of Gettysburg by his black chauffeur.  He also realizes that his chauffeur must sleep in the car because there are no lodging places available for him because of his race. Warren discovers a majority of the Court agrees to strike down the "separate but equal" laws; however, it is important to him that the Court be unanimous.  He writes an opinion and takes copies to all of the dissenting justices trying to convince each one of the significance of unanimity.  They finally all agree.  Warren reads his opinion which states that segregation "has no place" in American society.  Even opposing counsel, John W. Davis, privately agrees it is time for society to change.  The film closing acknowledges Thurgood Marshall's own ascent to the Supreme Court in 1967 and explains that the plaintiff in the companion case, a black student named Briggs, never attended an integrated school.  
Session Man (film)
 An aging, but capable and talented [[Session musician|session guitarist]] named McQueen ([[James Remar]]) is awakened by a late-night call from a nearby recording studio.  He is needed to help smooth out some tracks that are being worked on by an established and popular [[hard rock]] band, the Raging Kings.  The band’s own lead guitarist, Dean Storm ([[Jeff Kober]]) is resentful of McQueen’s involvement, and after an argument with the other members he decides to leave the group altogether.  Impressed by McQueen’s skills, the band asks him on the spot to replace Storm and he graciously accepts, fulfilling his lifelong dream.  After a brief [[jam session]], Storm suddenly returns to the studio and asks to speak privately with the original band.  They soon return from the meeting, and one member comes to McQueen and reluctantly tells him that he is out. Stunned, McQueen manages to complete what he was called to do and returns home to his wife, who is still in bed.  She asks what the call was about, to which McQueen replies “Just another session.”  The film ends with McQueen staring into the darkness, trying to come to terms with how he realized his dream and lost it in the same night.

Maloy returns to the lake to bring the Undin back home. After bidding farewell to Maloy, the Undin reunites with her mate as they swim away back to their home.  
The Seventh Brother
 The story begins in the forest, with the viewer being addressed by Dr. Albert E. Owl, a "famous storyteller". Noting that the viewer is lost in the forest, he decides to recount the tale of Tiny the puppy, the seventh brother (occasionally interspersing his story with various comments of his own).  The doctor's tale begins the previous spring, with Tiny the puppy riding in a car with his owner-a little girl named Angie-and her grandpa after an enjoyable trip to a big city. On the way home, their car breaks down in the middle of a storm and the grandpa goes out to fix it. Angie goes out to help, telling Tiny to stay in the car, but leaving the door open. Spotting a frog outside, Tiny goes after it, but falls down a hill (unbeknownst to his owners, who drive off without him and can't hear his barks over the storm). Heartbroken, he decides to wait out the storm by sleeping in a little hollowed-out area in a bush (sleeping through Angie calling for him, as she noticed his absence soon and told her grandpa to go back to find him).  The next morning, a band of rabbits discover Tiny. Their opinions on him are mixed (most of them believe Tiny to be some form of monster), but the leader of the group-the ruffian of the family, J.C. (his real name is Jerald Cuthbert)-feels that he should be left to survive on his own; luckily, one of his sisters, Joanna, decides that they should help him. She quickly convinces her siblings to join up after putting the matter to a vote with the other rabbits- Rebecca (the eldest sister), Mimi (the sensitive one), Cody (the glutton), Marty (the cautious one) -and Tiny is welcomed into the family as a "bunny-puppy". Tiny accepts, but on one condition- they must come back later to see if Angie came back. The bunnies agree and bring him back to their home following a musical number in which they introduce themselves. However, they teach him to act like a rabbit, such as hopping and keeping his ears up straight. J.C. is frustrated with Tiny because he doesn't act like a rabbit, but when J.C. is caught by a hawk, Tiny scares the hawk away by barking at it, causing it to fly away in a panic. Because of this, the family afterwards decides to accept Tiny as their brother, which makes the puppy very happy, although their parents are afraid at first.  The morning after, Miss Magpie, the nosy leader of the forest, is very scared of the news and tells her friend, Birdie, and the whole forest about it. Most of the forest is scared of Tiny at first, but when they see that he isn't vicious, the animals are relieved. The sole exception for this rule is Miss Magpie, who is still heavily convinced that he is a monster. When Tiny smells the scent of his owners and hears Angie calling for him, he runs up the hill to the road where he first met the bunnies. But when he arrives, he is too late, and thinks that his owners don't want him anymore (luckily, his new family is able to turn his frown upside down). Miss Magpie hires a fox named Mr. Fox to try and intimidate the rabbits, but Tiny teaches them to growl at him, which scares Mr. Fox and sends him running. Human poachers arrive in the forest to try and kill the bunnies, but the puppy teaches the rabbits to howl while hiding in their home, which send the poachers running.   Later that night, a flood reaches the bunnies' home. J.C. and his father stay in their hole trying to dig their way out while the other rabbits climb up a branch, but Cody is caught in the raging waters and Tiny jumps in. The puppy saves Cody, and the rabbits hop onto dry land, but J.C. and their dad are still in their hole trying to dig through as the water rises. Tiny senses them and digs a hole where they escape. Their father applauds Tiny, saying he is proud for him to be their son.  Winter is not far from arrival, and Miss Magpie mocks Tiny for being a dog, not knowing how to prepare for winter. Unfortunately for her, fortunes turn when a ferret tries to kill her because she failed to stop the rabbits. The ferret bites Tiny's leg, but he eventually throws the ferret into a pond. Fearing for his safety, Miss Magpie warns the rabbits. When the rabbits discover that Tiny is alive, they celebrate. But he is sick due to the effects of the bite, and he is taken to see Dr. Owl, who tells the parents that he must be returned to his owners. The rabbits carry Tiny back home, but along the way, they come across a big crease between two hills. J.C. uses a large stick to successfully carry the family over the crease, and they finally reach his owners' home. As Tiny is dragged into his doghouse, the rabbits howl and then disappear, causing Angie to wonder if it's her puppy howling. When Angie sees Tiny, she and her grandpa are very happy to see him again and welcome him home.

Shattered (1991 film)
 While driving at night along the [[Marin County, California|northern California]] coast, architect Dan Merrick ([[Tom Berenger]]) and wife Judith ([[Greta Scacchi]]) are involved in a [[car wreck]]. Dan suffers major injuries and brain trauma, resulting in [[psychogenic amnesia]]. After extensive plastic surgery, Dan returns home in Judith's care.  Dan relies on those close to him to help him restore his past, including his business partner Jeb Scott ([[Corbin Bernsen]]) and Jeb's wife, Jenny [[Joanne Whalley|(Joanne Whalley-Kilmer)]]. Dan has frequent flashbacks he believes to be events that led up to the car crash.  Dan finds discrepancies in the stories about his former self. He stumbles upon photographs of Judith sleeping with another man. Dan finds an expensive bill to a pet store and follows up with its proprietor, Gus Klein ([[Bob Hoskins]]). Gus says the payment was for services provided as a [[private investigator]] to follow Judith, and it revealed she was cheating with Jack Stanton (Scott Getlin).  Judith arranges a meeting with Stanton and Dan follows her. Judith stops at an old [[shipwreck]] slated for removal by Dan's company. Assuming the wreck is a key in remembering his past, Dan has its removal postponed.  Jeb's wife Jenny accuses Judith of planning the accident to eliminate Dan. As he works with Gus to keep tabs on his wife with a [[wiretap]], Dan tails her to a hotel where she and Stanton are to meet, but Stanton leaves and a chase ensues through a wooded area. After gunshots are fired from Stanton's car, Dan and Gus crash while Stanton escapes.  That night at home, Dan arms himself and lies in wait. At gunpoint, an intruder is revealed as Judith disguised as Stanton. She explains that Stanton is actually dead, killed by Dan on the night of the accident. Judith had intended to stop the affair with Stanton. Judith says she and Dan covered up the murder by disposing of Stanton's body in the shipwreck. When Dan reveals he postponed the ship's removal, Judith becomes hysterical and suggests they should flee.  Dan receives a phone call from Jenny imploring him to see her, but when Dan arrives, he finds Jenny dead. He is confronted at gunpoint by Gus, who followed him, thinking Dan must have murdered Stanton. Pleading for his life, Dan convinces Gus to visit the shipwreck, where they find a chemical storage container. Dan dredges up a body of a man who looks exactly like himself. Dan realizes he is not Dan Merrick; he is Jack Stanton.  In a flashback, it is revealed that an abusive Dan confronted his wife Judith with evidence of her [[infidelity]]. She called for help and Jack raced to her home, arriving too late to prevent her from shooting her husband in the head. Jack wanted to go to the police, but Judith convinced him to cover up the murder and hide Dan's body. After doing so, Jack told Judith he wanted out of the relationship. This angered and distracted Judith, who drove into the car wreck.  Judith had banked on the chemical dissolving Dan's body, but because it was actually [[Formaldehyde]], she had preserved it. Gus is shot by Judith, and falls into the water. Judith  forces Jack to leave with her. She drives erratically down the same stretch of road from the night of the accident, confessing to the murder of Jenny, saying she had figured everything out and had to be killed.   She hid the facts from Jack so he'd have [[plausible deniability]]. After the crash, she told the [[plastic surgeon]]s that the man she was with was her husband Dan. Distracted by a police helicopter, Judith loses control of the gun, and Jack grabs it, demanding she stop the car. Judith decides to kill them in a murder-suicide car crash. Jack, at the last second,  rolls out, while she plummets to her death.  The police helicopter lands, and an injured Gus Klein emerges. Gus survived his plunge into the water after being shot thanks to his asthma inhaler. The two board the helicopter, with Gus referring to Jack as Dan, presumably securing Merrick's fortune for him. The helicopter lifts off, flying over the burning car at the bottom of the cliff.

The Silence of the Lambs (film)
  [[FBI]] trainee [[Clarice Starling]] is pulled from her training at the [[FBI Academy]] at [[Quantico, Virginia]] by [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] of the Bureau's [[Behavioral Science Unit]]. He assigns her to interview [[Hannibal Lecter]], a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer, whose insight might prove useful in the pursuit of a [[serial killer]] nicknamed "[[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]]", who [[Skinning|skins]] his female victims' corpses.  Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where she is led by [[Frederick Chilton]] to Lecter's solitary quarters. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at "dissecting" him and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, one of the prisoners flicks [[semen]] at her. Lecter, who considers this act "unspeakably ugly", calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his. This leads her to a storage shed, where she discovers a man's severed head in a abandoned storage facility. She finds a [[Acherontia styx|Death's Head Hawkmoth]] [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] lodged in the throat of another victim's recovered body. She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to Buffalo Bill. He offers to [[Offender profiling|profile]] Buffalo Bill on the condition that he may be transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests.  Buffalo Bill abducts a [[United States Senate|Senator]]'s daughter, Catherine Martin. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them find Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter demands a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' from Starling, offering clues about Buffalo Bill in exchange for personal information. Starling tells Lecter about the murder of her father when she was ten years old. Chilton secretly records the conversation and reveals Starling's deceit before offering Lecter a deal of Chilton's own making. Lecter agrees and is flown to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he verbally torments Senator Ruth Martin, and gives her misleading information on Buffalo Bill, including the name "Louis Friend".  Starling notices that "Louis Friend" is an [[anagram]] of "[[iron sulfide]]"—[[Pyrite|fool's gold]]. She visits Lecter, who is now being held in a cage-like cell in a Tennessee courthouse, and asks for the truth. Lecter tells her that all the information she needs is contained in the case file. Rather than give her the real name, he insists that they continue their ''quid pro quo'' and she recounts a traumatic childhood incident where she was awakened by the sound of [[Lamb and mutton|spring lambs]] being slaughtered on a relative's farm in [[Montana]]. Starling admits that she still sometimes wakes thinking she can hear lambs screaming, and Lecter speculates that she is motivated to save Catherine in the hope that it will end the nightmares. Lecter gives her back the case files on Buffalo Bill after their conversation is interrupted by Chilton and the police, who escort her from the building. Later that evening, Lecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell, and disappears.  Starling analyzes Lecter's annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally. Starling travels to the victim's hometown and discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor, with dresses and dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims. She telephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to form a "woman suit" out of real skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecter's notes with hospital archives and finding a [[transsexual]] man named Jame Gumb, who once applied unsuccessfully for a [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex-change operation]]. Starling continues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in [[Ohio]], while Crawford leads an FBI [[Hostage Rescue Team]] to Gumb's address in [[Illinois]]. The house in Illinois is empty, and Starling is led to the house of "Jack Gordon", whom she realizes is actually Jame Gumb, again by finding a sphinx moth. She pursues him into his multi-room basement, where she discovers that Catherine is still alive, but trapped in a dry well. After turning off the basement lights, Gumb stalks Starling in the dark with [[Night vision device|night-vision goggles]], but gives his position away when he cocks his revolver. Starling reacts just in time and fires all of her rounds at Gumb, killing him.  Sometime later, at the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in [[Bimini]]. He assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the favor, which she says she cannot do. Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying that he is "having an old friend for dinner", and starts following a newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.

He is given a new partner, Johnny Murata ([[Brandon Lee]]), an [[United States|American]] of partial [[Japanese American|Japanese descent]]. Kenner does not appreciate American culture, while Johnny does not much like Japanese culture. One thing they both enjoy are the martial arts, of which they are both experts. The two are assigned to L.A.'s [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]], where they break up some criminal activity in a Japanese [[restaurant]], and an arrest is made.  While Kenner and Johnny are questioning the suspect, Kenner loses his temper and rips the suspect's shirt, and the tattoos that Kenner sees on the suspect remind Kenner of when he was 9 years old, a time when he witnessed his parents being killed by a member of the [[Yakuza]]. The tattoos are the [[trademark]] of the Iron Claw Yakuza clan. However, before Kenner or Murata can get any information out of the suspect, he kills himself in the interrogation room by breaking his own neck.  On the other side of town, the leader of the Iron Claw, Yoshida ([[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]), kills the owner of a popular downtown [[nightclub]] called the Bonsai Club by crushing the owner, Tanaka ([[Philip Tan]]), in a car compactor. To celebrate "gaining" ownership of the Bonsai Club, Yoshida throws a [[party]] at his house with all of the club staff.   One of the girls at the party, named Angel ([[Renee Griffin]]), is revealed to have warned Tanaka about Yoshida behind his back, and this infuriates Yoshida. Yoshida questions Angel about her loyalty, and she attempts to appease Yoshida by offering her body to him. Yoshida then drugs Angel and strips off her clothes, and then fondles her from behind before beheading her.  When the coroner runs an analysis on Angel's body, it is revealed that she was forced into ingesting  a large amount of [[Methamphetamine|methamphetamines]] in her system which would have led to her [[death]] anyway. This discovery of drugs, together with the suspect having Yakuza tattoos, cause Kenner and Johnny to go to the Bonsai Club in search of information. There they meet lounge singer Minako Okeya ([[Tia Carrere]]), who was a good friend of Angel's. Before they can get any useful information out of her, they are ambushed and taken to see the nightclub's owner and Kenner recognizes Yoshida as the man who killed his parents. Yoshida is now a drug manufacturer using a local [[brewery]] as his distribution center. He uses smaller gangs such as the [[Hells Angels]], [[Crips]] and Sureños to peddle the drugs for him, in return for a percentage of the profit.  Kenner and Johnny escape from the nightclub. Later that night, Yoshida [[rape]]s and [[kidnapping|kidnap]]s Minako and vows to kill Kenner. Kenner and Johnny set out for Yoshida's heavily guarded home, where they rescue Minako. His pride wounded, Yoshida sends his men out to get Minako back. He has Kenner and Johnny captured and tortured, but Kenner and Johnny manage to escape, leading to a protracted battle in which Kenner and Johnny emerge victorious.  
Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: The Toy Maker
  Late one night in December, a young boy named Derek Quinn (William Thorne) hears the doorbell ringing and goes downstairs and finds a [[Christmas]] present that has been addressed to him on the porch. His father Tom (Van Quattro) reprimands him for being up so late and opening the door, sending him off to bed. Instead Derek watches from the stairs as his curious father opens the gift. Finding a musical orb shaped like [[Santa Claus]] in the box he activates it, causing it to strangle him with retractable cords; as Tom struggles he slips and falls onto a [[fireplace poker]], his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah (Jane Higginson) a few moments later.  Two weeks later Sarah takes Derek, who hasn't spoken since his father's death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto ([[Mickey Rooney]]) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black). Late paying rent, Noah, to smooth things over, gives Harold the Larry the Larvae toy in exchange for a one-day extension. While driving home Harold is killed when Larry the Larvae crawls into his mouth and bursts out his eye, causing his car to crash and explode.  The next day, Sarah takes Derek to see Santa (portrayed by Noah, who takes his friend's shift) at the mall, finding another gift on the porch on the way out. While Sarah and Derek are gone Pino sneaks into their house, using a key he had hidden years earlier when he and his father lived there. When Sarah and Derek get home early (due to Noah's odd behavior towards Derek) Pino flees from the house. After confronting Joe about Pino's intrusion (and stating that she will call the police the next time it happens) Sarah decides to let Derek open the present dropped off earlier, but Derek refuses to touch it. Leaving Derek alone, Sarah is visited by her friend Kim Levitt (Neith Hunter) and while the two talk Derek sneaks outside and throws the present in a garbage can, where Kim's adopted son Lonnie (Conan Yuzna) finds it. Lonnie unwraps the gift and finds [[roller skates]] in it. Joe, in a drunken rage, begins beating Pino, accidentally killing him by knocking him down some stairs. While using the skates, Lonnie is hit by a car and left hospitalized when rockets hidden within the skates cause him to lose control.  While Sarah visits Lonnie and Kim at the hospital, Derek is visited by Noah, who is shooed away by the babysitter Meridith (Amy L. Taylor), who tells Noah where to find Sarah when Noah keeps badgering her from outside. In the parking garage of Sarah's workplace, Noah, who is revealed to be Sarah's old boyfriend and Derek's real father, confronts her and the two reconcile. At the Quinn house, Meridith and her boyfriend Buck (Eric Welch) engage in sex, involving a toy hand on his butt, a toy that is left by Joe who is dressed as Santa. Joe, who had broken into the home, has a horde of toys attack them while he abducts Derek, taking him to the toy store. Shortly before taking Sarah home, Noah tells her about Joe's past, saying he was arrested years earlier for booby trapping toys he gave to children after his pregnant wife died in a car crash. Pulling into he driveway, Sarah and Noah find the hysterical and bloody Meridith, who tells them Buck is dead (having his head cut off by a circular saw attached to a toy car) and that Joe took Derek.  Sarah rushes to the toy store (followed by Noah) and starts looking around upstairs, arming herself with a knife. In the basement Noah is attacked by Joe with a remote control plane and an acid squirting water pistol and is knocked out. Hearing the noise Sarah goes downstairs, finds the real Joe's dead body and tries to run, only to be stopped by the Joe dressed as Santa. The imposter Joe removes his face (showing robotic components underneath) and puts on another, revealing himself to be Pino. Pino explains to Sarah that Joe created him to replace his own dead son, but he could never live up to his father's expectations (as he was not "a real son") and was continually broken and rebuilt by Joe in his drunken rages. Pino goes on to say that he wants Sarah to be his mother (sending killer toys to try to kill Derek) before beginning to dry hump her while frantically screaming "I love you mommy!"  Sarah manages to stab Pino in the head with a [[screwdriver]], causing him to begin malfunctioning. Grabbing the knife Sarah dropped earlier, Pino begins trying to stab Derek, whom he had placed in a large sack. Derek is saved when Noah breaks into the room and starts fighting Pino, distracting him long enough for Sarah to halve him at the waist with a double-bit axe. Barely functioning, Pino cries for his father before grabbing Sarah's leg, causing her to stomp his head into pieces.  As Sarah, Derek, and Noah leave, the eyes of one of Joe's partially assembled robots spark ominously, like Pino and his creations.

Beneath his charm, Martin has extreme obsessive control issues, who has been physically and emotionally abusing Laura throughout their marriage. He makes her keep everything in order in the house, tells her what she should wear, picks out what music she listens to, and limits her social activities.   One day, Martin believes Laura has been flirting with an attractive neighbor, and he physically assaults her in a jealous rage. In an effort to escape Martin, Laura fakes her own death at sea in a storm while the couple are boating. Because Laura had deliberately led Martin to believe that she could not swim, he believed she had drowned once she was lost overboard. However, Laura was able to swim safely to shore, because she had recently taken swimming lessons at the [[YWCA]]. Laura secretly returns home, retrieves some clothing and cash she had hidden away in preparation, disguises herself, and leaves home after flushing her [[wedding ring]] down the toilet.

From the Minneapolis nursing home, he learns that Laura's mother is alive, and has a private investigator trace her to the nursing home in Iowa. He visits Laura's mother and tells her he is a police officer needing information about Laura. He learns from her that Laura is seeing a college drama teacher in Cedar Falls.

Soapdish
 Celeste Talbert, the long-time star of the embattled daytime drama ''The Sun Also Sets'', is targeted by her ambitious co-star Montana Moorehead; Montana connives to supplant Celeste as the show's star by promising sexual favors to its producer, David Seton Barnes. To make the audience hate Celeste's character, Montana and David come up with a last-minute plot change in which she will accidentally kill a young, destitute deaf-mute, played by the newly-cast Lori Craven. Despite the strong objections of head writer Rose Schwartz and Celeste herself, the scene plays out, but is interrupted by Celeste's recognition of Lori as her real-life niece. Network honcho Edmund Edwards sees potential in the relationship and makes Lori a regular cast member, hoping to boost the show's flagging ratings.  Montana and David seek to further unnerve Celeste by bringing back Jeffrey Anderson, an actor whom Celeste arranged to be fired from ''The Sun Also Sets'' decades before, after his romantic relationship with Celeste went sour. Bitter at being reduced to performing dinner theater for uninterested seniors in Florida, Jeffrey relishes the chance to needle Celeste. Outwardly despising Jeffrey but perhaps still harboring some feelings for him, Celeste becomes unhinged when Jeffrey and Lori seem to be about to begin a romantic relationship, seemingly from jealousy. However, when Lori and Jeffrey are about to enact a scripted onscreen kiss, Celeste stops them by revealing that Lori is actually her ''daughter'' by Jeffrey. On camera, Celeste explains that she was responsible for getting Jeffrey fired because she was distraught about the pregnancy. Then she went home, passed Lori off as her niece, and had her parents raise Lori, all due to pressure from the network. This incites disgust and scorn from nearly everyone on the show towards Celeste, but the scandal ignites renewed interest in the show, causing the ratings to skyrocket. A board meeting between the show's staff—including Rose, who speaks out in Celeste's defense—takes place thereafter, where David insists that she be fired, but he is quickly overruled as the situation has not only resulted in positive press for the show, but has generated a great deal of public sympathy for Celeste.   The next day, after an unpleasant exchange with Lori, Celeste goes to Jeffrey and pleads with him to speak to Lori on her behalf. Jeffrey is resistant at first, but after Celeste gives him advice on how to approach her and break the ice, the conversation leads to Celeste and Jeffrey embracing. Just when it seems the two are about to reconcile, Montana interrupts them and claims that she and Jeffrey slept together the previous night. Disgusted, Celeste storms off, leaving the situation between her and Jeffrey even worse than before. The dilemma is further inflamed when Rose—who by now is no longer angry with Celeste—shows her a tabloid newspaper proclaiming that Montana is pregnant with Jeffrey's child. After an explosive exchange between the three of them takes place over this, Celeste, Jeffrey and Lori go to the head of the network with their concerns and demand that some action must be taken to solve the problem. But it's Lori who delivers an ultimatum stating, "Mr. Edwards--it's them or me--that is the bottom line here! ''They'' go or ''I'' go!"  A decision is made by the network, and the actors head into a live episode still not knowing who will be written off the show.  They will read their lines from a [[teleprompter]] so that the secret will be kept until the last minute. It is revealed that Lori's character has "brain fever" and will die; still hoping to be rid of Celeste, Montana ad-libs and suggests that a brain transplant can save her. Lori is shocked by the revelation, but in character, Celeste immediately plays along, offering her own brain for the operation. Touched by the sacrifice, Lori asks Celeste and Jeffrey not to leave the show, and softens to her newfound parents. Montana, desperate to stop them, reiterates that she is pregnant with Jeffrey's child, but she is publicly ruined by Rose who, with the help of vengeful Ariel Maloney, who wanted Jeffrey for herself, reveals the secret from a high school yearbook that Montana is actually a [[transsexual]] called "Milton Moorehead, of [[Syosset, Long Island]]." David is shocked and Montana flees the set, screaming in horror. Later, Celeste, Jeffrey, and Lori win soap opera awards while Montana is relegated to performing dinner theater at Jeffrey's former venue.

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country
 [[File:St6-excelsior and shock wave.png|thumb|left|The USS ''Excelsior'' weathers the shock wave generated by the explosion of Praxis.<ref name="martin-46"/>]] Praxis, a [[Klingon]] moon, explodes without warning. The starship [[USS Excelsior (Star Trek)|USS ''Excelsior'']], commanded by Captain [[Hikaru Sulu]], is struck by the shock wave and its crew discovers that much of the moon has been obliterated. The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's [[ozone layer]] throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons [[Suing for peace|sue for peace]] with their longstanding enemy, the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, [[Starfleet]] sends the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise''-A]] to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. ''Enterprise''s captain, [[James T. Kirk]], whose son [[David Marcus (Star Trek)|David]] was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.  After a rendezvous between ''Enterprise'' and Gorkon's battlecruiser they continue towards Earth, with the crews sharing a tense meal aboard ''Enterprise''. Later that night, ''Enterprise'' appears to fire on the Klingon ship with a pair of photon torpedoes, disabling the [[artificial gravity]] aboard the Klingon vessel. During the confusion, two figures wearing Starfleet spacesuits and gravity boots beam aboard the Klingon ship and grievously wound Gorkon before beaming away. Kirk surrenders to avoid armed conflict, and beams aboard the Klingon ship with Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]] to attempt to save Gorkon's life. The chancellor dies, and Gorkon's chief of staff, [[Chang (Star Trek)|General Chang]], has Kirk and McCoy arrested and put on trial for his assassination. The pair are found guilty and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on the frozen asteroid [[List of Star Trek planets: R-S#R|Rura Penthe]]. Gorkon's daughter, Azetbur, becomes the new chancellor, and continues diplomatic negotiations; for reasons of security, the conference is relocated and the new location is kept secret. While several senior Starfleet officers want to rescue Kirk and McCoy, the Federation President refuses to risk full-scale war. Azetbur likewise refuses to invade Federation space, stating that only Kirk will pay for her father's death.  Kirk and McCoy arrive at the Rura Penthe mines and are befriended by a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Martia, who offers them an escape route; in reality, it is a ruse to make their arranged deaths appear accidental. Once her betrayal is revealed, Martia transforms into Kirk's double and fights him, but she is killed by the prison guards to silence any witnesses. Just before the prison warden reveals who set them up, Kirk and McCoy are beamed aboard ''Enterprise'' by Captain [[Spock]], who had assumed command and undertaken an investigation in Kirk's absence. Determining that ''Enterprise'' did not fire the torpedoes but that the assassins are still aboard, the crew has begun a search for them. The two assassins are found dead, but Kirk and Spock trick their accomplice into believing they are still alive. When the culprit arrives in [[sick bay]] to finish off the assassins, Kirk and Spock discover that the killer is Spock's protégé, [[Valeris]]. To discover the identity of the conspirators, Spock initiates a forced [[mind-meld]], and learns that a group of Federation, Klingon, and [[Romulan]] officers plotted to sabotage the peace talks, fearing the changes their success might bring the titular "undiscovered country" (the future), and that Chang is one of the conspirators. The torpedoes that struck Gorkon's cruiser came from a prototype [[Bird of Prey (Star Trek)|Bird of Prey]] that can fire while [[cloaking device|cloaked]], and hovered just below ''Enterprise'' at the time of the assassination.  The crew contacts Captain Sulu, who informs them the conference is being held at Camp [[List_of_Star_Trek_planets_(G%E2%80%93L)#K|Khitomer]]. Both ships head for the talks as fast as they can. As ''Enterprise'' nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With ''Enterprise'' unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on ''Enterprise'' and then ''Excelsior''. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communications officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and ''Enterprise'' and ''Excelsior'' destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation President's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Kirk and crew are contacted by Sulu, who bids farewell to his old friends and the ''Excelsior'' departs. ''Enterprise'' is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As ''Enterprise'' cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of ''Enterprise'' under his command, others will continue their voyages.<ref name="synopsis"></ref>

After stopping a supermarket robbery, Joe is summoned by Agent Cunningham (Richard Gant), whom he meets in a vacant underground parking garage. Cunningham proceeds to blackmail Joe into going undercover, by threatening to turn his three-week suspension into six months without pay.  Cunningham wants Joe to go undercover in Mississippi and infiltrate "The Brotherhood," a white supremacist biker gang linked to the murders of government officials and suspected of dealing drugs to the mafia. The Brotherhood is led by a violent psychopath named Chains Cooper (Lance Henriksen).  Joe reluctantly accepts and goes undercover as "John Stone", but his job is not easy. His FBI contact, Lance (Sam McMurray) is a germophobe who does not exactly fit in with the biker crowd, and the members of the Brotherhood, especially Chains, have their doubts about "John Stone", who has seemingly come out of nowhere to get a piece of their action.  Charged with killing a man as his initiation, Huff enlists the FBI's help to carefully fake the murder and is accepted into the Brotherhood. However, Chains's right-hand man Ice Hensley (William Forsythe), does not trust him and eventually goes out of his way to expose him, leading to Ice's death in a high-speed motorcycle chase.  During the operation, Huff learns that the Brotherhood's ultimate goal is to eliminate Brent "The Whip" Whipperton, a District Attorney running for Governor of Mississippi, who has promised to crack down on crime within the state. They plan to use a cache of stolen military weapons to storm the Supreme Court, where one of their own is on trial for murder, and assassinate both Whipperton and the judge presiding over the case.  When Chains' girlfriend Nancy accidentally learns about Huff's identity, he confides in her, explaining that he can grant her immunity if she cooperates with the FBI. Though resistant at first, Nancy accepts his offer, but the operation fails when the man Huff had supposedly killed to gain admission to the Brotherhood suddenly returns. In retaliation, Chains shoots and kills Nancy, but plans to do away with Huff in a more spectacular fashion, by strapping a bomb to his chest and throwing him from a helicopter en route to the courthouse.  Huff manages to fight his way free and commandeer the chopper, then takes the fight inside the courthouse, where a melee erupts between the Brotherhood and the local police. Although the Brotherhood succeeds in its plan to eliminate Whipperton, Huff battles his way through the ranks of the gang until finally coming face-to-face with Chains.

A gunshot is heard, and Chains abruptly falls to the ground, having been shot by Huff's partner Lance. Huff then marches stoically from the courthouse.

James fears that Glenna will run off with Kimberly, considering that she is losing the battle, is refusing [[alimony]] and is advised by the judge to seek psychiatric help. James is awarded temporary custody, and hires Parrish for assistance during his work hours. Parrish does not feel comfortable around children, and Kimberly immediately shows her lack of interest in her. Glenna, meanwhile, is heartbroken over having lost the case, and tells her lawyer that she hates how James can abuse Kimberly on a daily basis now. Her lawyer feels sorry for the woman and puts her in contact with former reporter Nettie Forbes ([[Veronica Hamel]]), who has spent a year in prison for attempting to murder the man who had abused and killed her daughter. Since then, Nettie specializes in helping mothers to kidnap their children from their abusive husbands, and she offers Glenna a new identity following the kidnapping of Kimberly.  Meanwhile, Parrish grows closer to Kimberly and even tells her about her love of her life: a former colleague who was shot and killed by a man who they were arresting. Their conversation is interrupted by a sudden visit from Nettie and Glenna, who have Parrish under gunshot and take Kimberly. While they head out to a safehouse and come up with a new name, Parrish is criticized by her colleagues for having failed her job. James insists on Parrish trying to find Kimberly, informing her that she is not safe with Glenna, who was institutionalized three years ago following a manic depressive episode. Parrish's partner Sgt. Jake Morris ([[Robert Desiderio]]) – with whom Parrish has had a romantic past – arrests Nettie, but she does not talk throughout her holding. Instead of being convicted, Nettie is released, enabling the police to follow her every move. Nellie, however, gets rid of them via a drive-in, and surprises Glenna with a new birth certificate, of Carol Davidson.  While Nettie and Glenna prepare to leave for Mexico, Parrish locates them and begins a dangerous car chase. Glenna finally gives up and gets out the car to stop Parrish, while Nellie drives off with Kimberly. Nellie puts Kimberly to stay with her friend, but Kimberly does not feel safe and cries out for her mother. Back at the station, Parrish looks into the rape allegations against James. Through Glenna's lawyer, Parrish finds out that Kimberly brought up the abuse claims herself, and that Glenna's so-called mental illness is nothing more than a depression. Even though there is no hard proof for the abuse, Parrish slowly starts to believe the lawyer, and offers to help Nettie to reconcile Glenna with Kimberly. Nettie wants to help Kimberly break out of jail, but this is no option for Parrish, who does not want to jeopardize her career.  Meanwhile, the FBI locates Kimberly through one of Nettie's posted letters. Parrish tries to help her out by warning Kimberly's caretaker Victoria before the FBI can get to her, but Victoria is unavailable, and the police are able to take Kimberly. As soon as she is reconciled with James, Parrish offers her babysitting services to continue the battle to help Glenna. Charges against Glenna are dropped on condition that she leaves the state, and Nettie is thereby released from any allegations as well. Shortly after, following a confession about the [[child abuse]] from Kimberly herself, Parrish arranges for Glenna to leave the state with Kimberly. To assure herself of not losing her job, Nettie shows up and fakes to have cuffed her, before having kidnapped Kimberly. Believing that she was part of the kidnapping, James threatens to sue Parrish, but she assures him that she will tell everyone about the abuse if he does.

Una storia semplice (film)
 The Sciascia story unfolds with the arrival in Sicily of a medicine rep from Verona.  He is an unaware of being witness to a double murder at a rural railway station and hears of the event on the car radio.  He calls on the local police station to help with the enquiries. The police had already discovered the body of a retired ambassador, who had returned after years of absence, to in his remote farmhouse, after calling them to alert them of his discovery of an item (a stolen painting) rolled up in the attic. The police did not call that night as the duty Inspector who left soon after insisted the Brigadiere should tarry as it might be a hoax as he knew the Farmhose to be abandoned.  The following day the strange appearance of the retired ambassador's body which appeared to have been a suicide, raises suspicion in the Brigadiere that he may have been murdered.  This remains the investigating policeman's opinion but is totally rejected by the Police Commissioner who insists on a simple and uncomplicated suicide.  There is a suggestion that the Carabinieri who have also turned up at the crime scene are aware of the alternative theory the Brigadiere had mulled over with the Carabiniere driver and repeated to his superior the Colonel.  Meanwhile, interrogation of the Veronese witness clarifies that he had not seen the railway staff but their murderers rolling up a "carpet"/ painting in the station.  The film follows the investigation as it proceeds with an old friend of the "suicide" a professor Franzo also revealing more on the telephone conversations they had exchanged before the ambassador's death.  It looked to the police as though the Farm buildings had been used for criminal activity for some time. The inspector however appeared to be overly familiar with the inside of the Great house and real doubts entered the Brigadiere's mind as to his real involvement in the crime.  The Procurator/judge insisted unreasonably the police Commissioner and Carabinieri should give him more and cast iron evidence if he were to proceed with any case, as in his view all he heard were conjectures.  The estranged widow and son of the ambassador arrive and the extent of the family rift is evident.  They appear to have relied on the local parish priest Don Cricco to oversee the mainly abandoned family properties in the area.  The film ends with an accident in which the Inspector and Brigadiere exchange pistol shots, killing the Inspector. The police call it an accident.

Greeted back in [[Anaheim]] with considerable skepticism, Virgil arranges a tryout for Sammy. The boy is wild at first and Virgil's great find appears to be a big joke. Once he calms down, however, Sammy proves to have everything it takes to make it big.  Team management, desperate for a new star, immediately begins to overplay the arrival of Sammy with wildly overblown hype. A public-relations blitz promotes the boy as baseball's next great star, even though he has yet to throw a pitch in a big-league game. By the time Sammy takes the mound for his first Angels game, expectations are so high that he cannot possibly live up to them.  He is roughed up by opponents in the first inning, humiliating the owner and making fans furious. But, gradually, with a surprise assist from Virgil on the field, Sammy settles down and begins to look like a star in the making.

One day, a group of bandits appear in the restaurant and one attempts rape on Hao Mei.  Hai Ge intervenes and with his deft skills manages to kill the assailant.  The dead man is none other than the second brother of renowned desert bandit Lethal Swordsman.

To fight Lethal Swordsman, Hai Ge goes to find Desert Eagle, who promises he will be there to slay the bandit.  He promises to turn up at high noon two days later when the bandits appear.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze
  One year after the events of the first film, a young [[pizza delivery]] boy named Keno inadvertently encounters [[Burglary|burglars]] on his route and tries to stop them. Seeing him as a witness, the burglars attack Keno, who proves to be an expert [[Martial arts|martial art]]ist, but he is soon overwhelmed before the arrival of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. They vanish after rescuing Keno, tying the burglars up, and taking the pizza he was delivering, leaving behind the money to pay for it.  [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], along with their master [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], are living with [[April O'Neil]] while they look for a new place to live following the events of their [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|last adventure]]. Splinter wants to remain in the shadows, while Raphael thinks they should live out in the open. At a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] where the remnants of [[Foot Clan|The Foot]] and [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder's]] second-in-command Tatsu are hiding out, they are met by their master, who has been disfigured by his previous defeat but did not die as they thought.  April interviews Professor Jordan Perry of Techno Global Research Industries (TGRI) about a possible [[toxic waste]] leak. He assures her that everything is fine, but at the same time their scientists discover [[dandelions]] which have been mutated by the leak. Freddy, a spy for the Foot posing as April's cameraman, discovers this and reports it to his master, who decides to have Perry interrogated. Back at April's apartment, Splinter reveals to her and the turtles that the canister of mutagen (dubbed "Ooze" by the Turtles) which mutated them into their current state 15 years prior was created by TGRI, and they too decide to talk to him. The Foot gets to Perry first and kidnaps him, salvaging the last vial canister of ooze in the process. The turtles attempt to get the canister back, but ultimately fail. Afterward, Keno gets into April's apartment under the guise of delivering pizza and discovers Splinter and the turtles.  At the Shredder's hideout, Perry is forced into using the remaining ooze on a [[Gray wolf|wolf]] and a [[Common snapping turtle|snapping turtle]], which mutate into Tokka and Rahzar. With the imminent threat to April's safety by the Foot, the turtles start to actively look for a new home. After an argument with Leonardo, Raphael breaks off from the group, while Michelangelo, who soon discovers an abandoned subway station, deems it a perfect hideout. Raphael and Keno defy Splinter's orders and implant Keno into the Foot Clan to find their hideout. However, they are caught and Raphael is captured, while Keno escapes to warn the others. When they come, they are ambushed by Shredder and the Foot; Splinter saves the group, but leaves as they face Tokka and Rahzar, who prove too strong to defeat. Donatello finds Perry and the five of them make a tactical retreat. Once back in their hideout, Perry explains that the creation of the ooze was an accident, disheartening Donatello, Leonardo, and Raphael, who saw a higher purpose for their existence.  Shredder unleashes Tokka and Rahzar into a nearby neighborhood to cause damages. The next day, Freddy sends a message to April that Tokka and Rahzar will be released into [[Central Park]] if the Turtles don't meet the Foot Clan at the construction site. Perry develops an antidote to the mutations and when they confront the two, Leonardo and Michelangelo trick Tokka and Rahzar into eating it. They discover the trick and brutally attack, throwing Raphael into a public dance club. A big fight ensues among hundreds of witnesses and eventually the turtles turn Tokka and Rahzar into their natural state, while Vanilla Ice improvises the "Ninja Rap". Shredder attacks, threatening a citizen with a final vial of ooze, but Keno intervenes and the turtles overload an amplifier, causing Shredder to be blasted out onto the docks behind the club. They follow and discover that Shredder had drunk the last vial, transforming into a "Super Shredder" with immense super strength, who begins to destroy the support structure holding the dock up. Not caring about his own life, Shredder attempts to kill the turtles by collapsing the dock on top of them, but the group escapes the collapse using their aquatic nature, and surface in time to witness Shredder's last breath.  In a press release, April reads a note from Perry, thanking the turtles for saving him, and when they return home, they deny being seen by the humans, but Splinter holds up the evening's [[newspaper]] on which they are plastered across the cover. He then orders the four of them to do flips as punishment, chanting the theme song they were dancing to at the club "Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go!" exclaiming he "made another funny" as the scene freezes.  
Thalapathi
 A 14-year-old forlorn Kalyani delivers a boy in seclusion, fearing societal backlash and incapacity. She abandons him, heavy-hearted, placing him inside a moving goods train, which, a slum dweller finds. The slum procures him as their common child-naming Surya and collectively raise him honest. He grows up, intolerable against injustice especially to the poor, amidst his worry behind a real reason, regarding why his biological mother had impetuously abandoned him. A yellow shawl was the only identity he had of his mother which she had placed him in when casting away.  Devaraj, a powerful don who is kind yet feared by most in the society, also fights injustice, but by violent means. Ramana, an auxiliary of Devaraj's, whose abusive demeanour led Surya to attack him, succumbs to his death. Surya gets apprehended for this. An exasperated Devaraj soon perceives Ramana's felony, realises Surya's cause was genuine and bails him out. Thus, Surya and Devaraj get to understand each other as both share similar social ideologies despite getting off on the wrong foot. Devaraj declares Surya his "Thalapathi", a best friend.  Arjun, a new district collector, arrives in the city. He wants to end violence by lawful means. Arjun is the second son of Kalyani, now a doctor. After the abandonment of her first offspring, she wed a man (Jaishankar) who accepted her, despite knowing her past. Never did Kalyani let Arjun know the ordeal she faced as a teen, but is constantly grieved by thoughts of her long-lost first child. Meanwhile, Surya gets wooed by a Brahmin girl, Subbalakshmi who is smitten by his transparent nature, restraining crimes. Surya's appraisal to Devaraj leads the people in the locality to pay utmost respect to both. Both of them continue objecting societal incongruencies which other dons, like Kalivardhan, incite through moles in governance.  While Devaraj leads Surya to help curb those unlawful discrepancies, Subbalakshmi initially despises Surya's use of violence and tries to persuade him against it. Devaraj tries to get an alliance between Subbalakshmi and Surya. However, he fails because her father, an Orthodox priest, was uninterested in having her married to Surya, an orphan. Her marriage subsequently gets arranged with Arjun.  Arjun turns to target Devaraj and Surya as they inflict violence, in the name of fighting organised crime. His attempts to chain them are futile. Meanwhile, Padma, Ramana's widow, makes Surya feel guilty for the sufferings he brought her by killing Ramana. Devaraj, understanding the pain a widow and a single mother bears, shelters them. Padma, however, confesses that she is constantly troubled by the men surrounding her with dishonourable intentions, who concoct reasons to make advances towards her. Devaraj, considering Padma and her daughter's safety and Surya's future, requests both of them to accept each other. A guilt-ridden Surya marries Padma, wins her child's affection eventually.  Later, at a medical camp, Kalyani meets Padma and her daughter along with the same shawl in which she wrapped her child she rejected. Jaishankar, too, indicates that Surya was actually Kalyani's long lost son during a suspect identification. Jaishankar secretly meets Surya and reveals the truth of his origin to him. Surya asks Jaishankar to promise not to let his mother know of him as it would pain her to know that her son has grown to be a vigilante.  Regretful Kalyani, though, eventually finds Surya and meets him. Surya vows that he will not harm Arjun for her sake. The long-standing feud between Devaraj and Kalivardhan, who is Deva's main rival, in due course of time, makes Surya admit the truth about his family when Devaraj doubts Surya's intentions after learning of his secret meeting with his stepfather and mother. Deva is pleased to know that despite knowing Arjun was his own half-brother, Surya still preferred to stick with him and supported him during unforeseen situations, thus valuing Deva's friendship more than family. Devaraj, as an outcome of this, decides to surrender. They both go meet Arjun, who is now aware of who Surya is because mother has revealed it to him. Suddenly, Kalivardhan's men retaliate, and during the fight, Devaraj is killed. Enraged, Surya avenges Devaraj by killing Kalivardhan and surrenders to the police, but is released due to lack of evidence. Arjun is later is transferred and relocates to another city with Subbalakshmi, while Kalyani prefers staying with Surya.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day
  In 1995, [[John Connor]] is living in [[Los Angeles]] with foster parents.  His mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the Human Resistance leader against [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] – the [[artificial intelligence]] that will be given control of the United States' military arsenal and initiate a nuclear holocaust called "Judgment Day" on August 29, 1997 – but was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory. In 2029, Skynet sends a new [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]], an advanced prototype [[T-1000]], back in time to kill John. The T-1000's [[mimetic]] poly-alloy construction (referred to as "liquid metal") gives it the ability to take on the shape and appearance of almost anything it touches, and to transform its arms into blades and other shapes at will. The T-1000 arrives under a freeway, kills a policeman and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed [[Terminator (character)|T-800 (Model 101) Terminator]] to protect his young self. The T-800 arrives naked near a sleazy bar, its initial goal being to find suitable clothes and equipment to blend in. It defeats the entire bar with ease - however, nobody is killed - and takes their weapons and a motorcycle.  The Terminator and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a [[Cyberdyne Systems]] engineer working on a revolutionary new [[artificial neural network|neural net]] processor that will form the basis for Skynet.  Sarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to Mexico, but after having a nightmare about Judgement Day, she instead sets out to kill Dyson in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring. Finding him at his home, she wounds him but finds herself unable to kill him in front of his family. John and the Terminator arrive and inform Dyson of the future consequences of his work. They learn that much of his research has been [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the damaged CPU and the right arm of the previous Terminator. Dyson instantly knows he must end the project, but the Terminator and Sarah remind him that ''all'' of his research and designs must be destroyed as well, as well as the chip and arm, and any other research even related to it at Cyberdyne, to prevent anybody picking up where he left off, and as soon as possible. They break into the Cyberdyne building that very night, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the entire building. The police arrive and Dyson is fatally shot, but he rigs an improvised [[dead man's switch]] that detonates the explosives when he dies. The T-1000 has deduced that they are at the alert he recievs, but arrives late. It begins to pursue them in order to kill John and reacquire the arm and chip. Eventually it corners them in a steel mill.  The T-1000 and the T-800 engage in physical combat and the more advanced model seriously damages and shuts down the T-800. However, unbeknownst to the T-1000, the T-800 brings itself back online using emergency power. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah but the T-800 takes it by surprise and blasts it into a vat of molten steel with an [[M79 grenade launcher]], destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that to ensure that it is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to "self-terminate". Although John begs the Terminator to reconsider, it bids them farewell and hugs a tearful John before it is lowered into the vat, giving a final thumbs-up as it disappears into the molten steel. John and Sarah drive down a highway and Sarah says in a voice over, “The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."

On the way, they stop for a drink at a roadhouse bar, where Thelma meets and dances with a flirtatious stranger, Harlan. When he takes her outside to the parking lot to get some fresh air, he starts kissing her and taking her clothes off without her consent. Thelma resists, but Harlan hits her, and then attempts to rape her. Louise finds them and threatens to shoot Harlan with the gun that Thelma brought with her.

At a motel, they discuss how to handle the situation.

Heading west, the women come across an attractive young drifter, J.D., who Thelma quickly falls for, and Thelma convinces Louise to let him hitch a ride with them.

The following morning, Thelma leaves J.D. in her motel room to meet Louise downstairs for breakfast, and, when they return, they discover J.D. has stolen Louise's life savings and fled.

Arkansas State Police Investigator Hal Slocumb leads the investigation and questions both J.D. and Jimmy and taps into the phone line at Darryl's house. He discovers that Louise had been raped years earlier in Texas, so sympathizes with her situation and understands why they didn't report Harlan's murder to the authorities. During a couple of brief phone conversations with Louise, he expresses his sympathy but is unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade her to surrender.  Thelma tells Louise she understands if she wants to go back home, knowing she has Jimmy waiting for her, but explains she cannot go back to Darryl. Louise promises they will keep going together.

Toto the Hero
 Ostensibly set in the near future, the film tells the life story of an elderly man named Thomas Van Hasebroeck (who has dubbed himself Toto, after a childhood fantasy), looking back on his ordinary, apparently uneventful life in a complex mosaic of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s, interspersed with [[dream sequence|fantasies]] about how events might have turned out differently. It is not always possible to tell the difference between embellished or manufactured memories and fantasies, as Thomas is a very [[unreliable narrator]], but some scenes (such as the narrative thread that features Toto as a [[espionage|secret agent]]) are definitely fantasized.  Thomas firmly believes his life to have been "stolen" from him by Alfred Kant, born at the same time as Thomas, who Thomas believes was inadvertently switched with himself as a baby (characteristically, the film remains ambiguous as to whether this substitution ever actually happened, with Thomas' only substantiation being his apparent vivid memory of the day he was born). Thomas' jealousy of Alfred has overshadowed all his life, often with tragic consequences for his loved ones, and he is plotting revenge. Throughout most of the film, his intended revenge takes the shape of a plot to kill Alfred, but in the end Thomas finds a more creative and surprising way to "take back" his life.

He demands the release of his drug kingpin father, Enrique Cali, only to be told that his father has already been delivered to the United States for trial. They escape by helicopter and with the weapons and logistics assistance of Luis' second-in-command, an American named Jack Thorpe, they enter the U.S. through Mexico.  In the United States, the Regis High School is a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] for teenage boys with wealthy and influential parents, half of whom have been expelled from other schools. A group of pranksters led by Billy Tepper ([[Sean Astin]]) that includes Joey Trotta ([[Wil Wheaton]]), Hank Giles (T.E. Russell), Ricardo Montoya ([[George Perez (actor)|George Perez]]), Jonathan Bradberry ([[Keith Coogan]]), and Phil Donoghue ([[Knowl Johnson]]) is carefully watched over by their teachers and the stern but well-meaning Dean Parker ([[Louis Gossett Jr.]]).  Phil's father is the Federal Judge presiding over Enrique Cali's trial, so the entire family is taken to a safe location as a precaution. Unaware of this, Luis Cali invades the school to capture Donoghue, killing the Campus Police, and a faculty member who interferes. Furthermore, they rig the campus with heavy firearms and remote-detonated explosives. With Phil nowhere to be found and the sons of numerous influential individuals in his grasp, Luis takes the entire school hostage.  Underestimating the threat, the local Sheriff attempts to intervene but is repelled by fire from a .50 caliber M2 machine gun, although he and his deputies are able to fall back to safety. The State Police, FBI and US Army are called in, keeping their distance to avoid provoking the terrorists. Luis releases the school faculty except for the cooks and headmaster, Robert Gould ([[Denholm Elliott]]) but institutes hourly headcounts to keep track of the boys.  The students, under Billy's leadership, use their expertise in skirting authority to collect tactical information about the occupying forces, which Billy covertly brings to the authorities on the outside. They won't allow Billy to return, but with Parker's encouragement, he escapes and narrowly rejoins the students in time to be counted, preventing the killing of Gould and four students in response.  Joey's father, New York mafia boss Albert Trotta arranges through Luis' father for the boy to be released. Joey, contemptuous of his father, refuses to go. He steals a weapon and opens fire on another terrorist, but is killed. Luis tries to impress upon Parker, who comes to retrieve the body, that it was an accident, but Albert takes revenge by having Enrique Cali killed in prison.  Knowing they must act before Luis can learn of his father's death, the authorities undertake a rescue mission. [[FBI Hostage Rescue Team]] personnel (trailed by Parker), supported by the Army, covertly infiltrate the school and begin taking out terrorists. Meanwhile, Billy and his friends sabotage the detonator for the explosives, incapacitate several more terrorists with surprise attacks and lead the students and Gould to a secret basement chamber. Overwhelmed by the assault, in which most of the terrorists are killed, Luis takes Billy at gunpoint and holds him in Gould's office. Parker and commandos converge and kill Luis, then Dean being wounded in the process. The few remaining terrorists are subdued and the students are liberated.

Claire then travels to Berlin and hires missing persons detective Phillip Winter to help her find Trevor through tracking his passport and credit card—he agrees to help when he finds out Trevor has a substantial bounty on his head. However, when Claire meets Trevor for lunch, she betrays Winter and attempts to escape with Trevor. Winter catches the two having sex in a motel room, after which Trevor handcuffs them to the bed and escapes with more of Claire's money. Winter, Claire and Eugene meet in Moscow to continue the search, and find out from Moscow bounty hunters that Trevor is actually Sam Farber, wanted for stealing the prototype of a secret research project. Multiple government agencies and freelance bounty hunters are chasing him to recover the device. Winter quits the job, intimidated by the even larger bounty on Sam's head, but Eugene buys a tracking computer to help Claire. However, when the computer finds Sam's location, she leaves Eugene while she thinks he is sleeping.  Following Sam on the Trans-Siberian Railway, she travels through China and reaches Japan, where she rescues Winter from a botched capture attempt at a capsule hotel.

Voices from Beyond
  Giorgio Mainardi (Diulio Del Prete), a wealthy, middle-aged financier, lies dying in a hospital bed surrounded by his family. He has collapsed suddenly, coughing up blood. His last word is to his stone-faced family is, "why?" The doctor's diagnosis of Giorgio's death is an internal hemorrhage, possibly from a stomach or intestinal ulcer. The following day, Giorgio's daughter Rosie (Karina Huff) arrives at the Mainardi estate having taken a leave of absence from her college studies to attend the funeral and for the reading of the will. Rosie soon finds her entire family squabbling over the estate. Giorgio's stepmother Hilda (Frances Nacmen), refuses permission for an autopsy, and taunts her elderly husband, Giorgio's father Paolo (Paolo Paoloni), who is near death himself from a recent stroke and is unable to move or speak. Meanwhile, Hilda's son Mario (Pascal Persiano) is revealed to be having an affair with Giorgio's third wife Lucy (Bettina Giovannini). Lucy is only a few years older than Rosie, and is apparently the only one of the Mainardi family who shows any compassion for her presence.  Giorgio's spirit remains conscious after death and from his buried coffin, he tries to communicate with Rosie. He succeeds by entering her dreams and entreats her to discover who in the family was responsible for his death. However, he tells her to hurry, for as his corpse rots away in the coffin, so does his power to communicate with his daughter. At the funeral, each of the family mourners think back to their relationship with the dead man; Lucy remembers his anger at her frigidity; Mario recalls how Giorgio humiliated and insulated him after he asked for financial help in obtaining a business position; Hilda fumes over the memory of Giorgio ordering the bank not to let her cash the checks from his sick fathers account; Rita, (Antonella Tinazzo), Giorgio's mistress, remembers being spurned when Giorgio rudely broke off their secret affair and decided to go back to his wife.  At the reading of the will, bad feelings erupt when it is found that Giorgio has left his entire estate to Rosie. Lucy, however, is allowed to remain at the house. But even she is angry because no provision has been made to their child, David, a little boy whom Giorgio believes was not his.  Despite Hilda's objections, an autopsy on Giorgio goes ahead. The pathologist (Lucio Fulci) takes a sample of his small intestines and discovers some lacerations to the interior wall. He puts the sample in a jar of formaldehyde for later inspection. A little later, Rosie and her college boyfriend Gianni (Lorenzo Flaherty) discover that the jar containing the organ pieces removed from Giorgio's corpse have been "accidentally" smashed. But Gianni, a medical student with access to the pathology lab, tells Rosie that he'd found tiny splinters of glass in the intestines before the accident accrued later that night. He suggests that they go the police with their suspicions, but Rosie, who is now frequently and telepathically in touch with the spirit of her dead father, insists they investigate themselves rather than attract a public scandal.  Lucy tells Rosie that Giorgio had returned form a visit to his mistress the night of his collapse. Rosie suspects that Rita may have put the mini-glass shards in his food. Lucy talks to the Maitre'd (Tomasso Felleghy) at a local restaurant where Rita and Giorgio visited for their secret dates. But the Maitre'd tells Rosie that the couple had pitched into a furious argument the moment they arrived over Giorgio wanting to end their clandestine affair. They soon left the restaurant without even drinking a glass of wine. With Rita written off as a suspect, Rosie returns to the house, but accidentally discovers that her soda drinks have been poisoned when a mini hypodermic hole is found at the top of one of her cans of soda. Rosie talks to Dorie the housekeeper (Sacha Maria Darwin), and little David's nanny who says that only she, David, and Lucy were in the house on the night of Giorgio's death. Rosie notices that David is playing with a mortar and pestle. She confronts Lucy, who acts oddly, but seems distressed rather than panicked by her stepdaughter's suspicions.  After a significant dream, Rosie wakes up with the answer to the puzzle. The glass shards had been concealed in the ice-cubes Giorgio Mainardi took with his late-night drinks. Rosie confronts Lucy and reveals that the plot must have been hatched by Hilda Mainardi and her son Mario. Hilda enters and admits the plot to kill Giorgio for his money, and adding slyly that Lucy knew about the plot, but did nothing to stop them. In case of discovery, young David had been encouraged to play with the mortar and pestle, grinding up a light bulb into tiny splinters an adding them to the water in the ice-cube tray as a "game". They way Hilda hoped to explain the murder away as a tragic accident. Rosie tells Hilda that she will leave the conspirators to fest in the Mainardi house together instead of informing the police. As she leaves to return to college, Rosie tells Hilda that Giorgio's vengeful spirit will be everywhere, haunting them to the grave.

Unable to cope, Bob follows Leo to his vacation home. Leo is annoyed because he does not see patients on vacation, but seeing how desperate Bob is tells him to "take a vacation" from his problems. Bob seems to have made a breakthrough, but the next morning, he tells Leo that he decided to take a vacation in spirit and fact at Lake Winnipesaukee as a guest of the Guttmans, a couple who own a coffee shop and happily welcome Bob as their guest. The couple encourages Bob to be around Leo, as they hold a grudge against Dr. Marvin for purchasing the lakeside home they had been saving for years to buy.  Bob suggests that they start a friendship, but Leo thinks being friends with a patient is beneath him and attempts to avoid any further contact. However, Bob swiftly ingratiates himself with Leo's family, who think Bob may have some foibles, but is otherwise a balanced and sociable man. Leo's children, Anna and Sigmund, find that Bob relates well to their problems, in contrast with their father's clinical approach. Bob gains an enjoyment of life from his association with them; he goes sailing with Anna and helps Sigmund to dive into the lake, which Leo was unable to help him with. Leo then angrily pushes Bob into the lake, and Leo's wife, Fay, insists on inviting Bob to dinner to apologize. Bob, who believes Leo's slights against him are accidental and/or part of his therapy, accepts the invitation. After dinner, a thunderstorm forces Bob to spend the night. Leo wants Bob out of the house early the next morning before ''[[Good Morning America]]'' arrives to interview him about ''Baby Steps''.

Forced to retrieve him, Leo then abandons Bob in the middle of nowhere, but Bob quickly gets a ride back to Leo's house while various mishaps delay Leo until nightfall. Leo is then surprised by the birthday party that Fay has been secretly planning for him, and he is delighted to see his beloved sister Lily. But when Bob appears and puts his arm around Lily, Leo becomes enraged and attacks him.

White Fang (1991 film)
 In the late 19th Century, prospectors flock to the [[Yukon]] in search of gold. Among them is young Jack Conroy, who arrives in the town of [[Skagway, Alaska]], telling fellow passenger Beauty Smith of his search for prospector Alex Larson. Smith and his companions, Luke and Tinker, direct the boy to the [[Chilcoot Pass]]. The three men surround Jack and steal his money, but he is undaunted and makes his way to the pass. Jack finds Alex and his companion, Clarence "Skunker" Thurston, at the top of the pass. He introduces himself as the son of Scott Conroy, who died a year earlier, leaving behind a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. Although Alex and Scott were close friends, the former doubts there is gold in the claim and advises Jack to go home. However, Skunker takes a liking to the boy and persuades Alex to bring him as far as [[Klondike City]], Yukon, after they bury their dead comrade, Dutch. While on their journey, they are stalked by a large pack of wolves. One night, while resting at a campfire, a female wolf named Kiche manages to lure one of the sled dogs (Digger) away from the group, and another wolf appears and chases the dog into the woods. Skunker uses his ammunition to wound Kiche and gives chase to save his dog, but is killed and devoured by the rest of the pack. Later that night the wolves return but are scared off by Jack and Alex using burning branches. The following morning the wolves attack the two men, but they are saved when another sled team arrives with one of the men shooting a female wolf. The fatally injured wolf hobbles back to her den, and her cub remains by her side until she dies. The pup is left to fend for himself. Jack and Alex reach a town where they plan to stay for the winter. When a group of native [[Hän]] discover the cub, their chief, Grey Beaver, notes his “white fang,” proving the animal is descended from a domesticated dog. Grey Beaver adopts the cub and names him “Mia Tuk", a name meaning "White Fang".  As spring comes, Jack and Alex resume their quest, but stop off at the native Hän settlement. The chief explains that White Fang has been raised to obey, not to be friendly, but Jack seeks to change that. Jack's chance comes when he is chased and cornered by a [[grizzly bear]]. White Fang intervenes, saving Jack's life. Jack and Alex later leave the settlement. Not long after, White Fang is unfairly traded to Beauty Smith when he blackmails Grey Beaver for the wolfdog, saying that ownership of a wild animal is considered illegal. Smith and his gang train White Fang to be vicious in order to enter him into illegal dogfights. White Fang eventually meets his match in a brutal fight against a bulldog owned by Smith's archrival, Sykes. Jack happens upon the fight and intervenes in the nick of time. Having earlier reached his father's claim and begun the work of digging for gold, Jack returns with White Fang to the cabin where he seeks to transform White Fang's vicious and territorial nature.  Jack's attempts to tame White Fang eventually succeed; both wolfdog and man develop a close and trusting bond. Alex helps Jack mine for gold and they strike it rich with the help of White Fang. One morning, Jack travels to the town to claim proper ownership to the gold when Luke notices White Fang with him. Seeking retaliation and planning to steal the gold, Smith and his men attack the cabin site. White Fang attacks Tinker, who accidentally discharges his gun, wounding Luke. White Fang subdues Smith until he's ordered by Jack to back down. Jack and Alex take Smith and his men prisoner and force them at gunpoint to haul gold ore into town.  Alex and his wife, Belinda, offer to take Jack back to [[San Francisco]], but he lets Jack know that city life is no place for a wolf; he must let White Fang run free in the wild. Though White Fang cannot understand why Jack is trying to leave him, Jack's efforts by using a stick (which White Fang hated/feared when he was under Smith) finally succeed in scaring the [[wolfdog]] off. Later, just as he's boarding the ship back to San Francisco, Jack realizes that his rightful place is in the [[Yukon]] and he  decides to stay behind alone and live off the land; Alex congratulates him by saying that it is what Jack's father would have wanted. After a short time, White Fang returns to the cabin site where he and Jack are happily reunited.<ref></ref>

There she falls in love with both the countryside and Gino Carella, a handsome young villager, and she decides to stay.

He and Caroline return home, unable to forgive themselves for not putting an end to what they see as a clearly unsuitable marriage.  Lilia is startled to discover her desire for independence is at odds with Gino's need to be the unquestioned head of the household, and she is shocked when he becomes physically abusive to clarify his position. Their relationship becomes less volatile when Lilia becomes pregnant, but she dies in childbirth, leaving her grieving husband with an infant son to raise with the help of his ageing mother.  When word of Lilia's death reaches England, Caroline decides to return to Italy to save the boy from what she believes will surely be a difficult life. Not wanting to be outdone, or considered any less moral or less concerned than Caroline for the child's welfare, Lilia's mother-in-law sends Philip and his priggish spinster sister Harriet ([[Judy Davis]]) to Monteriano to obtain custody of the infant and bring him back to [[Sawston]], where he can receive what she perceives to be a proper upbringing and education. Everything about the journey – especially the heat, the uncomfortable accommodations, and her difficulty communicating with the locals – distresses repressed and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] Harriet, but Philip and Caroline both begin to find themselves attracted to everything Tuscan that had appealed to Lilia. Philip and Caroline also begin to sympathise with Gino and his loving relationship with his son, but though Philip says he 'understands everyone', he vacilates to even broach the subject of getting custody of the boy to Gino. Philip can't seem to 'settle it, and do the right thing', as Caroline reminds him. Harriet is left to take matters into her own hands and makes a decision that leads to tragic consequences.  In contrast to the [[Where Angels Fear to Tread|novel]], the film adds a positive ending to the changes in the story, by hinting that love between Caroline and Philip may be possible.  
We're Talking Serious Money
 It is a comedy about two misfit men, Sal ([[Dennis Farina]]) and his friend Charlie ([[Leo Rossi]]), who are cheated out of $10,000 that they had borrowed from a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] kingpin. They must flee from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Los Angeles]], only to there get involved in a caper involving a video of Senators in compromising positions. Given a cool million for the video, they are then pursued by the mob and the [[FBI]]. This brings about a surprise ending to the film, as well as to their bungling adventures.  
Whore (1991 film)
 Liz is a [[Los Angeles]] [[street prostitution|street prostitute]]. The audience first sees her attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who [[gang-rape]]d her and left her for dead. A passerby gives her his handkerchief and offers to take her to a hospital. She refuses, makes up a boyfriend story and asks for some money. She sends him the money back with a thank you note and a new handkerchief.  Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake. Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man.  As Liz stops off at a [[strip club]] for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie ([[Frank Smith (actor)|Frank Smith]]). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her [[tattoo]]ed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him.  A local [[homeless]] person/[[street performance|street performer]] named Rasta decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's [[soliloquy]].  After the movie, Liz talks to the audience about her son, whom she clearly loves, though he's now in [[foster care]]. She finally gets a customer and services him. He has a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and Liz panics, trying to give him [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]], without success. Blake happens along then. He takes Liz's money and tries to rob the dead customer. When Liz tries to stop him, Blake tries to strangle Liz and threatens to put her son into prostitution, with Liz retorting "I'll kill you first!". Rasta comes to the rescue, killing Blake. A grateful Liz gives her thanks and walks away.  
Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken
  Sonora Webster lives with her emotionally abusive aunt during the Great Depression.  She learns that because of the family's financial difficulties, her treasured horse Lightning will be sold and she will be placed in an orphanage.  Instead, Sonora slips out of the house during the night. She ends up at a county fair and sees a performance by Marie, a diving girl who rides a horse off a platform, and aspires to do the same. Doc Carver, Marie's employer, tells her she is too young but gives Sonora a job as a stable hand due to her ability with horses, and she begins traveling with them. Doc's son Al wins a wild horse in a card game, and Sonora surprises Doc by taming and riding it, so he promises to train her as a diving girl if she can mount it while it's moving, which she succeeds after multiple attempts.    Marie falls and dislocates her shoulder, leaving her unable to perform, and Sonora steps in. Although she has never dived with Lightning, their first jump is successful.  Marie becomes jealous, and as Doc tires of her [[diva]]-like behavior, she quits rather than share billing with Sonora. Al develops a romance with Sonora that strains his relationship with his father, leaving after a particularly bad fight.  Al promises to write to Sonora, but Doc hides his letters.  As Doc and the new stable hand Clifford leave the farm in search of work, Lightning falls ill with colic. Al returns, and he and Sonora work together to heal Lightning. Doc fails to any jobs, but Al announces he has arranged a six-month contract to perform at the [[Steel Pier]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], reconciling father and son. Doc passes away en route from a heart attack, and Al assumes his father's role as show presenter.  Sonora searches for Doc's jacket to give Al confidence on his first show, and finds one of Al's letters inside, confessing his love for her, letting him know she feels the same.  Al proposes to Sonora just before a performance in front of their biggest crowd, which she accepts.  The horse is a jittery stallion instead of her usual partner Lightning, who falters and trips due to a cymbal crash below.  Sonora keeps her eyes open as they fall into the water.  Both of them make it, but her vision is impaired, yet she hides this from Al. Sonora wakes the morning after to discover she is permanently blind from detached retinas in both eyes. To avoid a breach of contract lawsuit, Al must find another diving girl within a week, calling Marie, who returns. Meanwhile, Sonora misses diving terribly.  She tells Al of her desire to dive with Lightning again, and they work together to try to train her to mount him again, but it proves fruitless and Al gives up.  Sonora spends some quiet time with Lightning that night.  The next day, with Clifford's help, Marie is locked in her dressing room, and Sonora performs in her place with Lightning. Al shouts at her to come back down, but she continues and the jump is successful.  Her voiceover tells us that she continued diving for eleven more years with the audience never learning of her blindness, and of her happy marriage to Al.  
The White Viking
  King Olav is a fanatical [[Christianity|Christian]] who seeks to root out paganism in Norway. He hears the voice of Jesus, or ''White Christ'', when praying which causes jealousy in his religious adviser, bishop Thangbrandur. The pagan [[Earl|jarl]] Godbrandur is the last major resistance to him. Godbrandur's daughter Embla marries Askur, the bastard of powerful [[lawspeaker]] Thorgeir of Iceland, and Godbrandur's foster son. King Olav and his men ambush the pagan ceremony. One of Olav's soldiers, Kolbeinn, crushes Godbrandur's wooden statue of [[Odin]], but is axed to death by Embla. Askur and Embla fight the Christians but are captured. Desperately Godbrandur agrees to be baptised to save Askur and Embla. Askur is ordered to christen the remaining pagans on Iceland, since the king thinks a son of Iceland has better hopes than any man of the king. Meanwhile, Embla is kept in a convent as a hostage.  In Iceland, the tricks of conversion Thangbrandur thought Askur proves useless and Thangbrandur turns out to be something of a local joke among the pagans. Askur's half-brother Gunnar is alerted by Askur's presence, since he believes that Askur has come to usurp him. Gunnar and his insane mother Hallbera set up Askur and murder the smith Völondur, blaming it on Askur. Askur is gagged and presented to Thorgeir, unable to identify himself. Völondur's brother Hrappur and Gunnar want Askur to be killed, but due to Askur being a missionary, Thorgeir thinks a martyr's death is what Askur wants. Instead he exiles him back to Norway, like he had previously done with Thangbrandur.  Returning to Norway, Askur attempts to free Embla from the convent. He poses as Jesus to frighten the nuns and he and Embla swim away from the convent. However, they are captured on the shore by king Olav. Embla convinces Olav to allow Askur to go back to Iceland and complete his task. Embla tells Askur that Olav wants to marry her and gives Askur a necklace with an image of [[Freyja]] for protection. Olav has captured the sons of the Icelandic chiefs active in Norway. Askur is sent back with Thangbrandur and the jewelry of the sons as proof of the hostages. When Askur returns, Thorgeir goes to fight him on the beach. Askur reveals his identity to Thorgeir, who then stages a faux-duel with him. Thorgeir leads the fight into a pagan temple, where Askur is drenched in sacrificial blood, tricking everyone into thinking that he has been killed. Askur's companions flee with the necklace. Embla escapes the king and hides with sympathetic farmers. Thorgeir hides Askur in a mound while he goes to the [[Althing]]. Thorgeir solves to conflict peacefully by converting to Christianity and making a decree that Iceland will be Christian, but the pagans will be allowed to worship in secrecy. This is accepted by Christians and pagans alike. Thangbrandur and Gunnar realise Thorgeir's ploy and try to kill Askur to get the jewelry. Askur outsmarts them, but Thangbrandur is mortally wounded in the struggle. Thangbrandur asks Askur to forgive him, but Askur replies that only White Christ can do that. Thangbrandur admits that White Christ will never do that because of all his done and in a surprise twist Thangbrandur starts to pray to Odin to be allowed entrance into [[Valhalla]].  In Norway, Godbrandur has finished a [[stavechurch]] to vindicate Olav. Embla reunites with her father and they plan to escape to Iceland to continue their pagan ways. But before they can leave, Olav's ships appear in Godbrandur's fjord. Realising there is no escape and having received the necklace as a token of Askur's "death", Embla enters the church and [[Church arson|sets it on fire]] in a suicide attempt. Olav and Godbrandur attempt to save Embla. Godbrandur is killed by burning debris, but Olav manages to save Embla and carries her away. Embla attempts to kill him, but the king overpowers her with ease. Olav gives up on making Embla his wife and leaves her be. Embla emerges in the ruins of the church and prepares to commit suicide, but is stopped when she sees what appears to be an apparition of her father, calling out to Odin. Moments later Embla sees a ship carrying Askur appearing in the fjord.

Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too
 Two days before [[Christmas]], [[Christopher Robin]] writes out a letter to [[Santa Claus]] for him and his friends in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], asking for the following presents:  * [[Rabbit (Winnie the Pooh)|Rabbit]] likes a new fly swatter to keep the bugs off his carrots * [[Eeyore]] could use an umbrella to keep the snow off his house * [[Tigger]] likes a snowshoe for his tail so he can bounce on the snow without his hands and feet (because otherwise he sinks into the snow) * Christopher Robin wants is a sled "big enough for me and maybe a friend or two" * [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] said Santa Claus could bring whatever he wanted  He sends the letter off into the wind, but the next day (Christmas Eve), [[Winnie the Pooh]] realizes, after [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] informs him, that he did not ask for anything himself, so they go find the letter, which has not gotten very far. Afterwards, they, along with Tigger and Eeyore, go to Rabbit's house and rewrite the letter to include what Pooh wants (a pot of honey, of course). Along the way, though, they become greedy and start upgrading their desires (Rabbit wants a bug sprayer, for instance).  Following this, Tigger, Eeyore, and Rabbit go off to get a tree big enough for "the stuff we're gettin'", with help from a reluctant [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] (he is supposed to be hibernating). In the meantime, Pooh and Piglet go back to the point where Christopher Robin sent the letter and cast it off into the wind again. But the wind shifts southward, and the letter follows Pooh all the way to his house. He goes to Piglet and informs him of what happened. Knowing that the rest of the gang will not get their presents as a result of this, Pooh tells Piglet they must take it into their hands to make sure the gifts are delivered.  Disguised as Santa, Pooh sneaks out and delivers Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore a super-bouncer barrel, a bug sprayer, and a mobile home, respectively - or rather, handmade versions of the said items that break apart upon use. Demanding to know what is going on, the three of them corner "Santa", who insists that he is who he claims to be. But then, Piglet (disguised as a "sorry-lookin' reindeer") slips and makes his sled fall downhill, thus loosening Pooh's disguise.  After explaining what happened, Pooh decides to try to deliver the letter to Santa himself, telling the rest of the gang it would be worth missing Christmas if he could "bring Christmas" to them. He does not get far, though, as the wind suddenly takes the letter, so he gives up and goes back to the gang. Even after he tells them that he failed, they are happy to have him back, because they have realized what Christmas is really about (they admit having him with them at Christmas is more important than getting gifts and were willing to give their gifts up to have him back). Afterwards, Christopher Robin shows up on his new sled and brings them the gifts they had originally asked for. Everyone is happy except Pooh, who feels he doesn't deserve his gift. But then giving Christopher Robin a hug he gets very happy.

Year of the Gun (film)
 In 1978, David Raybourne is an American novelist who lives in [[Rome]] and works as a journalist in a small English-language newspaper. He is romantically involved with Lia, the estranged wife of an Italian Industrialist, and befriended by Italo Bianchi, a politically left-leaning lecturer at a Rome university.  The movie re-creates the backdrop of politically charged atmosphere and student unrest, in which the infamous [[Red Brigades]] commit their spate of violent attacks which rocked northern Italy in the 1970s, culminating in the kidnapping and later murder of [[Aldo Moro]], former [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]].  As part of a plan to write a commercial novel and raise money to marry and support Lia in the style to which she is accustomed, Raybourne researches the activities and organization of the Red Brigades. He writes the draft of a novel, realistic but fictitious, with the plot centered on the kidnapping of a central political figure by the Red Brigades. During this time David Raybourne meets a beautiful and sexually provocative young photojournalist, Alison King. She is eager for a news story and is introduced by Raybourne to Italo Bianchi. Alison King becomes convinced that Raybourne knows something about the Red Brigades and is hiding a potential scoop from her, so after a sexual dalliance she searches his apartment and finds Raybourne's novel draft. She brings this to the attention of Bianchi who, despite his mild manner and seemingly moderate politics, is actually collaborating with the Red Brigades. He delivers the draft to a Red Brigades contact and the similarity of his fictitious plot to their actual kidnap plans causes them to conclude that their plans have been leaked. Raybourne realizes he is being hunted when the Brigades shoot his boss Pierre Bernier dead at the newspaper office, moments before Raybourne himself arrives. He then attempts to escape with Alison King with the aid of his romantic connection, Lia.  It turns out that Lia is even more deeply involved with the Red Brigades than Italo, and after a chase, Raybourne and King are captured. They are held while the kidnapping of Aldo Moro takes place. After this is achieved the Brigades leadership accuses Lia of the leak and shoot her for her apparent betrayal right before Raybourne's and King's eyes. They force King to photograph the body and instruct Raybourne to publicize the story as a warning to any future traitors.  The movie ends with Raybourne being interviewed on American television regarding the successful publication of a now non-fiction book about the Red Brigades and his contact with them, with a postscript saying that [[Aldo Moro]] was found shot to death in the trunk of a car nearly two months after his kidnapping.  
Yagnam (1992 film)
 The film deals with the life of a poor farmer ([[P. L. Narayana]]) and his dysfunctional family. The farmer sacrifices his own son ([[Bhanu Chander]]) as an offering to overcome his debt.  
Zeiram
 Zeiram (Mizuho Yoshida) is an alien of unknown origin. It appears to be a very large, imposing [[humanoid]] wearing a wide, circular hat and a ragged cloak, and its appearance is usually accompanied (at least on the film's soundtrack) by an eerie chant. However, its true form is actually the small [[Noh]]-like face on its hat. This face is its only weak point; the rest of the body is almost indestructible and regenerates quickly as long as Zeiram is able to feed, which it does by extending the little face on the end of a fleshy tentacle to take bites out of people. By doing this, it also absorbs the genetic material of its victims, which it uses to generate smaller, weaker monsters to do its bidding. These monsters seem to be partial clones of whatever creature's genetic material was used in their creation (in ''Zeiram 2'', a dog is killed by Zeiram and the resulting monster looks vaguely canine). Zeiram itself is able to change its own form to a large degree, and appears in many different forms throughout the series. It can produce many different weapons such as guns and swords from its body, although these are probably weapons taken from its victims and stored inside itself. In addition to consuming organic tissue through its core, if it sustains enough damage, Zeiram is able to ingest a victim's entire body, keeping that person alive for some time inside itself while it digests them, regenerating itself and drawing on their genetic material and even their memories to create more advanced clones.  Although the core face is Zeiram's only weak point, even that may be impossible to permanently destroy. In ''Zeiram 2'', the creature's core, which was presumed dead, is recovered by a shadowy organisation which installs it as the organic core of a [[robotic]] [[supersoldier]]. This new [[cyborg]] Zeiram starts out bearing a mild resemblance to its precursor, before it lost the hat and cloak in favour of an appearance patterned after a classic Japanese fox-spirit, or ''[[kitsune]]''. The actual core of Zeiram is visible on the robot's stomach. Naturally, even in an artificial body Zeiram cannot be controlled, and it goes on a killing spree. It is possible that Zeiram itself is partly [[biomechanoid|biomechanical]], since even in ''IRIA'' it is shown to be able to infect and control computers.  Although Zeiram is usually referred to as a male, at least in subtitles, the face which serves as its core seems to be female. Indeed, some of its mutations quite visibly possess female breasts. Its partially regenerated appearance in ''Zeiram 2'' might suggest that its original form was that of a miniature female humanoid.  Zeiram is reasonably intelligent, although it doesn't seem to be able to speak or understand human language. Just how intelligent is up for debate, since it spends most of its time mindlessly killing everything in sight.  
Zandalee
 Zandalee Martin is a young boutique store owner living in New Orleans who is sexually frustrated and feeling unfulfilled with her marriage to Thierry Martin, and eventually gets tangled in a passionate, sensual and torrid adulterous affair with her husband's mysterious and free spirited old friend Johnny Collins. Zandalee and Thierry's marriage has hit a snag and seems to be eroding due to his lack of passion.   Zan needs to explore, while Thierry wants to withdraw, and has become more and more distant and impotent in their relationship. He used to be a poet, but now has taken over the family's communications business after the death of his father. As time goes on, Thierry has to sell the business and become basically a (vice president) figurehead. He is emotionally adrift as his dreams give way to disillusionment.  Johnny, an artist painter by trade, has been working for Thierry's business to help support his paintings. His only religion is self-gratification. Johnny also sells and mules cocaine for a local drug dealer as another source of income for himself. Having not seen each other in a while, the two run into each other at a bachelor's party. After the party, Thierry brings Johnny home to meet Zandalee and his grandmother Tatta ([[Viveca Lindfors]]). While talking about old times, Johnny offers to paint a portrait of Thierry at their home.  Later, in another scene, after finishing the painting, Johnny shows it to Thierry, Zandalee and Tatta. While they go off to other rooms and sensing Zandalee's frustration and vulnerability, Johnny makes a pass at her. Johnny continues to pursue Zandalee and when they run into each other during a rain storm, he takes advantage and moves in by seducing her, first in his loft in an angry passionate scene, (Zan's wedding ring is on the table next to the bed) which is followed by him erotically finger painting her. Their sexual liaisons continue to occur in various places including her laundry room a top a washing machine while Thierry and guests are having dinner. Thierry soon suspects the two are having an affair.  As the affair intensifies, Johnny meets Zandalee in a church and asks her to leave her husband. However, Zandalee feels that she must never abandon her true love Thierry, and quickly ends her affair with Johnny after he forces himself on her in the confessional. She and Thierry re-commit themselves to each other, but Johnny, now obsessed with her, will not be brushed off that easily. He tracks them to their vacation spot in the Bayou. All of this puts the three on a destructive collision course with a tragic sequence of events.  When Thierry figures out that Johnny has indeed been having an affair with Zandalee, he becomes drunk and confrontational (he pulls a gun out) leading to him becoming reckless when he takes Zan and Johnny for a speedboat ride on the Bayou, which ends when he falls off the boat and drowns, refusing to be saved by either Zan or Johnny who dive into the water to save him. Both Zandalee and Johnny become distraught by Thierry's death and begin to isolate themselves with Zan jogging for long periods and Johnny trying to work on his paintings, but becoming more self-destructive. In one scene, Johnny, in a rage rips up some of his paintings and pours black paint all over himself. He also consumes some of the cocaine he is supposed to sell, which gets him in trouble with his supplier.  When Johnny meets with Zandalee with the hopes to restart their romance and have a possible future together now that Thierry is out of the picture, she remains emotionally distant and instead goes for a walk along the Old Quarter with Johnny following her. But in the final scene, when Johnny's drug supplier attempts to kill him in a drive-by shooting outside the church that Zandalee frequents, she sees what is about to happen and shields Johnny, getting fatally shot in the process. The drug dealer flees from the scene of the crime (saying "you've got to make accounts payable man"), leaving behind Johnny, now alone, as he cradles and holds Zandalee's dead body. The movie ends with him walking in front of the church with the lifeless Zandalee in his arms.  
Young Soul Rebels
 The film revolves around various plots. The central story-line is about a murder investigation involving one of the central characters ([[Valentine Nonyela]]) and his relationship with his girlfriend ([[Sophie Okonedo]]).  The second narrative involves the relationship between a gay punk ([[Jason Durr]]) and a soulboy (Mo Sesay) and the racism and homophobia they face in both [[West Indian]] and [[white British]] communities. The film is a love story that can be seen as an allegory for racial and class solidarity, as their love transcends class and race barriers.  Set in London in 1977, the plot takes place against the background of the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Silver Jubilee]]. The film begins as buddy movie between two friends, Chris and Caz, who run a [[pirate radio station]] from a tower block in [[Dalston]], [[East London]]. The film starts with the murder of their friend TJ while cruising for sex in the local park at night. While Caz is distraught by the death of his friend, Chris seems focused on balancing a professional career in commercial radio without selling out. They both want to promote soul music while the prevailing popular music is punk.  The murder and the different paths they diverge on causes tension between buddies Chris and Caz. Chris discovers that he has a tape recording of the murder but fails to hand it in as evidence. He is then pulled in by the police as a suspect because he was in possession of TJ's cassette radio. He tries to call Caz but Caz is busy with his new boyfriend, Billibud, who is a punk that espouses the views of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] while wearing (admittedly nicked) Vivienne Westwood designer T-shirts. The character Billiibud gets his name from the fictional character "Billy Budd" from Herman Melville's novel ''"Billy Budd, Sailor".'' In this novel Billy Budd is described as "renowned for his good looks and gentle, innocent ways". Similarly, in the film Billibud is known for being good looking. However, in Melville's novel the character is also known for being on the less intelligent and gullible side, as seen for his "inability to perceive ill will in other people" and has an "unpredictable tendency to stutter". In comparison, in the film Billibud is also portrayed as somewhat dimwitted<ref></ref>.  Chris and Caz then have a showdown on the roof of the tower block and Chris nearly falls off the roof. He then meets Tracy and she persuades him to send the tape to the police, but not before he has made a copy. They then make love on a rooftop. On the day of the Silver Jubilee celebrations Caz and Billibud go to the street fair, where Billibud is attacked by the local skinheads. Caz and Billibud return home and make love. That evening Chris goes to the radio station but Caz is not there and the studio has been vandalised. He starts broadcasting "Funk the Jubilee" but feels is not the same without his partner Caz. Chris is then attacked by TJ's murderer who turns out to be someone he and Caz had thought of as a friend. He escapes but cannot find Caz.  A grand reckoning takes place at an open air disco in the park where TJ was murdered. While Caz and Billibud are MCing, Chris attempts to warn them about the revelations regarding TJ's murderer. A Molotov cocktail is thrown onto the stage and Caz and Billibud begin trying to save the vinyl records. Chris puts on the tape of TJ's murder, but doing so requires going onto the stage, whereupon he falls to his death in the inferno of his own creation.  The scene is a bitter-sweet microcosm of the racial and sexual tensions of the British 1970s, with skinheads hassling Chris and Caz,  whites making snide remarks about how things have changed since their youth, and blacks stating how they were unable to decide if they hate whites, mixed-race people or [[Batty boy|"batty boys"]] most. Yet, despite all of this, youth in the clubs are enjoying the music, drinking, dancing and bonking inter-racially while paying no mind to the gay men around them.  The film ends in a life-affirming scene with the two DJ buddies reconciling their differences while they clean records, which is followed by a one-by-one each of the friends joining into dance together.
